1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,950
Hi there, thanks everybody for coming to the talk.

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,510
I'm Michael Dawson, gonna talk about

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,531
designing interactive fiction on episode in three phases.

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:14,892
So I wanted to start out,

5
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:17,352
think about what does it mean to design

6
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,332
great interactive fiction that people love

7
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:20,753
and to do it on this device.

8
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:24,193
It means putting together two very distinct worlds.

9
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,874
One world is, I think, well represented by Hollywood,

10
00:00:28,054 --> 00:00:30,735
which is really best on earth storytelling.

11
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:35,495
The other world is mobile, which is both the largest games platform on earth right now,

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,977
as well as maybe the largest platform overall that we have to work on.

13
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:44,879
So today I really want to walk through what are the parts we on episode have taken from both of these worlds

14
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:47,220
to put together hit interactive fiction.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,643
So as a way of background on kind of me and episode,

16
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:52,345
for those of you that might not have it,

17
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:55,410
I'm Michael Dawson, I lead the studio at Episode,

18
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:58,595
which was created by Pocket Gems in 2014.

19
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:01,659
It was created by seeing this real opportunity on mobile

20
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:03,983
to say what does it mean to tell a story on a mobile device.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,431
So we've launched, since we've launched,

22
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,191
we opened up our tool set.

23
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,513
We have over five and a half million creators

24
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,893
using our tool set today.

25
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:16,394
We also have an internal team that's kind of working

26
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:19,075
on episode originals that use that tool set as well.

27
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:22,396
We've launched over 50,000 stories,

28
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,898
including both these great things created

29
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:27,118
by our user community,

30
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,619
as well as things we created internally

31
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,900
like Mean Girls, Demi Lovato, and Pretty Little Liars.

32
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,022
All of which have seen over 3 billion episodes viewed,

33
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:40,023
which is like 57,000 years or so spent watching it.

34
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:42,444
So I give this only as background just to say,

35
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:44,945
this is kind of, I wanna give this talk

36
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:47,046
to talk about what we've learned as we've done all of this.

37
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,824
And I want to talk about how it works for us in three phases.

38
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:55,425
So the first phase is really creating a great story.

39
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:57,225
And because Episodes on Mobile, I'm

40
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:58,626
going to talk about creating a great story that

41
00:01:58,646 --> 00:01:59,266
works on mobile.

42
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:02,207
The second phase is then you've created that great story.

43
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,168
How do you iterate on it with your internal team

44
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:07,129
to make sure that it goes from a great story idea and concept

45
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,389
and outline to a fully fleshed out great story?

46
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:11,630
And then the third phase and kind of

47
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:14,429
Anyone here who kind of has built mobile games

48
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:15,771
and launched and iterated them knows this,

49
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,314
but how do you iterate on it with viewers

50
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:18,736
in advance of its worldwide launch?

51
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,821
So let's dive in first to this first phase

52
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,384
of creating a great story that works on mobile.

53
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:27,395
The place you start, this is for episode,

54
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:28,816
I think for anyone who's really knowing

55
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,097
and understanding your audience.

56
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:32,239
And so for episode, our audience is women

57
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,520
who are 13 to 25 on mobile.

58
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,041
And this audience is interesting.

59
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:38,863
This is truly a mobile-only audience,

60
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:40,444
not even a mobile-first audience.

61
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:42,966
So some of the stats we found when we talked to people,

62
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:45,647
14% of our audience use their phone

63
00:02:45,808 --> 00:02:49,290
for 12 hours a day or more.

64
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,551
11% check their phone when they're in the shower.

65
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:55,139
12%, especially those 13 to 17, check their phone

66
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,240
every few seconds when we ask them,

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,761
how often do you check your device?

68
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:02,903
So this is very different than Hollywood.

69
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:05,684
Hollywood does not design for this audience.

70
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:09,346
They design for an audience that goes into the movie theater,

71
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:12,428
that sits in front of a TV for long, interrupted time,

72
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:14,649
not an audience where there are native things

73
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:15,850
built for the mobile device.

74
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,251
It's much closer to gaming.

75
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:20,190
I think another part of this audience,

76
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,092
and this is great for all of us gamers,

77
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,555
is they want to be active participants.

78
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:25,717
That's what they've grown up doing,

79
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:26,658
that's what they've always known.

80
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,981
They've grown up with social media,

81
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,963
they've grown up with smartphones,

82
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:33,666
they've grown up getting to be the center of their stories.

83
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,261
But for them, these stories are like,

84
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,421
what are they for lunch?

85
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:38,561
What are their friends doing?

86
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,341
The stories aren't the great sort of

87
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:41,822
Hollywood caliber stories.

88
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,922
So the question is, how do we take those great stories,

89
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:45,842
those great caliber stories,

90
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,823
but weave in thoughtfully the interactive elements

91
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,403
that are so natural to gamers?

92
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:53,364
How do we make sure that the audience

93
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:54,624
is at the center of that story?

94
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:58,184
How do we give them agency as they read the story?

95
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,745
How do we design it then to fit inside mobile

96
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:02,605
in how we're doing this?

97
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:07,652
So the last thing about mobile is episodes audience,

98
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:09,713
but mobile audience in general wants bite-sized stories.

99
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,055
So there are two parts of this.

100
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:13,136
So one part is for all of us who have mobile phones.

101
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:14,978
Our mobile phone is something we use

102
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:16,219
when we're in line at Starbucks,

103
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,521
when we're on the bus, when we're kind of walking,

104
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,562
when we have these small bite-size increments.

105
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:23,564
So I think that's true in general,

106
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,926
but then episodes audience, there's a second layer to this.

107
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,908
If it's an audience, if you guys all use Snapchat,

108
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:32,630
or if anyone's seen someone who's 13 to 17 use Snapchat

109
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,011
and the pace at which they do it,

110
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:36,373
and the attention span that's associated,

111
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,734
it is even shorter.

112
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:39,555
10 seconds is way too long.

113
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:42,317
A three to seven second video is the right length of time

114
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:43,338
for short form content.

115
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,739
So thinking of these two factors,

116
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,000
both mobile to begin with,

117
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,861
and then this mobile only audience together,

118
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:54,829
We said the right for long-form storytelling. It's no longer the 129 minute feature film

119
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:58,113
It's not even the 22 minute sitcom or 44 minute drama

120
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:02,218
It's a five minute episode length is the right long-form story length

121
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:03,359
so

122
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:07,954
This is a giant move away from what is normal in Hollywood

123
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,915
in typical formats.

124
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:12,598
It's more like session times normal to mobile games,

125
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,720
but instead of it being a single compact session,

126
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,823
it's how do you tell a long-form story episodically,

127
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:20,085
still by doing this bite-sized way?

128
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,447
That's kind of the audience overview.

129
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:24,469
So another question is how do you pick a concept

130
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:25,370
this audience will love?

131
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,012
Well, here's a place where Hollywood's pretty great

132
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:28,773
at picking concepts.

133
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,034
They have a lot of things that they do.

134
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,467
a genre the audience loves and do a really original take on it.

135
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:39,391
So you can think of like what Amy Schumer has done recently to the romance comedy.

136
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:45,936
They find exceptional creators, exceptional writers, and have them make something.

137
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:48,878
So James Cameron, Steven Spielberg stand out in this dimension, but

138
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:50,980
there are lots of others where you really trust in a creator.

139
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:56,149
They also can license a great story that was started in another medium.

140
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,491
So Harry Potter and Twilight both started as books before they came to Hollywood.

141
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:04,575
So these are all great things to start, but there are ways that you can,

142
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:08,278
if you have kind of a platform of mobile, you can augment this in ways that

143
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:10,079
Hollywood can't really or can't very easily.

144
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,825
So one thing we did when we were deciding which partners in this licensing group who to partner with

145
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:17,788
is we just asked our audience, we're like, what do you like?

146
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:19,630
What TV shows do you like? What movies do you like?

147
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,374
What stars do you like? And they answered. They told us Pretty Little Liars, they told us Mean Girls,

148
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:25,997
they told us Demi Lovato, among a set of others.

149
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,259
So we went out and partnered with them, and it's been great.

150
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,183
We've had a really wonderful response. We didn't have to guess, we just had to ask.

151
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:35,718
I think a second thing is because we have people searching

152
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:36,819
through our 50,000 stories,

153
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,560
we can look at what they're searching for.

154
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,662
And it's maybe not that unexpected,

155
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:43,843
but at the same time it can really zero you in

156
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:44,644
and help you focus.

157
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:49,567
So, you know, this audience loved Twilight a decade ago.

158
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,788
Doesn't, it makes sense.

159
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:53,189
Vampires and werewolves were high up on here today still.

160
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,611
There's love on here, whether summer or otherwise.

161
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,412
There are crushes, there's even cheating.

162
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:01,494
There's a lot about babies and pregnancy.

163
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:04,596
They talk about princesses here and royalty.

164
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,837
So that informed some story ideas.

165
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:08,538
And so one story that came out of this for us

166
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:10,139
was one we called The Royal Baby.

167
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,841
The Royal Baby is a story where you meet a guy,

168
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:16,322
you end up with him, you end up getting pregnant,

169
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:17,723
turns out he's a prince, it's amazing.

170
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,362
with this, it also, this was like,

171
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,442
because we had all this data,

172
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:23,683
but then we could also look at what was happening

173
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,424
in the news, and you saw Prince William and Kate,

174
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:27,765
they just had their first two kids,

175
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:28,886
it was really on people's minds,

176
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:30,086
so we can take sort of, again,

177
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:31,867
take that Hollywood approach, take those normal things,

178
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,748
but add this data element to it

179
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,169
to really feel like we're honing in,

180
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:36,550
and I'll talk more about it later,

181
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,891
but the Royal Baby was one of our best performing stories

182
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,872
to date that we've created that was entirely original.

183
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:43,573
So, you get this great concept.

184
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,212
Then the next step to creating a story is really use those best practices of Hollywood screenwriting.

185
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:53,754
This, you know, if you've read Save the Cat, if you've read Story by Robert McKee,

186
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,255
these books really lay that out.

187
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:58,656
They go through kind of great three-act story structure,

188
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:02,838
they go through kind of pacing, dialogue, like all the good things of storytelling.

189
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:05,879
Because there's a true craft to doing storytelling well.

190
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,580
And I think that applies independent of the medium.

191
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,508
The other piece that we've taken a lot for episode, because it's episodic,

192
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,871
is from the TV world, the idea of a writer's room.

193
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:19,114
So the idea of you have a set of writers and creative people in a room,

194
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:22,076
working to break down the story together, and come out of it

195
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:25,079
with an outline that captures every story beat, scene,

196
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,441
within that act structure.

197
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,482
And we found that is a really great thing.

198
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,548
But you can't just take the Hollywood screenwriting process,

199
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:35,270
apply it exactly, because mobile's different.

200
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,190
So how's it different?

201
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,392
So the first is pacing of your story on mobile.

202
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:42,173
So in the first five minutes of movie, they do set up.

203
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:44,154
In movie, to get through the first act,

204
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:45,575
it's like 15 to 20 minutes.

205
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:48,256
In books, it's 60 to 70 pages,

206
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:49,156
if we're talking about a novel.

207
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:53,931
On episode, the first episode, we tend to get through the entire first act.

208
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:56,892
And if you don't do that, it will feel too slow.

209
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:58,714
So let me tell you two stories.

210
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:03,917
So one of the stories we did was Mean Girls sorority rush.

211
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,638
It was a follow-up to our Mean Girls senior year,

212
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,359
which is a follow-up to the Tina Fey movie, Mean Girls.

213
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,202
So the first version of that, the whole first episode was you arriving at school.

214
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,183
And anyone that's seen the movie Pitch Perfect,

215
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:16,384
that's basically the first five minutes of Pitch Perfect.

216
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:18,566
So you're arriving to school, it's fun, it's enjoyable,

217
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:19,946
the pacing feels right for a movie.

218
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,636
We did that, it felt way too slow.

219
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,739
It just, it was like you were bored

220
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,322
as we were playing through this thing we'd created.

221
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:29,246
So we had to speed it up and we jammed kind of that

222
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:32,311
into the first couple taps and then went on

223
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,735
into the inciting incident and the rest of the first act.

224
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:38,286
Another example is we had a writer that we brought in

225
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,146
and brought on to our team who spent a lot of time

226
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,447
in the soap world, and he, the first day in the writer's

227
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:46,148
room, outlined the first four episodes of a story.

228
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,888
And the next day he came back in and the team,

229
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:50,889
they looked at it and they're like, that's episode one.

230
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,129
That is not the first four episodes, that is episode one.

231
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,550
So I think really making sure that that pacing

232
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,430
is mobile length is important.

233
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:01,629
The second thing is thinking about the mobile device

234
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:04,071
and what is the native format of mobile.

235
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:06,773
So if you think of iMessage, you think of Snapchat,

236
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,735
you think of Instagram, you think of your email,

237
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:09,836
it is portrait.

238
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,918
That is the native format of mobile.

239
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,053
I think that is not the native format of Hollywood.

240
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:15,934
It is the landscape.

241
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:19,237
But I think for mobile, designing in that native format

242
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,839
feels better, it feels more natural,

243
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,901
and it's the one we have very much stuck with.

244
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:25,904
I think, assuming you take that step

245
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:28,387
for kind of interactive fiction you put on mobile,

246
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:31,090
you need to really think about how screen real estate works.

247
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:35,219
It's really hard to have a ton of characters on screen at once in a portrait mode.

248
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:37,660
It's better for close-up shots, fewer characters.

249
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,761
So if I think of like, if we were going to tell Lord of the Rings on episode, we would

250
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:43,662
tell Frodo's story more than we'd do the 10,000 person battle.

251
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:48,844
I think the last piece that's really different from Hollywood is you have to build interactivity

252
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:50,104
in from day one.

253
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,509
So in the Hollywood world, you create a linear story.

254
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,450
There's no way for the audience to interact

255
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,051
with a movie screen in a theater.

256
00:10:58,071 --> 00:11:00,693
With TV shows, maybe that will come soon,

257
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:01,534
but it's not there yet.

258
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:05,076
VR, it will certainly come, but again, not yet.

259
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:07,798
So I think this is a change to the process.

260
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:09,880
And it's thinking as you're breaking that story,

261
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,841
as you're in the writer's room,

262
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:12,582
as you're putting together that story outline,

263
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:16,405
what are gonna be these moments of great interactivity,

264
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:18,706
these moments of choice, these moments of branching?

265
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:22,243
So we found that we want to think about it then,

266
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:23,944
but the other thing we found we have to do

267
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:26,285
is add a couple days onto our writers rooms

268
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,946
to have specifically focused on choice and interactivity.

269
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,407
And to really flesh that out,

270
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:32,988
to make sure that we're building that

271
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:34,429
into the core of what the story is

272
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:36,650
instead of band-aiding interactivity on after the fact.

273
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:39,653
As an example, when we were working on Pretty Little Liars,

274
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,034
we had this idea, there's a moment in the story

275
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:44,576
where you're at a party, there's a photo booth at the party,

276
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:46,978
a photo pops out, and you have this really tough decision.

277
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:48,619
Are you gonna protect the four liars?

278
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,620
Are you gonna protect Spencer and Hannah and Aria?

279
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,762
Or are you gonna protect yourself and your family?

280
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,863
And we knew this would be one of those weighty,

281
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:57,125
wonderful decisions where it's a true choice

282
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:59,827
that has agency, one where 50% choose one,

283
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,788
50% choose the other, but we designed it

284
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:02,969
from the beginning and then could write

285
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,430
the whole episode with that in mind.

286
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,600
So, after you finish this process,

287
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,601
hopefully what you come out of is a great story,

288
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:11,341
and by that I mean you have an outline of a story

289
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,082
with interactivity built in that's thought of

290
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:14,202
for the pacing of the device.

291
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:16,783
Now, to iterate internally,

292
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,283
the first thing you've got to do is write scripts,

293
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,864
but I think the key is go as fast as you can

294
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,485
to get that script onto device.

295
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:24,345
So much changes, I think,

296
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:26,546
and especially until you have lots and lots of cycles

297
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:27,586
writing the script for device,

298
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:29,246
which we certainly don't yet at Episode.

299
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:32,816
So we, and we learned this the hard way

300
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:33,736
by making some mistakes.

301
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:35,778
So we had one story we did internally

302
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:36,578
called Bad Boy's Girl.

303
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,380
It was a story where we spent six weeks on the script,

304
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,621
we got it really right, we kept tuning the language,

305
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:43,982
tuning the dialogue, making the romance feel great,

306
00:12:44,022 --> 00:12:45,223
making the plot move forward.

307
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:48,045
And then we put it on a device and it just didn't work.

308
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:48,705
People were bored.

309
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:50,246
It was not fun to tap through.

310
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,466
And had we done that sooner?

311
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,508
So we had to go rewrite and blow up the whole story

312
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:54,468
and work over it.

313
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:56,435
I think a second one that's happened,

314
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:58,476
our first season of Mean Girls, Mean Girls Senior Year.

315
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:00,818
So with that, we partnered with Kiwi Smith,

316
00:13:00,898 --> 00:13:02,519
she's awesome, she co-wrote Legally Blonde

317
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,959
and 10 Things I Hate About You.

318
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,161
She's great at writing romance comedies

319
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:09,182
and she knows how movie scripts translate to movie screens.

320
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:12,004
So we got that script, it was hilarious.

321
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,745
We were laughing out loud, we thought it was so funny,

322
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:15,546
it was like, we thought maybe we're funnier than Tina Fey.

323
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:19,178
Then we put it on the app and everyone was so depressed

324
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:20,539
because it was not funny anymore.

325
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,980
The comic timing just didn't translate

326
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,001
in the way people expected.

327
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:26,963
So had we spent less time perfecting everything

328
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,984
in the script form, getting it to device sooner,

329
00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:30,965
and making it a playable, we would have learned that.

330
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,101
And I think key to being able to do that quickly

331
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,604
is having tools to get to a playable fast.

332
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:39,808
So we built a tool set, we released them,

333
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:41,430
anyone here can use them if you like.

334
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,374
But some of the key things to that tool set

335
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:46,397
is having a library of art that's there

336
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:48,199
that you can just grab, so you don't have to wait

337
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,961
on all of the custom art for your story.

338
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,846
you can put art from your library in there.

339
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:57,233
I think the second thing is the tool set should really be usable by anyone,

340
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:58,455
or essentially anyone.

341
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:02,141
It shouldn't require animators, plus artists, plus engineers

342
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,165
to get your story to be playable.

343
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:07,458
Then, once you have this playable story,

344
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,539
the question is, how do you do story feedback?

345
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:10,979
So we think of it in four phases.

346
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,600
First of all, there's a core group,

347
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,481
and this core group needs to be able to cover

348
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,641
the key elements of the story

349
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,942
while understanding the genre you're in.

350
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,822
And so things of that, like for us,

351
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:22,703
story structure is a key thing,

352
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:24,804
and the fundamentals of kind of how the outline works

353
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,204
in that.

354
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:28,485
Romance, for a lot of our stories, is a key element,

355
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,805
so really being honed to that

356
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:31,186
and how to make a romance feel real

357
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,246
and great and wonderful.

358
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:36,799
Interactivity and choice, people with narrative design backgrounds are great at that.

359
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,443
Voice and dialogue and kind of getting that right and connecting with your audience, as

360
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:46,947
well as visual storytelling and really understand not just how are the words doing it telling

361
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,869
the story, but how are all the non-word elements doing it telling that story.

362
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,071
So we get feedback from that group, but then they've seen the thing a bunch.

363
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:56,113
So we want a few people that really understand the story that are outside of that group that

364
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:56,914
can be fresh eyes.

365
00:14:57,848 --> 00:15:01,691
Then going to a broader group, often including people that kind of understand metrics better

366
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:05,715
and tuning and those things that can give very specific feedback on the story, but maybe

367
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:08,517
aren't people with creative story backgrounds.

368
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:12,041
And then finally, we'd love to show it to the whole team, and we can't, at this point

369
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:13,622
for us, we can't do that with all of our stories.

370
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:17,565
We like to pick a few and show it, and we get amazing feedback, even from people who

371
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,269
aren't from the demographic, who don't love the genre, but they still can be really thoughtful.

372
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,568
And the questions to ask as you're going through this is,

373
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:27,670
most importantly on mobile, does it keep you engaged?

374
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,452
At every tap, does it keep you engaged?

375
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,633
Is the story moving fast enough?

376
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:33,595
Does it have the right amount of agency

377
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:35,576
that it gives to the readers?

378
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:37,217
Is the dialogue working?

379
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:38,498
And fundamentally, is it fun?

380
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,899
And is it connecting with you emotionally?

381
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,001
So from there, we do the third phase.

382
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:45,163
We wanna then go and iterate with our viewers.

383
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:49,939
And for this, this is very much what we've always done

384
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,960
as a mobile games company at Pocket Gems,

385
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:55,563
is really think about how can we soft launch something,

386
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,604
how can we collect data and user feedback,

387
00:15:57,945 --> 00:15:59,626
how can we then go iterate on the story

388
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:01,127
and continue repeating this cycle

389
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,409
until we believe in the thing that we're launching,

390
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:05,190
and then we can get it to worldwide launch.

391
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,731
So how do we iterate?

392
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:09,112
So the first thing we look at is the overall rating.

393
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:11,774
So for anyone that's put games out on mobile,

394
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:14,475
this is the equivalent of Google Play or iTunes rating

395
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:15,676
that you get from your users.

396
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:17,117
It's a pretty blunt thing.

397
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:19,058
It tells you, do people like it or not?

398
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:20,238
How much do they like it?

399
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:22,960
And eventually, you can start having relative comparison

400
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,300
points.

401
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,722
This is really good to say, am I on track to have a hit?

402
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:29,083
Is my concept a hit?

403
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,544
Is the overall story a hit?

404
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:32,745
Is my execution in general going in the right direction?

405
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,181
and it can help you decide which things to invest in overall,

406
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:38,122
but it can't really tell you what to do to iterate,

407
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:39,463
so that's the next set of things.

408
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:43,086
So first is story starts.

409
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:46,729
So this is combined with things you can control

410
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:47,470
and things you can't.

411
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,171
So a set of things you can control,

412
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:50,612
you can control the title,

413
00:16:50,952 --> 00:16:52,273
you can control the description,

414
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:53,935
you can control any visual images,

415
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:56,096
we call them story cards inside episode.

416
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,800
And so for that we've learned some things.

417
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,424
So we've learned that being closer on faces is really good,

418
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:05,066
like you see on the Trugable Maker image on the right,

419
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,729
because it can show more emotion and capture that.

420
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,530
We've learned for our audience,

421
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,771
like you see in Bad Boyz Girl,

422
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:13,214
kind of love triangles are really exciting,

423
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:15,015
and ones with two guys tend to do better

424
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,316
than ones with two girls, it turns out.

425
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:19,876
But you can tune all these, you can tune the description,

426
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:21,617
you can tune the title and make it really exciting.

427
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:24,020
There's an, you also have to understand

428
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,421
where are you showing it, in other words,

429
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:28,223
like an episode, if we put it as the very top card,

430
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:31,627
it'll get far more initial starts

431
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:32,868
and far more people coming in.

432
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:37,133
If it's a licensed property that people already know really well, it'll get more starts.

433
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:39,876
So I think that there are things there you have to understand to calibrate.

434
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:43,421
But then the final thing you can't control is, is the thing absolutely a hit or not?

435
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:46,305
And I think that that in the end will determine how many story starts you get,

436
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:48,748
but these are all things you can tune to help give you a better chance.

437
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:53,247
Then it's what do we iterate on inside the story?

438
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:57,150
So we look at what is the retention to the episode

439
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,751
and we can also instrument scene story beats

440
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:01,712
so you can go all the way down and see

441
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:03,733
where are people kind of playing,

442
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:05,434
where are they not playing, where are they falling off?

443
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:11,338
What we found is this is really useful, interesting data

444
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:12,539
but it doesn't tell you what to do,

445
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:13,939
it only tells you where there's a problem.

446
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,801
So in that first season of Mean Girls Sorority Rush

447
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:18,402
when we were working with Kiwi, we put it out.

448
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:22,765
And we thought, because in episode five, you're competing,

449
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:23,926
for any of you who remember Mean Girls,

450
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:26,207
you're competing in this version with Regina George

451
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:28,067
to win student body president.

452
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:31,168
And the election, the results come in in episode five.

453
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:32,689
So we thought that'd pull people along.

454
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:34,790
Turned out, no, not enough happened

455
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,791
between episode one and five to get people there.

456
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:39,071
We had to have something really fun happen in episode three.

457
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:41,447
And Kiwi then had this great idea.

458
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,788
She's like, what if there were a party?

459
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:44,808
And what if Gling Coco threw that party?

460
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:48,049
And what if you had all these highs and lows of a high school

461
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:49,309
party and all the fun things?

462
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:50,009
And it was great.

463
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:51,089
It utterly fixed it.

464
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:53,130
But unless we had this data, we wouldn't

465
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,730
have known to go figure out a way

466
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,091
to solve that retention issue in episode three.

467
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:01,751
In this connect, this is just like if you think

468
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:02,792
of retention in games.

469
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,172
But for us, we broke it down to how do we

470
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:05,432
do it within the story itself.

471
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:10,012
The next thing is choices, and so for the choices themselves

472
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:11,712
to make sure the player feels agency,

473
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:13,053
to make sure the choice is great,

474
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,873
the key thing about them is you want people

475
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:16,053
choosing both sides equally.

476
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,694
If 90% of people pick one side of the choice

477
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:21,695
and 10% the other, that wasn't a meaningful, hard choice.

478
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:23,295
It felt like there was a right answer

479
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:26,216
versus this was a choice where you got to shape this story

480
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,037
and where you got to define yourself as a character,

481
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,237
and that's another thing that you can track and look at.

482
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,808
We also look at dollars earned per story start

483
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:35,669
as a way to think about monetization,

484
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:38,452
in large part because we want to make sure

485
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:42,134
that we can kind of know the stories that people love

486
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:44,056
and decide where to invest more over time.

487
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:48,539
There's a pretty big range in what we find here,

488
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,021
and we find that we can actually move this quite a bit.

489
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:52,803
The primary way that we move this

490
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:55,905
is by adding premium branches and premium choices.

491
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,451
So when I talk about those, we found that we can do

492
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:01,972
strong work to optimize them.

493
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,794
So here, I don't know if you guys can read this that well,

494
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,116
but what we started with was one where kind of

495
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:10,377
you're saying, hey, I wanna put on a new outfit.

496
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:12,418
You're gonna go meet a guy that you're into,

497
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,759
but you're like, I wanna put on a new outfit.

498
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,760
We give you a single choice for the outfit,

499
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,502
then you try it on or not, and you're like,

500
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:19,902
okay, now I'm gonna go meet the guy.

501
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:21,483
So it was a good choice, it did all right.

502
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:25,906
We found with working with the setup, the choice,

503
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:28,188
and the result, we were able to increase it almost 100%

504
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:29,608
in conversion.

505
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,911
So with the setup, we found that we really

506
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:36,473
wanted to create good, stronger self-encouragement to say,

507
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,795
hey, if I put on this outfit, he's going to love it.

508
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:42,096
I think then for the choice itself,

509
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:44,458
we found if we gave people two options, they like that better.

510
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,919
And we simplified the language around what

511
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:47,960
those options felt like.

512
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:53,991
And then in the result, we found that if we really emphasize the payoff of making that choice,

513
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:58,294
it helped people feel really good about it and encouraged them to make future choices like this.

514
00:20:58,314 --> 00:21:04,078
I think, separately in Pretty Little Liars, we had this moment where we thought at the beginning

515
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:07,500
it was going to have great choices if you could help the four liars in their lives.

516
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,723
And you would pay to help Aria, you'd pay to help Spencer, you'd pay to help Hannah.

517
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:15,310
And what we found is that didn't work.

518
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,112
It turned out that the choices that worked better

519
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,715
were things about yourself and your own life,

520
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:22,417
and kind of whether it was the romance you were interested

521
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:25,120
or other things that tended to work better within that world

522
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,362
and we were able to really move up

523
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:29,023
the engagement with those choices.

524
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:35,973
So, we stay in this process until we get to something great,

525
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:37,593
then we push it out to worldwide launch.

526
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,334
And that moment of launch is the moment where you learn,

527
00:21:40,394 --> 00:21:42,315
did you actually have a hit on your hands or not?

528
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:44,435
You don't really know for sure up front,

529
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:45,656
but there's so much you can do

530
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:47,496
to give yourself a better chance along the way.

531
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:49,177
But for us, that's not the end.

532
00:21:50,263 --> 00:21:52,585
So the step what we've been taking now,

533
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:54,366
and kind of we're just in the process of,

534
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,367
is thinking about how can we support agency

535
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:57,648
and identity across stories,

536
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,409
not just within the individual story.

537
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:01,089
So, because in a lot of our stories,

538
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:02,770
you get to pick an avatar, create a character,

539
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,711
but it's locked inside the world of that story.

540
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:05,632
So.

541
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:09,100
We're launching profiles where you can create a profile,

542
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,601
you can have an avatar for that.

543
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:13,123
And the idea is over time for that avatar

544
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,364
to be able to be the avatar you use

545
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:16,985
through different and distinct stories.

546
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:22,389
So that it better sets you up to feel this identity

547
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:26,551
that persists across episode and across the world of that

548
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:28,393
and really takes that to a next level.

549
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:29,833
So.

550
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:34,320
To kind of summarize, I think everything starts with understanding your audience

551
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:36,963
and picking a concept that that audience is going to love.

552
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:41,328
I think then you need to embrace your medium's pacing,

553
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:45,673
its narrative design formats, its interactivity formats,

554
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:48,676
while at the same time taking those best practices

555
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:50,979
from Hollywood screenwriting and keeping those in mind.

556
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,220
You then want to go from a script to a build on your device

557
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:58,963
as soon as possible, because it's really,

558
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:01,825
the translation can be quite tricky and unexpected.

559
00:23:03,186 --> 00:23:04,647
From there, you want to establish

560
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,028
the right internal review loops,

561
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:09,370
because you want to feel good about what you put out,

562
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,012
but then you want to pilot to gather data and feedback.

563
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:13,553
And honestly, we've never felt like

564
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,094
we put something out too soon to pilot.

565
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:16,815
We've often felt like we waited too long,

566
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:17,976
spent too much time internally,

567
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:20,197
but I think the sooner you put it out, the better.

568
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:23,127
And then you want to iterate.

569
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:24,508
And in this iteration,

570
00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:26,370
don't be afraid to blow up your story.

571
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,052
I think that's the biggest thing.

572
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,554
Nothing about that story should feel sacred.

573
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:32,376
It should feel like all you're trying to do

574
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:34,759
is make something really great and wonderful

575
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:35,880
that people love.

576
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,302
And if it's not working, change it, try again.

577
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:39,984
It will get there eventually.

578
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:42,927
So thanks very much.

579
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:45,269
Love to take any questions if anyone has any.

580
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:09,569
Hi. Oh, thanks for the talk. I just had a question more about how did you come up just

581
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:14,533
by making games and episode games, how the studio was born, episode.

582
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:17,680
Sure, so in terms of how Episode was born,

583
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:20,943
when we started Pocket Gems, it was always with the thought

584
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:23,145
of we're a mobile entertainment company,

585
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:24,666
not purely a games company.

586
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:27,348
And in entertainment, storytelling's

587
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,110
the half trillion dollar a year market.

588
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,412
Games is the tiny market of only 150 billion.

589
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:37,274
So we'd always thought of what is native storytelling on mobile, but by storytelling we meant this

590
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:38,795
long form Hollywood storytelling.

591
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:40,756
So we prototyped for a couple years.

592
00:24:41,236 --> 00:24:46,798
We launched a first version in 2014 with kind of a pretty small team and it just worked

593
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:47,378
and it fit.

594
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,080
So we've been investing more and more in it ever since.

595
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,220
Okay, thanks.

596
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:51,740
Sure.

597
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,822
All right, fantastic talk.

598
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:55,582
Thanks.

599
00:24:55,722 --> 00:24:56,262
Quick question.

600
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,750
in terms of monetization, your stories are five minutes.

601
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,891
How many of those episodes would a player

602
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:05,652
be able to do for a dollar?

603
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:07,232
And how did you guys go about that process

604
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:10,973
of figuring out the sweet spot for how many passes

605
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:13,194
or stories a person could do for when they spend?

606
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,216
Sure, so thinking about what's the kind of sweet spot for stories.

607
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:20,920
So for us, our episodes are five minutes.

608
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,343
Our stories might last multiple episodes the same way TV seasons do.

609
00:25:24,884 --> 00:25:29,308
So they're usually at minimum 12 episodes that can go on.

610
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,329
We have some of our user stories that are now over 100 episodes.

611
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:36,514
In terms of that, we don't actually charge for the episodes.

612
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:39,236
We have in-app purchases within them,

613
00:25:39,617 --> 00:25:42,839
and we also have a pass system that the longer you've been in the app,

614
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:44,601
the more free passes you get every four hours,

615
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:45,722
but they continue to refill.

616
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:51,766
In terms of figuring out the sweet spot, a lot of A-B testing, I guess, is the answer.

617
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:57,789
For the past system, but then also with the story length itself, it depends partially

618
00:25:57,849 --> 00:25:58,609
on the story.

619
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,292
I don't think we know exactly what the optimal length is.

620
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:05,373
We haven't sort of so clearly fit it.

621
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:08,035
The way TV has it, it's like 22 and 44 minute lengths.

622
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:08,755
Great.

623
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:09,135
Thank you.

624
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:09,515
Sure.

625
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:19,331
Hello, very nice talk. I wanted to ask you how do you choose which choices should be

626
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:25,434
the ones that are monetizable, which choices to monetize? And a second question, once you

627
00:26:25,454 --> 00:26:29,355
made that decision, did you A-B test those choices?

628
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:31,096
Sorry, could you say the second part again?

629
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:36,418
Once you made the decision, okay, I want to monetize this choice, did you do an A-B test

630
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:37,498
on those choices?

631
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:38,199
Sure.

632
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,361
It's not, there's not a science to it exactly,

633
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,921
but we look at choices or branches

634
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:45,161
that feel really meaningful,

635
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:48,282
and that will give a viewer something

636
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:49,883
that feels like really meaningful value.

637
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:50,923
Because if they pay for something,

638
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:51,924
we want them to feel great

639
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,824
that they got something of real value.

640
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:56,105
So either the branch has to be big enough,

641
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:57,405
or it might give them an outfit

642
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:58,546
they wouldn't have otherwise got.

643
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:00,987
So that's kind of the main criterion,

644
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:02,707
is our viewer gonna feel good

645
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,368
about having made that choice and done it?

646
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:06,669
And then yeah, we test each one,

647
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:08,611
and we can kind of look at the performance of the choice.

648
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:09,471
Okay, thank you.

649
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:10,132
Sure.

650
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:14,274
How much ongoing development are you investing in,

651
00:27:14,755 --> 00:27:17,096
like the core of an episode, right?

652
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,678
You have dialogue choice mechanics,

653
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,100
like items and outfits, et cetera,

654
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,602
like all the animation stuff.

655
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:27,123
Like, are you still actively developing

656
00:27:27,163 --> 00:27:29,705
and adding to that tool set for the authors,

657
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:32,607
or does it feel kind of like done right now?

658
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:33,779
Definitely not done.

659
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,844
So we're investing very much in the tool set and want to continue putting out new and great

660
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:41,508
ways for people to tell stories and surprise and delight their viewers.

661
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,934
Is there any sort of preview of what feels like that you could, I don't know, I'm just

662
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:49,318
interested in what feels missing or like what's the next biggest bang for your development

663
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:49,778
buck?

664
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:52,348
Sure, I think a couple of things that are coming right now.

665
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,630
So we launched Pretty Little Liars in December

666
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,813
with an entirely new art and animation style.

667
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,755
I think it was more realistic, more subtle.

668
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:01,017
We're working to put that out to our whole community.

669
00:28:01,037 --> 00:28:03,520
We're working to put weather effects out right now.

670
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,062
We have a kind of first version of that.

671
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:06,763
So those are a couple of things on the roadmap.

672
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:07,704
Cool, thanks.

673
00:28:10,347 --> 00:28:11,789
I really enjoyed the presentation.

674
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:21,804
I was wondering if you could comment on your studio's experience mixing mini-games with

675
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:23,467
interactive fiction.

676
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:27,067
Sure, so experience mixing mini-games, interactive fiction.

677
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:31,350
We haven't really done that that much, is the answer.

678
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:36,133
So we have choices in there, but we very much tried to say,

679
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:38,876
how can episode be an alternative to TV

680
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,077
for a generation who's mobile only

681
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,578
and used to being an active participant

682
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:45,160
in their entertainment, more than we've thought,

683
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,923
how can we mix interactive storytelling with games?

684
00:28:50,224 --> 00:28:51,825
In that sense, so philosophically, we've

685
00:28:51,845 --> 00:28:52,826
just taken a slightly different path.

686
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:53,467
Thanks.

687
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:59,323
Hey, great content and super impressive concept just overall.

688
00:28:59,584 --> 00:28:59,984
Well done.

689
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:03,933
Um, how did you guys determine your target audience to begin with?

690
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:07,064
Sure, I think it's a great question how we determine the target audience.

691
00:29:07,144 --> 00:29:10,325
And it's just to some degree it was thoughtful and some degree it's chance.

692
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:14,687
I think the chance piece came of we in our casual studio in the early days

693
00:29:14,747 --> 00:29:16,588
at Pocket Champs had created a game Campus Life.

694
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:20,810
And it had a great art set and had our paper doll engine that allowed kind

695
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,431
of animated interactive characters that you could change outfits on.

696
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:27,973
So we could just take that art set and it was in the pilot episode

697
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:30,315
and that focused on this audience.

698
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:31,515
I think some of them were.

699
00:29:32,155 --> 00:29:34,817
the more thoughtful parts of it is an audience that feels pretty underserved.

700
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:39,240
And it's an audience that seems to like storytelling quite a bit.

701
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,062
And it's an audience where the kind of stories they like

702
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:45,524
are tellable in a mobile format quite well

703
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:50,366
versus, say, like a superhero story that would be much harder to tell in a platform-based way.

704
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:55,490
Do you see any opportunities for extending the platform to boys?

705
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:57,472
I think we do.

706
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:00,175
Over time, for sure, we'd love to be a platform

707
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:01,416
that hits all four quadrants.

708
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:06,801
But right now we're focused on just putting out great stories

709
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:08,503
for the current audience and growing organically.

710
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:09,384
All right, thanks.

711
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:12,059
Hi there.

712
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,480
One person on this side.

713
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,962
I'm curious about incidences of long-term choice

714
00:30:19,022 --> 00:30:20,843
and how your audience feels about them.

715
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:23,965
It seems that since they like things in a bite-sized form,

716
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:28,487
do they get frustrated when there's a longer-term choice

717
00:30:28,547 --> 00:30:30,768
where maybe they decided, OK, that choice

718
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:32,888
I made a long time ago, maybe I shouldn't have made?

719
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:35,630
That's an interesting question, but do they

720
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,790
get frustrated with long-term choice?

721
00:30:37,831 --> 00:30:39,591
I think it very much depends.

722
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:45,345
They want to, at every moment, be emotionally connected to that story.

723
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:49,468
So if the long-term choice is helping them stay connected to the story and feeling good,

724
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:53,712
I think that's what matters more than whether the choice is short-term or long-term.

725
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:58,335
I think the other pieces, the best choices are the ones that feel really, really meaningful.

726
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:00,957
And again, it matters less if they're short or long-term.

727
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:04,460
It's just, are you connecting deeply and emotionally with your audience at each moment?

728
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:06,262
Excellent. Thank you. That was fantastic.

729
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,344
All right. Well, thanks everybody. Really great to talk to you.
