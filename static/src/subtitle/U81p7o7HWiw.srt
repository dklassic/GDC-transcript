1
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:10,529
Yep, so let's start with some quick introductions.

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,891
So I'm Douglas Wilson.

3
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:18,174
I'm a lecturer at RMIT University in Melbourne, where I teach and research games.

4
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:25,520
I'm also the co-owner of Diguda Fabrique, a small studio based in Copenhagen, Denmark,

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,360
making indie games.

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,143
We're currently working on an adventure game called Mutassione.

7
00:00:30,743 --> 00:00:35,026
This is not what this talk is about, but hopefully we'll have news about this game in the near

8
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:35,326
future.

9
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:41,729
So today I want to give a business talk about one of my previous projects called Sports

10
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:42,070
Friends.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,753
I have a lot to share about this project, so I'm going to try to cram in as many slides

12
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,955
as I can into the next hour.

13
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:53,979
Just as a quick overview of the project, in case you've never heard of this before, Sports

14
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:58,182
Friends is a compendium of four different local multiplayer games, all by different

15
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:01,045
designers who were based in New York City at the time.

16
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:04,939
By local multiplayer, I mean multiplayer video games you

17
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,761
play together in the same room, like as opposed

18
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:09,541
to online.

19
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:14,144
The four games include Super Pole Riders, a physics-based

20
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:15,704
pole vaulting game by Bennett Foddy.

21
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:20,187
HOKRA, a minimalist 2v2 sports game by Ramiro Corbetta,

22
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:24,310
Barabariball, a mix of volleyball and Super Smash Brothers

23
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,954
by Noah Sasso, and JS Joust, a physical face-to-face motion

24
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:31,556
control game that I designed while living in Copenhagen

25
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:32,877
as a graduate student.

26
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:36,380
Actually, there are also a couple of secret games

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,503
by Bennett Foddy, but I'll let you discover those yourself.

28
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:44,138
And so when I say compendium, I mean that all four games were

29
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:48,040
bounded together in the same commercial product

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,603
as one executable glued together with the same main menu flow.

31
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:56,985
In May of 2014, we released Sports Friends

32
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:00,728
for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 on PlayStation Network.

33
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:04,090
And so that puts us very late in the PS3 lifecycle,

34
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,871
but quite early in the PS4 lifecycle.

35
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:13,814
Then in December of 2014, we released Sports Friends for PC, Mac, Linux via Steam and at

36
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:14,714
the Humble store.

37
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:20,796
The game received strong reviews, which we're really proud of, and the project was actually

38
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,916
profitable, which I'll talk more about later.

39
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:28,318
Today I want to give a business talk about how we marketed and made Sports Friends and

40
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:29,418
why that matters.

41
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:35,599
So, why talk about a project that's like four years old at this point?

42
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,823
You know, admittedly, the games industry has changed significantly since this game was

43
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:41,384
released.

44
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:47,668
But what's important about this talk, I think, is not Sports Friends itself, but more general

45
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:52,992
takeaways about video game compendiums and other possible forms of cross-game collaboration.

46
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:57,037
So this talk is not me suggesting do what we did,

47
00:02:57,057 --> 00:03:00,040
but rather I think indies could take some of the lessons

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,124
and run with them in their own way in a manner

49
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:08,730
specific to their cultural context, time, period, genre, and so on.

50
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,787
Okay, so here's what I'm gonna cover today.

51
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:15,508
First, a review of how the project came about,

52
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:19,749
then how we raised funds to make the project

53
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:20,709
and built an audience,

54
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,310
how we made the thing once we were funded,

55
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:26,971
and then a whole bunch of our financials.

56
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:30,732
So the budget, the legal contracts that we signed,

57
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,693
our profit sharing mechanism, and some sales data.

58
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:43,347
And finally, and maybe more interesting, I want to think through a little bit about the future of sports friends like compendiums and what that could look like moving forward.

59
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,574
And then I'll crystallize some takeaways at the end of the talk.

60
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:52,076
I don't want this talk to just be like a post-mortem.

61
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:54,638
I mean, obviously, it is kind of a post-mortem of Sports Friends,

62
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,159
but I do want it to say something a little bit more.

63
00:03:57,179 --> 00:04:02,383
One of the key points I'm going to emphasize is why a compendium like Sports Friends

64
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,284
is something more than just a bundle.

65
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:08,547
I want you to come away from this talk understanding why that distinction matters.

66
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:13,530
More generally, I want to convince you to consider broader cultural narratives

67
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,811
beyond just your one game.

68
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:21,075
So recently there have been a lot of articles about how to market your indie game and how

69
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:25,357
to design marketing-friendly moments into the very fabric of your game.

70
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:31,259
In this talk, I want to question the unit of analysis that's so often assumed by these

71
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,341
articles that the goal is just to market your one game singular.

72
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:41,684
The argument I want to make is that thinking about just your one game might not actually

73
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:42,965
be ambitious enough.

74
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:45,706
To this point, I hope Sports Friends can provide

75
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,268
one example of thinking more broadly.

76
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:53,532
Also before I get into it, I do want to mention one big caveat for this entire talk.

77
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:58,635
I don't mean to suggest that commercial success should be necessarily your goal.

78
00:04:59,276 --> 00:05:04,340
It is 100% absolutely fine and great to make a video game as a hobby or artistic practice

79
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,121
beyond the demands of the market.

80
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:11,365
Actually on this topic I recommend Robert Yang's recent post on reassessing what success

81
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:12,866
means in independent games.

82
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,659
And anyway, I hope this talk will be relevant to anyone trying to build an audience for

83
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,800
their work, commercial or not.

84
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,561
OK, Project Origins.

85
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:26,622
I don't think I can talk about the business of Sports Friends without telling you about

86
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:29,023
the cultural context in which it was conceived.

87
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,324
So let's go back to 2011.

88
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:37,946
At the beginning of this decade, as new ideas about indie games were coalescing, there was

89
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:42,968
a growing wave of public video game exhibitions organized by festivals and game collectives.

90
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:47,772
Just to name a few examples, I'm thinking of events like Indiecade in Los Angeles,

91
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:51,595
the GAMMA showcases run by Montreal collective Cocoromi,

92
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:56,079
Babycastles, a games and DIY art collective in New York City,

93
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,122
and lots more I won't have time to talk about today.

94
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:05,248
These public events gave indie devs like me opportunities to show games to live audiences

95
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:10,012
and motivated us to make new exhibition-friendly work suited to spectatorship.

96
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:16,589
In some cases, these events directly commissioned and funded game prototypes.

97
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,993
An example here is NYU's annual No Quarter exhibition, which still continues today.

98
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:27,056
In fact, two of the games in Sports Friends, Hokura and Barabari Ball, were originally

99
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:28,798
commissioned by No Quarter.

100
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:32,580
Hokura was commissioned in 2011 and Barabari Ball was commissioned in 2012.

101
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:36,732
There's a much longer history I could tell here,

102
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:39,413
but what I do want to convey is that in

103
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:42,754
2011 it felt like local multiplayer was important, that

104
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:45,195
it was being recognized, that it was on the

105
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:45,615
rise.

106
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:49,457
So while all of this is happening, I was

107
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:51,778
living in Copenhagen as a grad student, making my

108
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:53,218
own local multiplayer games.

109
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,520
Inspired by my work with the Copenhagen Game Collective,

110
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,061
I went to the 2011 Nordic Game Jam and

111
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,742
prototyped what would become Johann Sebastian Jauss.

112
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:08,846
After showing the game in the streets of Copenhagen in June 2011, I knew I was on to something

113
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,347
really, really fun.

114
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:15,190
I submitted the game to festivals and was fortunate enough to be able to show it at

115
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,293
events like IndieCade, Wild Rumpus, and the Independent Games Festival.

116
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:24,417
But I had no idea how I could ever release this game commercially.

117
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:29,502
For one thing, it only ran on Mac and needed multiple PlayStation Move controllers.

118
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:34,866
Like this weird controller that not many people owned, let alone have like six of them.

119
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:41,973
Meanwhile, in spring of 2011, I playtested an early build of Hokura that Ramiro had emailed

120
00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:42,313
to me.

121
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:48,659
I had met Ramiro the year before in my travels exhibiting my games in Baby Castles in New

122
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:48,939
York.

123
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,442
Immediately, I loved Hokura, like the minute I played it.

124
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:58,808
It was kind of like Nintendo ice hockey, but for the 21st century and with a nice 2v2 dynamic.

125
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:04,303
And despite the difficult path to market, indie designers we knew kept making weird

126
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:04,923
sports games.

127
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:11,725
In September of 2011, I met Bennett Foddy, the maker of QWOP, at an exhibition we curated

128
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,226
at Baby Castles in New York.

129
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:19,148
At the event, we debuted Bennett's new 1v1 pole vaulting game, Pole Riders, the game

130
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,388
that would go on to become Super Pole Riders.

131
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,430
We had this growing feeling that there might somehow be a commercial path for our games,

132
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,671
even if we didn't yet see how.

133
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:33,333
Also, we saw a commercial release as a way to reach new audiences.

134
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:38,306
And that was always the main goal, anyway, getting more people to enjoy our games.

135
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:44,120
In 2012, after a lot of brainstorming, we decided to take some inspiration from sports

136
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,281
games compendiums like Epic's Summer Games and Wii Sports.

137
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:52,163
The hope was that if we could combine a handful of games into one package, we'd have enough

138
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:55,444
critical mass to motivate a full commercial release.

139
00:08:56,304 --> 00:09:00,765
Three games felt like too small a number, so eventually we recruited Noah Sasso and

140
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,826
his sports-like fighting game, Bar Bari Ball.

141
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,602
And that was that.

142
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:07,407
We had a team, we had an idea, and we'd eventually

143
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,793
call the project Sports Friends, inspired by the German word

144
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:15,943
sportsfreunde, which is a real word, which is kind of great.

145
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:17,959
Fundraising.

146
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,721
So I want to talk a bit about the project logistics

147
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:23,643
to give you an idea of what making this kind of compendium

148
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:24,664
might entail.

149
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,246
Early on, we decided it would be important to release

150
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:29,607
Sports Friends on console.

151
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:32,189
Getting controllers to work on home computers

152
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:35,211
is a real pain, especially the move controllers.

153
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:37,793
And anyway, getting on console would expose us

154
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:39,434
to a much larger audience.

155
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:44,959
Throughout 2011 and 2012, I had already been talking

156
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:48,022
to Sony America about JS Joust, my game, which

157
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,626
they had played at IndieCade 2011 and some

158
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:51,187
other events.

159
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:53,590
I took the idea of Sports Friends to my

160
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,213
contacts at Sony, and eventually we ended up signing

161
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,935
a pub fund deal with them.

162
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:03,014
The PubFund program, at least our deal back in 2012,

163
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:06,775
isn't really upfront publishing money from Sony.

164
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:11,396
It's more a guarantee on a certain number of sales.

165
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:14,377
So for example, let's say you get $150,000 PubFund grant

166
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,458
from Sony in the 2012 era of these grants.

167
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,261
That means you get $150,000 from Sony right when you finish the game.

168
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:29,843
Then, the first $150,000 you make goes straight to Sony.

169
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:33,264
That arrangement means, even if your game bombs and, like,

170
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:37,406
fails to sell a single copy, you still make $150,000 guaranteed,

171
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:39,106
and Sony eats the loss.

172
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,808
For us, that guarantee was enough to reduce the risk

173
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:44,528
of making the project for console.

174
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:52,685
Also, I think importantly, PubFund is a commitment from Sony to help market your game, both explicitly and implicitly.

175
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:56,133
This kind of deal gives them an incentive to earn their money back.

176
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:01,921
we still needed to raise funds up front to make the game.

177
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:04,563
So we went to Kickstarter in late 2012.

178
00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:10,609
We eventually met our goal of $150,000 with over 4,000 backers.

179
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:14,793
Of course, that simple summary doesn't really tell the full story.

180
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:17,615
Both Kickstarter and social media...

181
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:22,738
I want to caveat, have changed a lot, like a lot, a lot over the last four years.

182
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:28,321
So I don't think I can give you specific crowdfunding advice that's still relevant in 2018.

183
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:30,943
What I can tell you, though, is that even in 2012, $150,000 was a big ask.

184
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:32,023
Why did we set it at $150,000?

185
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:39,927
Well, the four of us got together, spent a long time

186
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:43,189
figuring out what we needed to make the game, and we calculated

187
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:46,111
we could get by with a minimum of $150,000.

188
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:49,573
We asked for what we needed, because the only thing worse

189
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:52,895
than failing to hit your target is just barely hitting a target

190
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,577
that's actually too low for you to finish the game.

191
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:02,095
We actually barely made this target, squeaking by on the final day, as you can see from this

192
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:02,755
graph here.

193
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:06,457
In retrospect, we did, like, a lot of things wrong.

194
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:12,020
Despite significant effort, we had trouble explaining such a complex project with so

195
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,840
many moving parts.

196
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:18,223
But we did have a few key advantages going for us, advantages that would serve us well

197
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:21,305
not just during the Kickstarter, but also upon release.

198
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:27,499
First and foremost, we owned a strong narrative about reclaiming local multiplayer and ushering

199
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,900
in a new golden age of in-person play.

200
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,961
All four Sports Friends games, whether motion-controlled or screen-based, excel at getting people together

201
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:42,283
in the same room, facilitating an enjoyable social experience for both players and spectators.

202
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:46,685
This angle really resonated not just with players, but also the press.

203
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:53,140
The narrative capitalized on latent interest in local multiplayer experiences that people

204
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,771
had growing up in the arcade and in the home, like four-player games on the Nintendo 64.

205
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:02,337
In fact, we really doubled down on this narrative.

206
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:05,178
We made it clear that Sports Friends would be local multiplayer

207
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,199
and local multiplayer only.

208
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,041
We deliberately said we wouldn't be adding any single player mode

209
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:13,422
or network multiplayer or AI or anything.

210
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:18,585
Here's an editorial Bennett wrote for Polygon on the topic at the time.

211
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:21,626
This choice was partly for technical reasons.

212
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:25,268
Network multiplayer wouldn't have worked with most of the four games.

213
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,532
We also limited scope for budget reasons.

214
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:31,476
Writing four different AI systems would have been too expensive

215
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:34,239
and networked multiplayer would be even worse.

216
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,944
Mostly, though, we just weren't interested in those features.

217
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,427
We wanted to get to the heart of the genre,

218
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,670
playing with other people in the same room

219
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:44,493
and cut all the cruft.

220
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:51,060
One big advantage we had, or another big advantage we had, was that the four of us had accumulated

221
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,281
different fan bases while touring our games around in 2011 and 2012.

222
00:13:56,201 --> 00:14:00,382
For example, I had generated a passionate fan base for JSJoust after having shown the

223
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,362
game at events like PAX.

224
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:06,223
Here's a clip of the special 18-player version I ran at PAX Prime 2012.

225
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:12,347
Noah, by contrast, was able to build some interest in the fighting games community and

226
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:15,930
had shown Baro-Bari Ball at events like EVO in Las Vegas.

227
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:20,594
By coming together, the four of us were able to attract audiences we couldn't have reached

228
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:21,195
on our own.

229
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:26,618
In a sense, then, this section title of fundraising is a little misleading.

230
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:31,721
What I'm really talking about here is something like cultural legitimation.

231
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:36,524
That's to say we didn't just raise money for a project we wanted to make, we also built

232
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:41,948
a fan base and reassured ourselves that there was indeed enough public interest to justify

233
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:45,770
investing our time and our money into such a project in the first place.

234
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:51,780
Also importantly, the project benefited greatly from the renown of Bennett's virally infamous

235
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,781
browser game, QWOP.

236
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:57,706
With our Kickstarter campaign sagging and just days to go, we tried doing a Reddit AMA

237
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:03,613
in a last-ditch effort, and Bennett, who understands Reddit pretty well, was clever enough to frame

238
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,716
the AMA in terms of QWOP, the game everyone loves to hate.

239
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:08,385
Thank you, Bennett.

240
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:13,647
The AMA was a big success, and in fact, you can see on this graph, you can actually see

241
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:18,709
the slope of the contributions to our Kickstarter changing that same day that we do the AMA.

242
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:23,790
Of course, this data doesn't, like, prove that correlation is causation, but my guess

243
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,511
is that the AMA helped drum up a significant amount of awareness.

244
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:34,452
The broader, more useful lesson here is that Sports Friends didn't just arrive out of nowhere.

245
00:15:34,752 --> 00:15:39,218
It was a project that built on years of prior games, experience, and brand building.

246
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:42,513
OK, so the project was funded, and now we actually

247
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:43,334
had to make the thing.

248
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:46,515
In late 2012, right as the Kickstarter happened,

249
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:48,356
I moved from Copenhagen to New York.

250
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:50,197
That was partly for family reasons,

251
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:52,178
but I also wanted to be near the other sports

252
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:53,299
friends during the production.

253
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,620
Even though I was technically the lead producer, all four

254
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,862
of us were extremely involved throughout the entire process.

255
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:03,083
Each of us retained final say over our own games,

256
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:06,465
but when the entire product was concerned,

257
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,786
we tried to make all our decisions unanimous.

258
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:11,929
Of course, that meant a lot more discussion time,

259
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,231
but I think in the end it was almost always worth it.

260
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:17,354
In retrospect, I think Sports Friends only worked

261
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:19,296
because the four of us got along so well.

262
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:22,079
That meant working on the game was usually enjoyable,

263
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:24,221
like even the more bureaucratic meetings.

264
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:25,903
I don't think we could have achieved

265
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,484
such a coherent final product

266
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,566
if we all hadn't been so invested.

267
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:34,992
There's a huge potential for big disagreements to sink a project like Sports Friends.

268
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:38,295
I think knowing that we were each the king of our own little domain,

269
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:40,237
like our own component games,

270
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:44,382
made it easier to listen to each other when we were discussing the larger product.

271
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:49,487
The compendium brought with it a natural structure, which is, I think, a really key point.

272
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:54,005
We hired two full programmers, partly because console development was too much

273
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:55,066
for the four of us to handle.

274
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:58,609
Our lead programmer was Jonathan Whiting, based in Oxford, England.

275
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,454
Oxford made sense because that's where Bennett was living before he moved to New York in 2013.

276
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:08,640
Jonathan worked on the core PSN code, the menus, and was responsible for the PC, Mac,

277
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,481
and Linux ports.

278
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:12,744
He also did the Super Pole Riders and JSJoust.

279
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:18,616
Our second programmer, Ed, came recommended by Romero, who had worked with him at a previous

280
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:18,936
job.

281
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:23,180
Ed was based in New Jersey, which meant that we could take the train down to work with

282
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,861
him in person when we needed to.

283
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:30,266
Ed worked on the core PSN code alongside Jonathan and took the lead on the PS4 specific code.

284
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:32,808
He also did the ports of Hokra and Bar Baribol.

285
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,900
Now, one of our major tasks was porting the four games into the same code base.

286
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,621
Kind of hilariously, all four of our prototypes were made using different technologies, so

287
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:49,222
Flash, XNA, GameMaker, and Unity, which is a little brutal.

288
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:54,343
At the time, Unity didn't seem quite so ready for console ports, and anyway, we didn't know

289
00:17:54,363 --> 00:17:57,483
when the Unity team would support PS4.

290
00:17:58,064 --> 00:18:03,285
So we ended up going with a proprietary C++ engine licensed to us by our friends at Choice

291
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:03,825
Provisions.

292
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,813
Beyond Jonathan and Ed, we had a large team of contractors and collaborators helping us

293
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:12,795
with different aspects of the project in different capacities.

294
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:16,857
To start with, each of the four of us had our own small team helping us with our game,

295
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:18,858
which I won't detail fully here.

296
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:24,002
We did hire a visual artist, Florian Sanger, to lead the visual design of the menus and

297
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:24,662
the branding.

298
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:29,925
And we hired Guta Fabrique's composer, Alessandro Coronas, to do the sound and music for the

299
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:30,306
menus.

300
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:34,548
Here's a mock-up from Florian for a tournament mode that never made it into the game.

301
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:40,488
As I see it, the most important work we did during the production was the menus and the

302
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:44,674
branding, bringing together all the games into one cohesive package.

303
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:50,703
The menus took up a huge amount of our time and effort, way more than porting of the games

304
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:51,444
themselves.

305
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:55,548
It's one thing to make a local multiplayer game that's fun,

306
00:18:55,728 --> 00:19:00,914
but it's another thing entirely to make the whole experience feel smooth and professional,

307
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:03,817
to make it easy for players to enter and exit games,

308
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:07,161
create their own arenas like they can in the final version of Pokera,

309
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:09,944
change settings, and all that other stuff.

310
00:19:11,146 --> 00:19:15,427
We also felt like we needed to distinguish ourselves from the many bundles that have

311
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:16,827
flooded the marketplace.

312
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:21,308
Don't get me wrong, I really like the Humble store and I think their bundles serve an important

313
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:22,468
role in the marketplace.

314
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:25,809
In fact, Sports Friends has actually been in a few Humble bundles.

315
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:29,410
But often bundle themes are like loose at best.

316
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,991
We were worried about people thinking that the Sports Friends games were low value or

317
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:36,831
that the quantity was making up for low quality somehow.

318
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:41,917
So in contrast to bundles, we wanted to create a more coherent narrative about what Sports

319
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:44,559
Friends was as a single product.

320
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:49,381
To that end, we hoped that the menus would give the project both a visual identity and

321
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:53,603
a conceptual identity, a whole greater than the sum of its proverbial parts.

322
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:59,466
This isn't something we can easily measure, but I do think the new visual identity helped

323
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:03,648
address some of the problems we had explaining the game during our Kickstarter campaign.

324
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:08,069
Now, with the final menus, you could see visually

325
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:10,430
that Sports Friends was one product immediately.

326
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,530
It was tangible.

327
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,471
We also put in this great Danielle Buttonberry quote

328
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:16,592
in the startup sequence

329
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:19,073
to emphasize our local multiplayer narrative.

330
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:21,153
Here, we were basically arguing

331
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:23,414
that the absence of single-player or online play

332
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,875
isn't a bug, it's a feature.

333
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:30,496
Okay, so here's some of the gory financial details

334
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,037
about the project.

335
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:37,321
The project cost us approximately $200,000 to make.

336
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:42,187
Our Kickstarter budget calculations actually turned out to be pretty accurate.

337
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:48,434
But midway during production, we decided to take on some extra costs to add PS4 support.

338
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:51,617
So when we had originally budgeted the game, we thought we were only doing PS3.

339
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:53,499
So that explains the extra $50,000, roughly.

340
00:20:56,544 --> 00:21:01,546
I do want to note that this 200,000 number is kind of artificially low, because none

341
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:05,928
of the four main sports brands took any money during the production, myself included.

342
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:09,630
We were only paid in profit share after the release.

343
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,471
All four of us worked on the game in some kind of part-time capacity.

344
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:18,353
I was the most full-time of the four of us, but even I took a couple of contract jobs

345
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:19,153
during the production.

346
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:22,641
Beyond that, I subsisted on savings for my previous job,

347
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:26,290
and the other three sports friends had their own contract work or day jobs.

348
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,811
Here's a budget visualization I spat out from Google Docs.

349
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,691
The text is a little too small.

350
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:36,153
But to summarize, about two-thirds of our budget

351
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,714
went to our hired programs, by far our biggest cost.

352
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:42,815
The second biggest cost was visual design and sound,

353
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:46,196
which also covered the new redesign of JSJoust,

354
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:51,438
which now features beautiful graphics by Dom2D, a Canadian artist.

355
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,105
For the legal entity behind the game, we used the studio I co-own, The Gouda Fabrique, and

356
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:03,368
specifically we used a New York LLC that's a branch of Gouda Fabrique.

357
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:08,811
Note that the other three sports friends are not actually part of Gouda Fabrique.

358
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:15,036
So because Gouda Fabrique took on the legal risk, and because I did so much production

359
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:22,041
work leading the project, we split the profit shares five ways, where me and the three sports

360
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:27,726
friends each took 20%, and the company Gouda Fabrique took the extra fifth share.

361
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,306
It was important for all of us to feel like equals,

362
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:32,607
while still recognizing all the additional work

363
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:34,107
me and Guta Fabrique did.

364
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,628
Actually, it's a little bit more complicated than that.

365
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:40,369
We also gave shares to our programmers, Jonathan and Ed.

366
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,290
Although we paid them for their work up front,

367
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,730
we thought it was only fair for them to have some share of the profits,

368
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:49,551
especially given how much time they'd be spending on the project.

369
00:22:49,591 --> 00:22:51,012
They spent a lot of time on the project.

370
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:53,728
OK, contracts.

371
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:56,589
We knew there was a big potential for this kind of project

372
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:57,489
to go really wrong.

373
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,550
Thankfully, it didn't, but there was always that potential.

374
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,711
So we wrote up a lengthy contract and even paid lawyers

375
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:04,631
to look over it.

376
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:07,812
This is going to be a little oversimplified, obviously,

377
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:10,273
but here's an overview of some of the general terms

378
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:12,594
of our contract, just as a suggestion of what

379
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:14,574
it might look like to structure one

380
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:15,695
of these kinds of compendiums.

381
00:23:17,368 --> 00:23:23,197
So Bennett, Ramiro, and Noah all retained the IP to their games, so Gudefribik does

382
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:28,064
not own Hokra or Super Bowl Riders or Barabaribol.

383
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:35,103
They did grant Gutaforbric a license to sell specific versions of their IP in perpetuity.

384
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:40,728
So Gutaforbric is allowed to keep sports friends on the marketplace as long as they want.

385
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:46,973
And they agreed to one year of exclusivity of their IP following the initial PSN release.

386
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:54,479
So a year after that 2014 release, for example, if Noah wanted to go on and make Barra Barriball

387
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:55,700
2, he could have done that.

388
00:23:58,214 --> 00:24:01,417
They agreed to a pretty specific schedule and feature set.

389
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:05,240
We all agreed to that profit sharing scheme that we spelled

390
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,622
out in extensive detail in the contracts.

391
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,644
And they were also given a minor financial stake

392
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:12,185
in the Sports Friends brand.

393
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:14,267
So if Gouda Fabrique was ever to use it again

394
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:15,928
in some new project, like a Sports Friends 2,

395
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:19,051
or say I made Gun Friends or whatever,

396
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:20,532
they would have had a small stake.

397
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:21,773
That's a joke.

398
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,855
I'm absolutely not going to make Gun Friends.

399
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:31,577
to be really clear. The contract also covered some failure cases. So, like, what would it

400
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:36,498
mean for the designers, like the other sports friends, to breach the agreement? What would

401
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:40,719
it mean for Agouti Fabrique or me to breach the agreement? And what would happen to the

402
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:45,120
profit shares if the agreement was somehow terminated? Luckily, we haven't had to deal

403
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,141
with any of this stuff, but it was really important for us to set all this kind of stuff

404
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:52,481
in stone. And if you're going to do this kind of project, I think it is really important

405
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:52,742
to have.

406
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:53,562
So, we'll have a link to that in a

407
00:24:53,582 --> 00:24:53,742
moment.

408
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:54,782
And, of course, you can see that we have

409
00:24:54,802 --> 00:24:56,263
all the legal contracts set pretty cleanly.

410
00:24:57,144 --> 00:24:58,504
By the way, if there's any interest, I can

411
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:01,145
look into releasing this contract someday.

412
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:02,546
So, feel free to email me.

413
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:04,327
I'll put some of my contact information at the

414
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:04,947
end of the talk.

415
00:25:06,248 --> 00:25:07,168
OK, sales.

416
00:25:07,448 --> 00:25:10,229
So, when we undertook Sports Friends, we didn't know

417
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,270
how much money we'd make.

418
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,491
And that's why the pub fund guarantee on sales

419
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:15,652
was so important for us.

420
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:18,073
Like, this was a weird and risky project.

421
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:20,294
It was quite possible in our minds that we

422
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:21,375
would make hardly any money.

423
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:29,744
So in the end, like to date, we've made roughly like $900,000 in net revenue.

424
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:34,927
Like that's the money that has come into our bank account, not gross revenue, which is

425
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:38,488
like a little bit more complicated for me to try to calculate, so I didn't.

426
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:44,471
This amount hugely exceeds our expectations, so we're obviously really kind of happy and

427
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,171
proud about that.

428
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:48,626
But so you think about the budget was $200,000.

429
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:49,847
So in reality, that's something like $700,000 in

430
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:50,367
profit so far.

431
00:25:55,068 --> 00:26:00,772
So, figuring out, figuring like my, for example, 18.5% split over two years of unpaid work,

432
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:05,955
that's about like $65,000 per year before taxes, which is great.

433
00:26:07,196 --> 00:26:11,399
I personally also took some of the Gouda Fabrique share and then put the rest back into our

434
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:13,340
future company projects.

435
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:18,403
Again, to be clear, we're like super happy with this amount, but you should note that

436
00:26:18,484 --> 00:26:20,925
all four of us are still doing day jobs, right?

437
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:24,058
It's a lot of money, but split a whole

438
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:24,819
bunch of different ways.

439
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,960
By the way, this amount includes the Kickstarter money

440
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,261
we earned and a PS Plus deal that we

441
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:34,823
did. The vast majority of the sales were on

442
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:37,584
PS4 as opposed to on home computers. Like, the

443
00:26:37,744 --> 00:26:40,905
vast majority of the sales. And we still enjoy

444
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:43,446
a pretty long tail of sales, which is, which

445
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:43,786
is great.

446
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:49,891
I think two things that probably helped us a lot was one, buy-in from Sony America, who

447
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:55,816
were invested in featuring our game, and two, we were pretty early in the PS4 life cycle,

448
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:57,598
which I think counted for quite a lot.

449
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:03,683
Okay, so making this compendium worked out pretty well for us, and clearly I'm a big

450
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:08,347
believer in the whole idea of compendiums as a way to do deep collaboration.

451
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:14,244
Sports Friends succeeded because it wasn't just a collection of random multiplayer games.

452
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:19,386
It was a project very visibly on the forefront of bringing back local multiplayer.

453
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:24,907
But thinking beyond Sports Friends itself, I want to offer a little provocation about

454
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:28,167
what the future of collaboration could look like in video games.

455
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:33,349
I've been talking about building something bigger than just your one game or even your

456
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:37,870
one studio, but in some ways that idea is kind of already well explored.

457
00:27:38,984 --> 00:27:43,446
For example, I'm pretty inspired by the Rusty Lake studio.

458
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:47,028
It's a Dutch duo who make surrealistic adventure puzzle games,

459
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:49,549
all orbiting the same fictional universe.

460
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,751
I really recommend taking a look at these.

461
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:56,773
The series began in 2015 and already includes nine free-to-play games,

462
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:58,894
which are called the Cube Escape games,

463
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:02,516
and three larger premium games, the Rusty Lake games.

464
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:07,759
I also want to clarify these games are not the same things as episodes, like episodic

465
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,400
releases of one larger story arc.

466
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,482
Each game is playable on its own, apart from the rest of the series.

467
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:17,745
And yet, all the games connect in direct and indirect ways.

468
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:23,497
In an interview with the Itch.io blog, the series creators talk about the inspiration

469
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:24,257
behind the series.

470
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:26,959
And I want to read this one quote from that interview.

471
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,481
So they say, we were inspired by Twin Peaks and wanted to create a similar surreal world

472
00:28:32,622 --> 00:28:35,123
where our games could take place and connect with each other.

473
00:28:35,743 --> 00:28:41,426
It was back in April 2015 when we launched Cube Escape The Lake and Seasons, the first

474
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:43,527
two entries in the Rusty Lake universe.

475
00:28:44,227 --> 00:28:48,871
Both games were connected and with a code you could use in one of the games that gave

476
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:49,852
a different ending.

477
00:28:50,393 --> 00:28:54,356
It made people feel like these games were part of something bigger.

478
00:28:54,917 --> 00:29:00,282
And so what I find so inspiring about this is that Rusty Lake isn't just a studio making

479
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:01,222
multiple games.

480
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:06,887
They're making games and servers of a larger, coherent experience with multiple entry points

481
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:10,631
such that each game leads players to all the other entries.

482
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,842
So the twist I'm suggesting in this talk

483
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:17,144
is that that kind of multiple entry points or larger

484
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:20,267
narrative can also be built more heterogeneously

485
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,569
across different studios, different designers,

486
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:24,829
different projects.

487
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,811
You see sports friends on the screen here.

488
00:29:27,977 --> 00:29:31,619
For years, I've called myself an independent game developer,

489
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:35,780
but we might reassess how independent we really even want to be.

490
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:39,922
Barring a term from Bart Simon and the research he and his team have done

491
00:29:39,982 --> 00:29:42,103
studying the economics of the indie megabooth,

492
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:46,184
maybe we could pivot from the more familiar indie game design label

493
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:49,506
to a kind of interdependy game design.

494
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:53,767
OK, like maybe not such a catchy term, but hopefully you get what I mean.

495
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,422
By the way, that research project about the Indie Megabooth called Indie Interfaces is

496
00:29:59,462 --> 00:30:03,964
a really useful sociological look at collaboration and culture building in indie games.

497
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:07,847
It was one of the inspirations behind this talk, and you can check out their research

498
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:10,228
on their website, which I recommend.

499
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:15,611
Back to thinking about sports friends and what future sports friends-like projects might

500
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:19,994
look like, something I think about all the time is what are the record labels of video

501
00:30:20,014 --> 00:30:21,815
games, and what could they be?

502
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,291
In music, one of my personal favorite labels is Warp Records.

503
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:30,273
In the 90s, warp became almost synonymous with a certain ilk

504
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,434
of electronic music.

505
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:34,215
If you bought a warp album back then,

506
00:30:34,255 --> 00:30:37,116
you knew you'd get an album of heady, high quality

507
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:39,578
electronic music, even if you'd never heard

508
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:40,938
of the particular artist before.

509
00:30:42,184 --> 00:30:46,268
Now, when I talk about this with colleagues, they often suggest that indie publishers like

510
00:30:46,348 --> 00:30:50,273
Devolver are already providing the record labels of video games.

511
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,116
And I think this is partially right.

512
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:58,682
Clearly, Devolver has a coherent aesthetic identity, a really strong social media presence,

513
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:00,284
and a dedicated fan base.

514
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:05,406
But we might also imagine a more bottom-up structure,

515
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:07,346
where fellow creators come together

516
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:10,367
in more complicated artist-run arrangements,

517
00:31:10,747 --> 00:31:13,227
as opposed to the more familiar top-down paradigm

518
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,448
of a publisher giving money and or marketing support.

519
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:19,288
So in that sense, maybe traditional record labels

520
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:22,049
like Warp aren't actually the best example here.

521
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,010
Maybe we can find more cooperative models.

522
00:31:26,322 --> 00:31:31,123
One useful example that blurs the line between indie publisher and developer is Wadjet Eye

523
00:31:31,163 --> 00:31:36,984
Games in New York, who make old school adventure games and also use their expertise and fan

524
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:40,104
base to publish similar games made by other developers.

525
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:45,746
Old school adventure games aren't so mainstream these days, sure, but they don't need to be

526
00:31:45,786 --> 00:31:49,927
super trendy as long as Wadjet Eye can establish a niche and find their fans.

527
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:55,851
I'd also point to artist-owned studios and game collectives who bring together like-minded

528
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:58,352
work with similar aesthetics.

529
00:31:58,712 --> 00:32:01,093
A good example here is Co-op in Montreal.

530
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:06,616
So they work on their own games like PS4 game Nog, but they also produce other people's

531
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,116
games like Gardenarium.

532
00:32:08,897 --> 00:32:12,698
Check out their website, which I think does a nice job conveying the creative identity

533
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:14,259
that binds their games together.

534
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:17,307
So let's think about Sports Friends again.

535
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:22,532
I sometimes wonder what it would mean to give a project

536
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:25,895
like Sports Friends more life beyond just the initial release.

537
00:32:26,396 --> 00:32:28,938
So imagine, if you will, turning Sports Friends

538
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:32,121
into its own platform, releasing a steady stream

539
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,504
of weird new sports games through the same application

540
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:39,108
over time, say one or two new games a year.

541
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:45,326
My ideas are still like a little half-baked, but let me at least propose two different

542
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:46,567
approaches we might take.

543
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:51,432
So the first approach is more ambitious and requires more coordination.

544
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:57,338
So we'd add new games to the existing Sports Friends executable and charge something like

545
00:32:57,398 --> 00:32:59,200
in-app purchases or a yearly subscription.

546
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:03,865
The main menu would feature a news feed announcing new additions to Sports Friends.

547
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:10,308
So possibly maybe we'd even like help pay for the porting and console release and offer our

548
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:15,491
expertise working through certification. And depending on the business model, we'd have to

549
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:20,474
figure out some kind of new fair rev split between all the game's designers, acknowledging the value

550
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:25,797
that the new games are bringing to the project. And really importantly, I think all new inductees

551
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:30,639
would then become official sports friends and would get an equal say in deciding which games

552
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:31,980
were added in the future.

553
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:36,964
So, OK, a second approach, which is a little less coordinated,

554
00:33:37,044 --> 00:33:39,085
so maybe also a bit more feasible.

555
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:43,608
All the new games would be separate downloads, separate purchases,

556
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:46,690
and whatever technology, so they wouldn't require any porting.

557
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,812
Maybe we'd specify some platform constraints, like all the games

558
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:54,014
must be for PS4 and or Steam or whatever.

559
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:59,585
All the Sports Friends games would include some kind of visual logo on their main menu

560
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:04,890
and link to the other Sports Friends games, like ideally in-app, maybe through some standardized

561
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,370
menu.

562
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:10,756
In this arrangement, maybe we don't even need to give funding or financial support at all.

563
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:15,540
The onus would be on the developer themselves to release their game, but the appeal is that

564
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,804
they'd still get to join a tightly curated collection with an existing fan base.

565
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:25,628
And of course, you'd still have the new inductees join the Sports Friends Council and help decide

566
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:27,569
which games get added in the future.

567
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,933
In either case, the strategic logic of that Sports Friends as platform idea is something

568
00:34:33,953 --> 00:34:34,334
like this.

569
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:38,236
Importantly, we commit to a coherent, communicable idea.

570
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:42,119
So in this case, local multiplayer and weird alternative sports games.

571
00:34:42,987 --> 00:34:49,414
We'd be pretty choosy about which games we'd add and release only, say, one game a year at a regular time.

572
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:53,198
The hope here is that we would be able to set regular expectations.

573
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,264
You'd want the fanbase to look forward to the new Sports Friends game of the calendar year.

574
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:03,738
And of course, we develop a coherent online and social media presence, a place for fans

575
00:35:03,778 --> 00:35:05,339
to stay updated about the platform.

576
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,104
Finally, as I suggested in approach number two, a cooperative might not even need liquid

577
00:35:11,164 --> 00:35:13,727
financial capital to make this idea work.

578
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:18,010
All you really need is a group of friends and colleagues coordinating their different

579
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,953
releases in a smart, branded, well-planned way.

580
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:26,204
I'm not sure if this is a good idea, by the way, for Sports Friends specifically, and

581
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:30,308
to be clear, none of the four of us were interested in pursuing such a project.

582
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:35,593
But I suspect that other compendiums could really make this general idea work.

583
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:42,199
Cross-promotion is certainly not a new idea, but I'd love to see more indies running with

584
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,523
it, taking it in new, more tightly coordinated directions.

585
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:49,563
Actually, maybe promotion is too limited of a noun here.

586
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,124
What I'm talking about is creating a narrative,

587
00:35:52,304 --> 00:35:55,126
becoming part of something larger than yourself.

588
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:58,008
In the current attention economy,

589
00:35:58,068 --> 00:35:59,869
I think there's something really valuable

590
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:01,830
to be gained by thinking bigger

591
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,091
than trying to build just one great game.

592
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:06,713
I know this sounds like a little over the top,

593
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,854
but it's worth considering how you might build

594
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:10,415
a larger cultural movement.

595
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:14,117
The question here is, how can your one isolated game

596
00:36:14,217 --> 00:36:15,698
be connected to something larger?

597
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:21,191
For us making sports friends, this was pushing the zeitgeist of local multiplayer.

598
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:25,233
For you, this will almost certainly be something totally different.

599
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:30,496
Now, I wish I could give you, like, a recipe for how to build that movement or collaboration,

600
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:35,298
but the power in this idea is precisely in charting new terrain and trying new arrangements.

601
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:40,781
I do think sports friends offers some valuable hints and inspirations, but any structure

602
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:45,283
you try to build will need to be tailored to your context, moment, and genre.

603
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:52,054
Finally, beyond business concerns, there are also political reasons to pursue radical

604
00:36:52,094 --> 00:36:52,794
collaborations.

605
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:57,256
One thing that's a little obvious from all the photos I've been showing is how all four

606
00:36:57,296 --> 00:37:00,098
of us sports friends and all of our main collaborators were men.

607
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:02,699
It doesn't have to be that way.

608
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:07,581
Just like how Sports Friends gave the four of us access to a commercial platform, we

609
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:11,403
couldn't have feasibly reached on our own, I think these kinds of collaborative structures

610
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:16,605
could also be used to give professional opportunities and visibility to more marginalized voices.

611
00:37:17,426 --> 00:37:21,888
Just as one small, recent example, local to me, I'd point to the all-women Australian

612
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:25,710
collective Blushbox, who make and promote games about sex and romance.

613
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:32,461
It isn't easy to get your game on console, especially for newcomers to the industry,

614
00:37:32,821 --> 00:37:36,803
but as we learned making Sports Friends, there is definitely a power in numbers.

615
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:42,505
For example, I don't think I would have been able to launch JS Joust by itself on PS4,

616
00:37:42,745 --> 00:37:45,326
even with one-fourth of the Sports Friends budget.

617
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:49,029
It was the larger scale of the Sports Friends project,

618
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:52,572
the four games together, that made the funding and logistics

619
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:53,193
possible.

620
00:37:54,134 --> 00:37:56,296
Applying collaborative structures more broadly,

621
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:59,478
we might wonder what other non-traditional games

622
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:02,581
and whose games might we be able to get

623
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:04,623
onto highly visible platforms.

624
00:38:05,924 --> 00:38:07,505
OK, so let's end this thing.

625
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:09,867
Some final takeaways I want to emphasize.

626
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:13,837
Take away one, Sports Friends wasn't just an idea

627
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,679
that we pulled out of thin air. It tapped into

628
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:23,502
particular trends. So, right place, right time. Sports Friends

629
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:25,943
was very much a product of its, like I

630
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:27,744
just said, of its place in time. It was

631
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:32,026
conceived somewhat organically, gradually, over a period of two

632
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:32,366
years.

633
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:38,308
Again, I think the trick here is to shift the unit of your thinking from just your one

634
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:40,909
video game to broader cultural narratives.

635
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,491
I don't think anyone can force a cultural movement.

636
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:48,493
A zeitgeist is something you identify, feed off of, and amplify.

637
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:53,475
That takes time and isn't the same thing as just trying to cash in on a hot new trend.

638
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:55,556
Takeaway number two.

639
00:38:56,257 --> 00:38:59,998
As much as possible, we try to go all in on our central narrative.

640
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:04,013
Again, think about the Danielle Buttonberry quote in our boot sequence.

641
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:09,002
Rather than shy away from the shortcoming of having no single player or online play,

642
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:11,447
we fully embraced that identity.

643
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:17,779
Take away three, narratives aren't just for the public and your potential consumers, they're

644
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:20,061
also for publishers and platform holders.

645
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:24,886
So here's a photo of me and Nick Suttner, who was then one of the main indie dev outreach

646
00:39:24,926 --> 00:39:26,107
guys at Sony America.

647
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:31,472
Sports Friends could not have happened without his enthusiasm or without the help of other

648
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:34,035
Sony folks like Brian Silva or Adam Boyes.

649
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:39,379
The fact that Nick so enthusiastically bought into the idea of local multiplayer

650
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,602
was a good sign that we were on to something and that the project was worth pursuing on console.

651
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:52,001
Takeaway number four, crafting new narratives is actually really hard and describing complex

652
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,643
projects like this is pretty tricky.

653
00:39:54,623 --> 00:39:58,907
Again, think about our Kickstarter campaign and the trouble we had packaging the idea

654
00:39:58,967 --> 00:39:59,587
of the project.

655
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:04,411
So it's easy for me to stand here and sing the praises of radically collaborative projects,

656
00:40:04,932 --> 00:40:08,975
but they often come with a huge amount of work nailing your narrative and explaining

657
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:10,336
the project to the public.

658
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:12,189
This takes time.

659
00:40:12,629 --> 00:40:16,173
Sometimes the public just has to sit with the concept for a while before they really

660
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:16,694
get it.

661
00:40:17,554 --> 00:40:21,819
That said, it's precisely that difficulty that makes such an idea worth pursuing.

662
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,044
If the narrative were easy, someone probably would have done it before.

663
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:31,401
Takeaway five, team chemistry is everything.

664
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:33,862
I've been talking a lot about the narrative

665
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:35,703
of local multiplayer and how sports friends

666
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:37,464
with the right project at the right time,

667
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,925
but all of that was only possible

668
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,726
because the four of us got along so well

669
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:43,406
and we're so excited to work with each other.

670
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:48,840
And that's not just true of the core team, but also of our programmers, Jonathan and Ed, and all of our other collaborators.

671
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:53,202
All that is to say, I'd be careful not to force a collaboration.

672
00:40:54,182 --> 00:40:59,624
But if you can find a great group of people who are all hungry to work together, you're definitely on the right path.

673
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:03,237
Takeaway number six, get involved.

674
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:04,278
Put yourself out there.

675
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,920
These kinds of collaborations don't happen overnight.

676
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,361
They happen gradually.

677
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:11,263
Here's a screenshot, actually, from the time

678
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:13,405
we video called Ramiro right after trying

679
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:14,706
Hochra for the first time.

680
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:17,068
Thank you, Brandon Boyer, for the screenshot.

681
00:41:17,928 --> 00:41:21,772
If I hadn't exhibited my games at Baby Castles in New York

682
00:41:21,932 --> 00:41:24,294
in 2010, I don't think I would have ever met Ramiro,

683
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:27,076
and Sports Friends probably would never have happened.

684
00:41:27,636 --> 00:41:29,257
And it's not like we came up with the idea

685
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:31,578
for Sports Friends the first time I met Ramiro.

686
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:34,479
That happened slowly over time as I got to

687
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:37,220
know him and his work and, and the other

688
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,720
Sports Friends.

689
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,481
OK, so, final caveat.

690
00:41:40,961 --> 00:41:43,182
Yeah, listen, this game is pretty old at this

691
00:41:43,262 --> 00:41:43,482
point.

692
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:47,084
So this, this talk is not a how-to guide.

693
00:41:47,144 --> 00:41:50,025
2018 is a very different climate for local multiplayer,

694
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:51,646
and this is not a project that we could

695
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:54,287
easily do today, at least not in the same

696
00:41:54,427 --> 00:41:54,687
form.

697
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:58,169
Still, if you're feeling alone in the world

698
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:00,590
of game dev or intimidated by the torrent of

699
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,872
new releases on Steam or whatever platform, I might

700
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:08,535
suggest consider finding new forms of collaborations, collaborations that make

701
00:42:08,575 --> 00:42:10,916
sense for you, and try to build something bigger

702
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:13,938
than just your one studio or your one game.

703
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:15,859
Yeah, that's about it.

704
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:16,299
Thank you.

705
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:30,071
I thought I'd go longer, but so we do have time for questions.

706
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:32,012
So if you do have any questions, great.

707
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:33,834
If not, that's okay too.

708
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:40,058
Hey, thanks for the talk.

709
00:42:40,698 --> 00:42:45,141
I just wanted to know, like, because everything seemed to come together quite organically.

710
00:42:46,624 --> 00:42:50,688
How did you manage, once you sort of kicked it into a gear and realized what you were trying to do,

711
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:57,156
how did you manage everybody's time and the differences of where people were up to with their projects and deadlines

712
00:42:57,256 --> 00:42:59,258
and just communication in general between the team?

713
00:43:00,673 --> 00:43:05,555
I think we were lucky in that all the games were already really playable, and we knew

714
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:10,777
all four games were good, they were playable when we started the project.

715
00:43:11,057 --> 00:43:12,597
So in that sense, managing...

716
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,639
We all had to polish our games, but it wasn't that much polish.

717
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:23,240
So managing the four main sports friends finishing their games was never really a big concern.

718
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,481
It was more just the like...

719
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:29,545
polish and the porting details, which is kind of them like managing a regular project.

720
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:34,589
So I think this would be much harder if the games were in like various different states

721
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:35,309
of completion.

722
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:40,674
So in that sense, we were already had the momentum of four games that were like showable

723
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:41,154
and playable.

724
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:42,555
That answers your question.

725
00:43:42,715 --> 00:43:43,056
Yeah, cool.

726
00:43:44,837 --> 00:43:49,341
You may have been asked this before, but why were the secret games kept secret?

727
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:53,364
And did that have any sort of effect on like the profit sharing conversations?

728
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:59,267
It did. So actually, the profit sharing slide I showed you is a little bit of a lie.

729
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:03,791
We gave Bennett a few more profit sharing percentages for the Secret Games.

730
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:09,336
I think this is, in fact, Bennett's in the audience, so he could probably tell you.

731
00:44:10,777 --> 00:44:12,778
For us, I think it was like a labor of love.

732
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,159
Like, it was never even planned.

733
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:15,420
Like, one day, Bennett was like,

734
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,820
you know, I want to make this secret game.

735
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,601
And so I think that spoke to the kind of, like,

736
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:20,602
enthusiasm in the project,

737
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:22,223
like people just doing stuff for fun

738
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,224
because they were geeked about local multiplayer.

739
00:44:24,264 --> 00:44:26,365
So those two secret games kind of came about,

740
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,706
like, weirdly and surprisingly.

741
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,007
But, yeah, we did.

742
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:32,428
I didn't want to get into the extra detail.

743
00:44:32,448 --> 00:44:33,849
But, yeah, the profit-sharing scheme

744
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:35,730
is a little bit more complicated.

745
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,490
And we did compensate Bennett a little bit more for that.

746
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:38,431
Okay, cool. Thanks.

747
00:44:40,915 --> 00:44:42,036
Hi, that was great.

748
00:44:43,456 --> 00:44:45,297
Can you just talk a little bit more about,

749
00:44:45,577 --> 00:44:48,098
you mentioned that 2018 is really different right now.

750
00:44:48,638 --> 00:44:50,639
So can you talk a little bit more about how

751
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,281
local multiplayer, how you think about that right now

752
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:56,762
versus when you started working on the project?

753
00:44:58,722 --> 00:45:01,023
So I've had this discussion a lot,

754
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:03,544
actually with the House House guys

755
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:04,425
who are here in the audience

756
00:45:04,465 --> 00:45:06,866
who made a great local multiplayer game, Push Me Pull You.

757
00:45:08,813 --> 00:45:13,675
I think local multiplayer is a tricky beast because people find their one local multiplayer

758
00:45:13,715 --> 00:45:17,116
game that they love playing with their friends, and there are other ones out there of the

759
00:45:17,156 --> 00:45:17,856
same era, right?

760
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:21,098
Like Tower Fall, Samurai Gun, Gang Beasts, whatever.

761
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:27,060
And it's something about the replayability of those games where you'll keep coming back

762
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:32,342
to them, so you might have less space in your social time for new things to try.

763
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:37,484
So that potentially, I worry, crowds out the ecosystem of local multiplayer.

764
00:45:37,564 --> 00:45:38,525
So to some extent, I think.

765
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:47,272
Now, in terms of co-located play and video games, more generally, in 2018, I'm really

766
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:49,374
excited by cooperative games.

767
00:45:49,474 --> 00:45:54,879
So Overcooked is a super good example of this, and that is a deeply underserved genre.

768
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,783
Someone should absolutely go make cooperative friends, or whatever you want to call it.

769
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:03,066
They would slam it out of the park, for sure.

770
00:46:03,086 --> 00:46:03,526
So I think...

771
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:05,388
Not that like...

772
00:46:05,408 --> 00:46:05,888
I don't know.

773
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:09,490
I don't mean to glorify cooperation over competition in games.

774
00:46:09,651 --> 00:46:11,652
That's often a false binary that's evoked.

775
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:17,115
But right now, I think that particular mode of co-located couch play is a little underrepresented.

776
00:46:17,215 --> 00:46:22,358
So I would absolutely love to see cooperation friends or whatever it is.

777
00:46:22,638 --> 00:46:23,198
Yeah, for sure.

778
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:27,460
It's great you say that because a bunch of friends of mine are working on a bunch of

779
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:28,581
similar co-op games.

780
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:28,861
Yes.

781
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:31,762
And I floated to them a similar kind of compendium idea.

782
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:36,585
And a lot of us have a couple irons in the fire, very few of us have released games before,

783
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:42,627
so it's pretty difficult to, as much as everyone loves the idea, to commit to giving up your

784
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:46,589
potential to one quarter or one fraction of a potential.

785
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:50,891
So when you guys were putting this together, it's gone organically, but where was that

786
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:52,592
moment where everybody kind of got...

787
00:46:53,232 --> 00:46:56,734
the full sort of like, OK, this is the way this will take,

788
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,355
rather than me continuing to develop and releasing on my own.

789
00:46:59,895 --> 00:47:01,136
Was it a difficult conversation?

790
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:01,556
No.

791
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:06,118
And almost the opposite, where me and Ramiro had no idea.

792
00:47:06,158 --> 00:47:07,279
We were just like, we're never going

793
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:08,219
to be able to sell our games.

794
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:09,420
It's going to be impossible.

795
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,920
Hooker requires four controllers.

796
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,841
You can't sell that.

797
00:47:12,581 --> 00:47:14,502
So for us, it was more like, uh.

798
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:20,428
Even convincing ourselves that we could sell it in the first place.

799
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:27,195
I'm trying to think of what else I would say.

800
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:34,703
I think it helped a lot that all four of us had showed our games at festivals.

801
00:47:35,164 --> 00:47:39,006
And so, like, you mentioned, you know, being somewhat more of an unknown.

802
00:47:39,246 --> 00:47:40,827
And that gets to my point where this took time.

803
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:43,008
It wasn't like we had our games and then just did it overnight.

804
00:47:43,649 --> 00:47:47,391
We were lucky enough to get our games into smaller, large festivals.

805
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:52,414
And so to someone, for example, making co-op or friends or whatever, like, if those individual

806
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:57,237
games can speak for themselves at whatever local or global events, I think that's the

807
00:47:57,277 --> 00:47:59,158
kind of sign, OK, we're onto something.

808
00:47:59,438 --> 00:48:00,979
This is worth pursuing further.

809
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,100
So that's, I think, maybe.

810
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,923
And also, there was maybe some amount of equitable attention

811
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:07,984
on the four games.

812
00:48:08,044 --> 00:48:10,846
All four of them had kind of made it to cool festivals.

813
00:48:10,886 --> 00:48:13,948
So we didn't feel like necessarily one of the games

814
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:16,050
was way less popular than the other three,

815
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,671
and that wasn't fair to the four of us.

816
00:48:18,112 --> 00:48:20,874
It was also, and I guess that's also what I mean

817
00:48:20,894 --> 00:48:22,255
by don't force collaborations.

818
00:48:22,755 --> 00:48:25,557
We found four people who were kind of in the same place

819
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:26,297
in their career.

820
00:48:27,118 --> 00:48:30,300
and that made it feel really fair to split the profits equally.

821
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:34,883
And you said that you don't think you could have released The Origin of Chess on its own.

822
00:48:34,983 --> 00:48:35,203
No.

823
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:39,346
So it seems like you found that right balance almost by happenstance with the four of you.

824
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:43,028
You all believed in your projects, but also believed you couldn't sell them on their own.

825
00:48:43,308 --> 00:48:46,890
Yeah, but I think that's a special case.

826
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,572
I think even if you believed you could sell your, let's just say, cooperative game...

827
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:55,630
over cooked, like whatever, undercooked. I don't know.

828
00:48:56,191 --> 00:49:00,615
You maybe could sell it on your own. I still think there's something to be said to momentum scale.

829
00:49:00,835 --> 00:49:06,580
And that, like, unless your game is as right time right place is overcooked I...

830
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:11,783
there's probably some other conceptual addition there that you would

831
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,504
have to work out. So not just like,

832
00:49:13,544 --> 00:49:16,105
yep, we made four co-op games, I guess you can

833
00:49:16,145 --> 00:49:17,826
get them, and like what is, there's like some

834
00:49:17,886 --> 00:49:22,928
other special spice, like whether that's all games for romantic

835
00:49:24,389 --> 00:49:27,570
pairs, right. Like that's suddenly like a more coherent.

836
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:34,695
So, you know, all weird 3D, some aesthetic style that binds things together.

837
00:49:34,715 --> 00:49:41,180
So I don't know, but I think all four people have to kind of sniff out that, like, the

838
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,643
momentum we can generate together is going to outweigh my game just being lost in the

839
00:49:46,243 --> 00:49:49,886
bajillion games that are released on Steam every single minute or whatever.

840
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,067
Next.

841
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:53,047
Yeah.

842
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:55,008
We have one more question.

843
00:49:55,428 --> 00:49:55,528
Hey.

844
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:57,269
Just a historical question.

845
00:49:57,669 --> 00:50:00,190
Like, were any of the Sports Friends

846
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,090
sold separately at any point, like in their lifetimes,

847
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,551
either before or after the game?

848
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:07,632
And two, did the release of Sports Friends

849
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,732
end their festival circuits?

850
00:50:10,153 --> 00:50:12,953
Like, was that kind of the cap on showing them publicly?

851
00:50:14,254 --> 00:50:15,034
Great questions.

852
00:50:18,594 --> 00:50:23,098
The games were never sold, but it's a little bit more complicated than that.

853
00:50:23,138 --> 00:50:30,285
So JS Joust was part, in 2011, of a Kickstarter reward for Brandon Boyer's Venus Patrol Kickstarter,

854
00:50:30,305 --> 00:50:33,668
which actually ended up working pretty well because it was like a little bit of guerrilla

855
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:34,128
marketing.

856
00:50:34,148 --> 00:50:38,933
There was this like crew, this select crew of people, enthusiasts who had funded Brandon's

857
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:41,856
Kickstarter, who then got the build of JS Joust.

858
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:42,777
So there was...

859
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:50,741
Some of these games were leaking out into indie circles, which I think helped start

860
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:51,101
that buzz.

861
00:50:51,121 --> 00:50:56,003
So it was kind of like an organic lifting-off process.

862
00:50:56,043 --> 00:50:58,004
But no, we weren't selling them.

863
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:04,207
Bennett's game, the original version of Pole Riders, which is a little different than Super

864
00:51:04,247 --> 00:51:07,748
Pole Riders, was available in Flash free on his website.

865
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:13,431
So that, again, is this kind of leaking out into the world.

866
00:51:13,451 --> 00:51:18,373
But again, Super Pole Riders totally changes the graphics, adds four players, and makes

867
00:51:18,413 --> 00:51:19,613
the game quite different.

868
00:51:21,134 --> 00:51:24,696
The second question is, so you're saying when we were funding on Kickstarter or when we

869
00:51:24,736 --> 00:51:25,436
released the game?

870
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:32,131
OK, so the question is, do we still show at festivals

871
00:51:32,191 --> 00:51:33,112
now we've released the game?

872
00:51:35,373 --> 00:51:36,113
Kind of.

873
00:51:36,453 --> 00:51:38,294
JS Joust will still appear.

874
00:51:39,494 --> 00:51:42,636
For example, at MagFest in DC, they show it every winter.

875
00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:45,016
I try to go when I can to run it.

876
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:48,718
I've heard of some of these other games being played.

877
00:51:48,758 --> 00:51:49,818
Like, not in the same way.

878
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:52,099
And we're not paying, for example, for a PAX booth

879
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:52,500
anymore.

880
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,421
If we were to do Sports Friends the platform, I think we probably actually still could be running

881
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:05,283
like Barabari ball tournaments at a booth at PAX along with whatever the new Sports Friends game is of the year.

882
00:52:05,303 --> 00:52:11,544
So I think if we were to do that platform, we could keep digging back into our back catalog

883
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:16,145
in interesting ways in concert with the new games, I think in a very productive relationship.

884
00:52:17,165 --> 00:52:21,486
But all four of us have day jobs that I think we like, so that's...

885
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:26,189
That's why it hasn't happened, but I do think we could have done something like that.

886
00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:33,293
In that case, we would be still going to PAX every year to show both the new games and

887
00:52:33,313 --> 00:52:33,773
the old games.

888
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:39,316
It's not a specific question, but I was wondering if you could talk more towards this idea of

889
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:43,358
using the compendium to boost more marginalized voices?

890
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:43,859
Yeah.

891
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,401
Because it's incredibly interesting and I think sort of necessary.

892
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:48,821
Right.

893
00:52:48,841 --> 00:52:50,963
Do you have anything more to say on that?

894
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:57,290
of a leading question. Thank you. Yeah, no, I'm not sure how much there is to say, but

895
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:03,216
there's definitely, for example, I live in Melbourne and there's a crew of us who are

896
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:07,181
interested in exploring some of these ideas. So what does it mean to get a whole local

897
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:10,605
community making games together? And I think there's something powerful.

898
00:53:11,926 --> 00:53:13,787
In fact, I was just answering another question.

899
00:53:13,827 --> 00:53:15,407
In the case of Sports Friends, all four of us

900
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:18,528
were in a similar stage in our professional careers.

901
00:53:18,968 --> 00:53:20,969
But I think you could also do it some way where

902
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:25,070
you were mixing old experienced voices with less experienced

903
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,871
voices, whether that was on different games

904
00:53:27,911 --> 00:53:30,052
or potentially working together on the same game.

905
00:53:30,112 --> 00:53:32,033
So that kind of knowledge transferred,

906
00:53:32,533 --> 00:53:34,033
social capital transfers.

907
00:53:35,515 --> 00:53:37,277
I think there are totally different ways to do it.

908
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:42,463
And that could be everything from a community art project

909
00:53:42,823 --> 00:53:48,970
to a really commercially focused title that's funded by an indie publisher or whatever.

910
00:53:50,622 --> 00:53:57,387
But it's something I personally am looking to continue working on in the future when I'm kind of done with my current projects.

911
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:03,252
What is that next version of Sports Friends that's appropriate for 2019 or 20 or whatever the year it is?

912
00:54:06,314 --> 00:54:09,675
Unlike Sports Friends, how can we bring in more people in interesting ways?

913
00:54:09,715 --> 00:54:13,196
So put people on PS4 who have never been on PS4 before.

914
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:16,097
Get an artist who's never, you know, worked on a video game before.

915
00:54:16,158 --> 00:54:19,259
And I think there's something also about the compendium structure, too,

916
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:21,699
where it's easy to slot in heterogeneously.

917
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,442
different minigames of different visual styles.

918
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,425
So that, like, the structure itself of the compendium

919
00:54:30,665 --> 00:54:34,788
or the metagame or the party game is kind of naturally,

920
00:54:34,848 --> 00:54:40,071
I feel like, is a kind of plurality of heterogeneous voices in and of itself.

921
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:42,953
So I think it almost naturally lends itself to that kind of...

922
00:54:43,474 --> 00:54:45,096
political art project.

923
00:54:45,476 --> 00:54:48,660
So fingers crossed that we'll see more of this,

924
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,302
whether that's from me or somebody else.

925
00:54:50,382 --> 00:54:52,624
But yeah, for sure, this still remains

926
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:54,606
one of my main interests, which is

927
00:54:54,766 --> 00:54:56,849
why I'm talking about it so many years later.

928
00:54:56,869 --> 00:55:00,813
I think we're wrapping up.

929
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:02,134
But thank you, everyone, for attending.

930
00:55:02,154 --> 00:55:04,377
I'll be out in the hall if you want to talk more.

931
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:05,038
Thank you.
