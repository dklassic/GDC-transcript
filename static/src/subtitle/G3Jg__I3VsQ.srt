00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,401
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:11,162
Thank you for joining us for the Raid on Ryze panel.

3
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:14,023
We're going to be going over a little bit about the process

4
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:18,044
and the challenges we faced when creating the narrative for Ryze

5
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:18,945
of the Tomb Raider.

6
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,066
Before I begin, this is critically important.

7
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:23,087
We're going to be talking frankly and openly

8
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:24,027
about the story.

9
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:25,407
There will be spoilers.

10
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:27,788
We will say elements about the ending.

11
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,269
And I am deadly serious.

12
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:30,389
We are going to spoil this game.

13
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:34,338
So before we begin, let me introduce our panel real quick.

14
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:37,240
We have Noah Hughes, who is our creative director.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,301
Rhianna Pratchett, our lead writer.

16
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:42,104
John Stafford, our lead narrative designer.

17
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:44,465
We have Tor, who is our performance director.

18
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:46,867
That's his real name, I swear.

19
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,989
And Jeff Adams, who's our lead story designer.

20
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,090
And I'm Cameron Sui, I'm a narrative designer.

21
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:53,332
lead story artist.

22
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:54,673
Cameron Sui, I'm a narrative designer,

23
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:55,813
and I drew the short straw,

24
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:57,594
so I'll be moderating the panel today.

25
00:00:57,594 --> 00:00:59,696
Now we come from a diverse background of games,

26
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:02,958
some of the samples of our past history are up there,

27
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,199
but we've all come together for this game.

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,480
Now this talk, we're gonna talk about

29
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,342
how we go about creating stories at Crystal Dynamics,

30
00:01:10,342 --> 00:01:12,403
how we work across disciplines.

31
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:14,004
Now this team up here is the

32
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:18,166
the main narrative team that is in charge and responsible for

33
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,707
the implementation of the story but

34
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:23,769
the real story is created by everybody across the entire studio in every

35
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,209
department

36
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:26,270
uh... now a quick note

37
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,192
we sort of look at this as a uh... a raid in an MMO fashion we all come from

38
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,192
very diverse backgrounds we have very

39
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,894
diverse skills and we really learned to trust each other's strengths in this

40
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:35,874
process

41
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:38,635
and so we each had unique roles and we're going to be talking a little bit about that

42
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:39,876
as we go through our process

43
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,835
Now we're going to talk a little bit how we get from this,

44
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:46,275
the very beginning of our first ideas on the page

45
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:47,796
and our first beginnings of sketching out

46
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:51,136
the rough framework of a story, to this.

47
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:54,897
My dearest Lara, I often think about a shame

48
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:58,818
I have brought upon our family's name.

49
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:03,519
Croft, what does it even mean?

50
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:12,617
When I was young, he was just my father and I.

51
00:02:12,617 --> 00:02:18,779
In his last years, he was obsessed with myths about immortality.

52
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:23,740
I may have found the next piece to the puzzle, but they're following me.

53
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,641
I know them by name now.

54
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:32,682
Trinity. Of course, no one believed him,

55
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:35,783
including me.

56
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:35,943
OK.

57
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,886
We're going to cover very briefly the Crystal Dynamics

58
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:40,706
story pillars.

59
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:43,248
These are the underpinning philosophies and ideas that we

60
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:45,749
use when creating any narrative at our studio.

61
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,112
Then we're going to talk a little bit about what we

62
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:51,533
learned from the prior Tomb Raider game in 2013, which

63
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,755
Rihanna, John, and Noah are veterans of.

64
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:55,936
Tor, Jeff, and myself are new to the party.

65
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:58,157
And then finally, we're going to talk a little bit

66
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,078
about our process and the eight steps

67
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:03,240
that we go from starting our very earliest discussions

68
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,001
of themes to the very final finished product.

69
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,823
We're going to walk you through using examples

70
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:10,184
and illustrate how this works.

71
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:12,685
And hopefully, you'll be able to take some of our process

72
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,806
or some of our takeaways and create

73
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:16,887
your own unique and fulfilling narratives.

74
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:21,234
Now, Crystal Dynamics uses a high-level framework

75
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,474
when approaching a narrative,

76
00:03:22,474 --> 00:03:24,435
and we're gonna call them the story pillars.

77
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:26,795
We're gonna discuss the four key ones right now.

78
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:28,996
And we develop all stories for games

79
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:30,857
at our studio using these as a guide.

80
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:32,057
I'm gonna turn it over to Noah here,

81
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:34,138
who's gonna talk a little bit about our story pillars.

82
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:35,709
Thanks, Kim.

83
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,073
The first thing to note is we do apply a three-act structure.

84
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:43,155
So it ends up being a very long act two in the middle.

85
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:45,437
But those transitions from act one to act two

86
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,619
and from act two to act three are what you'd

87
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,420
expect from that structure.

88
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,782
But beyond that, to put our characters at the center,

89
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:54,084
we sort of commit to the idea of the character arc

90
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:55,605
being the backbone of that story.

91
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,647
So we'll take our point of view character, in this case, Lara,

92
00:03:57,647 --> 00:03:58,588
and we'll put her in the middle of the story.

93
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:01,768
and make sure that she's different at the end of the story

94
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:02,909
than at the beginning of the story.

95
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,749
And she has an internal conflict

96
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:07,270
which forces her to ultimately change

97
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,890
in order to be successful.

98
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,450
And that's, of course, in addition to an external conflict.

99
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,111
So we have basically this transition of a character

100
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,711
that comes to a head in the climax

101
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:18,072
where both these external and internal conflicts

102
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:18,432
get resolved.

103
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:21,593
So that's just a sense of how we place our characters

104
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:22,973
at the center of our story structure.

105
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,807
Hi everybody, can you hear me, or do I need to get closer?

106
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,468
I'm always worried no one can hear me in the back.

107
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:29,848
I'm John.

108
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:34,711
So we have a very collaborative approach at Crystal Dynamics.

109
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:37,473
For us, it's really important that the entire team

110
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:39,594
is involved in the story, everyone across the team.

111
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:41,095
So everyone participates.

112
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:44,637
We recognize that good ideas can come from anywhere,

113
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:46,838
so we're always looking out for the good ideas.

114
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:50,240
because that might lead to something great in your game.

115
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
So you need to include your team.

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,962
Everybody is involved in story at Crystal.

117
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:56,383
So that's how we approach story.

118
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,204
Just a note also, we don't subscribe to this idea

119
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:00,164
of a genius in a box.

120
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:01,725
Like no one, we don't send a writer

121
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:04,306
or a story person off to the mountain

122
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,807
to chisel the tablets and come down

123
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:06,947
and deliver story to the team.

124
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:09,769
It's not that we don't have vision,

125
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,129
we just have a collaborative vision

126
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,230
in the way we approach story.

127
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,550
So that's important to us.

128
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:20,739
We also strive for relatable human heroes in a grounded world.

129
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:27,463
So this in particular was important with the 2013 reboot because one of our goals was to take Lara Croft,

130
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:30,324
who had become almost an icon more than a person,

131
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:34,467
and really start to peel back those layers and understand who she was as a character.

132
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,629
So we take that philosophy into each of our stories in saying,

133
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,430
what would it really be like to be thrust into this situation?

134
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:47,876
And we try to put that position of Lara being closer to you or I and going on that journey like her.

135
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:52,780
Similarly, we include a lot of maybe supernatural and over-the-top elements,

136
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,124
but we try to do that in a way that makes you believe that they could be real.

137
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,907
So in a lot of cases, that means a ramp of the supernatural.

138
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:04,690
And before we ever reveal that big reveal, we're going to try to get you there.

139
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,752
We're going to try to make you believe that this really could be possible

140
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,574
somewhere in the darkest corners of the world.

141
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:09,694
So...

142
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:16,368
Basically, taking those human heroes and thrusting them into this grounded experience for us

143
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:17,450
makes it more relatable.

144
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:25,930
So, feeding back into that idea of collaboration, we consider the world a character in our games.

145
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:33,235
When we approach building levels, when we approach sound and music and the stuff that you find in the environment and the artifice,

146
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:40,901
everything, we think about that as a deep character. It's layered, it has roots, and we want it to speak to the main narrative that we're trying to tell.

147
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,663
So everything we do in the game, in the game world,

148
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:46,765
is kind of supporting our main narrative.

149
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:47,686
So that's a big pillar for us.

150
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,868
We're always concentrating on making the world

151
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:50,808
tell the story.

152
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:51,008
Yeah, hi.

153
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:51,169
I'm Thor.

154
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,833
I'm the, probably the latest member of the narrative team.

155
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:02,057
And I was coming into Crystal at the busiest time

156
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:04,298
of the project when kind of pants on fire.

157
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,280
Everybody was just running around

158
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,861
trying to make things work.

159
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,083
And yeah, I guess you could say the raid was kind of,

160
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:15,139
at a challenged place.

161
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,102
And I came from a very different background from a sister studio in Copenhagen doing the

162
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:19,742
Hitman games.

163
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:22,785
And the way that Crystal did it was kind of different.

164
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:24,746
It was a very ambitious narrative team.

165
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:29,950
And I mean, up front and center was the cinematic story, like the one hour of...

166
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:35,878
of cinematics where every second counts, and around that was the whole kind of supporting

167
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:41,960
narrative of the, like John was talking about, the world as a character, like the layers

168
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,441
of history in the world, all the secondary characters, all the documents and everything,

169
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:50,762
this kind of rich tapestry of stories that all needed to be put in the right place at

170
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,942
the right time and fit in with the main narrative.

171
00:07:53,702 --> 00:08:04,687
But the big front and center, having a main character like Lara, where literally everything that goes on in the story is revolving around her and her as a personality.

172
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:11,290
Every piece of story is an opportunity to build up her as a character and give her more depth.

173
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:20,475
So that was a really big challenge coming into and also seeing how the narrative team was structured in a way to kind of support a character like that.

174
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:24,828
We were very lucky to have Tor join us, our pants absolutely were on fire.

175
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:29,190
And he was a cold bucket of water to dip them in.

176
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,532
So we're going to talk a little bit about Tomb Raider 13.

177
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:35,253
Rihanna, would you like to talk about what we learned from 2013?

178
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:40,596
Hi, I'm Rihanna, I'm the lead writer on Rise and I was the lead writer on the previous game as well.

179
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:48,019
I have spent about five years with John and Noah and these guys being my polygamous work husbands.

180
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:54,722
And we always consider our story to be a work in progress.

181
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:56,783
And we try and do better with every iteration.

182
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:59,664
And believe me, there are a lot of iterations.

183
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,865
I think there's one scene that got 47 rewrites.

184
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,206
I am not even kidding.

185
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:07,908
And we listen to our players and our postmortems and our...

186
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,427
testing feedback for the first game,

187
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:14,149
and we decided to try and make some improvements

188
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,230
to the narrative moving on to Rise.

189
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,013
So I'm just gonna talk to you a little bit about those.

190
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:21,955
So the first one was,

191
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:25,044
Bring back the tombs?

192
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:25,424
Oh, yeah.

193
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:26,085
Oh, it is, yeah.

194
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:26,905
Couldn't see it.

195
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:33,447
So, bringing back the tombs, and that was one of the big feedbacks from the first game

196
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,628
that people wanted to see more tombs.

197
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:38,949
And one of the reasons we didn't have too many tombs in it was because she was on the

198
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:39,850
road to being a tomb raider.

199
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,870
She wasn't a tomb raider yet.

200
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:47,172
And so that meant that the raiding she did was more kind of accidental.

201
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:47,212
So...

202
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:50,198
This time it was more purposeful tomb raiding,

203
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:52,679
but it's actually more than just mechanics

204
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,059
and more than just level design.

205
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,620
It's about her character as well,

206
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,081
and the fact that she is,

207
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:00,742
she glimpsed something in the first game,

208
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:02,463
which really sort of propels her onwards

209
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,143
into the second game,

210
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:06,504
and makes it much more deliberate tomb raiding,

211
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:07,884
because she's after information,

212
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:08,825
she's after answers.

213
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:14,562
So we wanted the next chapter to really respect what had come before,

214
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:18,243
but at the same time we couldn't be too beholden to everything in the first story

215
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:22,465
because we didn't want to alienate players that maybe hadn't played the first game

216
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:24,705
or had completely forgotten what we did

217
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:27,686
because they'd skipped cut scenes and made writers cry everywhere.

218
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,724
So Rise was very much a continuation

219
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,746
of Lara's arc, which started in the first game.

220
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,609
So one of the other things we wanted to address

221
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:39,571
is that we had far too many characters, really,

222
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:40,392
in the first game.

223
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:43,315
And we really wanted to have fewer characters in this one,

224
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:45,357
so we could realize them better.

225
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:49,858
So we pared down our cast quite a lot.

226
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,399
And we have a very limited cinematic canvas.

227
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,759
We have about 60 minutes of cinematics in the game

228
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,439
and that's the same for the first one as well.

229
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,520
So that's not really a lot of space

230
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,360
when you consider it's like half a movie,

231
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,381
two thirds of a movie to kind of

232
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,741
showcase all your characters.

233
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:07,801
So we had fewer characters

234
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,862
and we tried to make them more meaningful

235
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:11,522
in the world and in Lara's story.

236
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:22,316
One of the big things we wanted to do was make the player's actions match the character's intentions

237
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:29,418
and balancing that level between player character and player is always really, really difficult in games.

238
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:34,340
So we wanted to up the player, Lara and player synchronicity in other words.

239
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,322
So we gave Lara more agency in her path and a laser focus.

240
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:42,623
So in the first game she's very reactive to things that are happening to her.

241
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:44,925
In Rise, she's proactive.

242
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:45,525
She's kind of out there.

243
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:46,825
She's going after the adventure.

244
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:49,626
She's making a choice.

245
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,647
And as part of that choice, yet again,

246
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:52,827
she has to kill to survive.

247
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:57,028
And we've always tried to embrace that style of gameplay

248
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:59,609
a little bit in her character.

249
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,764
This time around we have to kind of up the level of nastiness in the enemies.

250
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:09,066
They're up to no good, they're going to kill her.

251
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:14,230
She's very much in a mode, very focused on what she's doing,

252
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:21,155
and she's much more able to meet fire with fire than she was in the first game.

253
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:23,397
So, yeah, making the enemies more violent,

254
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:28,461
making her not killing innocents and giving her a bit of a moral compass

255
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:29,782
really helped with that sort of...

256
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:31,473
player synchronicity.

257
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:35,916
So using those learnings from 2013's Tomb Raider as well as our Crystal Dynamics story

258
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:42,439
pillars, I want to talk a little bit about our process and sort of eight basic steps.

259
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:46,321
Hopefully you'll see how those story pillars and those learnings that we attempted to bring

260
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:51,243
into Rise of the Tomb Raider really informed our decision making throughout the whole process.

261
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:53,564
So Noah, what is the very beginning of our process?

262
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:58,480
Yeah, it starts with some high concept discussion.

263
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,264
So we know we want to tell the next chapter in Lara's story.

264
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:04,329
One of the techniques we use to sort of build

265
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,492
that foundation for Lara, especially

266
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,836
her internal conflict and her journey as a character.

267
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:11,479
is this controlling idea.

268
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:14,543
So what that does is suggest that there's a key value

269
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,668
at stake and some action is going to change that value.

270
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:21,191
In particular, to give our example,

271
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:24,054
we made the statement, we become who we are meant to be

272
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,037
when we let go of who we are supposed to be.

273
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:35,479
So this is not only thematic, but it defines the actions that Lara takes, and ultimately the result of that is the forging of her identity.

274
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:42,360
So identity is what's at stake in this story, and Lara comes into it with this notion that she is a discoverer,

275
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,681
that she is going to find something great and bring it back to the world, and that is going to make the world a better place.

276
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:52,442
But over the course of the story, she has to confront what her actions will result in,

277
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:54,842
and ultimately through doing that will...

278
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:59,103
to redefine her relationship with these ancient secrets

279
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,124
that she's pursuing.

280
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:04,244
This is also a theme that runs through other facets

281
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:04,745
of the game.

282
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,525
So in a lot of ways, the story becomes

283
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:10,246
sort of a debate over this facet of the human condition,

284
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:14,627
that should you fulfill your destiny as you believed it was,

285
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:18,008
or should you let go of that and sort of jump and become

286
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:19,288
that new person?

287
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,209
And that's something that we see not only in Lara,

288
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:24,350
but our additional characters, the remnants.

289
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,512
who are defined as protectors of this secret.

290
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:28,453
And by the end of that,

291
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:30,394
they have to change their relationship,

292
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,056
and ultimately in doing so,

293
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,757
sort of move forward as a people.

294
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:36,599
So this is a theme that helps guide us through,

295
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,161
even as we go through many iterations,

296
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:39,342
which we'll talk about,

297
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:42,064
we sort of have this notion of what our story is,

298
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:42,864
is really about.

299
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:49,527
Yeah, and with that, we can start doing research on the plot.

300
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,070
And in our case, it's the myth.

301
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,212
What is Lara going after?

302
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:55,253
We know what kind of drives her.

303
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:56,695
We know the kind of debate she's going

304
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,916
to have in her character arc.

305
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,619
So we were looking at myths that had

306
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,322
you know, danger as well as benefit to humanity.

307
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,663
So that choice that she makes,

308
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:08,843
there's a bit of a gray area there.

309
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:10,124
It's kind of like the atom, you know,

310
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:11,865
that you can make an atom bomb

311
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:13,185
or you can create limitless energy.

312
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:15,466
This idea that, you know, what she's going after

313
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:17,407
will cause a debate for her.

314
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:20,348
And since she kind of encountered an immortality myth

315
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:21,188
in the first game,

316
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,509
like this kind of crazy soul-sucking Japanese queen,

317
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,312
We assumed that she's going to be interested in that idea of immortality.

318
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:29,333
So we started looking at immortality myths.

319
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,275
These are some of the ones we kind of discarded out of hand.

320
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,776
Not out of hand, we did some research.

321
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:37,579
But, you know, there was Noah's Ark and Fountain of Youth and Garden of Eden.

322
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:40,281
For various reasons, these didn't really work for us.

323
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:43,763
So we landed on two myths that we kind of mashed together.

324
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:48,726
The city, Velocity of Kitezh, which is sort of unknown in popular culture,

325
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:49,867
at least in the West.

326
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,748
We had this guy on the team from Russia who was like, oh,

327
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:53,249
my grandmother used to tell me this story.

328
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:59,031
So it's quite popular in the East, but it's basically this Atlantis of the East,

329
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:01,152
this city that sinks into a lake and disappears.

330
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:04,212
And it was a great setting for us because we could build tombs out of this.

331
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:06,893
It has connections to history.

332
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:12,154
And the other myth that was important for us was this myth of Koschei the Deathless,

333
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:12,234
who

334
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:18,500
was another obscure Russian myth, maybe not so obscure to some people, but this myth is

335
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,925
about a man who takes his soul, puts it in an object, and attains immortality.

336
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:26,629
And so that gave us a nice MacGuffin for Lara to go after, what is this object?

337
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:30,973
But also gave us another interesting character, and we actually didn't use Kostya, the actual

338
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,296
name, we just based our character Jacob on him.

339
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,477
This idea that Jacob has something to lose as well,

340
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:39,198
something that he has to debate in his arc.

341
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,660
So by the end, when he gives up his immortality,

342
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,381
he becomes who he's meant to be, which is dead.

343
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,181
And the immortality myths also gave us a nice lens to look at

344
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:53,722
Laura's relationship with her father.

345
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:54,662
Absolutely.

346
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:55,042
Yes.

347
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:55,362
Yes.

348
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:58,804
Forgot about that note, but yes, so we, we basically mirrored that on her father

349
00:16:58,804 --> 00:17:02,426
as well, because that's a primary motivator for Laura and she's, she's not

350
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:06,288
only trying to find this, this, this ancient secret and prove it to the world.

351
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:08,949
She's also kind of trying to live up to her father.

352
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,989
So.

353
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,894
So after we'd sort of established the high concept,

354
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:17,115
it was time to sort of move on to the treatment.

355
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:21,318
And our treatments are similar to what you might find

356
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:22,138
in a movie treatment.

357
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:24,800
They're sort of halfway between a traditional movie treatment

358
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,342
and something that's very game specific.

359
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:31,104
So the treatment was about nailing down the broad strokes,

360
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:34,307
Lara's arc, looking at all the characters.

361
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:36,088
We spent a lot of time focusing on the characters

362
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,569
and their wants and their needs,

363
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:39,050
which are often different things,

364
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,590
and how does the...

365
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:46,834
The gameplay and the story clash with those wants and needs and how they tie into everyone else.

366
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:51,376
And so we were sort of putting that together with the broad strokes, with the arc.

367
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:56,958
And that was largely myself and John and Noah and some special guests from Square and XHQ,

368
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,940
just really sitting in a room kind of hashing everything out.

369
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,197
and then kind of me just sitting and pulling everything together into a document,

370
00:18:05,197 --> 00:18:08,158
which helped guide the first part of the production process.

371
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:10,399
And from that we could sort of start putting together a skeleton.

372
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,416
of the script, sorry.

373
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:25,640
And from those, I could do more of an outline.

374
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,083
And as I say, we looked at the characters first and foremost.

375
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,965
And because we had fewer characters to deal with,

376
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,826
we could make them count.

377
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:34,548
We could spend a lot of time focusing

378
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,850
on how their particular journeys intersected

379
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,171
and how they affected one another.

380
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:43,796
So, you know, I went back and I looked over all the documents that we had done at the time

381
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:49,441
because you produce so much and you iterate so much, it's very difficult to remember where you came from.

382
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:55,926
But a lot of our ideas that we were doing at this stage made it through to the end game in some form.

383
00:18:55,926 --> 00:19:01,671
But one of the ones I missed in particular was when we blew up UCL's archaeology department.

384
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,656
which terrified and excited me in equal measure.

385
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,018
And that was in the script for a while,

386
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:07,661
but that was kind of one of the ones

387
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:09,063
I sort of missed a little bit, to be honest.

388
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:17,889
Okay, so once we have a treatment and we've got our bedrock of controlling idea, we go

389
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:22,110
into what we call our metascripting phase, and that's what we call it. I don't know if

390
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:28,291
we can coin that term, but we do a lot of exercises to start bringing the story to a

391
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:33,772
state where we can start making a game. And the first thing we do is we create a giant

392
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:38,093
Word document, which is sort of a description of every cinematic scene and...

393
00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:43,017
all descriptions of gameplay in just one sort of written document from top to bottom.

394
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:43,878
And it's about 100 pages.

395
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:48,902
This is kind of the first place that narrative and gameplay kind of shake hands.

396
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,824
They have a stake in this.

397
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:54,987
I'm working with our narrative leads, or our game design leads,

398
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:58,050
and we basically put together a high-level skeleton of,

399
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,573
yeah, this is the story from beginning to end, how it interfaces with gameplay.

400
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:05,537
We can start looking at pacing, start looking at how much time we're talking about between scenes.

401
00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:10,682
It's great to plan things out, but then you should also plan for it to change, because it's going to change.

402
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:15,086
And then, from the Metascript, we start creating beat documents, and these are...

403
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:21,972
they can be considered your standard level design documents, but for us what's important is

404
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,074
these are written experientially, so...

405
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:28,317
to help the team imagine and visualize the experience

406
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:32,179
so that they can be inspired to build and inspired to create.

407
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,000
So these aren't, they're kind of blueprints,

408
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,101
but they're also inspiration pieces for the team.

409
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,863
We give them to a large group of team responsible

410
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,644
for bringing the levels to life.

411
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:43,425
And we expect these to come back to us as leads

412
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,967
or as a narrative team with changes or ideas

413
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,668
because like I said, the entire team is involved

414
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,909
in the story and we want them to do that.

415
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:53,311
So this is a guide for them to be creative

416
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:54,771
and to be, to engage in the story.

417
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:59,079
And as you mentioned, this is the first time that the story and game player put side by side,

418
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,840
and they really are never decoupled after that.

419
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,282
We always look at them as a holistic experience in concert.

420
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:11,427
So another exercise for us is, we take all the major character arcs and plot threads

421
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:14,689
and break them down into their component parts and hashtag them.

422
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,010
and throw them up on a board.

423
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,651
We usually start with just a Post-it board,

424
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:20,911
and then it goes digital so the team

425
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:22,032
can access it on the network.

426
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,453
But this allows us to track everything

427
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:26,433
that's happening in the story.

428
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:29,654
And this is both a proactive and reactive exercise.

429
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:31,755
And when we do it initially, it's

430
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:33,276
liable to change along the process,

431
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:35,176
and we update it as we go through.

432
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:37,297
But it's a tool for us to start looking at.

433
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:41,278
tension, emotional pacing, log jams of ideas.

434
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:42,939
We might see a scene has 10 hashtags,

435
00:21:42,939 --> 00:21:46,400
and we realize that's going to be a monster scene that

436
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,500
has to have a lot of this stuff.

437
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,542
And it's also a way to inform Rihanna, myself,

438
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,682
the people who are writing the scenes, what's happening.

439
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:59,344
As an example of how we use this to, I think, great effect.

440
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:05,691
For a while in our game, we were noticing on our board that the dad hashtag, which you saw in the last one,

441
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:14,602
the dad hashtag, because her dad is important to her, the arc of her mirroring her father is very much part of her motivation.

442
00:22:15,243 --> 00:22:19,645
And for about two hours, two, three hours in the beginning of the game, it was just gone.

443
00:22:19,645 --> 00:22:21,766
It wasn't anywhere. It wasn't in-game, it wasn't in any scenes.

444
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:25,507
She talked about him in that first scene, and then there was this gulf.

445
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:28,589
And people were... we were worried people were just going to lose that thread.

446
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:32,010
So we came up with this mechanic to bring in-game.

447
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,691
We called it our dictaphone mechanic.

448
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:35,432
The dictaphone is that thing there.

449
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:39,494
My dad had one. I don't know if you guys have any idea what this is, but it's a tape recorder.

450
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:41,095
Where you'd...

451
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:43,177
Raise your hand if you've used it.

452
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:43,217
No.

453
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,998
Anyways, she picks us up.

454
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:45,739
Lara's kind of a lutter.

455
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,600
You've maybe noticed she doesn't even have a phone.

456
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,421
We did that deliberately.

457
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:51,444
We don't give her a phone because that just opens a whole world of mechanics we don't

458
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:53,165
want to deal with, like Twitter.

459
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:58,389
We don't want her to tweet, ah, I found the tomb.

460
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:01,176
Maybe we'll do that, but I don't know.

461
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:03,397
So we kind of think of her as a Luddite.

462
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:04,217
She has this thing.

463
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,658
She's walking around the environment.

464
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:08,039
We hear dad talking from the past.

465
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,319
They're connected.

466
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,480
It's on the sticks.

467
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,280
It's in her inventory.

468
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,080
It's a mechanic.

469
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,181
So that uptick was great.

470
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:14,982
It was like, cool.

471
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:17,543
And we found that with our hashtag board.

472
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:19,724
We used that as like, oh, we need to put something here.

473
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:21,606
And it kind of got everyone thinking about,

474
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:22,608
like, what are the, you know,

475
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:23,950
instead of just having her say,

476
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,554
dad, in a cinematic, which she does,

477
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:27,596
we also have something in game.

478
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,499
And we actually probably used it too much.

479
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:30,480
At some point, the team was like,

480
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,902
she needs to shut up about dad.

481
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:33,845
Because it was like, dad, dad, dad, let's talk.

482
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:34,286
Yeah.

483
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,001
And then that leads us to the script.

484
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:43,983
So another purpose of the meta-script is to basically give me a road map going into the

485
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:45,124
first draft of the script.

486
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:49,266
So I write the script more or less like a movie script, so it's usually in chronological

487
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:52,367
order, which certainly isn't the case for all games, but it's always been for the Tomb

488
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:53,368
Raider ones.

489
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:58,290
So I get to see the pacing and the tone and the gameplay and how everything is folding

490
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,651
in together.

491
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:04,674
So that's when we really start getting the big beats down on paper, and it's really important

492
00:24:04,674 --> 00:24:04,994
to give...

493
00:24:05,831 --> 00:24:09,534
writer's time and space to do this because so many things are worked out on the page.

494
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:13,317
You can write all the explanations you like, but when you get into the scene and get your

495
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:17,441
hands dirty, then you start seeing what's working and what's not.

496
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:23,526
So another step in the process we did with Rise was get it tested out with our actors

497
00:24:23,526 --> 00:24:24,106
early on.

498
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:24,567
So we had...

499
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,753
We took the version of the script that we had down to LA and did a table read with our actors down there.

500
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:37,415
And that was really useful for seeing how everything sounded, getting feedback from the actors,

501
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:41,797
doing some edits on the fly as well, and in some cases we actually...

502
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:45,351
we mic'd up the actors and used their VO

503
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,892
as kind of test VO in the game

504
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:49,153
because it sounded a lot better

505
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:52,436
than getting the other people at our studio to do it.

506
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:53,316
So it was really useful.

507
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:55,258
And of course, getting feedback from the actors themselves

508
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:57,679
because we used Camilla again for Lara

509
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,842
and obviously she was very, much more in tune

510
00:25:00,842 --> 00:25:02,843
with the character this time around.

511
00:25:02,843 --> 00:25:04,884
She definitely had a Lara mode.

512
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:06,566
She was really great at giving us feedback

513
00:25:06,566 --> 00:25:08,647
on how she felt the character was developing.

514
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:20,726
And then as an added bonus, we can also record those table reads.

515
00:25:25,002 --> 00:25:27,704
Jeff, we found, was pretty invaluable in this process.

516
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:31,185
Jeff, you want to talk a little bit about how we kept the team appraised of all of our

517
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:31,765
changes?

518
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:32,325
Absolutely.

519
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:33,466
Can everyone hear me?

520
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:36,867
I think I got too close last time.

521
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:41,789
During this phase, while the story is developing, the standard practice was usually to send

522
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:43,670
out some emails to the team.

523
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,852
kind of keeping them abreast of what was changing in the story so everyone knew that.

524
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:52,694
But at this time it was important for us to also get that thing, get a graphical representation

525
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:57,216
of what we were building so far up so that the team would just see it on a day-to-day basis.

526
00:25:57,216 --> 00:26:01,838
And so we would create things like on the left we have a character board,

527
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:04,279
Lara being the center line and every branching character.

528
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,261
coming off of that line showing some form of relationship to her and their relationships to each other.

529
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:14,263
This was great to get the team talking about the characters that were the stars of this game.

530
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:18,465
And this would encourage a lot of feedback coming from the floor

531
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:22,526
and would allow us to be able to at any time have a conversation about how the story was progressing

532
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:23,866
and everyone was on the same page.

533
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:26,567
And we noticed when we put these up in high traffic areas,

534
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,528
we had people immediately coming over and asking us questions,

535
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:31,109
talking about the story and engaging with it.

536
00:26:31,405 --> 00:26:32,606
Absolutely, and as a matter of fact,

537
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:34,407
Tor even mentioned it on his first day,

538
00:26:34,407 --> 00:26:35,908
and you saw this board in the hallway.

539
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:38,410
Yeah, I was very excited coming into Crystal

540
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,971
for the first day, seeing this, and saying,

541
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,192
hey, these guys know what they're doing.

542
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:42,833
They have everything mapped out,

543
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:46,095
and then realizing that, yeah, it was there,

544
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:48,356
but it needed a lot of work to kind of fall into place.

545
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,253
It was actually fun to see this because you put these up on the floor and people are walking around.

546
00:26:52,253 --> 00:26:56,059
Next thing you know, they're getting their coffee and they're hanging around and they're talking about,

547
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:00,566
hey, I didn't know that and I'm going to go over and talk to these guys and tell them what I think.

548
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:03,391
Yeah, I mean, it's always about the strategy for getting your team involved.

549
00:27:04,726 --> 00:27:07,027
I hesitate to say that people don't like to read,

550
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,488
but when you've got chunks and chunks,

551
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:11,709
huge amounts of written text, there's

552
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:14,750
ways to get people involved that don't involve

553
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,691
handing them 100 pages of text.

554
00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:19,953
Some people on your team will absolutely engage with that.

555
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:22,154
But figuring out ways to engage with your team

556
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:25,255
and getting people involved, go for those shortcuts.

557
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:28,036
Find an artist and get things into pretty pictures,

558
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:28,957
and you're good to go.

559
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:30,317
And the more people got involved,

560
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,139
the more they were actually giving us feedback

561
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,600
and giving us great ideas that we probably never

562
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,421
would have come up with.

563
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,642
Yeah, and one thing also is that, real quick,

564
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:41,905
if we go back, the graph on the right

565
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:44,766
was pretty imperative to help illustrate.

566
00:27:45,892 --> 00:27:49,035
plot thread issues that people were having a hard time getting their head wrapped around.

567
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:52,799
So we found that if we would illustrate it and kind of break it down to its core pieces,

568
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,425
we could identify where things were working well and sometimes where things were kind

569
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,646
of getting mashed together.

570
00:27:58,646 --> 00:28:02,671
So it helped feed back into the writing team, their ability to be able to kind of streamline

571
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:03,492
the story.

572
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:04,012
Absolutely.

573
00:28:04,998 --> 00:28:07,561
Previously, John talked a little bit about the world as a character.

574
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,603
It's one of our major pillars.

575
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:11,645
Now, the main story obviously focuses on Lara.

576
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:13,668
But when we talk about the world as a character,

577
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:16,951
we often talk about something called supporting or secondary narrative.

578
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:18,973
This includes everything outside of Lara.

579
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:21,316
This is overheard enemy conversations.

580
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:23,538
This is collectible relics and documents.

581
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:25,641
This is the history and the layers in the game.

582
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:32,330
All of these support Lara's story, but they also flesh out the world and give us a variety of other lenses to look through.

583
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:38,738
We talk a lot about canvas for narrative, in the sense that everything in the game is a potential to tell some aspect of the story.

584
00:28:38,738 --> 00:28:42,283
Even an animation cycle tells something important about how that character is acting.

585
00:28:42,663 --> 00:28:47,586
SecondaryNative is a great place that we can sort of spread our wings and play in a little bit wider margin.

586
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:53,489
The main story obviously focuses on Lara, but when we talk about the world, we talk about first layers of history.

587
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:56,790
And this is something we do through a pretty exhaustive research process.

588
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,531
Once we had our initial myth of Katesh...

589
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:02,453
and we knew that we were focusing on Russian and Siberian history.

590
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:04,574
That allowed us to make what we call layers of history.

591
00:29:04,574 --> 00:29:08,055
Now, the first layer, obviously, is Lara and the current story with Trinity,

592
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:10,596
but just beneath that, about 50 years prior,

593
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:13,577
we have a Soviet Cold War era layer,

594
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:17,478
and then beneath that we have the layer of the Remnant living off the land.

595
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:19,759
Prior to that, there's the layer of the Mongol invasion

596
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,540
and the Golden Age of Kutaish before that.

597
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,664
And then even beneath that there's a layer of ancient history.

598
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:28,126
Now that ancient history doesn't so much support the main narratives

599
00:29:28,126 --> 00:29:32,171
if it gives Lara a chance to say and think smart things about archaeology,

600
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,253
which helps put another lens on her character.

601
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:36,836
Obviously the world is telling a story

602
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:39,839
and always we want to be aware of all the layers of history in every area.

603
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,303
From this amount of research we would create exhaustive documentation.

604
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:47,566
Sometimes we would create short stories from the point of view of certain characters

605
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:53,431
that would give a sense of a tone for that area of history that we wanted to explore.

606
00:29:53,431 --> 00:30:00,076
On the right there you'll see a fairly detailed history of the birth of our immortal prophet, Jacob.

607
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:03,159
Starting with exactly where he was born and what he did as a child.

608
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:05,881
Now none of this stuff actually made it into the game, but it...

609
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:09,183
It created a very solid bedrock of real research

610
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:11,024
that we could connect his life to,

611
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:13,465
gave us things to hook onto.

612
00:30:13,465 --> 00:30:15,746
We talk a lot about plausible Googleability

613
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:17,606
when we talk about using history, which

614
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:20,108
is that we want to include things that people can latch

615
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:22,308
onto, go right to the internet, and look up,

616
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:24,369
and at least there's a sense of veracity

617
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:26,350
that we have connected a real world thing

618
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,971
and then adapted it for a video game.

619
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:31,360
And the funny thing is, when we were working on the project,

620
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,621
we would try to Google certain things,

621
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:33,602
and we couldn't get an answer.

622
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:35,264
So we'd walk over to Cam, and we'd ask him,

623
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,987
and he would pretty much have the answer almost every time.

624
00:30:37,987 --> 00:30:40,229
So after a while, we're like, why Google it?

625
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:41,931
Just Cam it.

626
00:30:41,931 --> 00:30:44,434
Yeah, unfortunately, Jeff, I was just smiling and Googling

627
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:45,955
it under the desk.

628
00:30:45,955 --> 00:30:48,077
He types faster, and he could do it without looking.

629
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:48,278
I'm just like.

630
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:53,315
So obviously you may not be working on a project that is a historical fiction grounded archaeology

631
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:58,358
adventure, but it is important that you have a sense of internal consistency and logic

632
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,598
to your world.

633
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:03,400
And I think research is the place where we create that solid bedrock that we can all

634
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,921
go back to and make sure we're on solid ground.

635
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:11,384
Bringing these connections into context, this is an interesting story, is during the creation

636
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:14,606
of the game we knew that we wanted to have an enemy near the end of the game that we

637
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:19,369
had called internally the Deathless Ones, that were an immortal army that could not

638
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:20,189
be killed.

639
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:23,952
Now in my research I discovered that right around the time that we have our immortal

640
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:30,035
prophet leaving the city of Constantinople, there is also an elite imperial guard called

641
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:30,816
the Afanatoi.

642
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:35,379
that vanished from the historical record with the death of one emperor and the ascendancy

643
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:41,342
of the emperor Basil I. Interestingly, the word athanatoi in Greek literally means without

644
00:31:41,342 --> 00:31:45,745
death. So once I realized that we had a missing army with the exact same name as our army

645
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:49,688
that we were going to put in the game, it was obviously a no-brainer to combine those

646
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:53,490
two things. It gave us a historical record that we could base those characters on. The

647
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:58,073
real historical athanatoi were the sons of noble houses, so they were resplendent in

648
00:31:58,073 --> 00:31:59,694
very non-functional golden armor.

649
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:02,055
So we use that as a part of an aesthetic guide

650
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:04,057
in the creation of those characters.

651
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:07,138
Grounding that foundation in plausible Googleability,

652
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:09,740
being able to leave the game and look that up in the real world

653
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,381
was something we always strove towards.

654
00:32:12,745 --> 00:32:15,746
And now secondary narrative, I don't want to say that it just

655
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:17,467
explores the margins of the world.

656
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:18,907
We also can use secondary narrative

657
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:23,008
to really clearly focus back on Lara and where she is.

658
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,409
So we wanted to find a place where

659
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,389
there was sort of low engagement gameplay

660
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:32,211
that we could deliver a lot more of Lara's internal voice.

661
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:33,491
Marina, do you want to talk a little bit

662
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:35,252
about the campsite diaries and how we use those?

663
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:39,273
Yeah, I mean this is something that we carried over from the first game.

664
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:45,599
Lara can kind of sit down at a campsite and it would be a quieter, more thoughtful moment

665
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:51,025
where she'd just be digesting kind of what's going on and how she feels about it and what's coming up.

666
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:55,650
And they proved pretty popular in the first game so we carried those over.

667
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,152
and they were a really great way of getting into Lara's head.

668
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:01,915
So I did a lot of the in-Lara's-head-based stuff.

669
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:07,179
So these were campsite diaries, there was therapy sessions,

670
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:09,760
and there was also Lara's father's diaries.

671
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,163
So I did the, they were split into two,

672
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:17,046
so our additional writer, Philip Gillette,

673
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:19,848
he did the father's work diaries,

674
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:22,910
and I did the kind of more personal diaries

675
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,552
to Lara when she was a kid.

676
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:25,292
And those were.

677
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:33,031
really quite fruitful for me as a writer because initially I was a little bit

678
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:36,772
concerned about the father plotline and I didn't warm to it.

679
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:40,032
I've been open about this, I didn't warm to it initially.

680
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:44,894
But sometimes you have to work through things and find peace with it

681
00:33:44,894 --> 00:33:49,255
and I did that by pulling on real-world influences in my relationship with my own father.

682
00:33:49,783 --> 00:33:53,904
and I even channeled that literally into one of the diaries.

683
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:57,125
My father passed away from Alzheimer's last year

684
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:00,045
and in one of the interviews he talked about

685
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:03,686
the memory he didn't want to lose and that was that the day

686
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:07,267
or the night that I was born and so I took that memory and I sort of merged it

687
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:12,428
with Lara's father's memories of her when she was born and even though that is

688
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:13,928
totally Mary suing

689
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:17,189
it really helped me to kind of

690
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,142
find some peace with the narrative

691
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,685
and get inside Lara's head and her father's head

692
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,007
and just, it all started working for me

693
00:34:24,007 --> 00:34:25,448
when I discovered that.

694
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:28,749
And I just wanted to mention one thing about it.

695
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:31,170
From a gameplay perspective, what's happening in campsites

696
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,451
is the player is upgrading equipment and doing,

697
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:38,033
when we say low impact or low engagement gameplay,

698
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:38,813
it's not combat.

699
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:40,914
It's not, you're not completely, your attention

700
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,355
isn't completely on the screen.

701
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:43,996
So you can split it a little bit.

702
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:46,657
And this is a good place where we can deliver narrative

703
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:47,697
content as well as gameplay.

704
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:49,358
We know the player is doing something.

705
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:51,439
They're going to be engaged.

706
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:54,280
So it's kind of a nice way to hit both narrative and gameplay

707
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,800
at the same time.

708
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:57,360
Yeah, identifying that space as a really good canvas

709
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,862
early on for narrative was a really good thing.

710
00:34:59,862 --> 00:35:01,884
The important thing about supporting narrative

711
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:04,966
is that everything in your game that is not your main story

712
00:35:04,966 --> 00:35:07,548
should be supporting and can be supporting your narrative.

713
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:09,810
Your combat VO, overheard conversations

714
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,233
between enemies or NPCs, even the placement of objects

715
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,275
in the environment are telling a story for a player who's

716
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:17,036
engaged and looking for those connections.

717
00:35:17,036 --> 00:35:17,476
All right, Jeff.

718
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:17,817
So at this point.

719
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:25,419
We've got all this great narrative content

720
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:27,579
that's been built. We've got scenes that we can start

721
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:29,400
working on. And the rubber hits the road.

722
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,581
And it's time to get this in front of players.

723
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:33,781
And so translating words to images

724
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:36,002
becomes a very important part of the process.

725
00:35:36,002 --> 00:35:39,523
Now, we use these for multiple purposes.

726
00:35:39,523 --> 00:35:41,863
We would use them, obviously, for performance shoots

727
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:42,903
at digital domain.

728
00:35:42,903 --> 00:35:44,484
But we would also use them on the floor

729
00:35:44,484 --> 00:35:45,924
for gameplay scenarios.

730
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:48,405
But specific to narrative, cinematics

731
00:35:48,405 --> 00:35:52,166
is where a bulk of my work went into.

732
00:35:52,917 --> 00:36:00,124
What we found is that the expressive nature of a drawing for users was a lot more efficient

733
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:05,128
for conveying what our intent was for the final cinematic than just proxy models that were posed.

734
00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:10,874
You can give a hint of atmosphere, you can give a hint of the anguish that a player is going through,

735
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:14,517
and you don't have to task the character team with a lot of work to create temporary rigs

736
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:16,199
that are just going to be thrown away for the final.

737
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,063
And so by putting a scene like this one here, which is rock bottom, which was originally meant to be the opening cinematic for the game,

738
00:36:24,063 --> 00:36:29,966
we were able to quickly run through scenarios based on the scene directives.

739
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:33,227
Here, originally, Lara was meant to be on a tube.

740
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:34,628
She's meant to be on a train.

741
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:38,470
and having a very traumatic dream when all of a sudden she's awakened and

742
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,232
she's all of a sudden surrounded by all these people that are looking at her

743
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:44,374
like she's not quite all there. And this was

744
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:48,477
satisfying one of the hashtags that the narrative team had established which is

745
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:51,979
to basically establish a... the rock bottom portion of

746
00:36:51,979 --> 00:36:56,122
Lara's arc so far. You know, she's been through a lot in the last game, she's been...

747
00:36:56,775 --> 00:37:01,219
going around the world trying to find answers, and now she's come back to London and she's

748
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,402
trying to get back into a normal life and she's having a hard time fitting in.

749
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:10,447
So we ran through several iterations of this on paper, and at some point we were like,

750
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:14,631
okay, we've changed things around, we're ready to get this into an animated form,

751
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:15,692
and that's when...

752
00:37:15,932 --> 00:37:17,653
the table reads came in really handy,

753
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,514
as well as some of our internal talent

754
00:37:19,514 --> 00:37:20,715
to help kind of make that a reality.

755
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:22,376
And I'll kick it back over to Cam for that.

756
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:22,776
Yeah.

757
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:25,698
Just as Jeff mentioned, that an expressive drawing

758
00:37:25,698 --> 00:37:28,940
is a lot better at communicating an emotionality of a scene

759
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,201
than a posed model.

760
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:31,702
What we discovered really rapidly

761
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:34,224
was that when we recorded temp VO for these scenes

762
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:36,445
and for in-game, is that if we were just

763
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:38,466
recording somebody reading the words verbatim

764
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,327
off the piece of paper, a lot of the focus

765
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,789
was on a performance that we knew was not good.

766
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:46,671
And that didn't allow us to focus on the words and the context in the game.

767
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:51,154
So we were incredibly fortunate at Crystal Dynamics to have more than two, but two very

768
00:37:51,154 --> 00:37:56,357
incredibly talented actors who also had real jobs in the studio as well, and who were always

769
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:01,340
willing to come in and do rapid iterations of VO with sort of intense direction.

770
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,521
I think is Megan here?

771
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:04,322
We have one of our stars here.

772
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:04,442
Yeah.

773
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:04,822
There she is.

774
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:05,723
Megan.

775
00:38:05,723 --> 00:38:06,964
No, come on.

776
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:08,685
You have an excellent voice for radio.

777
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:10,566
She's available for casting immediately.

778
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:10,906
Life saver.

779
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:11,606
Thank you.

780
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:22,295
So, yeah, I mean, I just wanted to clarify, I mean, like, the important thing is to get as close to as final as possible on screen for your players to react to, and that includes emotionality.

781
00:38:22,295 --> 00:38:32,299
So, you know, we were pushing these guys to try to be pretty emotional in their VO, and, you know, we would go through cycles where we would just do it fast with...

782
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:34,440
straight reads and it just wasn't working.

783
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,242
So it's worth the extra effort.

784
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:38,423
I guarantee you if you can get it to a state

785
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:42,205
where it's almost representative of what you're trying for,

786
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:44,267
then that's going to save you a lot of time on the back end.

787
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:46,368
Yeah, we even had processes of auditioning people

788
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:49,530
internally in the studio to make sure that we had the best.

789
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,571
We didn't tell them they were auditions.

790
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:53,392
We just didn't use the bad takes.

791
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:58,437
But it was very important having rapid iteration of really high

792
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:02,120
quality VO, especially with the folks that wrote the dialogue

793
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,102
being there, we were able to give the exact context.

794
00:39:05,488 --> 00:39:08,429
Now, the scene we're going to show you, ironically enough,

795
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,169
has no dialogue in it.

796
00:39:09,169 --> 00:39:12,211
So great segue, and we're not really paying off.

797
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:12,891
I apologize for that.

798
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:15,252
But rock bottom is such a great scene

799
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,253
to talk about because I think this was one of our most

800
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:19,934
heavily iterated on scenes.

801
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:20,174
47 times.

802
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:20,434
47 times.

803
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:24,076
And so it's just such a great case study for not only

804
00:39:24,076 --> 00:39:26,457
the process, but also the endurance of the team

805
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:27,878
and the team as a whole at the studio.

806
00:39:28,478 --> 00:39:33,719
So we finally ended up taking Lara off the tube stop and we condensed that story to take place

807
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:38,661
between the tube stop and her apartment. And it was very important here to basically put the player

808
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:42,602
in the driver's seat with Lara and really make them feel like they were seeing creepy crawlies

809
00:39:42,602 --> 00:39:44,943
coming out of the shadows on this street.

810
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,923
You can see how high quality these animatics that Jeff was able to put together very quickly

811
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:56,547
are at establishing a tone, a sense of motion, and the aesthetics.

812
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:59,029
Yeah, I mean our audio guys knocked it out too.

813
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:05,115
They would go in and they would score this with music and with great sound effects.

814
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:08,457
And these were intended for the team but also to go in front of users.

815
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:09,859
We did this intentionally.

816
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:11,080
We'll get into that point soon.

817
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,162
But the whole point of this is so that we can start testing our story.

818
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:16,824
And testing narrative is very difficult.

819
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:20,327
But when you actually have visuals, it's a lot easier.

820
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:22,088
And absolutely.

821
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,549
The testing stuff is so important,

822
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,750
because for a long time, we stayed with this version.

823
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,772
And we thought this is what was going to happen.

824
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:29,713
And after several play tests, we started

825
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:32,975
to realize that a shuffling of the intro was important.

826
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,156
So when you play the game, you'll

827
00:40:34,156 --> 00:40:36,698
notice that we start directly into the action on a mountain.

828
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:38,800
And then we come to this about, I think, about 20 minutes in.

829
00:40:39,258 --> 00:40:41,859
Yeah, I mean, we basically had a six minute block

830
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:43,580
of cinematics at the front end of the game.

831
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,201
And anybody who's worked on a game here

832
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:47,363
knows that's just a complete nonstarter.

833
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:49,444
You know, people are going to pick up your controller.

834
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:50,244
They want to play your game.

835
00:40:50,244 --> 00:40:53,386
So we wanted to get people on the sticks as soon as possible.

836
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:54,787
And just even in the middle of the game,

837
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,508
six minutes is kind of a nonstarter.

838
00:40:56,508 --> 00:40:57,688
So we needed to cut it down.

839
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,750
And we just started condensing.

840
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,051
Let's take moments from scenes and condense them.

841
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:04,372
So in this scene here, we took that moment

842
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:07,414
and condensed it into another scene to get the same effect.

843
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,563
So we basically moved everything off the street and moved it into Lara's apartment,

844
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:17,047
and we were able to satisfy some other hashtags that you didn't see in the original animatic,

845
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:18,748
but that took place in the apartment.

846
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:23,872
We were able to put it into one setting and just get the player right into the action in the meat of the matter.

847
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:27,275
By tracking those themes and hashtags and concepts and metadata,

848
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:29,016
we knew it was important about those scenes.

849
00:41:29,016 --> 00:41:32,899
So it was, we had the documentation for knowing what we needed to say in this scene,

850
00:41:32,899 --> 00:41:35,221
even as we drastically rewrote and restaged it.

851
00:41:35,395 --> 00:41:39,539
Absolutely. And one thing I didn't mention earlier too is before we even start drawing anything,

852
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:44,424
I mean, we're, I mean, I'm going and I'm talking to these, these guys on a daily basis. And before

853
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:48,148
I even will make a drawing, sometimes I'm offering feedback because I'm seeing in my head how things

854
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:52,652
might play out. So we're distilling and we're, we're honing. And eventually we land up with

855
00:41:52,652 --> 00:41:56,716
something that we feel is the intent of what the scene needs to express.

856
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:03,042
And just to add to that, I used the original rock bottom scene in the comics as well.

857
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:07,865
So all the thinking about it did not go wasted, because I kind of used it in there and folded

858
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:10,787
in some of the characters in the game to it.

859
00:42:10,787 --> 00:42:14,809
So even stuff that falls by the wayside, you can find other uses for.

860
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:17,731
That makes my comic book fan heart happy.

861
00:42:19,692 --> 00:42:24,793
Yeah, so talking a bit about iterations and feedback loops,

862
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:28,693
we were in a game like this, story

863
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:31,514
is very important in channeling the player

864
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:33,474
through the game itself.

865
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:37,155
And standing up to story is a very central part of that.

866
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,435
So Jeff was doing a lot of that work.

867
00:42:39,435 --> 00:42:41,896
But it was very iterative.

868
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:45,497
It was changing weekly or even daily.

869
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:47,837
And we were very lucky to have a.

870
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:53,800
a very strong focus on testing this with real users,

871
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,962
so having, and having a commitment from the team

872
00:42:55,962 --> 00:42:58,345
to always have the story stood up

873
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:01,808
so we could show it on a weekly basis for real users

874
00:43:01,808 --> 00:43:05,012
and getting results back from that.

875
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:07,615
And as Jeff was speaking to, I mean, it's...

876
00:43:08,238 --> 00:43:10,419
One of the most central parts, of course,

877
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:13,181
is to deliver on the emotionality of the story,

878
00:43:13,181 --> 00:43:14,822
that people can relate to the characters,

879
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:16,062
they understand their journey,

880
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:17,843
they're interested, invested in them,

881
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:21,365
which is super hard to get across in an animatic state

882
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:24,727
with two or three different temp video actors

883
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,388
that are hacked together in the scene

884
00:43:26,388 --> 00:43:28,389
to just get the scene across.

885
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:30,490
So we're asking a lot from the users

886
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:34,653
who are actually giving proper feedback.

887
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:50,143
But on the flip side of that, just the pure functionality of the story, understanding what's going on from one scene to the next and tracking these hashtags that John was talking about is the most useful we got out of a user test for a long time.

888
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:54,786
It's like seeing the different threads going through and the...

889
00:43:55,427 --> 00:44:00,230
One of the things people had a problem with was tracking what we had a hashtag called

890
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:07,034
the hashtag robot army, which literally was the kind of the code word for the kind of

891
00:44:07,034 --> 00:44:12,558
enemy, the trinity, our enemy through the game, the villains, and what was their project.

892
00:44:13,162 --> 00:44:14,923
And having it as a mystery story,

893
00:44:14,923 --> 00:44:17,584
it was kind of, we tried to kind of raise the stakes

894
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:20,206
and just giving the player little by little information

895
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:22,687
throughout the project, throughout the game,

896
00:44:22,687 --> 00:44:23,668
so they wouldn't get,

897
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:28,390
you can, the stakes wouldn't be raised too high too quickly,

898
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,691
but we would lose track of it

899
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:30,871
and people wouldn't really get it.

900
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:33,012
And we'll have to kind of shuffle scenes around

901
00:44:33,012 --> 00:44:36,234
to try to, or invent new scenes or new little beats

902
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:39,055
that would support the arcs of these different stories.

903
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,746
Robot Army was internally facing, obviously.

904
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,268
Yeah, I mean, we lifted right out of Terminator.

905
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:46,990
And we often would have these meetings

906
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,153
where we were incredibly jealous of franchises that

907
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:51,675
had things like Robot Armies, because everyone

908
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:52,536
gets a Robot Army.

909
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:53,477
It's going to kill everybody.

910
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:55,318
That's a pretty high stake.

911
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:56,039
And we had a very.

912
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,905
nuanced, complicated villain who, you know, essentially they were going to make an immoral

913
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:04,109
robot army and kill everybody eventually, but, you know, we were trying to track that

914
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:09,035
in a way that didn't just drop that on people's laps in the first five minutes.

915
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:10,596
So yeah, robot army, robot army.

916
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:16,172
And then it's worth noting that we're fond of those internal conflicts and the internal stakes,

917
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:22,317
but one of the things that happens is the story starts not working at some point if the external stakes aren't there.

918
00:45:22,317 --> 00:45:27,801
And that's for us, for an action-adventure genre where you are, for example, killing people,

919
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:31,704
that if you're just conflicted internally and you're dealing with that by...

920
00:45:31,904 --> 00:45:37,971
by killing fools, then it's less relatable than trying to understand that these people

921
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:41,014
are actually going to do very bad things if you don't stop them.

922
00:45:41,014 --> 00:45:46,460
So there becomes some amount of pressure to layer in those external stakes in addition

923
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:51,326
to those internal stakes early enough to drive the motivation of the players beyond just

924
00:45:51,326 --> 00:45:52,727
the characterization itself.

925
00:45:56,378 --> 00:46:01,542
Jumping into, yes, this process is just as chaotic as it looks.

926
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:07,026
We should probably start by saying if your story is anything like ours,

927
00:46:07,026 --> 00:46:09,488
it will be very broken until it's not.

928
00:46:10,589 --> 00:46:13,970
And I would emphasize the play testing part of this

929
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,452
and the things that Jeff was able to do,

930
00:46:16,452 --> 00:46:19,753
putting the words to pictures and getting performances

931
00:46:19,753 --> 00:46:21,995
that were what we would say is above the bar.

932
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:23,776
Because the problem is if you have an extremely

933
00:46:23,776 --> 00:46:26,697
bad performance or no moving pictures,

934
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:27,317
oftentimes...

935
00:46:28,138 --> 00:46:32,381
what players are seeing isn't actually landing with them. So

936
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:35,764
what you need to do in this, in these previous steps is get the

937
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:38,426
story to a point where people, where you can trust the

938
00:46:38,426 --> 00:46:40,608
feedback. Cause what you'll find is you'll get a playtest

939
00:46:40,608 --> 00:46:42,949
feedback and it's like kids don't understand this at all.

940
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,313
And you'll go, oh, well, that's just because it's not a final cinematic.

941
00:46:46,313 --> 00:46:50,218
Well, it's going to be really expensive to change once it is a final cinematic.

942
00:46:50,218 --> 00:46:54,604
So you have to find that cheaper representation of story so you can start

943
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:57,047
testing it sooner and you can trust the results.

944
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:59,049
And then we started to go, oh, you know what?

945
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:00,930
actually we really do have a problem.

946
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,852
We need more presence of the father

947
00:47:03,852 --> 00:47:06,333
or a greater presence of the external threat.

948
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,655
So this is then how we start finding canvases

949
00:47:08,655 --> 00:47:10,576
to speak to these things.

950
00:47:10,576 --> 00:47:13,678
So now you're really in a loop where,

951
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:15,579
and an important part of this is having someone like John.

952
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:19,661
So our narrative lead becomes the writer room.

953
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:22,163
He runs that sort of center there.

954
00:47:22,163 --> 00:47:24,844
And what that allows us to do is he can take feedback

955
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:27,166
from myself, from a creative direction level.

956
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,486
He can work with Cam.

957
00:47:28,787 --> 00:47:31,589
in the secondary narrative stuff, working with Rihanna,

958
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:34,772
who's external, so he becomes a bridge for her

959
00:47:34,772 --> 00:47:36,653
into the project and vice versa,

960
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:40,417
our additional consultants, so having someone like John

961
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:42,939
at the center of it, who's basically able to run

962
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:45,741
this crazy process, get that feedback in,

963
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:47,102
stand up a new version of the scene.

964
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:51,145
Jeff's gonna sadly draw it again for the 47th time as well.

965
00:47:51,145 --> 00:47:53,726
Megan's gonna read it again for the 47th time.

966
00:47:53,726 --> 00:47:55,607
And eventually you start getting the results

967
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:56,888
you want from the story.

968
00:47:56,888 --> 00:47:58,249
Ow, my hand.

969
00:47:58,249 --> 00:47:59,550
Just hurts thinking about it.

970
00:48:01,863 --> 00:48:04,764
Yeah, which leads to the actual performances.

971
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:06,705
And like Noah was saying, this is

972
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:10,586
where it gets really expensive and really tough

973
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:11,287
to change things.

974
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:15,469
So having that very agile process up to the point

975
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:18,630
where we go to the set and shoot it,

976
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,090
and even

977
00:48:19,976 --> 00:48:22,017
Like, we try to be prepared, we try to say,

978
00:48:22,017 --> 00:48:24,159
okay, we have to be two days early,

979
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,559
because of everybody's schedules and stuff,

980
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:29,602
to deliver all the scripts, to deliver the boards,

981
00:48:29,602 --> 00:48:32,044
so we have them on set so the actors can be prepared.

982
00:48:32,044 --> 00:48:34,865
But there were times we would come to the set

983
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:37,987
with new boards from Jeff that he'd been drawing all night,

984
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:41,309
stick them on the walls, okay, sorry, we change it again,

985
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:42,110
and the actors would be...

986
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:48,272
cool with it it would take a little more time to rehearse it on stage but we were very very

987
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:54,954
fortunate to have Camilla Luddington as our our star that was very well calibrated from the previous

988
00:48:54,954 --> 00:48:59,256
game and like Rihanna was saying she was part of the table read she was

989
00:49:00,132 --> 00:49:04,336
She was part of, how to say, putting the words to Lara,

990
00:49:04,336 --> 00:49:07,118
how she would react in the different situations.

991
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:10,681
And the other actors on set would kind of key off her.

992
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,923
She would be kind of a linchpin for the performance

993
00:49:12,923 --> 00:49:15,866
in the big moments of the story.

994
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:19,969
But we did have

995
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,322
reshoots of some of the scenes we had to go back.

996
00:49:23,322 --> 00:49:25,444
When we came back we found out it didn't work out

997
00:49:25,444 --> 00:49:29,086
in the user tests and so we would continuously

998
00:49:29,086 --> 00:49:31,368
kind of making this kind of puzzle of what are we reshooting?

999
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,450
What are we kind of picking up in different ways

1000
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:37,072
through VO or through the performances?

1001
00:49:37,072 --> 00:49:39,694
And sometimes having to even recast actors

1002
00:49:39,694 --> 00:49:40,655
because it didn't work.

1003
00:49:42,209 --> 00:49:48,392
We're trying to make a very, as I said, relatable world with kind of grounded characters and

1004
00:49:48,392 --> 00:49:52,614
sometimes with the VO sessions it would be hard to find actors that would be kind of

1005
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:58,117
differently calibrated for different kinds of games to get that voice that was more kind

1006
00:49:58,117 --> 00:50:02,119
of in sync with the rest of the direction of the game.

1007
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:06,941
So sometimes we would bring people back and say, okay, all that kind of bad guy voice,

1008
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:11,844
just please get rid of it and just do your own voice and it would be actually a lot better.

1009
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:15,547
Tor was critical in that he was able to be in most of the VO sessions,

1010
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:18,529
and since he had such a strong understanding of the story,

1011
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:21,672
was able to provide all that context for the actors, which is key,

1012
00:50:21,672 --> 00:50:24,674
because you can have a very well-written line and a very good actor.

1013
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,388
And if they deliver it in the wrong context or in the wrong tone,

1014
00:50:27,388 --> 00:50:29,649
the scene completely falls flat.

1015
00:50:29,649 --> 00:50:32,170
So we were very lucky to have Tor in that position.

1016
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:35,812
Now we try to obviously minimize those recasting and reshoots

1017
00:50:35,812 --> 00:50:38,973
by following this process and rigorously iterating.

1018
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:40,634
But those things are going to happen,

1019
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:42,875
and it was important that we embrace them and were agile

1020
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:45,096
and willing to make those changes when we needed to.

1021
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:49,398
Yeah, I mean, if you do your job right and you get to the end of this, then those, those reshoots are minimal.

1022
00:50:49,398 --> 00:51:02,521
And obviously not everyone's working on these giant projects, but, you know, I still think that the benefit of having, you know, a firm idea of your story before you start doing whatever version of the final assets is going to help you.

1023
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:02,621
Yeah.

1024
00:51:02,621 --> 00:51:13,963
And speaking about finaling, uh, we had a, we were lucky enough to have an extremely talented cinematics team that was located in Montreal, uh, led by Dave Hubert, who, uh, helped.

1025
00:51:14,812 --> 00:51:19,154
bring all of this together in the package that you actually see when you play the game.

1026
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:25,156
And Tor was talking about recasting, and sometimes we would have to make changes even after reshoots

1027
00:51:25,156 --> 00:51:25,817
were done.

1028
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:30,359
And at that time, we had the animators up there, and they were very diligent and very

1029
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:36,222
passionate about making sure that every detail on Lara's face and her actions was communicated

1030
00:51:36,222 --> 00:51:36,722
correctly.

1031
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:37,222
And so...

1032
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:42,327
As much as we have all this great motion capture technology and performance capture technology,

1033
00:51:42,327 --> 00:51:46,292
there's still an animator that's sitting there and is hand keying certain things in order to

1034
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:50,197
bring it all together. And so we were just extremely fortunate to be working with them

1035
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:52,440
up there and I just want to give a big shout out to them.

1036
00:51:54,475 --> 00:51:57,437
All right, so we've talked about our core story pillars

1037
00:51:57,437 --> 00:52:00,218
of Crystal Dynamics, the learnings we took from 2013's

1038
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:02,859
Tomb Raider reboot, and a little bit about our process.

1039
00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:05,260
So here's our key takeaways we'd like

1040
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,840
you to take from this talk.

1041
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,041
The very important thing is that your process is key.

1042
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:11,822
Create and embrace that process, whatever the project.

1043
00:52:11,822 --> 00:52:14,023
Obviously, your process isn't going to look exactly like

1044
00:52:14,023 --> 00:52:18,385
ours, but adapt or create one from the ground up, and stick

1045
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,066
to it, and you're going to be able to make yourself a

1046
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:21,666
roadmap to get there in the end.

1047
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:24,508
Cultivate feedback from every area of the team.

1048
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:25,709
Don't hold anything too precious.

1049
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,430
Everybody's feedback is important.

1050
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,591
And you need to be able to defend your ideas.

1051
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:30,872
If you can't defend them, then they're not

1052
00:52:30,872 --> 00:52:32,293
worth keeping on the page.

1053
00:52:32,293 --> 00:52:33,894
You can't have a thin skin.

1054
00:52:33,894 --> 00:52:36,295
You've got to let everybody speak their mind bluntly,

1055
00:52:36,295 --> 00:52:38,877
however they're going to speak it, and take that to heart.

1056
00:52:38,877 --> 00:52:40,217
And then finally, be inclusive.

1057
00:52:40,217 --> 00:52:42,238
The entire team has a stake in the story.

1058
00:52:42,238 --> 00:52:43,939
Everything in the game tells a story.

1059
00:52:43,939 --> 00:52:46,701
I said that we are the team responsible

1060
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:48,562
for the ultimate presentation of the narrative

1061
00:52:48,562 --> 00:52:49,383
in Rise of the Tomb Raider.

1062
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:52,284
In reality, the entire team is the narrative team.

1063
00:52:52,284 --> 00:52:56,045
We are all telling the story of Lara and the world at the same time.

1064
00:52:56,045 --> 00:52:59,286
So thank you guys very much for coming.

1065
00:52:59,286 --> 00:53:03,287
I think we have a few moments for questions and then we'll be able to be in the wrap-up

1066
00:53:03,287 --> 00:53:04,387
area afterwards.

1067
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:06,008
We have five minutes.

1068
00:53:06,008 --> 00:53:07,728
Does anybody want to step up and ask a question?

1069
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:09,168
There we go, right to the mic.

1070
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:23,718
Hi, so I'm a one-person team for a small game I'm working on, and I want to know what you would suggest for the feedback, the inclusive part, because if I'm a one-person team, I don't really have a lot of people to ask for feedback, so I'm just curious on what you would recommend for that.

1071
00:53:24,257 --> 00:53:25,818
Absolutely.

1072
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:27,579
Well, I think my recommendation would

1073
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,980
be to seek feedback from people that you know and you trust,

1074
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,601
and people who are going to be honest to you.

1075
00:53:31,601 --> 00:53:34,422
If at all possible, get it in front of people

1076
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:36,983
who aren't gamers, who are going to bring a different viewpoint

1077
00:53:36,983 --> 00:53:37,123
to it.

1078
00:53:37,123 --> 00:53:39,384
I think some of the most interesting story advice I got

1079
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,625
was from environment artists, who

1080
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,206
were telling me about the placement of objects

1081
00:53:43,206 --> 00:53:44,127
that I didn't even think about.

1082
00:53:44,127 --> 00:53:46,468
So being able to find somebody who maybe

1083
00:53:46,468 --> 00:53:48,168
has a unique viewpoint, you really

1084
00:53:48,168 --> 00:53:50,750
have to seek that out if you're on a team of one, absolutely.

1085
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,270
Anybody else?

1086
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:54,192
You like that answer, huh?

1087
00:53:54,192 --> 00:53:54,833
Yeah, good answer.

1088
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:55,553
All right, terrific.

1089
00:53:55,553 --> 00:53:57,593
I would also recommend just making

1090
00:53:57,593 --> 00:53:58,894
sure to track your feedback.

1091
00:53:58,894 --> 00:54:01,034
Don't just have a casual conversation

1092
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:04,716
and then just kind of retain it by asking the document where

1093
00:54:04,716 --> 00:54:07,156
they can, keep an Excel sheet or whatever tools

1094
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:08,017
you use to track it.

1095
00:54:08,017 --> 00:54:10,257
But always go back and evaluate and make

1096
00:54:10,257 --> 00:54:11,878
sure that you're marking those things off the list

1097
00:54:11,878 --> 00:54:12,678
as you're developing.

1098
00:54:12,678 --> 00:54:13,238
Yeah, absolutely.

1099
00:54:13,238 --> 00:54:15,499
And even if you don't agree with the feedback,

1100
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:19,580
you should understand it and put it down and internalize it.

1101
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:19,900
Thank you.

1102
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,620
Of course.

1103
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:22,622
Hey.

1104
00:54:22,622 --> 00:54:23,623
Hi there.

1105
00:54:23,623 --> 00:54:26,486
So you talked about receiving feedback from the whole team.

1106
00:54:26,486 --> 00:54:29,150
I was wondering at what points in the process

1107
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,973
you got feedback because sometimes early on,

1108
00:54:31,973 --> 00:54:34,036
small teams are good, and how you bring people in.

1109
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:37,490
John, you want to take that?

1110
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,170
Well, I try to seek feedback at every step,

1111
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,430
even in that early phase.

1112
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,851
I would tend to have meetings every week

1113
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:47,692
where anybody on the team could come

1114
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:49,352
and I would do an overview of the story.

1115
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:54,974
And I'm all about taking the feedback and assessing it.

1116
00:54:54,974 --> 00:54:58,935
But I don't feel like excluding is something that

1117
00:54:58,935 --> 00:55:01,135
is ever going to be helpful.

1118
00:55:01,955 --> 00:55:05,996
I can separate the ideas that I'm getting from people, that we're getting from people,

1119
00:55:05,996 --> 00:55:10,357
and still hold on to our vision, and still have that small team. I mean, I understand what you're

1120
00:55:10,357 --> 00:55:15,659
saying, but I do think even, you know, you want the whole team to be with you, and you're going

1121
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:19,420
to have a team, no matter how small your team is at the beginning, they're, you know, they're going

1122
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:23,801
to be with you to the end, and you want them to carry the vision with you, and always be able,

1123
00:55:23,801 --> 00:55:25,641
you know, you want people on your team.

1124
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:30,284
You want them challenging you, but you don't want them off the same page.

1125
00:55:30,284 --> 00:55:34,111
You all want to be kind of carrying the vision together, so I think it's important at every step.

1126
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:36,915
And it blossoms when you get it in the game.

1127
00:55:36,915 --> 00:55:39,236
So we talk about standing it up for user test.

1128
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:41,617
It's actually also, there's the small group who will give you

1129
00:55:41,617 --> 00:55:42,977
feedback on the page.

1130
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:45,038
But as soon as it's on the screen, and even before we

1131
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:47,199
would do moving pictures, sometimes we just put slates

1132
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,819
up there so that people understood the story beat that

1133
00:55:49,819 --> 00:55:51,080
was going to be there.

1134
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,901
And all of a sudden, everyone is now playing their game with

1135
00:55:53,901 --> 00:55:56,501
the story in it and having all kinds of ideas of how it could

1136
00:55:56,501 --> 00:55:58,222
be better or what they're not understanding yet.

1137
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:01,243
So just dropping it in is an explosion of feedback.

1138
00:56:01,343 --> 00:56:03,925
And I would say it's definitely not a comfortable feeling.

1139
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:06,247
I mean, it was insanely frustrating as a writer

1140
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:09,150
and as a story person to get that constantly.

1141
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,992
Like, you feel like you're under attack,

1142
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,474
but you just kind of have to let it all come in.

1143
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:15,115
And you know it's broken at that point.

1144
00:56:15,115 --> 00:56:17,598
This is early enough that it is not your perfect version.

1145
00:56:17,598 --> 00:56:20,260
And you have to stand there and hear about how

1146
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,081
you know it's broken.

1147
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:22,462
But occasionally, you'll hear about how

1148
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,583
you don't know it's broken yet also.

1149
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:25,224
And those are the precious ones.

1150
00:56:25,555 --> 00:56:29,537
It does make you really robust for writing for any other entertainment medium.

1151
00:56:29,537 --> 00:56:35,440
You are just writing in a headwind of feedback all the time.

1152
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,720
Over & over again.

1153
00:56:37,445 --> 00:56:40,327
But yeah, it is really good for kind of thickening your skin.

1154
00:56:40,327 --> 00:56:46,171
And it became very important to us to open the process earlier.

1155
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:48,933
And that was something that we took from Rise

1156
00:56:48,933 --> 00:56:51,654
so we could identify problems earlier in the process

1157
00:56:51,654 --> 00:56:52,915
and smooth things out.

1158
00:56:52,915 --> 00:56:55,397
Because we didn't always do that with the first game.

1159
00:56:55,397 --> 00:56:58,139
And that was something that we definitely carried through.

1160
00:56:58,139 --> 00:56:58,639
Open it up early.

1161
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:00,080
Their problems will be there.

1162
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,781
Those problems will be there.

1163
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:04,503
So let's get to them early and sort them out early.

1164
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:05,644
And I think that really helped.

1165
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,048
OK, I think we're going to be available for more questions

1166
00:57:08,048 --> 00:57:09,209
in the wrap-up area after this.

1167
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:10,891
But everybody, thank you so much for coming.

1168
00:57:10,891 --> 00:57:12,092
I'm supposed to remind you to fill out

1169
00:57:12,092 --> 00:57:13,353
an evaluation of some sort.

1170
00:57:13,353 --> 00:57:14,734
So please do that.

1171
00:57:14,734 --> 00:57:15,335
And thank you again.
