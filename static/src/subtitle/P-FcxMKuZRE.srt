1
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:14,369
What's going on everybody? Welcome to our presentation. We're really excited. We've

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:19,612
been wanting to do this for a long time. So we're always at BPARGC. I'm Ahmed Abdullah.

3
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:24,174
This is my brother, Khalil. And we're going to tell you about our journey, our journey to get

4
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:29,116
on consoles. And we're gonna have a good time. You know, we're also, hopefully you can learn

5
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:33,438
something from things that we've learned and maybe things that work well for us and also

6
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:37,940
our mistakes as well. So really excited to go through this presentation with y'all. Let's do it.

7
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:46,126
So who are we again? So I'm Ahmed. So I'm the younger brother. You're older than me. I'm the

8
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,627
veteran of the team. He's a veteran by about a year and a half. So you can see there that's

9
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:56,728
circa 90s over there. Us playing consoles on Nintendo, playing a little Mario. But we've been

10
00:00:56,748 --> 00:01:01,689
playing games our whole lives. Something we love doing. And from very young, we always loved

11
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,790
building games as well. We've kind of found time during the weekends we couldn't play games during

12
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,410
school week to build our own. So that was our workaround. So

13
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,531
We always wanted to be developers.

14
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:13,912
And the thing that we found was just

15
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:16,112
it was really hard to know what that really meant,

16
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:18,273
what it meant to go on that journey

17
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:20,033
to actually become developers.

18
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:21,334
And we loved consoles,

19
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:23,534
so specifically we wanted to be on consoles.

20
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:26,135
So we're gonna talk about that.

21
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:28,715
We're gonna talk about how we kind of became

22
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,876
these two little guys playing Nintendo

23
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:33,116
to actually being console developers.

24
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,117
I'm gonna go to the next slide here.

25
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:41,303
So that was us, but maybe tell them about Decoy Games, our company.

26
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:45,247
Yeah, so, you know, fast forward, you know, 30 something years or so,

27
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:49,131
now we're Decoy Games. We are our own self-published indie studio.

28
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:56,938
We're actually launching our first game, Sumsanity. Right now the team consists of myself,

29
00:01:57,238 --> 00:02:02,363
my brother, and also a shout out to Chris Venn, who does all of our visual art for our game right now.

30
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:06,879
Someone that we've actually known since childhood, I think since preschool or so, right?

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,420
Very young, yes.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,300
Yeah, very young.

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,723
And we just kind of got together and built this thing from the ground up, right?

34
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:15,504
Just kind of self-taught, as you saw there, self-taught.

35
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:20,047
So me and my brother taught ourselves how to do development through like YouTube, Google,

36
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:25,170
basically from scratch, understanding the intricacies and the beginnings of game development.

37
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,693
Meanwhile, Chris, who was just a graffiti artist, he's actually self-taught.

38
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:36,906
We showed him how to use the software, and then from there just kind of year after year, he just built his skills.

39
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:39,428
We're also self-funded.

40
00:02:40,188 --> 00:02:45,132
So everything that we've done, everything that we've funded for ourselves has actually come from us working part-time.

41
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:48,655
We'll get into that a little bit later in the presentation.

42
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:54,060
And then the last thing that we're also going to tap on a bit here is the fact that we're self-published.

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,065
So we are bringing our own game to market, and we want to tell you guys exactly how you can publish your own game.

44
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:05,973
So this will actually be a talk that ranges from,

45
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:08,034
you know, if you're a beginner or if you've even been

46
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,836
in the publishing or self-publishing business.

47
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,597
So hopefully there are things that we can touch as well.

48
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:12,938
But so what is our game?

49
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,719
So our debut game is Swim Sanity.

50
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,000
You might have heard it before.

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,841
It's a multiplayer underwater shooter

52
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,543
with competitive and cooperative game modes.

53
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:21,784
You can play online or locally.

54
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:23,786
We'll be launching on cross-play as well.

55
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:27,308
We've been fortunate enough to win a few awards,

56
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:28,789
going to different like indie showcases

57
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:29,650
and things like that.

58
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,971
It will come out on all platforms.

59
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:38,918
In August, if we fast forward time to real time, that would actually be tonight when you're watching this live.

60
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,922
So we'll see if this all worked or not.

61
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:48,510
But I wanted to show you guys some gameplay. You guys check it out and let us know what you think here.

62
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:25,616
All right, and that's Simsanity. We're done.

63
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,357
Can we edit in our own cheers?

64
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:30,097
Yeah

65
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,418
You know that that was our Simsanity coming out August 7th.

66
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:39,820
The game looked nothing like that when we first started so that's kind of the whole part of our talk as well

67
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,721
And we want to talk about kind of these five steps that took us to get to that point for our first game

68
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,622
So the first thing we'll talk about is making a good game

69
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:52,923
One of my favorite subjects is so simple and why do we talk about making a good game, but we'll go over that

70
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,319
Number two is preparing for visibility.

71
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,640
So talking about starting a company,

72
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,781
getting your game out there so people can see it,

73
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,761
what that all means.

74
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:04,062
Number three is showcasing and networking,

75
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:06,123
something that we love to do.

76
00:06:06,203 --> 00:06:08,384
We're just very people, person, people.

77
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:10,844
We just love interacting with people, so that's our brand.

78
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,345
So talk about how that worked for us

79
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:13,345
and how that may work for you.

80
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:16,666
Then we'll talk about console approval and development,

81
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:19,907
some of the gotchas that hit us and might hit you as well.

82
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:21,868
And then building a go-to-market strategy,

83
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:22,808
which is very important.

84
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,564
to make sure you have a plan going into market.

85
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:30,087
But very first, number one is making a good game.

86
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:31,929
So what does it mean to make a good game?

87
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,351
I mean, it's funny because it's such a simple thing, right?

88
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:36,052
You say, of course I'm trying to make a good game,

89
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:37,734
but that goes so much deeper

90
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:39,075
than just developing a good game.

91
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:39,956
So let's go into some of that.

92
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:41,697
And let's start with how we made

93
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:42,818
what we consider a good game.

94
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:46,321
So as he said before, the subsanity you see today

95
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:48,283
is not the subsanity that it started, right?

96
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:49,944
So this is a journey, it's a long run thing.

97
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:51,505
So about, what is it?

98
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,680
Nine, sorry, 10 years ago, I started with Simsanity,

99
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,201
The Adventures of Booba Diver, The Scuba Diver.

100
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:01,022
It was just a simple flash game where the scuba diver

101
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,703
tried to swim down to the bottom of the ocean,

102
00:07:03,063 --> 00:07:04,883
collect gold and bring it back up to his boat

103
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:06,744
when these horribly designed sea creatures

104
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:07,664
were trying to attack him.

105
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:09,085
Your art was impeccable.

106
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,146
My art, yeah, it looked a lot better in my head

107
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:13,646
when I was making it, but you know.

108
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:14,607
Gotta start somewhere.

109
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:15,707
Yeah, gotta start somewhere.

110
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,688
So yeah, this was just like the basic fundamentals

111
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:20,789
of what became Simsanity today.

112
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:26,455
Fast forward about two years later, we started working on the XNA framework.

113
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:31,299
Along this way, we started to really understand what game development really meant,

114
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:36,664
what it felt like to use at least a framework of an engine, add physics and stuff to our game.

115
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:40,467
Chris just started jumping on board around this time.

116
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:46,933
He was just getting used to doing digital art, so everything still, while it definitely was not as bad as my art,

117
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:53,158
Things still just kind of didn't really mesh together. You can see improvements here, but I mean clearly some issues

118
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:57,481
you guys are probably pointing out. The HUDs are basically in the middle of gameplay.

119
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:02,423
The background looks like it's on the foreground. It doesn't even look underwater.

120
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:06,426
Sorry, I'm bashing Chris and stuff here, but he'll have a good kick out of this.

121
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:12,789
But yeah, but the art got better, but it still just wasn't there, right? So what would be the next phase here?

122
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:18,289
So, and we talked about the journey, right? So, actually still within XNA, our experience started

123
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:23,334
to get better. You see this is about five years from the start. And we just, year after year,

124
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:28,118
we kind of picked up our skills, kind of recrafted our game. You can see it kind of starting to take

125
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:33,302
life a bit here. You see like some, a little bit better background design, some characters kind of

126
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:37,986
popping a bit more. And so, basically, this is like our skills are kind of starting to develop

127
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:38,827
as game developers.

128
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,651
Yeah, and at this point, the background was still a little busy, still the HUDs were kind of on the screen,

129
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:49,553
but this build was actually good enough to start getting the console's attention to actually have us be self-published.

130
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:56,275
So at this point too, what you don't see in the screenshot is that our gameplay loop was really a lot more crisp at this point.

131
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,856
It played a lot like Simsanity, it just didn't look like Simsanity at this point,

132
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:04,698
but this is before we jumped on Unity, right, started teaching ourselves Unity.

133
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:08,310
And then we started, as you said before,

134
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,692
we got Unity license actually from a convention

135
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:15,175
that we won essentially an award to give the Unity license.

136
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,475
And from there, that's when we really

137
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:18,116
started developing with Simpsanity OS today,

138
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:21,859
combining our experience with also the power of the engine

139
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,300
that allowed us to leverage some of the great things

140
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,481
that Unity brings to games today.

141
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,243
So this is the Simpsanity that you see now.

142
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,064
And let's talk about exactly what

143
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:32,986
were the steps that we took along this journey

144
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,387
to make the decisions that became.

145
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:39,569
what a lot of people are playing right now, Swim Sanity,

146
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:42,790
what decisions really went into making that good game?

147
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:47,553
So one of the things that we say, first and foremost,

148
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:49,534
especially for any beginner developers who

149
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:52,595
are watching this, it's never too early to get started.

150
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:55,657
So especially today, back when we started,

151
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:58,439
it was really hard to find game engines that

152
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,039
are accessible by developers.

153
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,122
Nowadays, you have Unity, Unreal, GameMaker.

154
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,282
I can keep going on.

155
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:10,616
But there are free demos for these engines that you can download and just start messing around with today.

156
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:14,418
Find the one that suits you best and really just start from anything simple.

157
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:21,561
Even if you are getting like a block moving across the screen, that's a goal, but you want to keep building on these goals and moving forward.

158
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:28,805
So one thing, and the reason why we start with make a good game, because to be honest, this is where a lot of things fall off, right?

159
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:32,087
Because you got to make a good game to sell a good game.

160
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:35,508
I think that's something that we need to be more honest with ourselves when entering this industry.

161
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,924
that maybe our game just wasn't good enough.

162
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,425
So how do we get it to that point?

163
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:43,288
For us, as Kool said, getting honest game testers

164
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,070
and getting feedback was really key for us

165
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,551
to make sure we iterate on that.

166
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:50,574
For us, it was friends and family just to start,

167
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:53,035
and they were pretty brutal in the beginning,

168
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:54,156
but it helped a lot.

169
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:57,859
One thing we say a lot is within your game community,

170
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,641
there's always stuff, whether it's on meetup.com

171
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:03,603
or different things where you can find Discord.

172
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:07,206
There's so many people that are just willing to play games.

173
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:11,810
So if you can't, if you think it's something that you need to pay for in order to get people to play,

174
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,851
I don't think that's true.

175
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:16,954
I think there are a lot of people that are willing to just play and just want to enjoy playing games.

176
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:20,297
And if anything, they feel almost honored to be in that prototype phase.

177
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:24,540
Yeah, and I really want to hammer on this one because the whole game testers thing,

178
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,501
I do feel like that's where a lot of indies fall short.

179
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:31,974
They play their own games and once their own game is good enough to them, they're like, oh, this game is definitely good enough.

180
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:37,775
Now let's try to market it and sell it. Make sure that you are actually testing with other individuals who have unbiased opinions,

181
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:44,276
but also taking their feedback to heart, right? So if someone does not have a positive opinion of your game,

182
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:47,137
it's not always, oh, he doesn't know, he doesn't understand my game.

183
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:49,817
He doesn't, he doesn't really understand the art of what I'm trying to do.

184
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:53,758
You have to take, especially if you are in the business of trying to sell your game to others,

185
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:56,654
You have to take the feedback of others as a group,

186
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,536
something like a survey, and apply it to what you do, right?

187
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:00,556
Be honest with yourself.

188
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,558
Be honest with the feedback that you're getting back.

189
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,899
Basically, just have an unbiased view.

190
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:09,142
That really, that circular kind of flow of testing a game

191
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:10,683
and then developing it is really what,

192
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:11,984
you know, makes a good game at the end.

193
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:12,944
Absolutely.

194
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:14,645
So, okay, we have a good game.

195
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:15,446
We're good.

196
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,667
Now we have to prepare for visibility.

197
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,729
So we have to get into the industry.

198
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:22,270
So another step that I feel like is very key here

199
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,752
is when you're doing this, we're starting a business, right?

200
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:29,714
So if you're selling something in any industry,

201
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:32,436
you have to start a business because once you sell it,

202
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:33,277
you have to pay taxes.

203
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:34,558
All these things go into that.

204
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,840
For some reason, I think as gamers,

205
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,881
we really feel like it's,

206
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:41,203
maybe we have this pass to not have to do the business part,

207
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:42,504
but it's very key.

208
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:45,266
It really is something that will establish

209
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:46,787
how your game sells

210
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,409
and how well you can get into the game industry.

211
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,271
And especially if we're talking about consoles.

212
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:59,697
Once you're dealing with those type of businesses, I mean, they really want to deal with you from a business perspective, not necessarily someone that might look at this as a hobby.

213
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:07,282
So one of the things we always tell people to do, and for us, is we create our business plan very early and set our expectations very early.

214
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:17,949
And one of the expectations for us is making sure that we can develop the game while having a good life balance with the game development and make sure that we have money to just live.

215
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:18,329
So.

216
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:22,978
What we did is we were working full-time jobs while working for a majority, I'd say about

217
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,999
90% of the development of some sanity.

218
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,100
Make sure we had full-time jobs.

219
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,023
We worked at nights, weekends, and that gave us the ability to make sure that we didn't

220
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:36,045
feel like we were rushing ourselves and make sure budget was really pushing us in decisions.

221
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:39,987
Give us time to just understand business, not just what the game, but also in those

222
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:43,389
jobs that we worked at, the corporate jobs we worked at, and allowed us to kind of build

223
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,329
our brand today.

224
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,271
So whatever that means for you, for us.

225
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:51,539
That was something that we knew we just had to have patience and prepare ourselves for the long run.

226
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:55,542
But it really gave us kind of this peaceful state of mind to be able to do both.

227
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:58,484
And I also feel like we're growing up with our game as well.

228
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,127
So having that business plan put together is really key.

229
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,849
And that was ours to make sure that we were able to kind of get into

230
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:08,771
the different conventions and showcase the way that we felt

231
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,472
were comfortable and wanted to present our title.

232
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,375
Speaking specifically to the game developers of the room,

233
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:16,136
I just want to say that you actually have a skill.

234
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:18,535
that while it is crafted for game development,

235
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:20,555
you have a skill that you can take to other industries

236
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:23,516
and work and get your foundation down

237
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:25,216
because things are just a lot easier

238
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:27,317
once you can fund yourself, not just for your game,

239
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:28,717
but just paying rent and stuff like that.

240
00:14:29,157 --> 00:14:30,198
As soon as you start crashing

241
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:32,978
because you don't have the means to make a living and stuff,

242
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,259
your game journey will actually burn out

243
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:36,199
way sooner than you want to.

244
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,620
So just specifically talking to game developers,

245
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,120
don't feel that you need to have a game development job

246
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,221
right when you start, right?

247
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:43,841
Like we said, we worked in sales.

248
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:45,041
I did sales for healthcare,

249
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:45,222
which...

250
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:49,674
I would personally, this has nothing to do with my personal interests, but it just laid

251
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:53,055
the foundation for me to then focus on my game on nights and weekends.

252
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,656
Had us understand business really well too.

253
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:55,156
Yeah, too.

254
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:56,937
So, that taking sales and things like that.

255
00:14:58,117 --> 00:14:59,698
So as you said, make a business plan.

256
00:14:59,718 --> 00:15:02,018
That's something you definitely want to do early.

257
00:15:02,338 --> 00:15:04,239
That means how do you establish your business?

258
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,620
Are you LLC, a partnership, things like that.

259
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,961
Learning about how your teams will be funded, learning about taxes, learning about what

260
00:15:10,981 --> 00:15:11,702
your goals are.

261
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:14,114
Defining what your success is.

262
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,194
Success is different for everybody.

263
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:18,635
I mean, success really depends on where you are,

264
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,616
where your happiness is with your title.

265
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:23,337
Knowing what that is in the beginning will help you define

266
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:24,498
where you should be putting your game,

267
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:25,458
who you should be talking to.

268
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:28,239
I listed some books up here that I read personally

269
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,240
that really helped me.

270
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,361
Some great stuff there that are really gaming focused

271
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,502
and some that are just strictly just talking

272
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:35,482
about how to start a business.

273
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,803
As I said, I feel like it's really important

274
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:40,564
to go outside of just gaming as far as business starting.

275
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:44,208
Because a lot of things you might miss if you just think about game development.

276
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:48,289
Because even some successful games out there, you know, they're the game developers,

277
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:50,490
but really the publisher is handling all the business part.

278
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,790
So if you're doing both, you need to make sure you understand what those publishers understand.

279
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,591
And they understand really the business part as well.

280
00:15:57,351 --> 00:16:01,252
Just one quick thing too about kind of once you start visibility is also to make sure

281
00:16:01,272 --> 00:16:04,232
that your social media, your press kit, and things are all set up.

282
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:06,133
Because you want to make sure all this hard work you put

283
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,053
into preparing your business is visual to the consoles.

284
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:14,354
To other press or anything that just give you more legitimacy and open doors for you

285
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:23,699
All right, so that's a perfect segue into showcasing and networking right so you have your good game you got your business plan created

286
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:28,282
We're looking good. You're looking good right we have we have our press kit so online. You know we have like a trailer

287
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:31,003
We have a demo now. We seem to show it off to people

288
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:36,083
This is one of our favorite parts is, you know, once you have everything together now, let's start to show it

289
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:38,304
You know, let's let's move around and show it off to people

290
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:42,084
I know some of this stuff is a little bit more difficult doing during these times

291
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:47,165
But we're pretty confident these times will event that these a convention stuff will eventually come back

292
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:51,426
But there's also a lot of like digital platforms that allow you to share to share your game for us

293
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:55,087
We built a lot of our brand off going to various showcases, right?

294
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:59,628
You guys know some of the big ones out there like your PAX East, PAX West

295
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,910
E3, DreamHack, things like that.

296
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:09,154
But there's also local conventions and stuff too that you can go to, right? So depending on where you are,

297
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:13,876
you'd be surprised what you can find when you just search, you know, local game convention, local meetups.

298
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:18,339
Especially if you're just getting started and you just need, you know, like 10 to 50 people

299
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,421
to come and try out your game and get some really genuine feedback.

300
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:25,823
Conventions are really good for getting people to test and play your game.

301
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:33,161
Getting eyes on your game from important influencers, YouTubers, podcasters, these guys always go to these conventions and whatnot.

302
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:37,684
And then also connecting to the distributors and whatnot in the industry.

303
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:43,567
One of the things with us is all the distributors that we actually connected with, Nintendo, Xbox, and Sony,

304
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:48,210
we met them at conventions, but we actually met them at very small conventions, right?

305
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,433
So we didn't meet them at your E3 or for Microsoft, we met them at a local convention in Boston.

306
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,225
that's actually held in a gym.

307
00:17:56,845 --> 00:18:01,206
We met our Nintendo contact at a small convention in Harlem

308
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,987
that might not be any more than maybe 300 people.

309
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:05,087
Yeah, Game Devs of Color.

310
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:06,147
It was a great convention.

311
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:07,587
Only about 500 people.

312
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:08,508
It was right in Harlem.

313
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,648
That started a great relationship with us

314
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:11,388
with Nintendo.

315
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,729
It's cool saying it's just like those small conventions

316
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:17,349
really were big for us to actually build

317
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,870
personal relationships with the publishers, the distributors.

318
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:25,644
of the platforms, and since we are self-published, that was very key for us.

319
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:28,745
We need to have a very one-to-one contact from a business perspective,

320
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:31,565
understanding how to get into, you know, the market.

321
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,646
And I just, the other thing I just want to add is that a lot of opportunities

322
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:38,446
are easier if you're actually going out there and networking.

323
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:41,147
And that doesn't always mean that you're flying around the world or anything like that.

324
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,967
But instead of, you know, just sitting behind your computer,

325
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:46,448
hoping people come to your game, you have to be aggressive, right?

326
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:50,148
So if you're, you got to send emails, you got to call numbers, you got to go shake hands.

327
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:55,358
If you don't go out and show people that you want them to play your game, people are unlikely,

328
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:58,960
they're not likely to just come to you and have this quick viral turnaround.

329
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,161
You want to make sure you're doing that outreach on your own.

330
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:03,442
Another thing too, we talk about building your brand.

331
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:05,904
For us, we always want to have a very consistent brand.

332
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:08,085
We just really love interacting with people.

333
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,245
So you see a lot of pictures here.

334
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:12,407
We're always taking pictures with cosplayers, we're always making sure we're running tournaments,

335
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:13,508
we're always interactive.

336
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:17,230
We found that that consistency, we wanted to make sure that was always there, whether

337
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,090
it was a big convention.

338
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,459
Or we're just throwing our TV on one single table,

339
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,721
wanting to make sure the experience is always the same.

340
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:28,724
We found that that was that the publishers and the consoles were actually

341
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:31,266
very keen to seeing how we actually took that approach.

342
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,507
And they would state to us, they said, honestly,

343
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:35,309
we just really like how you guys present yourself.

344
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:37,370
We really like your brand going there.

345
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,572
And that was important for us, and we're glad that kind of worked out.

346
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:43,134
So building your own brand, what that is for you.

347
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:47,786
As Kahlil said, there are a lot of digital showcases now that have a lot of eyes on it

348
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:50,808
and definitely things that people are paying attention to, but whatever works for you is

349
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:52,549
something you want to make sure you're consistent with.

350
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,932
So, yeah, just to review, one of our recommendations, like I said, there's a lot of ways to do this.

351
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,534
One thing that works for us is going to conventions with goals in mind.

352
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:04,255
What are you trying to get out of the convention?

353
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:08,196
Do I want to go to this convention so I can test play my game and get critical feedback?

354
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:10,077
Am I trying to go to the convention to get media?

355
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:11,898
So what do I need to do to attract media?

356
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:16,103
Have goals in mind, have strategies of how you want to actually accomplish those goals.

357
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:22,404
And then, like I said, a huge takeaway, small conventions, small showcases, small digital showcases.

358
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:26,125
Don't turn away from those just because you see that they have small numbers.

359
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,766
Numbers do not mean everything, right? Some of these have small numbers, but important influencers.

360
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,587
Some of these have small numbers of people who are definitely going to play your game, right?

361
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:38,587
So, if you have 10 people who love your game or are going to play your game,

362
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:41,148
grab those 10 people so they can share what they're following.

363
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,001
Yeah, and just getting that one person,

364
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:47,842
like we have people that just play our game

365
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:51,182
for a real long time, and that really have tested us.

366
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:52,983
And as Klaus said, Champion's such a great segue

367
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:56,764
into our next part, because when you do make

368
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:59,264
these connections with the consoles,

369
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:02,385
now there's a process of make sure you get approval

370
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:04,385
and the development of consoles.

371
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:06,806
And we do want to talk about kind of a few things,

372
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:09,326
the stories that we had as far as, you know,

373
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,326
building these connections.

374
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,187
Klaus said.

375
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:15,251
Having a champion is the most important thing I think,

376
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:17,853
and make sure of building kind of towards

377
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:18,754
a successful release.

378
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,935
So what is a champion?

379
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:23,538
For us, it's someone that is within that business,

380
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:26,060
whether it's Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, Steam,

381
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,642
that basically really likes your game

382
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,664
and can have some pull in meetings to say,

383
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:32,966
yeah, you guys, we should push this title.

384
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,788
It takes time to try to find that person.

385
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:37,630
It's always good to have multiple if you can.

386
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:41,763
But having a champion within these different businesses

387
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:43,885
will really get you to different places.

388
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:45,486
It might get you in different showcases.

389
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:48,108
It might also get you into different things

390
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:49,108
that are going through release.

391
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,611
For us, kind of one of the things we had

392
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:54,272
was going to like the Nini showcase

393
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:56,853
and building these champions to actually get us

394
00:21:57,314 --> 00:21:59,195
into these different available areas.

395
00:22:00,956 --> 00:22:01,997
The other thing, too, is when...

396
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:06,704
You have a champion, it might be someone at a different company, and people move a lot.

397
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:10,226
So we've had people where you want to make sure when you're talking to them,

398
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:12,167
you don't really know where they will end up being.

399
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:16,849
We have people that are now our champions, or we just talked to them and got along with

400
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,370
them really well that worked at a different company.

401
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,132
So building these relationships is very key, especially when you're self-publishing.

402
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:25,794
Because these are the people that you're going to be working with and getting to approval there.

403
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:28,676
And I mean, a champion doesn't have to be somebody who's working with the company, right?

404
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:31,397
It might be a person who runs a convention.

405
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:34,639
And while you're going and showcasing, because you see them walking around,

406
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:37,160
you go up and shake their hand and say, Hey, I'm Khalil, I work at Deepcoint Games.

407
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,340
Thank you for having me at your convention.

408
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,502
I like to work and get that conversation going.

409
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,603
You know, build those genuine friendships, those genuine connections

410
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,624
that become genuine business connections.

411
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:48,225
It's kind of both sides of the table on that one.

412
00:22:48,698 --> 00:22:53,941
Yeah, so, and that's key because you can always submit online to get approval on these consoles.

413
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:59,823
But, as you know, I kind of compare it to submitting a resume to a monster.

414
00:23:00,063 --> 00:23:01,964
It might just hit the bottom of the deck.

415
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:06,666
So I always feel like it's going to take time to figure out a strategy, how to meet these people face to face,

416
00:23:06,706 --> 00:23:09,507
or just in a different way where you can leave a lasting impression,

417
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,068
where they either see your game or see you.

418
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:13,969
Those are the things that would be very helpful.

419
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:15,968
So that's the approval part.

420
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:18,550
I just want to talk a little about development.

421
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,092
There's always things that you can't talk about on console,

422
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:22,513
but there's always those sorts of things

423
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,355
that you definitely want to make sure you understand.

424
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:27,057
When you're developing now for multiple platforms,

425
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:28,778
even though you're using something like Unity,

426
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:30,880
there's always things you want to make sure

427
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,402
you need to be prepared to develop specifically

428
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:34,383
for different platforms.

429
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:38,646
A lot of these things go into the certification process

430
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,328
that a lot of console developers know.

431
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:44,932
That it basically you need to go through testing to make sure your stuff is following a lot of their guidelines.

432
00:23:45,873 --> 00:23:51,498
If you do not plan this within your release cycle, this can really screw up things for you.

433
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,680
This process could take long for us.

434
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,623
Our first time going into it was pretty long for us because it's just a new experience.

435
00:23:58,344 --> 00:24:02,527
But making sure that you have that all planned is really key.

436
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:04,669
It's something that you want to make sure is there.

437
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,852
And you want to make sure, since we're using Unity.

438
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:12,404
One of the tips I have for you new developers is any of the assets that you're pulling off the store

439
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:16,426
and going into your product, make sure that they are console compatible.

440
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:21,128
Make sure that the support is there because if you might put yourself into a corner,

441
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:26,650
if you might, you know, something that ran really good on PC might not run very well on one of the

442
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,511
consoles, and you want to make sure that support is there. The more complex your game is, the more

443
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:34,213
you might, you know, have these different things come up. So a lot of things you got to handle,

444
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:37,534
a lot of hats you got to wear in order to release on all platforms.

445
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:41,367
Yeah, so just review on that.

446
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,488
Find a champion where you can for your game

447
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:45,910
across any organization, not just consoles,

448
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,810
but anything that can help.

449
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,292
Try to find you that champion, make a genuine connection.

450
00:24:49,732 --> 00:24:51,333
Don't just kind of use this deal.

451
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:52,434
Make a genuine connection with that champion

452
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:55,295
and then kind of utilize that for your own business purposes.

453
00:24:56,656 --> 00:24:58,557
Like I said, plan for console certification.

454
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:03,140
The majority of console development is that certification.

455
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,622
Chances are the actual core of your game

456
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:07,443
will actually be the same from console to console.

457
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:15,708
But the specific guidelines that you need to hit to follow these certification requirements for each console is where you're going to spend most of your console development.

458
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:21,611
The one tip I can say about certification that we learned is, and this is pretty consistent across all of them,

459
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:29,575
is when you're doing these things, there are SDK requirements, so these things might get upgraded and you want to make sure you submit these on time.

460
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,817
Especially if you're developing for multiple platforms.

461
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:37,972
Making sure you understand what that minimum requirement is in your third-party tools,

462
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,514
that you are able to support those.

463
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:43,214
Talking about SDK versions.

464
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:44,875
SDK versions is very key.

465
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:48,596
For us, since we are an online game that's cross-play,

466
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,477
we have tools that handle voice chat.

467
00:25:51,497 --> 00:25:55,038
We have tools that handle our architecture for the online play.

468
00:25:55,058 --> 00:25:56,599
We have tools that handle our controller.

469
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:59,780
To make sure those are all lined up for all platforms,

470
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:02,585
It's very key to know that consistent,

471
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:04,086
because that can change your release date.

472
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:05,247
That can change a lot of things.

473
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:07,688
So as one tip I'd say, probably the takeaway

474
00:26:07,728 --> 00:26:10,150
from what we're doing is make sure those are always lined up.

475
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,652
So make sure you have consistent releases across all platforms

476
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:14,953
you're trying to release on the same day.

477
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:18,716
All right, so we have a good game.

478
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:20,237
We got a business.

479
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:23,879
We've showed it, and we have now console approval.

480
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,400
Now we need to go to market strategy.

481
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:28,002
This is also another thing that we say,

482
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:29,523
you got to take a good amount of time.

483
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:34,253
to make sure you have because once you complete a game, just like any business,

484
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:41,196
you want to make sure that the game has time to get out to the public,

485
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:44,097
it has time for people to consume it, understand it.

486
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:47,759
And a lot of times I know you've been working so many years on this game

487
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,619
or whatever time you just want to get out to market.

488
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:54,321
You want to make sure you do take time so people can know what the game is.

489
00:26:55,332 --> 00:26:59,134
Maybe talk about a little bit our marketing strategy and how we did that or how we're doing that right now.

490
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:03,798
Yeah, so and we knew that especially being a first-time developers of our first game

491
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:10,042
regardless of how well received our game was in order to have the game played nationally or globally really

492
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:14,425
we needed to set aside enough time for us to spread that message to people and

493
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:17,808
we knew that with our current following we would not be able to spread that message ourselves.

494
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:22,311
So one of the things that we did is we leveraged console marketing or just leverage partners in general.

495
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:29,665
So some examples of what we did, we reached out to Nintendo early on and actually caught them right on time for their Spring Nindie Showcase.

496
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:33,729
That was broadcasted to millions of people around the world.

497
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:38,734
We did specific console events such as the ID8Xbox prepacks event.

498
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:42,197
Also got involved in ID8Xbox Summer Spotlight.

499
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:46,861
But reach out to these console guys early, especially if you have dev kits.

500
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:50,128
and find out exactly where and if you fit into their marketing plans.

501
00:27:50,188 --> 00:27:52,870
It's actually a set amount of things that they will give you by default.

502
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,232
But depending on what your relationships are with them,

503
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:57,273
depending on your game and how it fits with their brand,

504
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:58,634
they'll give you extra things as well.

505
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:03,017
Also, leveraging marketing partners in general, as you guys probably know,

506
00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:04,517
it's not just about the console guys, right?

507
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:07,139
There's certain whether they're streaming organizations,

508
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:08,660
maybe third party organizations.

509
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,302
Don't be afraid to reach out to these guys as well,

510
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:14,924
because they'll they actually have a lot of leverage in the industry also.

511
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:19,292
Especially if you're a small team like us who doesn't have a humongous following,

512
00:28:19,392 --> 00:28:22,134
leverage other people's following so that it can then boost yours.

513
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:27,057
Right, and we use examples like Razer and Unity. So we have our Razer products are

514
00:28:27,077 --> 00:28:31,500
compatible with our game using the Razer Chroma parts of the product. And you know,

515
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,583
they, as long as we're using dev kits that they provided and have in the game,

516
00:28:35,603 --> 00:28:39,846
they want to showcase that. They want to be able to promote that. Same with Unity. I mean,

517
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:42,728
you built a game on Unity, if they think it's great, you know, they're going to go share it

518
00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:43,688
through their channels as well.

519
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:49,398
This is our favorite bit of advice, but do not be afraid to ask for anything.

520
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:53,839
Literally, if you had a camera following us for everything that we've done,

521
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,600
the repeated pattern is we ask for something way out of the ballpark

522
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,821
to someone who's organizing an event.

523
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:03,421
We'll go up to them and be like, hey, we want our own room for our own tournament.

524
00:29:03,681 --> 00:29:05,822
We want 100 inch screen, actually 200 inch screens.

525
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,617
We want our own announcer and they're like, okay, we're actually going to give you a table

526
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:13,639
of two TVs and we'll put your tournament on our front page.

527
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,220
We're like, all right, cool, we'll take it.

528
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:20,343
Always go the full mile and if they scale back to half a mile, take a half mile.

529
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,664
But don't be afraid to ask.

530
00:29:21,704 --> 00:29:24,986
The worst thing they can say is a no and a no will never end your journey.

531
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:27,907
That is, if you remember anything, please remember that.

532
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:32,130
We ask for like just the most ridiculous things and sometimes we've gotten some pretty awesome

533
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,510
stuff.

534
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,811
So, as we were saying before.

535
00:29:35,468 --> 00:29:37,348
Take advantage of the console marketing.

536
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:39,369
That's just a lot of things are provided.

537
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:43,850
Like by default, I think a lot of developers might not know that once they're there,

538
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,130
but just make sure you plan and ask.

539
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,830
Plan that time for the certification.

540
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,711
That's very key.

541
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:52,972
And also, we talk about once you want to get your game out there,

542
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:55,092
you want to get reviews and get keys out there.

543
00:29:55,892 --> 00:29:57,092
Don't ignore the small press.

544
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:58,953
Building that hype within a small press

545
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:01,853
actually has the bigger press start looking at that as well.

546
00:30:02,294 --> 00:30:04,034
And that can really have a lot of impact.

547
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:04,094
So.

548
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,366
Make sure you spend time for that.

549
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:10,827
And then just kind of wrapping this up a bit,

550
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:12,167
this is an edit of process.

551
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:15,068
So don't be afraid if you're on step four

552
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:17,328
to go back to step three or even go all the way back to step one.

553
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:20,169
Just like development, chances are

554
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:20,989
when you're developing something,

555
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:22,409
you've got to compile it multiple times

556
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:23,330
before it actually works.

557
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,710
Don't be afraid to go back to the drawing board,

558
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,051
start over again, and go a different path.

559
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:32,072
This is an iterative, long-term process.

560
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:34,612
And that is it for the journey.

561
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:38,469
Thank you guys so much for being a part of this.

562
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:39,530
Just wanted to let you guys know,

563
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,692
we do have a Discord for Simsanity.

564
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,473
We love talking to developers up there,

565
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:44,454
and sharing our story.

566
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:45,435
Anybody, talk to anybody.

567
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:47,677
Or anyone, just really interacting, as we said.

568
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,539
Calls on social media, Decoy Games,

569
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:51,641

decoygames underscore official.

571
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:57,106
It's been amazing, I guess, tonight, in the future.

572
00:30:57,126 --> 00:30:58,447
We're playing Simsanity tonight.

573
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,189
Yeah, so love to play with you guys,

574
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:01,730
