1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,654
everybody. I just got the sign that the mics are now live so we can get started and try to

2
00:00:08,694 --> 00:00:13,837
figure out. So apologies first of all for not standing up but we kind of want to talk back and

3
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:16,879
forth and it's just a little awkward if we're constantly standing up and sitting down. So

4
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:23,343
we're just going to stay here and do it that way. My name is Paul. The title of this talk is a

5
00:00:23,383 --> 00:00:27,786
playful approach to prototyping. I think that's the title of the talk. And I'm Dan.

6
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:34,021
this is Dan Hurd. I'm the CEO and founder of Playful. Dan is the design director at Playful.

7
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:39,329
A little bit about who we are and what we've done very briefly because I'm thinking maybe you

8
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:42,354
guys might have some ideas about that since you are here.

9
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:46,869
The game we most recently worked on is called Lucky's Tale. It's

10
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,390
bundled with Oculus Rift. It's a third person character action

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,212
game. This right here is a picture of Lucky. We released

12
00:00:56,232 --> 00:01:01,294
this game earlier this year with Oculus. It's actually on the

13
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:06,436
box. And it's free to anyone who buys an Oculus. It's a pretty

14
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:09,236
short game. I don't know.

15
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:11,965
like to say three to four hours but really you can beat it in

16
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:21,290
like two hours. There's some surprising things about it in

17
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,952
terms of it being a third person game and all that kind of stuff.

18
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:27,374
What we're going to do today is we're going to use Lucky's Tale

19
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:30,436
and several other things we're working on to talk about how we

20
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:36,940
have been using prototyping as a studio in VR and try to give you

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,681
guys some thoughts and...

22
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:46,328
advice on, from what we've seen, kind of the front lines of doing VR work and our use of

23
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:51,869
prototyping to get that done. So I think we're going to talk about sort of three different

24
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,911
vectors on to that. The first thing is we're going to talk about how we use prototyping

25
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,452
during pre-production. So this is kind of using prototyping to figure out what we even want

26
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:05,793
to make. And there's kind of a chronology here, right? So.

27
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:12,842
So we'll talk about the early work we did with Oculus. We were, I think, maybe the first group

28
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:18,124
to actually work with Oculus at the very beginning. We're going to then talk about how we've

29
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:22,345
been using prototyping during development. And again, we'll be talking about Lucky's Tale and

30
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:27,946
kind of showing off some of the things that, well, nobody's ever seen before. There are things

31
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:32,747
that aren't even in the game. There's a lot of pre-production footage and prototype footage in

32
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:35,568
Lucky's Tale, things that maybe will show up in some future game.

33
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:40,389
And then the last thing that we're going to talk about is how we use prototyping to

34
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,151
Explore the frontiers and this is something that's that I mean

35
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:48,533
We're like right in the middle of but we're just kind of going to open the doors up a little bit into our studio and

36
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:54,955
Talk about how we're using prototyping right now to explore where we think VR could be going from here. So

37
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:01,358
This is a picture as I mentioned of the very first visit

38
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:05,771
to Oculus. This was during the kick starter when I first met

39
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:10,257
these guys and we flew out there and saw the very early duct tape

40
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:14,422
rift prototype. And I was like, I'm going to do this. I'm going

41
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:21,369
We had worked on some games before this. The last thing we worked on before Lucky's Tale was

42
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:28,254
Words with Friends. We had been through somewhat of a similar transition. We had been before

43
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:33,498
that making AAA games. We worked on Age of Empires series, Halo Wars. We left that to do

44
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,781
mobile games. That was this brand new set of problems and really all the things we learned

45
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:42,724
about making AAA games just didn't apply and we had to completely figure it out all over again.

46
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:47,285
We came up with a lot of prototyping processes during that. This was kind of that all over

47
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:51,346
again. That's how it felt to us. We showed up with these guys. They started asking us,

48
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:55,908
you know, hey, we love some of your previous work. Let's do something together. We said this

49
00:03:56,008 --> 00:04:00,409
device that you made is the most amazing thing ever. It feels like this moment again like the

50
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,990
first time we held an iPhone. This feels like that. So we want to do this again. And we'll

51
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,431
leave all the iPhone stuff behind and we'll do this now. We'll make VR games with you guys.

52
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:12,012
And of course the first thing they asked us is...

53
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:18,979
So okay, what are you going to make? What's your awesome idea? And there's kind of where the

54
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,645
problem landed at, my door stopped here. So okay. So I came home and said, okay, Dan, what's

55
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:29,430
our amazing idea? We want to work together. We want to make something in VR. So what are we

56
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:29,710
going to do?

57
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:37,137
So to be honest, we had absolutely no idea. I imagine a lot of you who are deving are faced

58
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:41,620
with similar things. Here's a whole new hardware set. So how do we even approach that

59
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,082
problem? There's just so many things you can focus on. So one of the things we didn't know

60
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:46,242
is that...

61
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:52,666
The set of things that was going to be really amazing in VR was probably something new,

62
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:57,108
something that was so tied to hardware, something that fundamentally changed the way that a

63
00:04:57,148 --> 00:05:03,832
game feels or controls. But we didn't know exactly what that was. So we said to set ourselves

64
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:09,395
up for success, for finding those things, we need to have as many kind of shots on goal

65
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:10,615
as possible. We needed to do

66
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:17,619
just a very, very rapid set of iteration with the focus of kind of communicating this idea

67
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,701
rather than even communicating full games. And we only had a couple of months to show what it

68
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:27,144
was that we wanted to make. So we kind of gave ourselves these numbers of

69
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:32,619
maybe we'll look at making about 30-ish games. If you think about maybe come up with 100

70
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,700
ideas of those, we're going to try and make 30 of them. Maybe of those, one or two might show

71
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,241
some sort of promise or something that allowed us to continue. But that was the scale that we

72
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:48,863
were looking at for this. So to accomplish that, we started to think about what is the

73
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,324
smallest, kind of leanest,

74
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:55,231
prototype team that we could come up with that allowed us to move very, very fast but didn't

75
00:05:56,532 --> 00:06:01,615
just go at this break neck pace without anything else that we would want, including art,

76
00:06:01,855 --> 00:06:07,378
including in many cases sound, anything like that. And we settled on a team that was

77
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:13,601
basically two programmers and myself as a designer. And that's where we spent most of our

78
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,182
time, just a very, very lean team.

79
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:19,889
team and then we eventually added a third programmer. So

80
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:22,950
everything that wasn't within the scope of our abilities, we

81
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:28,954
had to fake or hack to get it done. We didn't start off and

82
00:06:28,994 --> 00:06:31,455
say, oh, Oculus, we're going to make 30 games for you guys over

83
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,436
a couple of months. We really started off with them saying

84
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:40,322
transparent about, we're not going to tell you what to make

85
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:42,965
or what we think should be made here. We need to get our hands

86
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:45,829
on these dev kits. We need to spend time in VR and start

87
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,652
feeling what's working and figuring it out. And I think

88
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:53,417
we, you know, so we said, the way we're going to do that, as Dan mentioned, we're going to show

89
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:56,918
you a lot of different ideas. We didn't necessarily set out with the idea that we would be

90
00:06:56,938 --> 00:07:03,280
doing 30 games. But we just kind of felt, you know, we kind of felt desperate to explore this

91
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,041
really wide landscape as fast as possible, which is where this process came from.

92
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:11,363
Yeah, basically just find the things that just completely did not work and then those things

93
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:14,504
that did find promise and that was both a hardware and software problem.

94
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,243
and we were expecting to be surprised. To tie back to the mobile thing, going from that

95
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:23,986
transition from AAA game development to mobile, the set of things that ended up being

96
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:29,790
important and perhaps set products like Words and Friends or Angry Birds or Clash of Clans

97
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,333
apart from a lot of other folks that were building mobile games at the time, including

98
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:39,917
Electronic Arts building a Scrabble game. That's kind of a little bit of a case study.

99
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:42,979
Electronic Arts, the original version of Scrabble on mobile.

100
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:45,460
was very different than the original version of Wards of

101
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,702
Friends. It focused on a very different set of things. It was

102
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:50,163
very graphics heavy. It had a lot of sound. It was all these

103
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:53,225
things that they took as stuff that they were doing on console

104
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:56,807
and they just brought it on to mobile. We were focused on what

105
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:59,729
is it that's important about mobile as a platform. In that

106
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:05,093
case it felt like it was launch time, speed of getting into a

107
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,234
game and just playing it. You had to have these experiences

108
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,475
that lasted 15, 20 seconds because you're on a phone.

109
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,938
we just assumed the same would be true for VR. So going from

110
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:16,139
triple A game development and mobile game development now into

111
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,660
VR, we started with that assumption of we don't know

112
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,402
what's important about this platform yet, but we have to do

113
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:26,144
this process to begin to figure out what are actually the most

114
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:29,145
things we have to focus on to deliver the right things for

115
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:34,668
consumers. So the kind of the ‑‑ so the kind of the

116
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:39,088
Once we decided this was the density of prototypes that we

117
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:42,149
wanted and this is what our team looked like, then our focuses

118
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,090
were speed and playability. How many things can we put out and

119
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,491
through play communicate the absolute core of what it is,

120
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:51,071
even if we don't show what the game could be.

121
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:55,034
and we knew about seven prototypes a week. And we also

122
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:58,316
developed this kind of rough outline of four hours to live

123
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:01,138
for each of our game prototypes. So you have four hours to make

124
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:04,420
it to prove your point. If you can't do it, it's okay. We'll

125
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,822
set it aside. Maybe we'll visit it again later. But that's all

126
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:10,664
the time you should need to prove some sort of mechanic or

127
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:14,887
experience to prove that it could work. And for those that

128
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:17,388
didn't, we set them aside. For those that did, that would often

129
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:20,070
buy it the second half of the day, maybe even a little bit

130
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,270
more.

131
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,812
that's even kind of how we talked about it. We talked about these ideas in kind of a

132
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:29,435
Darwinian sense. If an idea couldn't make it past the first half of the day, then we would

133
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,617
force the team, I mean Dan and I would force the team to move on to the next idea if it

134
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:38,639
couldn't show promise in that first half. But games and ideas that we were prototyping

135
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,741
could by themselves the second half of the day or perhaps the first half of the next day.

136
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:47,282
But really we never, I mean if we're trying to do five to seven games a week, nothing could

137
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:50,243
ever get more than about a day and a half. You had to let it go. So that common designer

138
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:53,564
thing of you just don't see it yet, it's brilliant, but it's just beyond the horizon or

139
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:57,085
whatever, we weren't able to do that. Which hurt my heart.

140
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:03,588
But, you know, and the death ratio of these things is like so high, right? Again, that rough

141
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:08,430
wisdom that's kind of out there, which is like maybe one in ten ideas is even worth kind of

142
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,752
thinking about for a little bit, that applies here. And it was just so high, that meant we

143
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,913
just had to do as many as possible. So...

144
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:20,395
and what it actually looked like from Oculus' side is we would give them a drop every week at

145
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:24,457
the end of the week and it would be a document and a folder full of builds on Dropbox.

146
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,599
There would be anywhere from seven to ten, well, I think the lowest we ever did was five and

147
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:31,961
the highest we ever did was eight or nine. And we categorized them into two groups, it was

148
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:35,383
above the line and below the line prototypes. And above the line were ones that we saw

149
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:39,485
promise in and thought could go forward and below the line ones we were still showing them.

150
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:44,206
to show them our failures and our prototyping failures that we were doing because we thought

151
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:48,888
they were educational to some extent. Of course, they didn't always agree with us. Some of the

152
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:52,168
things that we thought were below the line they thought had a lot of promise and vice versa.

153
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:57,670
Yeah, and the document that we sent with that kind of was just one sentence like here's the

154
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,311
idea, just so it wasn't absolutely devoid of context. And here are the few things that we

155
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:05,012
like about it and here are the few things that we don't like about it. Just to give them full

156
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:06,372
context and we kind of ‑‑

157
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:10,595
said please look at those things only after you experience it and form your own opinions

158
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:16,319
about what you like and don't like. So I wanted to look at three of those ideas kind of plucked

159
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,262
from the 30 plus that we created. And they come from different points in that timeline. So

160
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:26,445
we're going to start kind of with earlier prototypes and show you then through the later

161
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:30,608
ones. I don't think we've ever really shown this stuff before so I think this is going to be a

162
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:31,609
cool opportunity.

163
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,791
So the discoveries that led to this first prototype were some

164
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:39,532
of those fundamental pieces of what makes VR really impactful.

165
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:41,432
And these were things we were seeing.

166
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:41,952
Oh, yeah.

167
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,693
This is not what we guessed or intuited in any way other than

168
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:48,014
we built a few things that in other prototypes may have

169
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,115
expressed it differently, but we said actually that one piece

170
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:50,855
was really cool.

171
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:53,436
And so some of those were physics.

172
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:56,217
Physics are just delightful in VR, especially when something

173
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:59,078
reacts roughly how you would expect it to when you poke it

174
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:00,518
or otherwise manipulate it.

175
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:05,581
very, very delightful. Things coming towards you are really

176
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:10,045
cool. Throwing things away from you is not as great. And the

177
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:13,207
illusion of life, small little characters, things just bopping

178
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,149
around. Even if it's not fully fleshed out, the fact that

179
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:18,971
something is moving kind of helps sell this narrative of

180
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,853
you're transported into this new place. There's this common

181
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:23,895
thread I think you'll see through several prototypes we

182
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,076
showed today where we

183
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:33,656
we're not, we're just, we're wandering on this uncharted frontier. And the set of things that

184
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:39,201
end up showing us promise, there's not a science behind it yet. I think it's like the dawn of

185
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:43,985
filmmaking. In 40 years, 30 years, we'll have a language, there will be books written about it,

186
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:46,147
academics, all this stuff. None of that exists right now.

187
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:51,309
So we have to use our intuition to say, well, okay, that feels

188
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:54,290
good. We don't know why. The example Dan used is what made me

189
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,972
think of this. Physics is an example of this. Maybe it seems

190
00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:02,013
obvious now, but heading into VR prototyping and development on

191
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:02,353
this stuff.

192
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:07,017
we didn't point out and say physics will be the thing that feels good in VR. I'm not sure. I

193
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:12,281
have theories why this is the case. There's several things like this. We'll talk about

194
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:17,745
miniature scale, the use of light mapping. They all have this common thread which is for some

195
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:20,207
reason these techniques are ‑‑

196
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:23,049
coupled with the headset and coupled with the sense of

197
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:25,470
immersion, they're working well. They're creating a higher

198
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,812
degree of sensation or emotion or presence than other things.

199
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:32,473
But the reason I say all that is this is not science. This is

200
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:36,095
still just an intuition driven process right now. So this video

201
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,616
that we're about to show kind of combines those several things

202
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:42,118
that we were talking about. I'll just get that started here.

203
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:44,999
And this is completely ridiculous by the way.

204
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:49,607
So what are they seeing here?

205
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,348
Right, so some of the context for what this is,

206
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:55,689
so you're a role here, you're a chef,

207
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,291
and we wanted to, a couple of cool things

208
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:02,792
that we discovered here was when you attach something

209
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:06,553
to your head, it was kind of cool and kind of bad

210
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:10,655
in the same breath, and it was just a very high fidelity

211
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:11,535
way to control something.

212
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:18,124
this was actually during when we didn't know what Oculus controller solution was. Half of our

213
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:22,630
prototypes were actually controllerless games. They were controlled through the gestures of

214
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,995
your head because we didn't know they were a controller. This was mostly

215
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:30,838
that way. We did, I think, eventually have a controller

216
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,461
button that we could press that helped you flip and sauté these

217
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:37,704
vegetables up in the air. But the idea was things, chefs

218
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,226
throwing vegetables to you, you would catch them in your plate.

219
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,568
That was the first skill. The second one is you'd throw them

220
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:44,389
up as high as you could, which is really delightful because

221
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:47,152
you'd see things go way up and then crash back down, catch them

222
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,514
all on your plate and you get a score for how high you sautéed

223
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:53,937
them. It's utterly ridiculous, but it kind of was a result of

224
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:54,878
several of those beats.

225
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,883
combination of some things that we were seeing working. For some

226
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,625
reason things that were close to you, there seemed to be this

227
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,448
sweet spot and we still believe this exists today with VR

228
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,489
headsets and I think it has to do with resolutions and other

229
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:11,772
technical things. Things that are right about here in arm's

230
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:14,875
reach are perceived to have a greater sense of depth and

231
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:18,618
presence. And so we wanted to put game play right there.

232
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,481
as Dan mentioned, physics was another thing. So this idea in

233
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,303
and of itself doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's the

234
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:27,286
combination of several of those concepts and saying how can we

235
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,068
make some prototype that combines these things?

236
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:34,712
Right. And so this next one is kind of a secondary approach,

237
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:38,776
which is, okay, that was a wholly new experience. We had

238
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:41,919
never played a game quite like that. So it was risky on a

239
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,401
couple different fronts, right? This next one was

240
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:49,203
Okay. So there are a lot of mechanics that exist already that we already love. We've played

241
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:53,544
many different games and fallen in love with parts of them over the years. So is there a

242
00:15:53,604 --> 00:16:01,446
mechanic or set of mechanics that when in VR or leveraging some part of all the control that

243
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:07,708
VR gives you, those things, can they become a better version of themselves? So how do we

244
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:12,529
reinvent a mechanic that we've seen before but just in this fresh new way that is bolstered by

245
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:13,329
VR's presence?

246
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,553
And so here's our example of that.

247
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:17,554
And the...

248
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:19,775
I hope somebody makes this game, by the way.

249
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:20,416
This was really great.

250
00:16:20,436 --> 00:16:21,716
This one was pretty cool.

251
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:24,618
So this was our Katamari prototype,

252
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,721
and it's based on kind of that central mechanic

253
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,463
that Katamari uses, which is roll things up

254
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:32,584
and stick them to the ball and get bigger.

255
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:35,346
But here's the cool thing about why this was

256
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:37,467
a really intriguing fit for us in VR,

257
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:40,710
is if you play the game in 2D...

258
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,570
Katamari.

259
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,411
Yeah, Katamari.

260
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:45,466
in 2D, what they're doing is they're saying,

261
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,289
well, here's the game about you getting bigger

262
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:48,211
and rolling up these things,

263
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:49,953
and the scale of the world just shifting.

264
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,696
And they would do that periodically

265
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:52,858
once you reached a threshold.

266
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:59,110
But that's actually VR superpower. So they had to fake it in 2D and say, well, this is kind of

267
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,993
where you break and now everything is just shrunken down. But in this prototype, we hacked

268
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:11,317
the IPD, the interpupillary distance, kind of moved your eyes further apart virtually and it

269
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:16,920
made you feel much, much larger. And we did that slowly over time. So as you rolled up all

270
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,421
these ingredients into your ball,

271
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:23,551
You don't know when, but at some point you're just like, I'm a giant. I feel like a giant.

272
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:27,534
And the quality of the ball and those pieces felt like a tiny little model.

273
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:32,856
And it's impossible to see on a screen like this because it looks the same. And that's the point.

274
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:36,218
The same thing in Katamari when you're playing that game on a 2D screen, even though the

275
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:40,441
perspective changes and you realize that house is now smaller, you don't get that sense. But in VR,

276
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:46,204
yeah, you're a giant at the end of this. And it happens so subtly over time, you can't even feel

277
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:46,704
the effect.

278
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:53,553
And one of the takeaways for us once we had kind of played with this experiment was that

279
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:58,099
scale shifts can be exceptionally powerful. At the time, there was no direct access to

280
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,521
modify that value.

281
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,461
supports it. Oculus has something in their SDK called

282
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:09,003
camera scale that was added in response to us breaking their

283
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:13,846
SDK and doing it ourselves. And you can change this value in real

284
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,427
time in the different game engines and get this effect

285
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:19,148
trivially. It's just a single number. It starts at 1.0, which

286
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,030
is a one to one scale. The other thing I just want to mention,

287
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,971
from a prototyping standpoint, this is a very powerful tool,

288
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:27,533
this camera scale tool, because at least with the engine that

289
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:29,994
we're using right now for most of the things we do, unity.

290
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:34,759
It's actually challenging to work with assets on different

291
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,702
scales because the unity editor doesn't let you change things

292
00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:40,004
like how fast the camera flies around and things like that. So

293
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:42,887
if you shrink the world down and you try to move the camera forward

294
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:45,610
an inch it flies past all your assets and this other stuff

295
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,571
becomes a real pain in the ass.

296
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:52,478
by using IPD you can build things at a normal game scale where a character is what unity

297
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:57,183
expects it to be, 1.5 meters tall and your trees are tree size and your houses are house size and

298
00:18:57,203 --> 00:19:02,109
then you can use, and we do this a lot in Lucky's Tale, you can use IPD to effectively get

299
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:06,433
whatever scale you want when the engine is running and when they're in VR and not have to deal

300
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:07,875
with all those editor problems.

301
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:14,303
And so this last prototype that we're going to show from the early days is we called it

302
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:19,886
Super Capsule Brothers. You might notice some of the inspiration. And it kind of hit us by

303
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:24,508
surprise because it's something that we did not expect, which was

304
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:29,151
here's whole hog kind of a type of game that we loved. But in

305
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:32,294
VR, third person for the first time felt very viable.

306
00:19:32,534 --> 00:19:36,597
Specifically, this demo sold us on that idea before it was very

307
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:39,359
much an outside shot from an idea perspective. And I remember

308
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,942
when this idea came to life, too, because as we're kind of

309
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:46,745
looking across this, as you can kind of see, we had maybe half

310
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:49,747
of our prototypes were brand new ideas that were crazy and the

311
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,609
other half were ideas where we were taking things that we

312
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:53,310
already loved and trying to map them into VR.

313
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:59,114
one of the things that came across our radar was games like Mario and these great character

314
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:03,497
action platformers. This was when I think Oculus started to tell us we would have a controller.

315
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:06,860
You give me a controller, those are the kind of games I want to play. We started talking about

316
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,744
it. Of course we went where everyone would go initially. How are you going to see over the

317
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:18,508
jumps you're making? It's not going to be making you sick and all this kind of stuff. And Evan,

318
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,029
who is the guy in these videos wearing the headset.

319
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,334
proposed this crazy idea, what if you're not the character and

320
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:27,678
what if you're just the camera floating next to the character.

321
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,882
And it sounded like the worst idea when we first heard it

322
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:33,886
because it just seems to go against everything you want VR

323
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:34,446
to be. Yeah, exactly.

324
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:42,531
And so, yeah, actually, it isn't moving. But some of the cool things that came out of this

325
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:49,476
prototype that, again, we carried forward were we messed with the scale a lot here, too. So

326
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:53,659
everything had a quality of a little model in front of you, a little toy. And you felt like

327
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,001
you had maybe scattered your toys in front of you when you were playing in the toy box.

328
00:20:57,121 --> 00:21:00,584
And that was directly building off of what the Katamari prototype showed us.

329
00:21:01,164 --> 00:21:04,427
It was. And there was this fantasy that I think we

330
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:11,313
we love to explore in games, which is I love to walk around and experience and explore the nooks

331
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:18,319
and crannies of the world. And this prototype, that hit us so hard that it's like, wait, I don't

332
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,623
have to deal with the abstraction of camera anymore, camera controls. I just look where I want

333
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:28,388
to go. I can peer down into the tunnels and I can see kind of far and I can visually judge how my

334
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:32,091
jumps are probably going to end up and not have that feel very abstracted.

335
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:35,993
And another amazing thing that happened here is all throughout our early work in prototyping

336
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:41,856
VR and still remains true, we struggle with locomotion like everyone else. You go into

337
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:45,437
these VR experiences and if you're just describing to a friend who has never tried VR before,

338
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:48,679
the friend might say, oh, it would be so cool, I want to walk through a park, I want to climb

339
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:52,741
a mountain, I want to do these things. As VR developers, you immediately run into the fact

340
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:56,762
that most of those things make you sick, at least the initial kind of implementation.

341
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:02,205
And for us, one of those core fantasies was like, I want to exist in a world, a beautiful world,

342
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:05,266
and say, oh, there's a mountain over there. I'm going to go to that mountain. There's a volcano.

343
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:08,528
I'm going to climb into the volcano or whatever, which is something you do in one of the levels

344
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:14,451
in Lucky's Tale. And this was this eye opening thing because it was the first prototype we had

345
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:19,393
ever built that allowed for continuous fluid locomotion through a 3D space.

346
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:23,677
that hit a certain comfort threshold. What you're seeing

347
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,060
here, by the way, in case it isn't obvious, is the first

348
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,123
prototype of Lucky's tail. When we saw this, we sent it to

349
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,506
Oculus and said, we actually want to make this game. We're

350
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:36,170
done prototyping. And up to that point we had been operating

351
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,011
actually kind of under this

352
00:22:37,652 --> 00:22:43,274
this idea that maybe we're going to actually ship a collection of mini games. So this

353
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:48,657
prototyping process dovetailed really nicely with that. And this was the game or the

354
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:52,139
prototype that kind of broke us out of that mold. And we're like, actually, I want to keep

355
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:58,062
playing this and I want to see what else is beyond that ridge. And so therein Lucky's

356
00:22:58,082 --> 00:22:58,562
Tale was born.

357
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:05,556
All right. So I want to move on to the second part, which is to talk about how prototyping is

358
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:10,119
now in use or has been in use. So fast forwarding a little bit. We signed that deal with

359
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:13,880
Oculus. We started working on Lucky Stoe. We worked on it for two years. What I want to give

360
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,983
you guys is just more of a tactical set of tips and tricks for the folks in the audience who

361
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:22,865
actually are doing live VR prototyping or thinking about doing it or thinking about building a

362
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:29,088
VR game. These are some of the things that we're using on a day-to-day basis to build our

363
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:30,208
games that are in production.

364
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:36,778
Okay. So there's just a list here and I want to go through these things. So the first and

365
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,464
kind of obvious thing that I think everybody is probably aware of is Unity rocks at this.

366
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:47,773
Like Unity has become the home for VR prototyping and VR game development because its

367
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,655
workflow is so

368
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:55,662
iterative. It allows you to come up with an idea and see it just a few seconds later in the

369
00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:59,686
headset. That's a breakthrough thing. There's nothing that has more of an impact on our

370
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:03,389
ability to move quickly with an idea than the ability to see that idea.

371
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:10,276
come to life, even in the most janky form, and anything that creates a delay, even a minute

372
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:14,940
delay between here's a thought I have, what would it be like if this thing was bigger and being

373
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:21,386
able to see it can kill the desire, even on an individual developer basis, to even ask that

374
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:24,309
question. And you're like, well, it's probably good enough and I don't want to go through a

375
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:26,211
build process or I don't want to do a bake or whatever it is.

376
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:32,255
Unity is built around that rapid iteration. The second point

377
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:34,696
here which really ties into that is Unity has the most amazing

378
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:37,578
thing with the asset store. We have a policy at Playful and we

379
00:24:37,598 --> 00:24:41,080
started this when we were tiny that if there's anything that

380
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,842
any developer wants to buy on the asset store, don't even ask,

381
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:46,884
just buy it and expense it. And we probably own three quarters

382
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:47,824
of the asset store right now.

383
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:50,986
And we do that because you break it down.

384
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:54,649
You say, well, how much is 30 minutes of a developer's time?

385
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:55,810
How much does that cost us?

386
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,972
And how much do these pretty high quality assets on the

387
00:24:58,992 --> 00:24:59,232
assets cost?

388
00:24:59,252 --> 00:24:59,632
They're incredible.

389
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:00,433
And they're all less than $50, $20.

390
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:02,734
Exactly.

391
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:04,635
And it's just like, well, you could spend an hour doing

392
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:07,117
that, but that's going to cost a whole lot more and slow us

393
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:07,337
down.

394
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,407
So we use the asset store daily. This isn't just about building prototypes that are for games

395
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:18,730
we haven't built yet. I'm talking about when we're working on Lucky Stale and someone has an

396
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,655
idea for a new coin effect or something like that. We'll go to the asset store first before we

397
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:28,060
even ask anybody to build that thing. It's just a natural part of our day to day process now.

398
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,322
Everybody uses that heavily as a resource.

399
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:35,786
It's a perfect frame of reference. It communicates the idea and you tweak the response to

400
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:39,709
that and the level of feedback you get. Once you have the desired response from your

401
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:43,231
audience, you say, okay, now we understand. Now we build it ourselves.

402
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:47,014
Sometimes we don't. In fact, we went to E3 the first time we showed Lucky's Tale. For the

403
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:48,355
folks who saw this, I think it was E3 2014.

404
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:55,631
half the game was asset store stuff. Not half. There was a ton of stuff. All the creatures and

405
00:25:55,651 --> 00:25:59,794
the bad guys. You would think going into that, we're going to show this to the public, we're in

406
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:03,517
the Oculus booth, everyone's going to be like, I can't believe you used these asset store

407
00:26:03,618 --> 00:26:09,102
assets. Not a single person noticed or mentioned it. So not that you should, I mean, you can

408
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:12,265
ship these things. They're all open licenses. You can put them in your games if you want to.

409
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:17,051
As Dan is mentioning, we tend to replace, by the time we finished Lucky's Tale, we were on

410
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:22,418
this quest in the last four weeks to make sure every last asset had been replaced by something

411
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:27,605
we had made. But those things will survive in our games for quite a while. So, I'm going to

412
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:31,989
kind of segueing from there, there's this asset on the asset store called ProBuilder that

413
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:36,532
some of you guys might have used. The reason I call this out is because in terms of creating

414
00:26:36,572 --> 00:26:40,856
VR environments, ProBuilder and specifically the combination of ProBuilder and the

415
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:46,281
light mapping engine in Unity is a godsend for rapidly building compelling VR

416
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,362
environments. So here's the thing, if

417
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:51,544
want to build a great looking house and I want you to feel

418
00:26:51,564 --> 00:26:54,565
like you're inside of a house, generally that's a difficult

419
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:57,286
problem requiring a lot of art and assets and other things

420
00:26:57,346 --> 00:27:01,248
that, you know, there's a lot of effort there. We found, and you

421
00:27:01,268 --> 00:27:04,349
can see this directly in the art style of Lucky's tail which has

422
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:09,211
no textures, is all mostly solid color surfaces, we found that

423
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:11,913
the combination of geometry,

424
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:16,694
and letting Unity's light mapper do the heavy lifting was

425
00:27:16,974 --> 00:27:21,155
like this magic trick for VR. We could take a cube and put a

426
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:23,236
light in it and run the light mapper and get something that

427
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:25,597
when you put on the headset was like, wow, I just really feel

428
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:27,277
like I'm in a real cube right now.

429
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:30,638
And that's a key word, feel, because that's something that

430
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,419
is hard to quantify and one of our main

431
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,144
just prototyping is. So sure it can also technically work on the screen. You may have

432
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:43,532
completed the task that you set out to do. But it's not accepted unless we've tested out in

433
00:27:43,552 --> 00:27:47,557
VR every single time. And that seems basic. But when you're going fast, sometimes that's

434
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:49,199
the part you're just like, I'm pretty sure.

435
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:55,441
it works. But feel is so strong here. And with ProBuilder and lighting, we've done several,

436
00:27:55,941 --> 00:28:02,123
many, many prototypes where we just need to rough out a space and when we do that, it can feel

437
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:08,006
real even though it even has default kind of ProBuilder grid texture all over it. The first

438
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:13,787
time I was ever truly fooled in VR development, unexpectedly, was through a VR

439
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:18,312
table tennis game we were prototyping and it was all done

440
00:28:18,352 --> 00:28:21,335
in pro builder and when I was done playing tennis I just went

441
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:23,437
to put my paddle down on the table and of course it crashed

442
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:26,881
to the ground and almost broke. But I had never been fooled in

443
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,903
that way and it was like ultimately it didn't matter that

444
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:31,606
there was a grid on it or that it didn't look exactly like a

445
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:33,008
table. It felt like a table.

446
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:39,412
The reason this is a magic trick is because Unity is doing all the heavy lifting here. It's a

447
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:42,754
pain and it takes time and it's getting better. Unity just announced a progressive light

448
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:49,259
mapper the other day that makes this way better. But anyway, ProBuilder, what it is,

449
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:52,060
it's a tool for building this geometry rapidly inside the

450
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,902
editor. If you have an idea for a tree, almost anyone can build

451
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:58,343
the shape of a tree using ProBuilder and you hit the

452
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,144
light map button, you set some colors on it and you can get a

453
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:04,426
surprisingly compelling result with no art and no work. I'm

454
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:07,047
not saying the art is incredibly important. The overall

455
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:10,328
aesthetic of Lucky's Tale is what it is because our artists

456
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,830
use those tools to make a cohesive scene that was lovely.

457
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,872
But it started off with these techniques and in fact, this is

458
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:19,192
kind of what...

459
00:29:19,712 --> 00:29:25,279
Dan is touching on. A lot of developers are not doing this right now. What I see more often

460
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:29,625
than not is using these super high end triple A game development techniques that we know and

461
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:34,150
love, things like normal mapping and specular mapping and all these things. Some of these

462
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,211
techniques are not

463
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:44,154
that accurate. They work great on a TV and you can't tell, but in VR with binocular vision and

464
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:49,598
all the things you get with a headset, your brain can tell that that specular highlight or

465
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:54,402
that reflection or whatever advanced technique isn't actually correct. And you don't, you

466
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:58,866
know, it doesn't leap out at you like that's wrong, that reflection is broken. But instead it

467
00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:03,590
just leaves this feeling of, I mean, I feel like I'm looking at a video game, not I feel like

468
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,370
I'm in an environment.

469
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:08,334
by using these simple materials, we sidestep that. So as I

470
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:13,819
mentioned, Lucky's tail ended up with just diffused surfaces on

471
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,883
almost everything with color and high quality light mapping. The

472
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:20,605
other side benefit of that is it forced us to have high

473
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:23,648
geometry. If you're looking at a surface like a plank of wood,

474
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:29,590
the difference between putting a texture of wood on that and carving out the divots, again in

475
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:35,131
VR is a night and day thing. You move your head a little bit and you can see the parallax in

476
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:40,052
the details of the geometry and you buy it way more and it creates that sense of presence. The

477
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:45,054
last thing we wanted to mention here is just the strength of programmer animation. So, you

478
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,834
know, we would have an idea for a creature.

479
00:30:48,021 --> 00:30:51,226
and we want to build a concept and create the mob and animate

480
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:54,670
them and do all these different things. What we found is we

481
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,175
could get so much use out of this basic ‑‑

482
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:06,087
set of techniques. This comes from Disney. This is quite old. This is a great thing. You can

483
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:12,349
actually find videos on YouTube about this. This is a one‑pager. These are the basic principles

484
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:18,052
of motion design for animation. You can take just a square, just a cube, and make it feel

485
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:23,814
delightful and come to life. This is especially true in VR using these techniques. We use this

486
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:28,276
all the time. Before we even know what a mob is going to be, we can take a cube and make it

487
00:31:28,296 --> 00:31:29,516
something you want to endlessly play with.

488
00:31:30,037 --> 00:31:32,138
in VR using these core techniques.

489
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:33,519
Just scale it at the right time,

490
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,340
give it a little bit of a sound effect,

491
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,381
just give it a wobble, a slow down.

492
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:38,982
Those things are very, very impactful.

493
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:42,144
But more importantly, when we're prototyping very quickly,

494
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:45,606
they enable us to not say, well, it's good enough,

495
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:48,368
but it doesn't read correct, but we don't have an animator.

496
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:50,069
It allows us to do several things

497
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,690
that a programmer can very quickly whip up.

498
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,453
going to go through a couple of these pretty fast. We really want to talk about the last

499
00:31:57,673 --> 00:32:02,275
section of this. Just the thing I wanted to say here is when you're doing this process you

500
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,958
may feel like a little bit of a fraud. We did sometimes and we still do sometimes. The

501
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:11,740
reason is because we come up with an idea and then we go to the asset store and we

502
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,102
download 50 different things and we wire them up in the most hacky way possible in unity.

503
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:18,343
We finished a prototype, here Oculus,

504
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:19,564
look at this amazing thing we made.

505
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:22,565
And we maybe wrote 20 lines of code

506
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:24,305
and basically just wired things together

507
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:25,986
and we used this, we're cobblers,

508
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:27,506
we're not game developers when we're doing this.

509
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:31,108
But we gotta get past that because the point is

510
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:34,068
to come up with these ideas and do the most rapid thing

511
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,729
to showcase the potential of them,

512
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,430
to prove that they deserve to have more time

513
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,591
and more investment and that's really our job

514
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:41,171
at the end of the day.

515
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:45,935
it's to build the experience and not to build the game. The moment we start building the game,

516
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:49,599
we're already sunk because we're solving all those really hard problems that come with

517
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:55,465
making a cohesive experience like that. So we wanted to kind of wrap up this section by

518
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:57,227
talking about some of the problems and that's one of them.

519
00:32:57,688 --> 00:32:59,270
You know, one of the other techniques we use

520
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,872
from a prototyping standpoint, the studio,

521
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:01,994
is we run these game jams.

522
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:03,216
Game jams are very expensive.

523
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,619
We take the whole studio, we spend a couple days doing this.

524
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,563
It's always a fight with management, of which I'm a part,

525
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,047
to make these things happen,

526
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:12,329
but they're always valuable to us.

527
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,571
But one of the things that I see universally happens

528
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:17,033
with game jam teams, half of our teams,

529
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:18,694
well I don't know, some percentage of our teams

530
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:20,856
will just, you know, no matter how many times we say this,

531
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:23,798
they'll get hung up in, okay, I'm gonna make an RTS.

532
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:25,199
That's my game jam thing.

533
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:27,020
I want to show what a VR RTS could be.

534
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:28,922
And then they start listing out all the things

535
00:33:28,962 --> 00:33:30,223
that a VR RTS would need.

536
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:31,704
We're gonna need pathing, we're gonna need,

537
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:34,486
you know, units that have certain,

538
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:36,908
we're gonna need hit points and stats and game balance

539
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:37,389
and all these things.

540
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,670
And then they are like, okay,

541
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,552
and then they spend the three day game jam building pathing.

542
00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:46,176
and at the end of that they have some units passing around and nothing about that

543
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:51,060
demonstrates what would be compelling about a VRRTS. The flip side of that is we'll have

544
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,044
teams that throughout that process are like, okay, what, and they're being really honest

545
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:58,186
about it because they might want it to be a VRRTS.

546
00:33:58,426 --> 00:34:01,429
and we actually had this video we cut out of this. There's this one thing we did, it was a

547
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:06,674
tactics VR, it was a room scale tactics thing. And they had this big idea of doing this

548
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:10,818
turn based tactics game. One of the things they started, that they threw in there at the

549
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:14,281
very beginning of that was a dice mechanic where you could pick up, scoop up a bunch of

550
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:16,243
dice and throw them on a board and they would roll around.

551
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:21,571
that was where the fun was in that prototype. They focused on that and put a lot of effects

552
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:26,319
and things in the dice and that made for a much better result than if they had tried to

553
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:29,505
actually stand up a fully working tactics game in VR in just a few days.

554
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:35,853
right? And you know, something that's not immediately intuitive, but so having been a part of a lot of

555
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:40,359
these R&D teams is, so you're working on this stuff and you're going really quickly and you're

556
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:45,105
building a lot of prototypes, but realize kind of, especially in the context of a larger

557
00:34:45,246 --> 00:34:49,611
organization, you know, so we have actual game teams building and shipping products.

558
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:54,354
and you're on this prototype team and you're like wow that's nice it must be nice to ship

559
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:59,180
something and to feel accomplished and show people your work right? You may not think it

560
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,624
would seem that way because it might be like oh that's so cool I get to just prototype a bunch

561
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:06,889
of stuff but it's pretty fatiguing. You open all these loops and rarely do you ever get to

562
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:07,289
close them.

563
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:12,654
So we have to be very, very cognizant of what we call prototyping fatigue.

564
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:15,316
Which is, you may not realize it, but it creeps up on you.

565
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:20,360
And we kind of like to, and we're defining this as we keep working on this, making it better.

566
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,483
We let people come in, and when they're burning with ideas,

567
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:27,546
and we let them prototype, and then when they start getting fatigued...

568
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:38,630
We rotate them out. We look at our R&D teams and prototype teams as tours of duty. We kind of

569
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,111
separate that out from the process of shipping something. It's a really enjoyable process,

570
00:35:43,131 --> 00:35:46,272
especially if you just shipped a game or you've been in production for a while to go and

571
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:51,754
participate in this for a while. But it gets on fun over time just because of the, you know, you

572
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,356
can fall in love with something and then it's immediately, let's move on to the next thing.

573
00:35:56,396 --> 00:35:59,757
So anyway, that's how we balance that across the studio. The other thing I just wanted to call

574
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:04,878
out here is, well, first two things. These new ideas and these prototypes, they have to be

575
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:10,220
protected because they're, as Ed Catmull says in the book Creativity Inc., they're ugly,

576
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:17,682
awkward babies. And they are. They're so easy to kill them with the wrong words of critique.

577
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,563
And we have to protect those things a little bit. The other thing is for us,

578
00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:26,030
we just have to figure out how we're defining success. This is more, it's kind of an aside,

579
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,538
it's a little bit of a culture thing. Every time we, as Dan was saying, every time we dive

580
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:34,205
into one of these prototypes, we ask ourselves what do we want the player to actually feel?

581
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,942
And despite this being a key part of our culture, we still get lost on this all the time and

582
00:36:40,962 --> 00:36:45,223
we'll find ourselves working on something and saying things like, this could be the next

583
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:51,125
clash of clans. And it just doesn't ‑‑ none of that ‑‑ we're so lost when we're saying

584
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:52,685
things like that because ultimately ‑‑

585
00:36:54,402 --> 00:37:00,685
the way we define success is did we set out with a vision and at the end of that someone was able

586
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:07,907
to play it and they said I felt this and that thing unprompted is what we said when we set out.

587
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:11,328
And so like Lucky's Tale is a good example of this for us recently because when we were

588
00:37:11,348 --> 00:37:14,929
building that game we used these phrases, we said we want it to feel like you're on a Disney

589
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:17,490
ride. We want it to feel like for some people.

590
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:23,473
the first time they played a game like Mario 64. Then we released this thing into the wild and

591
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:28,536
we go on Reddit and we're reading people saying it's like the first time I played Mario 64.

592
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:33,079
And other people saying it's like being on Pirates of the Caribbean or on Small World or

593
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:37,941
something. And there's no greater measure of success for us than that. Even if it sells five

594
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:42,364
copies. If that can happen, then we're being successful in terms of taking a vision and

595
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:45,125
translating it into a final product using ‑‑

596
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:49,227
this prototype. I think that's the strength of VR. That's the promise here. I can make you

597
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:54,989
feel something even more impactfully than we've been able to do before that. So. Okay.

598
00:37:55,029 --> 00:37:59,451
Here's the result of some of these things put into practice. This is a couple minute video

599
00:38:00,171 --> 00:38:04,793
of Lucky's Tale I mentioned at the beginning. Things that have shipped and a lot of things

600
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:05,193
that haven't.

601
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:17,921
So this is all pro-building.

602
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:28,838
you play lucky cell you recognize how many things we have not shipped yet. Okay. Last thing

603
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:36,046
we want to talk about. We'll try to go as fast as we can. We have 15 minutes left. So this is

604
00:41:38,357 --> 00:41:41,982
something we're working on right now. We want to use this last

605
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:46,789
section of the talk to give you guys a glimpse, really the first

606
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:48,931
time we've even talked about this or mentioned the name of

607
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:53,618
this, into something that we're working on right now and to

608
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,622
explore the boundaries of what ‑‑

609
00:41:57,703 --> 00:42:01,766
where VR could go from here and specifically where social VR might be going from here which is

610
00:42:01,806 --> 00:42:06,489
really fascinating to us. Just some caveats. This is not a product announcement. This is just a

611
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:11,392
glimpse into our R&D labs. We don't have a product to announce here. This may never turn into

612
00:42:11,452 --> 00:42:17,216
anything and the last thing I want to do is disappoint someone. But this is, you know, for the

613
00:42:17,236 --> 00:42:22,379
sake of this talk and talking about prototyping, I think a useful view into what prototyping

614
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:24,480
looks like right now today at Playful.

615
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,203
this is kind of like a container, like a fictional container that we want to pour in all of this

616
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:36,386
new prototyping that's specifically geared towards social VR and social connection. And so it

617
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:42,930
helps us talk about it to other people and even to ourselves internally. It's almost like a

618
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,231
laboratory. That's what Wonderland has become for us right now. So we have all these

619
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:50,854
questions, these things that we're fascinated by when we think about social VR.

620
00:42:51,814 --> 00:42:55,675
and we created this project as a container, a playground

621
00:42:55,855 --> 00:42:59,896
effectively for us to run those experiments and learn and do

622
00:42:59,936 --> 00:43:04,358
this work. So why that? Why Wonderland? Why this vector? So

623
00:43:05,218 --> 00:43:09,279
we've been doing this work in VR now for three years and even

624
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:11,860
since the beginning, especially since I got that very first DK

625
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,181
1 headset and it came in this polycarbonate case with foam and

626
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:17,021
everything and I felt like I was living in a William Gibson

627
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:17,261
novel.

628
00:43:18,882 --> 00:43:22,424
And certainly since then, especially now recently with some of the things that you guys are

629
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:27,028
seeing that Facebook is showing off and where it seems obvious that these things are headed

630
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:32,411
when you think about social VR. This is what comes to all of our heads. It's the metaverse.

631
00:43:32,892 --> 00:43:37,055
This is the ultimate dream of what it would be like to be in VR.

632
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:41,798
in a world with other players or people and experiencing this

633
00:43:42,638 --> 00:43:48,621
incredible alternate reality. These are some of the books that

634
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:52,844
obviously inspire us. There's tons of other media, too. So

635
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:55,405
this is what we're all dreaming about. And the question that I

636
00:43:55,445 --> 00:44:01,528
have for us and for the studio is, so if this will exist in the

637
00:44:01,568 --> 00:44:03,890
future because we all collectively are dreaming about

638
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,991
this thing as a society, when will that happen?

639
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:14,456
and when I look at things like the Vive or Oculus Touch, what I see is the dev kit for that

640
00:44:14,496 --> 00:44:19,418
future. I don't have any false expectations that the Vive is going to go on to sell millions and

641
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:24,240
millions of units and become the tool for the metaverse, but I can see the light at the end of

642
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,182
that tunnel now. These things are inevitable. These devices will turn into a pair of

643
00:44:28,222 --> 00:44:33,445
glasses and they'll be mass market consumer devices in just some number of years depending

644
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,246
on what you believe. Maybe 5, maybe 10, maybe 3, who knows?

645
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,431
But the point is, if that's where we're definitely heading,

646
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,831
when is it too early or too late

647
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:44,172
to have started to work on that thing

648
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:45,152
if we're interested in it?

649
00:44:46,252 --> 00:44:47,993
And my answer to that is now.

650
00:44:49,073 --> 00:44:49,733
Now's the time.

651
00:44:51,034 --> 00:44:52,214
I mean, some of those questions,

652
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:54,255
they can be easily worked on right now

653
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:56,255
because they actually are affecting

654
00:44:56,715 --> 00:44:58,016
the current products we're making,

655
00:44:58,076 --> 00:45:00,997
their challenges, huge outstanding challenges

656
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:02,797
for making games in VR in general.

657
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:04,818
And they can mature over time

658
00:45:05,278 --> 00:45:06,838
into kind of these final solutions.

659
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:11,188
And you know, the way that I think about this as the CEO

660
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:14,130
playful is I don't really think about this too much in terms of

661
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,753
going for the long-term goal of this. Because like I said, I

662
00:45:17,793 --> 00:45:20,174
don't think that can even exist today with the way the hardware

663
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:22,116
is and how expensive it is and all these other things. So I

664
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:25,358
can't really build the metaverse yet. But I think I can start to

665
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:25,799
figure out...

666
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:32,447
pieces of it and things that need to be figured out in advance of potentially being part of

667
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:37,473
building that together with hopefully you guys. Of course our version of what the metaverse

668
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:42,500
looks like is not necessarily what's on the covers of these books. We think about it

669
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,503
something more like this maybe. I don't know.

670
00:45:45,563 --> 00:45:46,464
It's a happy place.

671
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:47,745
It's a silly place.

672
00:45:47,985 --> 00:45:53,330
Yeah, we draw inspiration from games like Animal Crossing and from these kind of lighthearted

673
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,853
worlds that, you know, because when I think about where do I really want to hang out,

674
00:45:56,893 --> 00:45:59,115
I basically want to hang out on Main Street in Disney World.

675
00:45:59,395 --> 00:46:03,218
If I'm given the chance to escape from reality, and of course I grew up in Miami and went

676
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:06,300
to Disney World when I was a kid, so that's where I draw inspiration from.

677
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:10,296
everyone, different companies have different takes on this.

678
00:46:10,617 --> 00:46:11,558
This is our take.

679
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:13,200
We want to give that delightful,

680
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,402
and again I mentioned Animal Crossing,

681
00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:16,584
because it is such a wonderful example of that.

682
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:18,827
Animal Crossing is this place that

683
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:20,209
it's almost less about the game

684
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:22,612
and more about your experience of just living in that world

685
00:46:22,632 --> 00:46:24,154
and the ambience of it.

686
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:25,255
It's an escape.

687
00:46:26,403 --> 00:46:30,407
And currently we can just hang out in an alleyway if we want today. So this is something

688
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:38,094
we can't do today. I can't live on an island like this easily. Okay. So this is an immense,

689
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:39,875
immense problem space.

690
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:44,425
I couldn't list off all the things that need to be solved by us as a community of VR

691
00:46:44,445 --> 00:46:50,968
developers to begin to realize the full dream of the metaverse. But let's just talk about

692
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:56,390
some of them and we'll give you guys a view into our prototyping against some of these

693
00:46:56,431 --> 00:47:00,212
problems. So kind of going down the list, as I mentioned, this is a short list of some of the

694
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:06,595
immense problems we face. Let's pick three of these and show you guys kind of our live

695
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:08,376
prototyping against those problems.

696
00:47:08,865 --> 00:47:15,290
Right. So we're going to live in this little or spend a lot of time in this new place. So we

697
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:20,834
need some sort of representation of ourselves. And we've seen a lot of, even existing

698
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:26,219
currently, a lot of different approaches to avatars and to what that can mean for your

699
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,602
ability to express yourself. Most notably, we've seen a lot of just like the head and the

700
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:34,345
floating hands. Specifically because bodies are really difficult.

701
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:38,360
well and it's also, I mean it makes sense right? VR headsets right now can only track your

702
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,763
head and your hands. We don't have, there's not a consumer grade solution for tracking your

703
00:47:42,803 --> 00:47:46,546
entire body yet. Although it seems obvious that will be coming. But because of that, I think a

704
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:50,709
lot of developers are choosing to say, okay, we'll just show the floating head and hands.

705
00:47:51,029 --> 00:47:56,253
But for our goals here, which is I want to feel present in a co-location,

706
00:47:57,546 --> 00:48:00,950
I want to be co-located with another avatar and feel very present in that world.

707
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,252
Bodily present.

708
00:48:02,552 --> 00:48:03,954
We need to have a body.

709
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:04,334
And so...

710
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:06,056
Well, that's what we saw from our prototypes.

711
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:08,179
Because we did try all the versions of this.

712
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:12,604
We tried floating heads, floating torsos, all this kind of stuff.

713
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:16,009
We just kept coming back to that when we did do the full body rig.

714
00:48:17,265 --> 00:48:21,789
it felt more like I'm here with you than any other version of that that we've built.

715
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:26,472
And it works, you know, we've done some work to kind of help make it feel better and obviously

716
00:48:26,492 --> 00:48:31,035
in this prototype phase it's not about getting it perfect, it's about communicating gestures, big

717
00:48:32,236 --> 00:48:36,759
emotions through the face or through cartoon effects and just big gestures and we think

718
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:40,722
over time those animation quirks and things will actually will get better.

719
00:48:42,488 --> 00:48:46,772
Yeah, along those lines, one of the things that we've recently started to think about

720
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:51,597
in when it comes to avatars for social VR is we've started to think about it more as

721
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:54,380
puppeteering than avatars.

722
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,103
You know, there's just, and this again, we're a game company, right, so we're going to be

723
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:02,107
drawn to stuff like this, but we just have so much fun when we create these leveraged

724
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:08,110
things that you can do with your avatar so that, oh, if I go like this and I just make that

725
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,571
gesture, my whole avatar responds to that. I make a face, I do all this stuff, I have these

726
00:49:12,651 --> 00:49:16,632
cartoon effects that come off of me. And what happens over time is you start to play that as a

727
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:23,073
game. Oh, it's so much fun to control this puppet that is me. And, you know, it's delightful and

728
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:27,615
fun. Beyond just being an avatar. We're putting on a show for our friends, right?

729
00:49:29,552 --> 00:49:34,695
So another one is locomotion obviously. So we have some avatars co-located together.

730
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:40,078
So how do we move from place to place? How do we explore this interesting world we've created?

731
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:46,981
And so we are using in our prototyping right now, we've done a couple different approaches,

732
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:50,663
so there's a lot that is out there right now that focuses on teleportation.

733
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,197
which has... We were convinced for quite a while that that was how this had to be solved.

734
00:49:54,217 --> 00:49:59,398
We went in with that because one of our goals was, so say that you're standing right next to

735
00:49:59,438 --> 00:50:04,739
me and I want to hand you something. Well, if we're teleporting around, maybe one of the

736
00:50:04,759 --> 00:50:08,400
things that happens is I hand it, but a real world wall is right in the way between us. And

737
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,301
then I'm like, well, how do I get to you? Do I need to kind of teleport back and then kind of

738
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:18,082
rewalk forward? And there's all this complexity around that. And you lose complete idea of

739
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:20,543
where you are in space in the real world. And so...

740
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:26,647
first attempt at this was we'll teleport and we'll stay here to

741
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:30,850
kind of the chaperone area. An example of this is we were just

742
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,871
dealing with simple things like a kitchen. So you're sharing a

743
00:50:32,911 --> 00:50:36,313
kitchen with a friend in VR, social VR. If I, if I, if I

744
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:42,419
If my space, my room scale space isn't mapped exactly to yours, I could be standing over by the

745
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:46,883
fridge and say come over here and look at what's in the fridge. You might start to try to walk

746
00:50:46,923 --> 00:50:50,486
with me, walk towards me and run into a wall because you're actually standing on the edge of

747
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:55,110
your space. You can see this problem exist in lots of different social VR applications right

748
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:59,214
now. One that I love is the pool nation guys. It's a good example of that. You can share

749
00:50:59,234 --> 00:51:00,014
your playing of the space.

750
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:04,358
pool table but you're constantly losing your orientation within your room and having to

751
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:09,323
manage how do I take steps back and re-teleport and get aligned with my friend. This isn't so

752
00:51:09,363 --> 00:51:14,608
much a problem in single player VR experiences but in social VR experiences where that space

753
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:19,533
between you and another person feels like, yeah, and if there's actually a physical wall there

754
00:51:19,573 --> 00:51:21,935
but you don't know it, it causes a ton of problems.

755
00:51:23,136 --> 00:51:28,242
So it took us a while to be very candid with ourselves that actually our current approach was

756
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:32,746
fighting against our goal which was still unifying this connection between social avatars.

757
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:38,132
And so we ended up kind of rolling our own version of something that electric night owl had

758
00:51:38,232 --> 00:51:40,515
worked out which is the arm swinger locomotion.

759
00:51:41,856 --> 00:51:46,581
and kind of our thoughts behind that was, well, how can we make those controls fade into the

760
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:50,846
background even more? So I'm not fumbling in the dark for some sort of D pad control that

761
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:55,551
pushes me forward. And for those of you that don't know, it's essentially kind of grab the

762
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:57,313
controllers and swing your arms like you're walking.

763
00:51:57,873 --> 00:51:59,875
and it's not a smooth forward progression either.

764
00:51:59,935 --> 00:52:02,458
It's kind of like a halting forward motion

765
00:52:02,498 --> 00:52:04,100
that you might expect if you were walking.

766
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,922
And these aren't perfect solutions.

767
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:09,085
That's one of the main things we wanted

768
00:52:09,145 --> 00:52:10,666
to really underline here.

769
00:52:10,706 --> 00:52:12,748
But these are approaches that we're currently.

770
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,230
we like more than we dislike for various reasons.

771
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,191
Yeah, the thing that's neat about Arm Swinger,

772
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:20,272
that we were running into when we had teleportation,

773
00:52:20,392 --> 00:52:21,793
is again, you'd have these moments of,

774
00:52:22,693 --> 00:52:25,374
okay, let's go over there and follow me,

775
00:52:25,974 --> 00:52:27,575
and then you'd have to follow this, like,

776
00:52:27,975 --> 00:52:29,796
teleporting trail of the other person,

777
00:52:30,076 --> 00:52:31,457
and it didn't feel at all like

778
00:52:31,517 --> 00:52:32,617
taking a stroll with somebody.

779
00:52:32,637 --> 00:52:33,758
Yeah, it totally broke the fiction,

780
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:36,079
because in this world, things are persistent.

781
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,840
Things have weight, and the moment you teleport,

782
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:39,980
it breaks that.

783
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,781
It breaks it for anybody who witnesses it,

784
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:43,042
but it also kind of breaks it for you.

785
00:52:43,342 --> 00:52:51,609
breaks the social. And breaks the concept of distance. So the

786
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,893
last set of, well, one of the things we've been focused on,

787
00:52:55,913 --> 00:52:58,015
another big thing we've been focused on is the persistent

788
00:52:58,296 --> 00:53:02,840
living world aspect of this. So one of my favorite experiences

789
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,063
I've had in VR, and I think a lot of us have had, is the lab

790
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:07,044
that was built by Valve.

791
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:11,708
This was shipped with the Vive. It's the neatest thing. It's got a collection of different

792
00:53:11,728 --> 00:53:15,853
experiences. They're all tied together by this lab environment where really you're just

793
00:53:15,873 --> 00:53:20,458
supposed to walk around and teleport inside of these different mini games, right? Well, after

794
00:53:20,478 --> 00:53:24,882
I played all those mini games, I found myself returning back to the lab just to hang out in

795
00:53:24,922 --> 00:53:28,006
that space. And there's a dog there and there's like a white board you can ride on and

796
00:53:28,026 --> 00:53:29,487
there's a couple of little toys you can play with.

797
00:53:30,268 --> 00:53:32,229
And then there's these forklifts and stuff driving around.

798
00:53:32,249 --> 00:53:36,152
And anyway, it just felt like the most real virtual space

799
00:53:36,192 --> 00:53:37,793
that existed in VR at that moment.

800
00:53:37,853 --> 00:53:39,874
And I just wanted to spend time in there

801
00:53:39,894 --> 00:53:41,275
and really get a feeling for it.

802
00:53:41,315 --> 00:53:44,317
So I did, I spent a couple hours in the lab.

803
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:45,098
And I did all this stuff.

804
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,158
I drew things on the whiteboard,

805
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:47,539
and I played with the dog, and I did all these things.

806
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,921
And then I had the most disappointing moment

807
00:53:50,321 --> 00:53:52,903
when I came back the next day and that was all gone.

808
00:53:53,423 --> 00:53:58,010
the dog was back where it started. Nothing I had written on the white board was there. All

809
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:02,576
the changes I made to the environment were wiped out. It's because Valve wasn't looking at

810
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:07,744
that as a persistent world. They were using it as a lobby for these various experiences. But

811
00:54:08,505 --> 00:54:13,309
what I realized in that moment was that's what I wanted to feel that somehow still doesn't

812
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:19,173
really exist. Even in some of my favorite games like job simulator, I never have that moment,

813
00:54:19,253 --> 00:54:23,677
that feeling of I can go into the space, I can make these changes and they stay there. When I

814
00:54:23,717 --> 00:54:26,860
come back I'm going to pick up where I left off. That book I left on the shelf is going to

815
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,883
still be on the shelf. So this was kind of a starting point for us. Well, that seems really

816
00:54:30,923 --> 00:54:36,928
important. Clearly having a persistent world is a key part of doing a kind of metaverse type

817
00:54:36,948 --> 00:54:37,188
of thing.

818
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:43,892
So we focused on that. The other thing that we realized as we started to build this in a social

819
00:54:43,932 --> 00:54:49,316
context is that just having persistence was great. But the most delightful version of that was

820
00:54:49,396 --> 00:54:54,879
actually when not, oh, that book is on the shelf because I left it there, but wait a minute, that

821
00:54:54,899 --> 00:55:00,042
book isn't on the shelf anymore. It's on the counter because my friend was here when I wasn't

822
00:55:00,102 --> 00:55:02,504
here and they read my book and put it on the counter.

823
00:55:03,356 --> 00:55:07,800
Like, that was this amazing feeling, because not only am I coming back in to see the changes I made,

824
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:13,226
I'm in a world where other people are making changes, and, I mean, it's just, it seems obvious, right?

825
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:17,270
But when you experience this in a persistent social VR world, it's kind of a mind-blowing thing.

826
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:23,596
And then the most, most delightful version of that, which we've just started to see in recent prototyping work that we're doing here,

827
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:27,644
And this, to explain this, I'll tell a little bit of a story.

828
00:55:27,944 --> 00:55:31,545
So in our pursuit of doing the great with friends games on

829
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:34,427
mobile, we tried to make a lot of them and tried to get them

830
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:35,727
to be as successful as Wards of Friends.

831
00:55:35,787 --> 00:55:37,488
Nothing was ever as successful as Wards of Friends.

832
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:40,209
I have a theory for why that's the case.

833
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,310
And it's basically the fact that

834
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:45,391
We did other games, chess with friends, we did these various puzzles with friends games.

835
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:51,432
None of those games had the same moment of personal expression that words of friends did.

836
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:53,433
When you get a words of friends move from your friend,

837
00:55:54,093 --> 00:55:56,173
it doesn't feel like it's a move an AI could have made.

838
00:55:56,693 --> 00:56:00,274
It's your friend choosing the word that they want to play and you see them in that move.

839
00:56:00,554 --> 00:56:02,434
You get, you know, it's like, there's my friend.

840
00:56:02,514 --> 00:56:05,715
It's a little packet of their personality, their self-expression in that.

841
00:56:05,975 --> 00:56:07,495
And when we did something like chess with friends...

842
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:12,376
and you get the move from your friend and it's pawned to queen six or pawned to e6 or whatever,

843
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:16,897
it's like, okay, that could have been made by anybody. I don't really see my friend in this

844
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:23,219
move. So applying that to this, the most delightful version of social persistence and presence is when

845
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:28,040
your friend cannot just move the book from the counter to the tabletop, but can actually leave

846
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,440
a note in the book for you.

847
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:37,442
That's where this stuff truly becomes, I mean from the sense of an emotional connection into

848
00:56:37,482 --> 00:56:41,743
these worlds, that's where it truly comes to life from what we're seeing. Last thing I wanted to

849
00:56:41,783 --> 00:56:45,705
show you guys and then we have a few minutes for questions. This is just a video, another

850
00:56:45,745 --> 00:56:51,286
couple of minutes showing this game, not even a game as I mentioned, just an R&D project in

851
00:56:51,346 --> 00:56:51,606
motion.

852
00:56:58,310 --> 00:56:59,071
Yes, that is karaoke.

853
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:16,968
♫ Don't want you to just dance, dance, dance, come on

854
00:59:17,168 --> 00:59:20,231
♫ All those things I shouldn't do but you dance, dance, dance

855
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:22,152
♫ Ain't nobody leaving soon so keep dancing

856
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,193
♫ I can't stop the feeling

857
00:59:23,273 --> 00:59:24,454
Thanks a lot for coming today, guys.

858
00:59:24,514 --> 00:59:24,954
Thank you.

859
00:59:25,034 --> 00:59:25,575
Thank you.

860
00:59:25,655 --> 00:59:26,015
Thank you.

861
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:28,557
Thank you.

862
00:59:28,577 --> 00:59:28,777
Thank you.

863
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:28,998
Thank you.

864
00:59:29,018 --> 00:59:29,378
Thank you.

865
00:59:30,038 --> 00:59:33,081
Thank you.

866
00:59:37,024 --> 00:59:37,384
Thank you.

867
00:59:37,404 --> 00:59:37,624
Thank you.

868
00:59:37,684 --> 00:59:39,105
If you have questions, there are microphones.

869
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:39,866
We have a few minutes.

870
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:42,828
Looks like there's at least one microphone

871
00:59:42,848 --> 00:59:43,329
right there, anyway.

872
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:46,392
Yeah.

873
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:48,597
So beyond interactive design, do you

874
00:59:48,637 --> 00:59:50,741
think that applications like Tilt Brush

875
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:53,306
would benefit your current workflow

876
00:59:53,326 --> 00:59:55,711
for prototyping environments and characters

877
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:57,114
and to see how they feel in VR?

878
00:59:57,575 --> 01:00:02,036
absolutely. And there's some really neat experiments with this recently. If you Google,

879
01:00:02,857 --> 01:00:08,919
there's some people that are rigging up tilt brush creations, taking them into Z brush or

880
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:13,700
Maya and giving them a rig and bringing them back into VR. The other thing that is kind of

881
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,281
related to that that I'm fascinated by is unity on real, I'm not sure if you can see it, but

882
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:24,625
they're putting a lot of effort into bringing their editors into VR and there's just these great experiences you can have where where you know

883
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:30,369
You'll be in VR developing the game from inside VR and and and to tie back something I said earlier

884
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:33,550
It's the most iterative form of that development because you can say that

885
01:00:34,051 --> 01:00:37,973
That monster is too big and then literally just grab them and make them smaller and be like yeah

886
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:41,035
Actually, that's pretty good, and there's no there's no cycle time there

887
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,456
You're doing it live and those changes are being saved so

888
01:00:43,616 --> 01:00:48,479
you can even see some of this work happening in a different form in Facebook's like their space pen

889
01:00:48,859 --> 01:00:52,641
where they're drawing in space and then using that to be part of your costume or something. I

890
01:00:52,661 --> 01:00:56,483
think there's another huge opportunity for how Tilt Brush interfaces with that process.

891
01:00:56,563 --> 01:01:00,325
Yeah, so to answer your question, I think those kind of tools are going to merge. I think

892
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:05,008
you'll see Tilt Brush like tools inside of Unity and Unreal and you'll see more Unity and Unreal

893
01:01:05,048 --> 01:01:07,109
game editing tools inside of Tilt Brush.

894
01:01:11,002 --> 01:01:14,504
Hello. You spoke to what you went through with

895
01:01:14,605 --> 01:01:18,787
teleportation and other movement tests and you eventually came to

896
01:01:18,827 --> 01:01:22,129
the, you know, as of right now the arm swinging. As of right

897
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:26,772
now. As of right now, of course. Do you find that that helps with

898
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:30,195
the entire motion sickness thing? Does it help fool the

899
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:31,055
mind a little bit better?

900
01:01:31,415 --> 01:01:36,098
why it was one of the things that we eventually kind of wanted to explore more fully and bring

901
01:01:36,138 --> 01:01:41,641
into this world was there's something A, about standing, that helps, but that smooth sort

902
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:46,324
of acceleration and deceleration of like a D-pad movement or analog movement is really

903
01:01:46,384 --> 01:01:46,584
rough.

904
01:01:47,224 --> 01:01:50,705
and what we've seen from this is that because it's more self

905
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:54,146
guided and you have this sort of context of what a step might be

906
01:01:55,066 --> 01:01:57,687
and it's not a smooth process. It's definitely kind of like a

907
01:01:57,727 --> 01:02:00,627
halting and there's a lot of different pieces you can modify

908
01:02:00,727 --> 01:02:04,708
in the way that you move. That has actually raised the comfort

909
01:02:04,748 --> 01:02:08,949
threshold. So not everyone is 100% comfortable but we're

910
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:11,970
actually getting fewer reports of any sort of motion sickness

911
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:15,571
and more kind of like when I stopped using it I felt like my

912
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:16,991
motion was wrong in real life.

913
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:19,974
example Dan used earlier. If you've been skiing all day and

914
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:22,676
you take the skis off and you're like I feel like I should be

915
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:25,198
able to ski down this hallway right now. It takes a while for

916
01:02:25,218 --> 01:02:27,861
that to wear off. That's what happens here. You're walking all

917
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:30,803
day doing this and your legs stop moving. You take off the

918
01:02:30,843 --> 01:02:32,925
headset and you're like I'm going to walk out of the room

919
01:02:32,945 --> 01:02:36,288
and do that without taking steps. I have to use my legs

920
01:02:36,328 --> 01:02:39,351
now. That's why we're exploring it right now. Thank you.

921
01:02:42,214 --> 01:02:44,755
Hi, I'm Rob Yagno with the Google's VR prototyping team.

922
01:02:44,775 --> 01:02:45,596
This is great work.

923
01:02:45,756 --> 01:02:47,437
Your speed of movement is really impressive.

924
01:02:47,877 --> 01:02:48,958
One of the things that we're finding

925
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:49,999
is that especially as we're moving

926
01:02:50,019 --> 01:02:51,460
into the social prototyping space,

927
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,581
it really multiplies the complexity

928
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:55,122
having to work with different clients

929
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:56,423
and get your networking code working.

930
01:02:57,183 --> 01:02:59,165
Any tips for continuing to move quickly

931
01:02:59,265 --> 01:03:00,566
while prototyping social?

932
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:03,187
Yeah, I mean, that's one of the ones

933
01:03:03,207 --> 01:03:04,708
that we're trying to figure out ourselves.

934
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:08,051
Probably the most lengthy part of developing this

935
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,472
was the networking piece of that.

936
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:15,549
So I can talk about a struggle. This certainly would be

937
01:03:15,569 --> 01:03:21,095
something for the VR hardware developers. The only trick that

938
01:03:21,135 --> 01:03:23,557
we know now or that we're currently utilizing to try and

939
01:03:23,597 --> 01:03:26,080
make social VR prototyping go faster is

940
01:03:28,546 --> 01:03:31,328
And, you know, I hate this too. Doing single player games is so

941
01:03:31,368 --> 01:03:33,609
easy. Doing multiplayer games is always hard. This isn't unique

942
01:03:33,629 --> 01:03:37,612
to social VR. When we were doing age of empires and I was doing

943
01:03:37,632 --> 01:03:40,333
the multiplayer stuff, it was a nightmare. All testing gets

944
01:03:40,373 --> 01:03:43,235
multiplied by and all user testing and play testing, the

945
01:03:43,255 --> 01:03:46,437
complexity gets multiplied by an order of magnitude. That's

946
01:03:46,477 --> 01:03:50,120
definitely true here. But it's critical to keep that up and

947
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:51,961
running. We've had several times where we've

948
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:55,684
kind of let it go for a little while and we switch back to single player play testing

949
01:03:55,704 --> 01:03:59,687
because it's just so much easier and we're getting totally false results out of whether

950
01:03:59,727 --> 01:04:03,410
something works or not, whether it's good or not. You know, the teleporting thing is a great

951
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:07,094
example. It's a perfect example of that. We were so fixated on

952
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:09,255
on solving for motion sickness,

953
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:11,137
which is a good thing to be fixated on,

954
01:04:11,637 --> 01:04:14,219
that we pushed really hard in this realm of teleportation.

955
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:15,040
And while we were doing that,

956
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,121
multiplayer stopped working for a long time,

957
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:18,322
and we spent a while on it.

958
01:04:18,743 --> 01:04:20,784
Finally, when we brought a playtest back up and running

959
01:04:20,864 --> 01:04:22,345
using teleportation in social,

960
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:23,826
it was like, oh crap, this,

961
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:26,208
you know, it's just really not feeling good

962
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:28,590
to share a space and be teleporting around all the time

963
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:29,311
with another person.

964
01:04:29,351 --> 01:04:31,773
So anyway, the key is keep it running,

965
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:33,774
make it a super high priority,

966
01:04:33,814 --> 01:04:36,256
otherwise you're gonna get false positives and negatives.

967
01:04:37,724 --> 01:04:40,945
So maybe actually we can start taking some of our questions outside.

968
01:04:41,005 --> 01:04:42,466
Yeah, we can do it right from the next meeting.

969
01:04:42,486 --> 01:04:45,908
I was just going to ask, in the fictional examples that you put up there,

970
01:04:45,928 --> 01:04:48,789
the metaverse and Snow Crash and Ready Player One,

971
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:51,271
we use that for everything, right?

972
01:04:51,351 --> 01:04:53,812
Yeah, school, for...

973
01:04:53,832 --> 01:04:56,674
Yeah, school, work, yeah.

974
01:04:56,774 --> 01:04:58,915
What is your approach to your metaverse?

975
01:04:59,015 --> 01:05:01,036
What are we going to use it for?

976
01:05:01,156 --> 01:05:08,320
I think Dan used the right word, escape. We want to create a place where you can relax, you

977
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,182
can chill, you can hang out with your friends. All those things will probably still exist

978
01:05:13,302 --> 01:05:18,525
eventually, will exist there too. I love how ready player one talks about that, starts off as

979
01:05:18,545 --> 01:05:22,026
a game and ends up having schools and things in it. Maybe that will happen or maybe it will

980
01:05:22,046 --> 01:05:23,407
come from the other way around. I don't know yet.

981
01:05:23,607 --> 01:05:28,148
And we're also starting kind of focusing on you plus friends rather than you plus the whole world

982
01:05:28,168 --> 01:05:32,349
Yeah, that's key a lot of other social VR developers are like how can we get a hundred people in a room?

983
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:37,210
And we're just so it's like we can't even make one other person feel great yet

984
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:40,971
So we're gonna stay focused on that until we can before we start worrying about a hundred people

985
01:05:41,011 --> 01:05:47,032
Which is an entirely different social problem even even in the case of like okay, you're gonna hang out at a concert, right?

986
01:05:47,052 --> 01:05:47,832
You're not you can't

987
01:05:48,352 --> 01:05:51,035
It's not like you're going to talk to 100 of those people. It's a very different set of

988
01:05:51,075 --> 01:05:56,922
problems. We're very focused on just the one to a few, not one to a thousand. Thanks, guys.

989
01:05:56,942 --> 01:05:59,625
We'll be hanging around outside if there are any more questions. Thank you so much.
