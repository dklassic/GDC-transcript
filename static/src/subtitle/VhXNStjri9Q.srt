00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:08,933
Welcome to Tough Questions to Improve Your Leadership.

2
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:12,395
My name is Richard Atlas, and I'm one of the co-founders of Clever Endeavor Games.

3
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:15,217
We're a small studio from Montreal of six people.

4
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:17,978
We make a game called Ultimate Chicken Horse.

5
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:23,302
And so our studio consists of two programmers, two artists, a community manager, and myself.

6
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:28,065
So today, in 30 minutes, I'm going to try to convince every single one of you

7
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:29,326
that you can become a better leader.

8
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:32,848
I'm going to try to convince you of that, and I'm going to try to give you the tools

9
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:35,550
and the motivation, more importantly the motivation, to do so.

10
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:41,425
So the goal here is to inspire you to think about your own situation and ways in which

11
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:42,006
you can improve.

12
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:45,669
I'm not going to stand here and tell you what you should do, because I don't think I or

13
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:48,991
anyone else has the knowledge or the right to tell you that.

14
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,494
But I'm going to try and poke at certain things that maybe you haven't thought of, and hopefully

15
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:55,217
you can reflect on that and improve for yourself.

16
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,302
So we might be decent leaders, good ones, or even great ones, but I think that we can

17
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:01,622
be better.

18
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:04,624
And there's three ways that I'm going to try and do this today with you guys.

19
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:11,431
So by admitting our flaws, by talking to other people in our situation, and by thinking critically

20
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,334
about our practices, we can become better leaders for ourselves and for our organizations.

21
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:17,175
Hopefully that's why you're all here today.

22
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:24,400
So the best game development companies, whoops, the best game development companies and the

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,442
best companies in general are made up of the people who are the best at their craft.

24
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,182
So the...

25
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:29,864
Your slides aren't showing.

26
00:01:29,884 --> 00:01:30,604
My slides aren't showing?

27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:30,924
Ooh.

28
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:33,206
Hmm.

29
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:35,895
This one?

30
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:44,247
We good?

31
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:46,450
Yep, that looks about right.

32
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:47,652
Okay, so I'm gonna go back.

33
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:56,456
admitting our flaws, talking to others in our situation, and thinking critically about

34
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:56,996
our practices.

35
00:01:57,236 --> 00:01:58,577
Those were the things that I just said.

36
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:04,280
So the best game development companies, and the best companies in general, are made up

37
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,021
of the people who are the best at their craft.

38
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:11,163
So the best artists make the best art, the best combat designers design the best combat,

39
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:13,144
and the best programmers write the best code.

40
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:17,809
Now, I'm none of those people, and you might not be any of those people either.

41
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,534
My role involves asking myself the tough questions that I'm about to ask and help make my organization

42
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:24,354
better in the process.

43
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:30,639
So regardless of your roles on the team, your craft as a leader needs to be creating and

44
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,442
maintaining the morale and motivation of the people on your team.

45
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:37,545
And by working to become the best you can possibly be at this, you give your company

46
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:39,046
and your team the best chance at success.

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,213
So today, we're going to talk about roles and relationships, interpersonal communication,

48
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:47,376
information transfer, structure, planning, and efficiency.

49
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:50,658
We're going to talk to each other about the problems that we've faced and try to come

50
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:51,959
up with solutions to those problems.

51
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,852
And you've probably noticed the handout that I've given you.

52
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:56,533
I realize I did not print enough of them

53
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,794
and did not realize how big this room was.

54
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:02,037
But if not, hopefully you can follow along

55
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:03,457
with someone who's next to you who has this.

56
00:03:04,138 --> 00:03:05,719
And the idea is that on this handout,

57
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:08,601
you can jot down some ideas as the questions go along

58
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:09,301
in this talk.

59
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:12,323
And so all those questions you'll see on the sheet.

60
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:13,864
And at the end, there's a bunch of questions

61
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:16,026
that I did not have time to stick into the presentation

62
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:17,987
that I would like you to look at as well.

63
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,054
So my goal is that everybody in this room

64
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:24,375
leaves with different notes, as I said before,

65
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:26,517
and notes that pertain to their situation

66
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:27,817
and the places where they can improve.

67
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:30,599
Thinking about these notes after this talk

68
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:33,901
and likely after GDC might be the most important part

69
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:36,183
of this talk, so hopefully I can inspire you to do that.

70
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:38,644
So let's start with a question.

71
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,725
First I'm gonna ask everybody to stand up, please.

72
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,106
Can everybody please stand up?

73
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:44,688
Thank you.

74
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:49,471
So, are you your own worst boss?

75
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,516
Sit down if you think that if you were your own employee,

76
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,996
you would quit based on the hours asked of you,

77
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:59,277
the work on weekends, the stress imposed on you by yourself.

78
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:01,797
OK, not too many.

79
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:05,598
Now sit down if you think that you could realistically

80
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:08,058
manage your time significantly better than you do.

81
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:10,559
OK, a few more.

82
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,220
Now sit down if you think you could manage your tasks,

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
which tasks you're being assigned

84
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,100
and how you're prioritizing them better.

85
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:20,583
How are we getting most of you?

86
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:24,186
Finally, this one might take an extra second.

87
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:26,488
Sit down if you treat your employees better

88
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:27,248
than you treat yourself.

89
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:31,392
All right, so for the people still standing,

90
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,133
please hire everybody else around you.

91
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:34,715
No, I'm kidding.

92
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,576
Thank you for that exercise.

93
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,937
This example, this question of are you your own worst boss,

94
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:43,498
comes from a blog post by the amazing Seth Godin.

95
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,420
And it made me think about how much I can learn about management

96
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,880
by looking at how I manage myself.

97
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,142
And the question is how can you expect to be a good leader

98
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:53,904
for others if you can't be good for yourself?

99
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:57,565
I'm not singling out people who sat down,

100
00:04:57,726 --> 00:05:00,067
although I guess it was most of you, and myself included.

101
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,849
But we all have examples of this and we can all do better.

102
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:09,266
According to Mr. Godin, there are few good books on being a good manager, fewer still

103
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:12,387
on managing yourself, and it's hard to think of a more essential thing to learn.

104
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,168
Let's jump into another question.

105
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:18,130
How do you let your team know that you're listening to them?

106
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,872
How do you let your team know that you care about them as human beings as well as professionals?

107
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:27,214
How do you know how they're feeling about the work that they're doing, their compensation,

108
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,955
their relationship with other members of the team?

109
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,702
Do they have the space to be open with you about these kind of things,

110
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:35,024
either professional problems or personal problems?

111
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:39,589
Can you think of a time when maybe there was an issue between you and your colleagues

112
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:43,353
or an employer and an employee because there was a lack of this space to communicate?

113
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:47,063
So I'm actually gonna ask you to talk about this

114
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,924
for a second and we're gonna do a little interactive session.

115
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:52,684
So I'm gonna ask you to break into groups

116
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:54,985
of three to four people, just turn around

117
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,245
to the people next to you and behind you,

118
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:57,085
you don't need to move much.

119
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:59,785
And what I'm gonna do is after a couple minutes,

120
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:03,126
I'm gonna ask these groups to give me a one sentence idea,

121
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,966
a single sentence idea of how we can make our employees

122
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:08,547
feel more appreciated and heard and empowered.

123
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:12,808
So I'll give an example from Clever Endeavor Games

124
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:13,788
just to get the ball rolling.

125
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,441
So one of the things that I try to do is one-on-one meetings with everyone on the team,

126
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:23,242
co-founders, employees, everybody. And I ask them how they're feeling about their work,

127
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:27,023
how their health is going, how they're sleeping, and if there's anything I can do to remove roadblocks.

128
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:31,984
So my one-sentence idea would be one-on-one meetings every few months.

129
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:36,706
So I'm going to ask you guys to get to it. And I think there's a timer that might be able to

130
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:41,767
exist there. Maybe. All right, two minutes, please go.

131
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:48,335
All righty, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

132
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,397
Everybody, please wrap it up.

133
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,219
I didn't bring a bell.

134
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,900
I was supposed to bring a bell that I was going to ring,

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,421
go ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, but I didn't.

136
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:57,923
So I'm just going to have to be the bell myself.

137
00:06:59,584 --> 00:06:59,984
All right folks.

138
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,287
So I'm going to ask a couple of groups just at random,

139
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:04,168
someone wants to raise their hand.

140
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,089
I'll ask them to just yell out their one sentence idea

141
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:08,311
that they discussed in their little group.

142
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:09,652
And then I'll repeat it back on the mic.

143
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,173
So do we have any volunteers?

144
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:16,566
Company survey every six months.

145
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:19,429
And that is asking people about how things are going,

146
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:20,410
like everybody in the company?

147
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,370
Great.

148
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:28,416
I try to do something with any piece of feedback I solicit.

149
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:29,617
OK, so actually using feedback.

150
00:07:29,637 --> 00:07:33,340
Do we have another one?

151
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:36,363
I can't really see you guys, so sorry.

152
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:40,346
After being accused of always being a meanie,

153
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:42,008
I've chosen myself to actually show up once in a while

154
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:42,748
and discuss it.

155
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:47,675
Great, one last one on this side.

156
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:53,079
Maybe daily reviews or weekend of sprint reviews

157
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,042
to let people stand up and show the work that they've done

158
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:58,243
and talk about what hasn't gone well

159
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:00,585
or what has gone well and then other people

160
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,426
can sort of take notes of that

161
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,688
and help them sort of solve those problems.

162
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:04,748
Awesome, so daily reviews

163
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,110
where people can showcase their work.

164
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,891
Great, good stuff.

165
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,992
We're gonna hop into another question

166
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:10,213
because time is short.

167
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:12,495
But thank you all for that participation.

168
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,231
How much cognitive diversity does your team have?

169
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:23,454
So cognitive diversity is the measure of how different

170
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:25,335
the approaches of problem solving styles

171
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:26,575
are of the members of your team.

172
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:29,717
So for example, a new feature is proposed to a team.

173
00:08:30,517 --> 00:08:33,759
One person might be hesitant about technical challenges

174
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:34,660
and want to do some research.

175
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,380
Another person might jump in and be like,

176
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,241
let's build it right now.

177
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,902
The other person might say, well, that's

178
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:40,803
going to be really expensive.

179
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:42,163
Have we considered how much that's

180
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:43,904
going to cost over the long run, et cetera.

181
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:48,391
There's an article published by the Harvard Business Review and they found evidence that

182
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:53,138
a team that is not cognitively diverse was shown to perform worse in problem solving

183
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:58,406
tasks because it was homogenous in how it decided to think about change.

184
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:04,730
Despite this team being mixed in terms of age, gender and ethnicity,

185
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,571
they weren't able to do this problem-solving task as well.

186
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:12,272
And this is something that's harder to see than ethnic or gender diversity,

187
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:15,333
but it's shown in their studies to be critical to success as well.

188
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,162
So a good exercise to think about cognitive diversity

189
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:22,264
is this six thinking caps exercise

190
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:23,465
that maybe you might have seen.

191
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:26,787
The idea is that a different thinking cap

192
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:28,129
has a different sort of personality,

193
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,170
and people can put on those thinking caps

194
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,932
and bring to the discussion the personality

195
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,234
or the point of view of that thinking cap.

196
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,338
So the first one, the white cap, is facts.

197
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:42,280
It's just the information that's needed in the discussion.

198
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:48,707
The yellow hat is optimism, so it talks about what kind of positive benefits this new feature

199
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:49,647
or this discussion could have.

200
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:54,589
The black hat is caution, so it's kind of the devil's advocate of what could go wrong.

201
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,451
The red hat talks about feelings, so they're open to share if they love or hate the idea

202
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:03,232
and give their hunches or intuition.

203
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:06,819
The green hat is creativity, so they talk about new,

204
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,422
oops, new possibilities and alternatives.

205
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:12,484
And the blue hat is process, so the blue hat

206
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:14,366
is the person who keeps the thing on track

207
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,548
and makes sure everybody is speaking

208
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:17,349
according to their role.

209
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,871
By the way, these hats are taken from a game

210
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,332
called King of the Hat, which is made

211
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,254
by another Montreal team, and they're fantastic,

212
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:24,255
so check out King of the Hat.

213
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:26,637
All right, next question.

214
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:29,719
How much psychological safety does your team have?

215
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:34,615
So psychological safety is the feeling that you won't be punished when you make a mistake

216
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:36,036
and that you can be free to speak your mind.

217
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:41,700
So Google conducted a large-scale two-year study that looked at what made for the most

218
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,961
successful creative teams.

219
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,084
And psychological safety was one of the five key elements that they landed on.

220
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:50,446
And so I'm going to ask you to do something for me.

221
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:53,989
You might notice throughout this talk I'm doing lots of little interactive stuff, so

222
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:54,810
bear with me.

223
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,572
So I'm going to ask you to close your eyes for a second.

224
00:10:58,537 --> 00:10:59,378
And I can't see any of your eyes,

225
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:00,299
so I can't prove that you're doing it,

226
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,741
but please close your eyes.

227
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,143
And think about the last design discussion

228
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:06,965
or important team meeting that you may have had.

229
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:09,747
Try to picture what the room looked like,

230
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:11,789
who was in there, what kind of chair you're sitting on,

231
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,551
just to get an idea of what you're seeing.

232
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:16,714
Now, think about how aware you were

233
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:18,275
of the dynamic in that room.

234
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:22,966
Could there have been someone holding back from saying something because they felt it

235
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:23,967
wasn't their role perhaps?

236
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:29,071
Imagine the new design intern who's surrounded by senior designers and they come up with

237
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:30,692
what they think is a stupid idea.

238
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:33,314
How do you think they would feel trying to share that idea?

239
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:37,509
The psychological safety is not an easy thing to create.

240
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:39,030
You can open your eyes now in case they were closed.

241
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:42,654
The psychological safety is not an easy thing to create.

242
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:45,917
It's rooted in your company culture, in the way you carry

243
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:48,139
yourself as a leader, and in every relationship between

244
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,081
every person in the room at all times.

245
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:53,204
I don't think there's any secret sauce to this, and I

246
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:54,486
wouldn't claim to know it if there was.

247
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:56,127
But.

248
00:11:56,968 --> 00:12:00,471
As I mentioned before in the one-on-ones and as we heard from a few people who gave feedback,

249
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:04,814
there are things you can try to do to make your employees feel more empowered

250
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,835
and make your workplace more psychologically safe.

251
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:12,900
Now, on the topic of cognitive diversity that we just talked about and psychological safety,

252
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:19,091
There was another Harvard Business Review study which combines these ideas of cognitive

253
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:20,512
diversity and psychological safety.

254
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:24,114
So you'll see this little chart here that is currently empty.

255
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:25,875
You actually have one on your handout as well.

256
00:12:27,976 --> 00:12:32,238
So in the bottom left quadrant of this chart, we have an area of low cognitive diversity

257
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,479
and low psychological safety.

258
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:38,421
So teams don't feel super safe to express themselves or members of the team, and there

259
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:39,622
isn't a lot of diversity of thought.

260
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,128
These people, these groups tend to be defensive

261
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:44,988
or conforming.

262
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:49,149
In the top left quadrant, we have high diversity of thought

263
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:50,509
but low psychological safety.

264
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:52,770
So people have very different ways of approaching problems

265
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,670
but aren't necessarily comfortable sharing those.

266
00:12:55,611 --> 00:12:58,451
So this can lead teams to be oppositional

267
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:00,732
or too cautious or resistant.

268
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:04,173
In the bottom right quadrant,

269
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:06,913
we have a team that's easy to express itself

270
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:10,154
but somewhat homogenous in the way that it solves problems.

271
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:14,195
So these kind of teams might end up being very uniform.

272
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,517
Now, the goal, at least according to this study,

273
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,878
is to end up in this top right quadrant, which

274
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:22,659
is high psychological safety and high cognitive diversity.

275
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,082
So this kind of atmosphere makes for generative, curious,

276
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:29,322
and experimental teams.

277
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,949
Now, the question to you, I'm going to take away the good ones

278
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:34,909
so you don't associate with them.

279
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,811
The question to you is to think about some of these adjectives

280
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:40,672
and think about where your team might

281
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:43,754
lie on this chart in terms of cognitive diversity

282
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:44,854
and psychological safety.

283
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:46,535
If you're using the handout, you can

284
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:49,397
feel free to just put an x there and think about that later.

285
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:51,978
Otherwise, you can just kind of mentally note down

286
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,060
some of these adjectives and think of maybe a time when

287
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,841
your team performed as one of these adjectives

288
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,182
describes in a negative way.

289
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,081
So the truth of the matter is that you already have

290
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:07,022
some degree of cognitive diversity on your team,

291
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:09,263
but are you making the most of the cognitive diversity

292
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:09,603
you have?

293
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:12,625
You also likely have some psychological safety,

294
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:14,966
and you might be well on your way to becoming a team

295
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:17,207
that exists in that top right quadrant that we just saw.

296
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,429
By encouraging people to solve problems in different ways,

297
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:23,030
by welcoming new approaches to how we take in

298
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,312
and process information, and by being open to responding

299
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:28,433
in new ways to problems, we can encourage this

300
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,634
cognitive diversity and create a psychologically

301
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:31,395
safe environment.

302
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:37,292
Now a large part of this responsibility lies on you, the leader, to think critically about

303
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:40,633
these issues and to promote a culture and environment in which this diversity and this

304
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:41,434
safety can thrive.

305
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:46,857
And in fact, we've already thought of some ways we can do that in the interactive talk

306
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:47,397
that we did.

307
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:52,980
So we're about halfway through, and where have we gotten so far?

308
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:57,703
So far today, we've admitted our flaws, as we saw with the standing and sitting exercise.

309
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,206
We've talked to others in our situation, as we saw with the little group discussions.

310
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:07,291
And we thought critically about our practices as we saw with the cognitive diversity and psychological safety.

311
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:10,113
So now I'm going to throw more questions at you.

312
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:16,179
And the rest of the talk is made up of these questions that can be approached with these three tools in mind.

313
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,741
Admitting our flaws, discussion with others, and critical thought.

314
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:24,006
These questions are about you, about your organization, and about how you can help improve your organization.

315
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:29,088
I opted not to categorize them because they're all interrelated and they involve all sorts

316
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:29,448
of things.

317
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,531
Ego, confidence, trust, social awareness, blame, all sorts of things.

318
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:37,133
And there's no right answer to any of these questions.

319
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:39,914
But hopefully I can inspire you to think about the answers yourself.

320
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,756
So the first question, are you the Rock?

321
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,838
Not Dwayne Johnson, although that would be awesome.

322
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,921
But are you that static, immovable force that doesn't sway in the face of opposition?

323
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:56,066
So imagine the CEO that comes into the meeting with a big smile,

324
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:59,107
and the day after the game launched with crappy reviews,

325
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:01,208
and speaks calmly and says, you know, we're

326
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,168
going to bounce back from this.

327
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,630
And even though we didn't get funding for our next project, it's OK.

328
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,011
And even though money's tight, everything's going to be OK.

329
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:14,013
And now on the opposite side, imagine the CEO who comes in, big bags under their eyes,

330
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:18,796
they've just been up all night answering angry reviews or bad reviews, and they've been preparing

331
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:23,278
a pitch for the next project because they need to have it ready for 8am tomorrow, and

332
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,839
they slump down in their chair and they say, alright, let's talk about the game.

333
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:30,942
So maybe there's something in between these two things though.

334
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,467
So the great professor of social work and researcher,

335
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:36,547
Brene Brown, if you haven't heard of her,

336
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,188
please check her out, she's fantastic,

337
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:41,528
talks about vulnerability as being a key factor

338
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:42,348
in being a good leader.

339
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:46,009
So according to her, vulnerability is uncertainty,

340
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:47,709
risk, and emotional exposure.

341
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:49,770
And a good leader walks into these with confidence.

342
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,251
So imagine that same CEO walking into the room

343
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:57,271
and saying, look folks, we know that the game

344
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:58,891
got bad reviews and it stresses me out too.

345
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:01,264
But let's look at why that was.

346
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:03,025
Let's see what we can do better on our next project.

347
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,428
And money is going to be tight because our next game wasn't

348
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:06,848
funded yet.

349
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:10,971
But if we can be more communicative when our deadlines

350
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:13,453
are starting to slip, we can get through this together.

351
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:16,155
There's nothing shameful about coming into a meeting

352
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:18,597
and admitting that you don't know the answer to a problem.

353
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:21,559
So maybe being vulnerable doesn't

354
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,660
mean being an emotional mess.

355
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,701
And maybe you don't need to be the rock.

356
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:25,862
Maybe you do.

357
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:27,603
I'll leave that to you to ponder.

358
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:31,752
Do you fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy?

359
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:34,913
So the sunk cost fallacy is the idea

360
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,994
that people continue with a behavior or project

361
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:39,495
because of an emotional or a financial investment

362
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:40,135
they've made in it.

363
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,757
And this is related to loss aversion, the idea

364
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:46,698
that people are more likely to avoid loss

365
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:47,698
than they are to seek gain.

366
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,480
And to me, this is one of the most dangerous things

367
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,460
in game development.

368
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,781
And it's one of the things I see absolutely all over the place.

369
00:17:55,617 --> 00:18:00,000
people will work eight months on a project and it's not quite where it needs to be.

370
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,182
And then they'll say, well, you know, it's only another eight months of development and

371
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:07,344
we're already halfway through, so we might as well stick it out and continue this.

372
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:13,709
And then it's game development, so 16, 24 months later, the game comes out and it fails.

373
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:14,929
And nobody's even surprised.

374
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,652
The team that made it is like, well, it was doomed to fail eight months through.

375
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,153
and they should have killed it earlier,

376
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,373
but because of the sunk cost fallacy,

377
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,994
they thought they had already put so much into it

378
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:25,854
that they couldn't do that.

379
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:28,494
Next question.

380
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,155
Do you do things based on your role

381
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:33,075
and not your knowledge or expertise?

382
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:35,136
So, a personal example here.

383
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:37,096
I've made calls about project management,

384
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:40,057
about scheduling, and when our game actually launched,

385
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:42,518
I kind of decided when the game was gonna launch

386
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,758
without having the right information

387
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,538
about the fact that there were features

388
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,779
that were behind where they needed to be,

389
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:48,959
and I caused a ton of stress on the team.

390
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:52,034
Now I did this because I thought it was my role

391
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:52,815
and that was my job,

392
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:55,196
but I didn't have the information that I needed.

393
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,599
Do you ignore statistics because you think you're different?

394
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,701
So David Dunning of the Dunning-Kruger effect,

395
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,782
you might know, has shown in studies that,

396
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:08,343
and I'm gonna paraphrase a little bit,

397
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:10,004
but basically everyone thinks they're better

398
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:11,345
than they are always.

399
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,027
Now, especially in the case of project planning,

400
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,688
this is something that is a serious flaw.

401
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:24,084
So I'm going to give you a fake example, because I don't know anything about making MMOs.

402
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:27,306
But most MMOs, let's say, would take four years to make.

403
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:32,129
But our team's going to be able to do it in two, because those other teams had to switch

404
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:35,331
game engines halfway through development and were happy with our game engine.

405
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:40,574
And they had two senior programmers leave six months before launch, but our team's happy.

406
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:41,234
We do one-on-ones.

407
00:19:41,274 --> 00:19:42,294
Everybody seems happy, right?

408
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:46,957
So this is dangerous, as you might be able to tell.

409
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:50,820
There's another question.

410
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,804
Do you reward extroversion over introversion?

411
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:57,350
So raise your hand if you consider yourself an extrovert.

412
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:02,117
Okay, now raise your hand, keep your hand up please.

413
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:04,861
Raise your hand if you think that you're more extroverted

414
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,063
than the average person on your team.

415
00:20:08,397 --> 00:20:09,497
All right, looks like we have a lot of introverts.

416
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,498
So, most of you lead teams,

417
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,659
and you realize that even as a team leader,

418
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,560
who one might think would typically be extroverted,

419
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,040
there are a ton of introverts.

420
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:22,702
And the power of introversion,

421
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,162
or the power of creativity in introversion,

422
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:26,883
is something that should not be squashed down

423
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:27,924
in favor of extroversion.

424
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:28,604
Now,

425
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,989
There's a great TED talk by Susan Kane about the power of introversion in creativity.

426
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:38,731
She gives some examples that some introverts that are some of the most creative minds in

427
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:39,271
history.

428
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:44,454
And I want to give you an example of a case in game development where maybe we'll reward

429
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:47,096
extroversion over introversion not even consciously.

430
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:50,177
So brainstorm meetings are a great example of this.

431
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:53,859
They're an easy time for an extrovert and a terrible time for an introvert.

432
00:20:55,406 --> 00:21:00,111
According to Kane, groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic

433
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:03,874
person in the room, even though there's zero correlation between the best talker and having

434
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:04,555
the best ideas.

435
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:09,019
This is something you probably know, but this is also something that you might not realize

436
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,423
in a meeting setting, that maybe the louder voice is being heard more.

437
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:16,538
So at Clever Endeavor, one of the things we try to do is

438
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,380
we try to come up with solutions separately

439
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,122
before we come to a design discussion

440
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,424
or a meeting about something.

441
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:23,905
So a problem will come up,

442
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:27,148
and then we will go off on our own, write things down,

443
00:21:27,248 --> 00:21:28,429
and then we'll bring up that list

444
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:30,311
when we actually come to talk about it.

445
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:31,793
It's not a perfect solution,

446
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:35,937
but we try to counteract that somewhat natural tendency.

447
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,208
What works for companies around you?

448
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:43,189
Take project management, for example.

449
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,471
What are other teams doing successfully?

450
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:49,426
Now, I was actually gonna ask you to swap sheets

451
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:50,346
with the person next to you.

452
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:51,546
I realize not everybody has a sheet.

453
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:55,067
So give your sheet to someone who is not you

454
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,507
and write down, I'm gonna ask you to write down

455
00:21:57,527 --> 00:22:00,548
a one sentence idea of something in project management

456
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:02,088
that your team does that you find useful.

457
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:05,109
So it can be anything, a tip, a trick,

458
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:06,029
or a quirk, or anything.

459
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:08,029
Just something that you find interesting.

460
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:10,029
So if you guys can do that,

461
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:11,890
write on someone else's paper something

462
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,410
and then they will be able to bring that home.

463
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,110
I'll give you about...

464
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:15,935
50 seconds.

465
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,099
Go.

466
00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:19,388
Or you can just talk, tell it to the person next to you.

467
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:20,051
That works, too.

468
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:48,778
I don't know, I'll see you guys later.

469
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,560
All righty.

470
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:29,222
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

471
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:31,743
Should really get an actual bell next time.

472
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:34,525
Everybody, please pay attention.

473
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:35,025
Hello.

474
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:37,627
This is not working.

475
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:40,729
There you go.

476
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:41,009
Thank you.

477
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,930
Appreciate that.

478
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:43,791
All righty.

479
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:47,413
So, next question.

480
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:49,635
Do you fill the space in meetings?

481
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:52,256
And if you didn't, who would?

482
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,450
So I'm not great at this. I will often ask a question

483
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,232
and there's this awkward silence.

484
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,593
And I fill that silence.

485
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:06,996
And I sometimes, often, will answer the question that I've asked with my own opinion.

486
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:09,978
The goal is not to try to convince everybody to think like me.

487
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:13,000
It's simply to fill the space.

488
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:16,221
But what I notice is that when I stop doing that,

489
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:17,542
when I actively stop doing that,

490
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:19,842
someone else fills the space, obviously.

491
00:24:20,362 --> 00:24:22,303
And it might be someone who doesn't often speak up

492
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,383
in meetings or in discussions.

493
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:26,584
This can be a very powerful thing to try,

494
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:28,084
especially if you, like myself,

495
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:30,425
have found yourself filling the space

496
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:31,665
when there's some empty space.

497
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:37,066
Lastly, where do you wanna be in two years,

498
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:38,826
or five years, or 10 years?

499
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,201
Does everybody on the team know where you wanna be personally?

500
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:45,283
Do you know where everybody else on the team wants to be

501
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:47,483
in their professional development,

502
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:49,744
personally, either with your studio or not?

503
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:52,646
So I'm gonna ask you, if you're using the handout,

504
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,967
to write down the name of three people that you work with.

505
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:56,807
Doesn't have to be the closest people to you,

506
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:57,708
just any three people.

507
00:24:57,728 --> 00:24:58,808
If you're not using the handout,

508
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:01,349
just try to think mentally of three people

509
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:02,630
that you work with.

510
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:05,571
Get those in your head.

511
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:08,875
I know the three, they're right there.

512
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:13,018
So think about one of those names,

513
00:25:13,298 --> 00:25:14,479
pick one of those names at random,

514
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,640
and think about where that person wants to be in two years.

515
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,482
Do you know where they want to be,

516
00:25:18,522 --> 00:25:19,242
what they want to be doing,

517
00:25:19,362 --> 00:25:21,383
what their ideal job or job title is?

518
00:25:22,744 --> 00:25:24,265
This is something that can be quite important

519
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:27,888
because it can help to steer where your company's going

520
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:29,189
and how you interact with that person,

521
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:29,809
how you treat them,

522
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:31,650
the kind of tasks you might assign to them

523
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,111
if you're assigning tasks,

524
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,332
or the kind of work you might share with them.

525
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,519
I can tell you where I'd like to be in that time.

526
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,622
I'd like to be doing creative and fun work in a studio

527
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:42,763
that has a great culture that I've helped to nourish

528
00:25:43,304 --> 00:25:44,444
and to cultivate.

529
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:46,946
By being aware that I can improve,

530
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:48,347
and from critical analysis,

531
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:49,668
and from talking to the people around me,

532
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:51,569
I, like everybody else in this room,

533
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,590
can become a better leader.

534
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,172
And hey, if there's any place in the world to do that,

535
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:57,153
it's right here and now at GDC,

536
00:25:57,193 --> 00:25:58,514
surrounded by all these creative minds.

537
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:00,836
So I'm gonna leave you with a call to action.

538
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:05,424
Please take some time to consider what was talked about today, and keep striving to be

539
00:26:05,465 --> 00:26:06,625
more than just a status quo.

540
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:10,348
Be the best at your craft, and be the best leader that you can possibly be.

541
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:16,171
Your organization can and will be cognitively diverse, psychologically safe, creative, innovative,

542
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:17,152
and successful.

543
00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:18,993
It's just up to you to make that happen.

544
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:19,793
Thank you.
