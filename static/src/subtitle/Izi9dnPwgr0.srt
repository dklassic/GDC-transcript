1
00:00:06,243 --> 00:00:10,564
Time, 2104.

2
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:13,785
27 year old female, infected with unknown pathogen.

3
00:00:14,486 --> 00:00:17,346
Blood analysis indicates...

4
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:18,667
Virus!

5
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:19,947
Provisional name is...

6
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:20,687
Act 12.

7
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:28,001
Deceased had traveled in China before returning home two weeks ago.

8
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:30,002
I must have been pre-quarantined.

9
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:36,566
Unknown if had contact with livestock, but I could definitely see evidence of insect bites.

10
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:41,528
Deceased had reported coughing and sneezing with a high fever.

11
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:47,291
I am seeing a nasty rash, some abscesses around the abdominal cavity.

12
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:50,192
Clear signs of immune suppression.

13
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:56,736
Cause of death appears to be catastrophic organ failure.

14
00:00:56,997 --> 00:01:01,058
Findings match reports coming out of China.

15
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:03,879
This is highly concerning.

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,661
The deceased may still be infectious.

17
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:27,697
I'm halting the autopsy in order to notify the authorities.

18
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:30,558
Request a full lockdown of this facility.

19
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:32,699
Effective immediately.

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,480
Cool.

21
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,161
So, hi everyone.

22
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:46,246
Um, let's get started. So that was the trailer for Plague Inc. Evolved, which is going to be the

23
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:51,089
subject of the talk today. Some of you may recognize the voice of the doctor in there, it's

24
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,932
a little easter egg which I managed to, um, I was quite pleased to arrange. We're going to be

25
00:01:55,972 --> 00:02:00,095
discussing the trailer a bit, in a bit more detail later on, so try not to forget it. And...

26
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:05,455
I think it's quite helpful to just see a bit about what Plague Inc. Evolved actually is.

27
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:07,676
So, my name is James Vaughan.

28
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:11,258
I'm the founder of Endemic Creations and the developer of Plague Inc.

29
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:13,418
I'm quite new to the games industry.

30
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:16,019
I used to be a business strategy consultant,

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,621
and then four years ago I decided I was going to try and give myself a creative challenge and make a game.

32
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:26,033
I ended up making Plague Inc. as a hobby, and it did really well when released,

33
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:31,045
so I was able to quit my old job, and I've been lucky enough to work on Plague Inc. ever since.

34
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:39,387
I'm here today to explore how and why our mobile game

35
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,627
succeeded on Steam.

36
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:44,931
More and more mobile developers are turning their

37
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:45,911
attention to Steam.

38
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:48,873
They're often without thinking about it enough.

39
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:52,396
Many mobile games have been ported onto PC, but they

40
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:53,857
rarely do very well.

41
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:56,739
They often attract a lot of negative attention

42
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:57,940
from gamers instead.

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,442
It was pretty nerve-wracking when we.

44
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:04,940
were working out how to take Plague Inc. onto PC,

45
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,661
and I wanted to share some of the lessons that we learned

46
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:09,962
and some of the thought processes

47
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,323
that we did with you all today

48
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,624
in the hope that it might help other developers

49
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:15,044
working out their strategies

50
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:16,845
to take mobile games onto Steam,

51
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:18,626
or for them to work out

52
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,026
if it's the right thing for them to do.

53
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:25,643
So we're going to start off by looking at the opportunities

54
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:28,127
and challenges that Steam provided for us

55
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:29,209
in coming from mobile.

56
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:32,674
And then we're going to go into detail on the logic

57
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:35,058
and the approaches that we use to design

58
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:36,119
around these challenges.

59
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,237
After that, we'll look at whether it actually worked,

60
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:42,799
and we'll also have a look at a few other interesting

61
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:45,722
observations that we made whilst taking this dangerous

62
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:48,424
journey from mobile to Steam.

63
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,786
And then finally, we'll wrap things up with some

64
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:53,949
recommendations on when I think you should go from

65
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,572
mobile to Steam, and when it might be better to go from

66
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:58,173
Steam to mobile instead.

67
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:00,395
After that, we'll have some time for questions.

68
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:06,018
So, before we get started on that, I think a quick disclaimer slash warning.

69
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:10,900
I'm going to focus purely on issues that are linked on going from mobile to Steam.

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,262
I'm not going to bother talking about all the infinite number of problems and challenges

71
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:17,182
that you have making a Steam game in general.

72
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:21,064
I'm also going to use the words Steam and PC interchangeably sometimes.

73
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:23,025
I've been trying to stop myself, but I haven't been able to.

74
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:24,545
stamp it out quite yet.

75
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:26,406
But most importantly, I think,

76
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:28,367
let's remember that this is the games industry

77
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:30,668
and nobody really has a fucking clue about anything.

78
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,410
Everybody's sort of got opinions and theories,

79
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,211
but nobody knows anything for sure.

80
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,912
So, this is going to be one case study for you guys,

81
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,553
and I hope it will be helpful for you.

82
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:44,275
So, first of all, what actually is Plague Inc.?

83
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,438
You'll have seen from the trailer, it's not a very nice game.

84
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:53,484
It involves designing a custom pathogen to infect and kill everybody in the world

85
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:55,967
before humanity can come up with a cure for you.

86
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:57,308
So it's a bit sinister.

87
00:04:57,749 --> 00:05:00,711
It launched originally on mobile for iOS and Android.

88
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:05,995
It launched in May 2012, and it's available for $0.99.

89
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:10,799
It also has a number of IAPs in there in the form of

90
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,760
expansion packs.

91
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,383
Some examples of these would be a necrovirus, a zombie

92
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:16,584
virus that I added to it.

93
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,066
We also did a partnership with Dawn of the Planet of the

94
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,547
Apes to add the simian flu in.

95
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:23,029
These are kind of big new content features.

96
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:28,570
These are the reasons why PlayGink has stuck around for so long and why it's done so well.

97
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,331
We've had over 45 million people play the games so far.

98
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:34,992
Over 45 million players.

99
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:39,793
And we've had around 900,000 games played every day on average.

100
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:44,674
It was the third best-selling mobile game of 2014 in the US.

101
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:48,395
And it was the number one best-selling iPhone game of 2014 in China.

102
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:52,476
And it's similar numbers elsewhere in the world where we've localized it.

103
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:58,411
So it's done quite well on mobile.

104
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:01,733
That's been a great gift, because it's meant that I was

105
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,356
able to start thinking, what else did I want

106
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:05,777
to do with PlayGink?

107
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:08,839
And once it was clear that PlayGink was a success, I was

108
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:12,442
able to start thinking a bit about getting it onto PC.

109
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:15,765
And in mid-2013, I was able to really start planning in

110
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:16,225
earnest.

111
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:22,126
The first thing I needed to do was work out why I wanted to bring it on to Plague Inc.

112
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:26,988
There's vast numbers of different reasons, and I know this is the business money track,

113
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:29,749
so I've got a big list of business reasons to share with you all.

114
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:34,031
But before I go into those, I want to tell you the real reasons, the unofficial reasons.

115
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:38,655
I just thought it would be really fun to take a game that I'd already made elsewhere

116
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:44,721
and then bring it onto Steam with all the challenges and all the cool things that could be done with it.

117
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:51,867
I'm a PC gamer at heart and there was a certain appeal to being able to take the baby that I'd created and then put it on the platform.

118
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:55,129
that started me off on my love for games.

119
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,109
So I already really wanted to do it,

120
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,670
and the game designer in me also was sort of

121
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,631
leaping at this chance to be able to

122
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:04,152
take my big list of stuff that I hadn't been able

123
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:05,373
to put in the game initially,

124
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:08,754
and then make it, realize these through Steam.

125
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:11,235
I only did about 50% of my design documents.

126
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:13,957
I had way more ideas than I could handle,

127
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:16,698
and I wanted to try and squeeze a few of those in there.

128
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,367
I also wanted to share it with more people, like get more people playing the game.

129
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:25,331
It's nice seeing people playing and enjoying a game that you have.

130
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,891
So those were the unofficial reasons.

131
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:31,254
Now putting my business hat back on, there were a number of

132
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,256
other reasons that were also important.

133
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:36,338
And they were useful for me to justify it to myself.

134
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:39,661
A key reason is that I could make more money from the game.

135
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,443
I'd already put a lot of work into creating a game that I

136
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:43,123
was proud of.

137
00:07:43,644 --> 00:07:45,905
And so I've got the game already.

138
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:48,547
Let's try and make sure we've got it on as many stores as

139
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:49,828
possible so that as many people as

140
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,290
possible can get it there.

141
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:58,029
I wanted to strengthen the, um, I wanted to strengthen the Plague Inc. brand.

142
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:03,171
Like, every platform that it's available on, it builds up the reputation of the game more.

143
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:06,633
It makes it more likely that people are going to tell their friends about it

144
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,194
and that people are going to have heard of the game.

145
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:12,880
I wanted to say, give me one second,

146
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,843
I'm just gonna increase this slide, there we go.

147
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:18,467
I wanted to extend the overall life of the game.

148
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:19,828
The more people I've got playing it,

149
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:22,552
the longer I can justify continuing to support it

150
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:25,215
and continuing to add new content to it.

151
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,877
So just getting that extra player base

152
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:27,978
was vitally important,

153
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,801
as games are always gonna sort of lose players over time.

154
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:34,885
Another big one I wanted to do is diversify company revenues.

155
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:38,088
For mobile developers, you've basically got Apple and

156
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:38,748
you've got Google.

157
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,410
And that's where all of your money is coming from.

158
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,114
And it's nice to have a certain amount of other

159
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:46,575
revenue streams coming in as well.

160
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:50,098
So I wanted to get it onto PC, start getting those other

161
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:52,720
revenue streams, make sure that the company wasn't as

162
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,522
dependent on any single source.

163
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:57,903
It would also be a foundation for future games.

164
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,664
I don't know what games I'm going to want to make in the future,

165
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:04,726
but I do know that it's incredibly important to start building up

166
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:06,327
a reputation with gamers,

167
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:09,108
showing people that you can be trusted

168
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:11,269
to make a game that they would enjoy playing,

169
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,370
that you can make a good quality game that's worthy of their money.

170
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,951
As I mentioned before, I was quite new to the industry,

171
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:20,573
so I kind of need to start building those credentials sooner rather than later.

172
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:23,254
And with PlayGink, I had a game that I was proud of.

173
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:26,478
So it's as good a place to start as any.

174
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,164
So I felt when I started looking at it in earnest,

175
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:36,009
there were several main ways to take plaguing from mobile to Steam,

176
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,191
which could really fall into four buckets.

177
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,554
They've all got various strengths and weaknesses.

178
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:43,864
Option one, in the bottom left corner,

179
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:47,087
is you take exactly the same game as you've got on mobile,

180
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,690
and you charge exactly the same price for it on Steam,

181
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,631
and that's it.

182
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:54,553
It's easy, it's relatively low cost,

183
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,515
hopefully there won't be too much technical stuff.

184
00:09:57,676 --> 00:09:59,757
But the negatives to that are you don't really get

185
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,419
to do any fun game design stuff,

186
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,801
you can't really expand your vision for the game,

187
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:05,762
expand the appeal to other people.

188
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:06,783
And also,

189
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:09,305
potentially you're missing out on a big opportunity.

190
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:12,969
What if you were able to add a load of new stuff to the game,

191
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,511
to build it into something bigger and better than it was already?

192
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:20,735
Option two takes the same game and charges more money for it,

193
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:25,400
or puts in more additional monetization methods.

194
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,401
This is, again, it's easy and low cost,

195
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:29,043
but I consider it quite risky.

196
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:31,845
This is the key thing that people hate

197
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:34,107
when they can see a game that's costing...

198
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:37,392
lots more money on Steam than it is on mobile.

199
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:40,115
And there's still no guarantee that it's going to drive

200
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,377
lots of extra revenue.

201
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,680
Like, maybe you'll make some extra money in the short term.

202
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,723
But what you really, you're missing out here, again,

203
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,187
is that opportunity to design something.

204
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:51,815
that's better, that's got more complexity,

205
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:56,038
that you can use to justify charging a higher price for it.

206
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:59,341
Option three is you make a better game,

207
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,862
but you don't charge more money for it.

208
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:03,925
It's a nice thing to do, but at the end of the day,

209
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:07,348
we're all here to be able to sort of feed ourselves as well.

210
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:07,888
And I didn't...

211
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,310
And so I'm not quite sure about that one,

212
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,072
because you've got all the challenges of expanding the game,

213
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:16,635
but you aren't getting any of the rewards of expanding the game.

214
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:22,982
And then you've got option four, which is where you expand the game and you then charge a higher price for it.

215
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:32,612
You get to do scratch the game design itch, you hopefully get to create something which allows you to create a better value for players and they're prepared to pay for it.

216
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:35,494
But on the flip side of that, it is going to be hard.

217
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:39,356
You can't just click your fingers and you've got a whole new extra bit of game to bolt on.

218
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:42,998
You're going to have to go to the game design mine and do a bit of mining

219
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,760
to be able to actually create something that you can make there.

220
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,462
And that will also cost money, making the game worthy of that.

221
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:54,050
So, as you can probably tell from when I was explaining those,

222
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,171
I was quite biased towards a certain option.

223
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:59,914
For me, I felt option four was the only one

224
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:03,077
that would support my aims for plaguing on PC.

225
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:07,060
I didn't just want to do a straightforward port or cash grab.

226
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,382
I wanted to make something which I could be really proud of,

227
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,964
which would scratch that PC gamer itch.

228
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:15,766
I wanted it to be supercharged, improved version,

229
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:19,029
with lots of things that I hadn't been able to do in the original game.

230
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,450
It would be bigger, it would be better.

231
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:23,172
it would be built from scratch for PC.

232
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,573
And I would charge a fair price for it.

233
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:27,855
I didn't want to be trapped by that mobile price point.

234
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,296
So I had to make sure it had enough content

235
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:32,158
to justify a higher price.

236
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,139
And we'll touch on that a bit more later.

237
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:38,442
But making plaguing on PC wouldn't be easy

238
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:39,602
to do it successfully.

239
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,902
It's really fucking hard to make any game successful on Steam.

240
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:48,204
You've got to make a good game, you've got to capture player imagination,

241
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:50,286
you've got to market it well, you've got to get lucky,

242
00:12:50,306 --> 00:12:51,186
you've got to engage with players.

243
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,167
All of this stuff has got to be done.

244
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,750
However, incredibly and unfairly, in my opinion,

245
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,611
games that are coming from mobile have got to do all of that

246
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:02,393
and they've got to do significantly more as well.

247
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:05,475
They have to defeat what I've called the mobile stigma.

248
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:08,677
And I found a lovely iPhone photo of a devil there,

249
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:09,898
which I thought I'd share with everyone.

250
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:14,631
But what actually is the mobile stigma?

251
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,632
I've kind of defined the mobile stigma as the belief,

252
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:19,553
the average Steam player's belief,

253
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:21,513
that all mobile games which originate,

254
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:23,634
or all games which originate from mobile,

255
00:13:23,914 --> 00:13:24,894
are sent by the devil.

256
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:28,355
It basically means that in order to be successful,

257
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,975
games coming from mobile have got to meet

258
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:32,516
a much higher standard.

259
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:36,037
than any equivalent game would that had not come from mobile.

260
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,157
I mean, this is a really big deal.

261
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:40,657
You see there's a lot of negativity about early access,

262
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:44,218
but people get even more angry and passionate

263
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:45,758
about games coming from mobile.

264
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:47,318
Take all the... there have been quite a lot of talks

265
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:48,899
about early access games

266
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,539
and how you need to be very careful

267
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,120
about dealing with players on that.

268
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,480
It's infinitely worse coming from mobile.

269
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,140
And if you do mobile and early access,

270
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,480
then you're really in trouble,

271
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,081
which we actually did do early access as well.

272
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:05,210
But so we've got this issue that we need to deal with,

273
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:08,113
and I wanted to look into it in more detail,

274
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,974
because the more I looked into it,

275
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,696
the more I realized that the sad fact is

276
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:14,938
that PC gamers are right to be wary

277
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:16,739
of mobile games coming to Steam.

278
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:22,822
In the past, they've frequently been burnt by straight PC ports of mobile games,

279
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:29,405
which are 10 or 20 times the price, providing an inferior playing experience to the original mobile version,

280
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:33,647
and often providing gameplay or monetization options that are...

281
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:37,571
don't really align with Steam player expectations.

282
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,615
And here are some of the key emotions or prejudices

283
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:43,178
that I felt made up this mobile stigma

284
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,921
and which I felt a plaguing game on Steam

285
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:48,064
would need to have to defend itself against.

286
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:51,194
Mobile games are not proper games.

287
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:53,837
They're overpriced compared to mobile.

288
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:56,299
They rely on pay-to-win mechanics,

289
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,161
and they're just exploiting the player.

290
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:00,503
They're not designed for PC.

291
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:02,605
And if I've already got it on mobile,

292
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,367
what's the point about getting it again

293
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:05,408
on another platform?

294
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:06,309
It's the same game.

295
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:15,546
If I wasn't careful, all of these emotions and prejudices could deal huge damage to Plague Inc. when it came onto Steam,

296
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:19,189
and it could potentially prevent it from being the game that I wanted it to be,

297
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:22,812
from having the success that it would need to be to justify the investment.

298
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:26,975
It would result in unhappy players who felt like they'd been cheated.

299
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:32,098
It would damage the brand, it could damage the brand and reputation of Plague Inc.

300
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:36,102
It could damage the original game when people start complaining about it

301
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:39,184
and then it destroys the viral loop that we've got

302
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:41,326
where players currently recommend it to their friends.

303
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:44,929
If they don't feel passionate about the game, enthusiastic about the game anymore,

304
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,651
they're not going to share it with people.

305
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:50,168
It would result in wasted time, effort and money.

306
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:52,470
We're a very small studio.

307
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,931
We don't have time to be working on 15 different things

308
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:55,311
at once.

309
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,313
If we're going to focus on one thing,

310
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,674
we've got to hit it out of the park.

311
00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:00,695
Otherwise that's a whole load of time going down the drain,

312
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:01,696
which we're not going to get back.

313
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:05,619
And maybe most importantly, it would completely burn

314
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,324
sort of chances I've got for future projects on PC in the future.

315
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:13,287
Like, Steam players, they've got a long memory.

316
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:16,931
They're going to remember if they feel that they've been exploited or not,

317
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:19,914
or a game that's been released which wasn't really worth their money.

318
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:23,658
And I didn't want to kind of shut that whole market out in the future.

319
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,108
So to ignore all these kind of nasty negatives,

320
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,831
we had to consider the mobile stigma

321
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:34,454
in every aspect of the game design

322
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:36,876
and make sure to neutralize it.

323
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,599
Otherwise, all that hard work would be for nothing.

324
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,824
So I felt we had two main weapons that we could use against it.

325
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,667
Visible differentiation and clear communication.

326
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,630
Basically, we had to make it really obvious

327
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,832
that the PC version was different to the mobile version,

328
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:56,853
that it was improved.

329
00:16:57,473 --> 00:17:00,096
And then we had to clearly communicate to players

330
00:17:00,596 --> 00:17:01,657
these differences.

331
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:03,438
Because if the players don't see it,

332
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:04,879
then it doesn't matter what stuff we've done.

333
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,801
So we had to make absolutely clear

334
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:08,122
that those messages were being heard.

335
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:12,602
So now I'm going to go in more detail into exactly what we did

336
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,465
to achieve this differentiation and to meet the communication

337
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:17,285
goals that we had.

338
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:21,289
So we'll start off with the big stuff.

339
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,132
The two single biggest additions to the PC version

340
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,255
are custom scenarios and multiplayer.

341
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:31,437
These are our big tentpole features,

342
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:32,357
which we want to sort of.

343
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:36,697
really use as the shining light for why

344
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:38,538
plaguing on PC would be better.

345
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,280
And for instance, in the custom scenario creator,

346
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,681
we open up all of the data that we use to make the game

347
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,882
so that people can play around and create their own diseases,

348
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,183
create their own worlds.

349
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:53,684
They can customize the disease that would be evolved.

350
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:55,945
They can change country stats.

351
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:57,846
They can manipulate various variables.

352
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:00,347
They can use an event and scripting engine

353
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:02,668
to create incredibly complex scenarios.

354
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,776
and then they could publish them online for other people to enjoy or suffer through, as the case may be.

355
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:15,042
And it's been fantastic actually seeing how players have taken to this system.

356
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,044
There's custom scenarios for everybody.

357
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:20,468
I went online yesterday, I think it was, to get sort of the latest.

358
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:24,390
view of what the most popular custom scenarios are, and it proved my point wonderfully.

359
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,233
We have Rise of the Xenomorphs, which is a great scenario, it's been played by a huge

360
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,795
number of people, and that's quite a serious, gritty scenario.

361
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:35,838
And then you'll see later on, someone else in the Steam community has risen to the opportunity,

362
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:41,962
and we've got Rise of the Fridges, which was made by Noob McNewby, who was inspired by

363
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:44,063
his friend killing him with a fridge in Gary's mod.

364
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,546
I haven't actually played this one, but it's managed to get quite high up on the popular

365
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,346
scenarios list.

366
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:48,566
So, yeah.

367
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,250
You've got a lot of fun stuff being made there.

368
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:55,016
The other part was multiplayer, which is actually

369
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:57,760
still in development and is being quite eagerly awaited.

370
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,402
But this is really where we have.

371
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:05,672
one player versus the other player, their diseases are battling to see who can wipe out more of humanity

372
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:12,360
set against this backdrop of the world doing everything it can to stay alive and nuking really infected countries

373
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:18,026
and doing all sorts of things to try and slow you down whilst you're trying to still fuck over the other player at the same time.

374
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:21,908
It's going to be really exciting when this comes out,

375
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:23,849
and players are already looking forward to it a lot.

376
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:26,230
Here we are actually doing a playtest in the office.

377
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,351
Unfortunately, I lost this playtest significantly,

378
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:31,312
so we're having to do some rebalancing to make

379
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:32,352
sure that doesn't happen again.

380
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,853
So these major temp hole features

381
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:40,235
are really key to differentiate from the mobile vision.

382
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:46,386
They're major tentpole features for a reason, and they're also major development efforts as well.

383
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:50,247
They're incredibly time-intensive to do, adding to the core game.

384
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:53,408
So it's very important to make sure that you pick the right ones,

385
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:56,349
the ones that are really going to resonate with Steam players,

386
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,350
that are going to capture their imagination, that they're going to want to talk to people about.

387
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,271
They need to be really hard for players to ignore and overlook.

388
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:07,897
they need to significantly increase the depth and the life of the game,

389
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,680
so that if we're increasing the price point,

390
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,046
players are feeling like they're getting increased value for money from these things.

391
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:20,767
These also had the advantage of appealing to the more hardcore and involved Steam players

392
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:23,349
who are wanting more from their gaming experience.

393
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:28,132
They're able to, they will be able to strategize and work out what the optimal strategy is on multiplayer.

394
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:32,435
They're also able to look at some pages of variables which will give them a headache and think,

395
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:35,397
wow, okay, this is, there's some real depth behind this.

396
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:39,057
It provides marketing headlines, great talking points,

397
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,599
so that when somebody's explaining the game to their friends,

398
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,421
they go, oh, it's like the mobile version,

399
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:46,784
but it's got multiplayer and scenario creator.

400
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,746
And it just, these, all these things,

401
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:51,349
they build together to support the higher price point.

402
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,569
the $15 instead of the 99 cents

403
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:55,890
that the mobile version goes for.

404
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,591
And as a bonus on these features,

405
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,092
it actually helped discourage piracy.

406
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:01,393
I didn't want to get distracted with DRM

407
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:04,115
or anything like that, but these, by their very nature,

408
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:07,377
they're both set online, and so we're able to make sure

409
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:09,118
that people have got to have a proper Steam account

410
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:10,179
in order to be using them.

411
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,200
So that was a nice little bonus from it.

412
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:18,339
The next thing we did was we significantly improved the graphics.

413
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:21,981
So this was actually a key reason why we rebuilt the game engine from scratch.

414
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:25,263
We wanted to take advantage of the improved PC hardware.

415
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:27,344
There was quite a few constraints on mobile,

416
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:29,265
especially when the game was created.

417
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:31,486
Obviously, we don't need to worry about that.

418
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:36,768
But more significantly, we now had the funds to invest in graphics a bit more

419
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:40,911
and have a bit of fancy animation, other very sophisticated things,

420
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,691
which I was scared of when we made the first game.

421
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:45,012
Because you've got to remember, plaguing was made as a hobby.

422
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:48,134
I spent less than $5,000 US making the original game.

423
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:50,735
So there wasn't that much money to be spending on fancy

424
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:51,255
graphics.

425
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:53,696
And the more complicated the game, the less likely it was

426
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:54,376
it could be shipped.

427
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:56,997
With all of that out the way, though, we could really do

428
00:21:57,077 --> 00:21:58,038
some fun stuff.

429
00:21:58,078 --> 00:22:01,999
So we took the original 2D world map and replaced it with

430
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,800
a 3D map.

431
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,321
And it's quite hard to actually see the benefit of

432
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:06,581
this in a 2D image.

433
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:07,782
But we're able to.

434
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:14,266
have a much more intriguing disease dot spread, the disease dots pulse as they

435
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,788
slowly spread around the countries.

436
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:20,311
We can show the trajectories of planes, you can look at them and see where

437
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:22,873
they're going to be flying to rather than wait to see where they end up going.

438
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:34,125
We did various other things as well. We took the evolution screen and added 3D models of the disease which respond as you evolve your disease.

439
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:44,756
We added a body scanner in the bottom corner which shows which of the organs will be impacted by the relevant traits that you were going to evolve for your disease.

440
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:50,238
We also managed to take the world screen, which we could take some extra space for,

441
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:54,100
and we were able to show additional stats about the country.

442
00:22:54,421 --> 00:22:57,082
We could show people where in the world that country was,

443
00:22:57,102 --> 00:23:00,564
because we actually find a lot of people improve their geography through plaguing,

444
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:03,406
trying to hunt down various random countries which are resisting them.

445
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:07,528
And we could also have these city cams, which are in the bottom left,

446
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:10,690
which help people see the situation on the ground

447
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,032
as their disease continues to spread throughout the game.

448
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,913
The wonderful thing about these graphical improvements is that they are impossible to ignore.

449
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,857
Every time the player is doing anything about the game,

450
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:28,262
they are constantly reminded that they are playing an improved version of the game.

451
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,967
There's no way you can look at somebody playing the game and think,

452
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:34,970
ooh, are they playing the mobile version? Are they playing the Steam version?

453
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,913
It is categorical which version they're playing.

454
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,216
And it makes it feel shiny and new,

455
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:41,379
even for existing Plague Inc. players.

456
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,482
It's great for marketing materials,

457
00:23:43,962 --> 00:23:45,905
you can generate wonderful screenshots,

458
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:47,848
you can hit people on the head repeatedly

459
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:49,029
with the fact that it's different.

460
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,493
And it just makes it harder for people to say

461
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,636
that it's identical to the mobile version.

462
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:59,082
Even our friendly trolls on the Steam forums have to admit that the graphics look different,

463
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:00,924
so their comments always have to start with,

464
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:03,627
yes, it has improved graphics, but...

465
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:05,489
and then go into whatever they want to say.

466
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,031
So we put them on the back foot a little bit, which is nice.

467
00:24:09,766 --> 00:24:12,106
Another important thing we did was the UI.

468
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:15,567
All of the UI was redesigned from scratch to suit the PC.

469
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:18,308
We had to think about things like distance

470
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:20,408
between the options when you're not using a finger

471
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:20,969
to touch there.

472
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:23,389
You've got the greater precision from the cursor.

473
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:26,490
Double click can give you significant extra options,

474
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,570
and obviously, significantly fewer space constraints.

475
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:32,571
We could take the main menu and streamline it

476
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:35,232
to be something much more PC-orientated.

477
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:39,093
Selecting your disease could become a lot more elegant.

478
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:43,846
and let people really get a feel for the fact they're kind of in a laboratory

479
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:47,116
selecting their various different pathogens that they want to play with today.

480
00:24:48,629 --> 00:24:51,491
We could significantly expand the disease screen

481
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:53,953
to, again, make use of those 3D disease models,

482
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,376
but also take some of the stats and the graphs

483
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:00,018
that we provide players and put them right

484
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:01,038
in front of the player.

485
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,980
We can show them the evolution history

486
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,802
so they can see how their disease has evolved over time.

487
00:25:06,242 --> 00:25:08,504
And we can also give details on what genes

488
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:10,345
the player is currently using.

489
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,372
Redesigning the UI is so important.

490
00:25:15,612 --> 00:25:17,974
It's what makes it feel like a PC game.

491
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,935
It prevents that kind of feeling sometimes

492
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:22,776
when you've got, oh, there's too much space here

493
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,817
or too little space here.

494
00:25:23,837 --> 00:25:25,758
You sometimes get that with console ports as well.

495
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:29,620
Something just feels a bit jarring sometimes.

496
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,541
Because we started from scratch,

497
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:32,942
there were no remnants of mobile.

498
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:35,183
There was never a time when we had to make a trade-off of.

499
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:40,166
Oh, well, we could change this, but it's a lot easier just to keep it as it is and hopefully no one will notice.

500
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,587
It was PC or nothing.

501
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:47,011
And that really ensured an optimum and natural playing experience for players.

502
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:51,113
And I think players have definitely appreciated that it was designed from scratch,

503
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:56,817
that they feel they've got a bespoke game which is absolutely targeted to their platform.

504
00:25:57,735 --> 00:26:00,096
It helps make it premium, supporting the price point

505
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:01,157
as other elements have.

506
00:26:01,597 --> 00:26:03,898
And in quite a lot of cases, it actually improves

507
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:05,538
on the original mobile experience

508
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:07,199
because we've got that extra space.

509
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:10,741
We're able, like I said, bringing data into the game earlier

510
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,861
we can just make sure that the player's got

511
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:14,382
all the information that they need

512
00:26:14,762 --> 00:26:17,783
to create a world-ending pathogen, which is important.

513
00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:23,086
We also made huge numbers of other enhancements,

514
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,548
lots of numerous smaller additions throughout the game,

515
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:27,549
often of which they were heavily influenced

516
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:29,930
by player feedback from the mobile version.

517
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:33,833
The aim for these was to have medium or high impact

518
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:36,034
while still being relatively low effort.

519
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:38,735
So we had things like the body scanner I mentioned before,

520
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:40,777
we added in more save slots,

521
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:42,938
which was a major requested feature from players

522
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,519
so they could have multiple games on the go.

523
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:50,835
just very simple things like letting people have longer disease names. We are no longer limited by space there.

524
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,522
The city cams I pointed out before, we can have a

525
00:26:55,218 --> 00:26:57,039
an image for each country, which just, again,

526
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:01,662
makes the world feel like it's a more unique place.

527
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:03,584
There's no similarities between the countries.

528
00:27:04,364 --> 00:27:05,905
Adding end game replays.

529
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:08,407
These have been really popular with YouTubers in particular,

530
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,288
because they're able to play the game.

531
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:11,309
And then they get to the end of it,

532
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:12,470
and they can just hit the play button,

533
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,952
and quickly their whole triumph or abject failure is repeated.

534
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:17,353
And they can have a nice quick summary

535
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:18,774
whilst discussing the game.

536
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,804
even relatively minor things like animating the zombie hordes.

537
00:27:22,864 --> 00:27:24,586
So here we have a group of zombies,

538
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:27,169
two, 20,000 zombies about to hit Greenland.

539
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:29,211
And just making them look a bit cooler,

540
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,153
making the world feel a bit more alive.

541
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:32,535
These are all things that...

542
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:40,001
Cumulatively, they just provide a general feeling of improvement and polish, almost an aura of these things.

543
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:42,983
And you can't quite put your finger on it, but it feels better.

544
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:48,787
It's appreciated by existing fans especially, because it's targeting the feedback that they've given in the past.

545
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:54,491
And sometimes you can still bundle up all of these improvements into marketing bullet points,

546
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:59,514
which are obviously quite important, but you can take the CityCams or the body scanner.

547
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:03,647
all of the data and talk to people about it in a group.

548
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:06,210
So even though individually they're not significant enough,

549
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,932
together they're quite powerful.

550
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:10,034
And again, these just help support

551
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:11,696
the broader price argument.

552
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:19,070
There are lots of simple, generic quick wins that can help out as well.

553
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,551
A wonderful example of this is hotkeys.

554
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:24,852
I'm always amazed when games don't use hotkeys properly.

555
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:27,773
Having well thought out hotkeys shows that you care.

556
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:31,154
It improves the player experience significantly

557
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:34,636
and it's an easy way to defend yourself against a criticism

558
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:38,797
that people always love to lob against mobile games or other ported games.

559
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:42,699
And as a wonderful bonus, it makes testing your game so much easier.

560
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:47,260
We added hotkeys into Plague Inc. on PC really early on,

561
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,661
because I was playing it with just a mouse,

562
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:52,102
and I found my hand trying to use hotkeys that weren't even written yet,

563
00:28:52,142 --> 00:28:53,903
just because it would feel natural.

564
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,063
It was what was required.

565
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:56,183
And so that's a one...

566
00:28:56,224 --> 00:28:58,144
If you're finding yourself wanting to press a button there,

567
00:28:58,164 --> 00:28:59,845
you've got to put these things in there.

568
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,766
And yet, I don't understand why sometimes you just don't get them...

569
00:29:03,246 --> 00:29:05,767
don't... don't... people aren't... people don't put these hotkeys in there.

570
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:08,168
Also, it's important to let people customize them.

571
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:09,548
We haven't actually done that yet.

572
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:11,549
We get requests for it.

573
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:13,930
But I think, to be honest, if you target your hotkeys

574
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,150
appropriately and you maybe have multiple options built

575
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,611
into it, maybe the customizing isn't as important.

576
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:21,352
We'll see how many people actually do customize them

577
00:29:21,372 --> 00:29:22,252
when we put that option in.

578
00:29:23,482 --> 00:29:28,104
Other examples of quick wins are just using the core Steam or PC functionality.

579
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:30,145
Steam achievements, trading cards.

580
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:34,727
Trading cards, it's just a simple graphical asset which you can upload through a web interface.

581
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,748
There's no reason not to do it.

582
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:39,930
And yet quite often you don't see trading cards coming in for weeks or months

583
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,751
until after the game's been launched.

584
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,012
Cloud save, a bit more technically complicated,

585
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:46,773
but still it's something that's appreciated by the player.

586
00:29:47,274 --> 00:29:47,974
Video settings.

587
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:52,637
Hardcore PC guys hate it when they can't customize video settings.

588
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:56,319
And it's not the end of the world to just provide a few resolution settings,

589
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,742
to provide a few dev settings to disable or enable various little graphical toggles.

590
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:05,024
And all of these things, they're mostly easy, and they're absolute no-brainers,

591
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:07,466
and it makes some players feel loved.

592
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,747
Maybe most players won't care, they won't even notice.

593
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:13,749
But the few who do care about it, care about it very passionately.

594
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,411
And it's just worth doing these things.

595
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:20,785
So I've kind of explained some of the key ways

596
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:23,206
that we differentiated Plague Inc. on PC,

597
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:26,647
but as I mentioned before, that doesn't mean anything

598
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:29,488
if you can't clearly communicate the impact

599
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:31,429
and value to prospective players.

600
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:34,410
So how do we go about doing that?

601
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,071
First of all, it's on messaging.

602
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:45,474
You've got to use all of the hard work that you've just put in to craft a really compelling story.

603
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:48,876
This story is so important, you're going to be using it so much,

604
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:53,058
you've got to spend several days just constantly brainstorming on it.

605
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:54,920
You've got to polish the story repeatedly,

606
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,541
and then when you've got something that you're happy with,

607
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,562
you've got to tell it again and again and again to people.

608
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:03,685
You've got to have it on your store page, you've got to use it to the press, you've got to use it in press releases.

609
00:31:04,265 --> 00:31:08,547
Trailer, the trailer I showed before, at the end we're there just hitting in those features.

610
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:11,849
Multiplayer, custom scenario creator, improved graphics.

611
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:16,551
You've got to make people never be able to look at anything to do with your game

612
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:19,733
without having those messages continually given to them.

613
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,014
Because it's easy to overlook it the first time, the second time,

614
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:27,037
but eventually you will get through to people and you will help them understand the value of what you've created.

615
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:32,928
The other major place to use it is in customer support, both by emails and the Steam forums.

616
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:38,591
You're going to have people, especially in the first few weeks, you're going to have people

617
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:44,534
battling over, is this the Antichrist? Is this a wonderful game? Is it awful? Is it average? Is it

618
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:49,237
a waste of money? All of these things are going to be going on. And you've got to make it easy

619
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:51,578
for fans to educate other people about it.

620
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:55,640
A, you can't handle everybody who's going to be coming at you with questions,

621
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,261
and B, you're biased.

622
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,222
It doesn't really matter what you think, of course you're going to love it.

623
00:31:59,262 --> 00:32:04,044
So really you've got to enable the players to defend you instead.

624
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:08,927
And the way to do that is by having those short, sharp, easily understood messages,

625
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:11,468
a web page that they can link to in arguments.

626
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:17,251
Like, these aren't rocket science, but it's about doing it consistently and repeatedly

627
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,032
and having that clear messaging.

628
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:25,533
And I think in particular, we found that the first few weeks of launch are vital for customer support,

629
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:29,356
because that's almost when you've got hordes of people who don't know anything about the game coming on,

630
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:34,260
and that's really when they make up their mind about, are you a good developer or a bad developer?

631
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:40,024
And after the first few weeks of doing support pretty much 24 hours a day, it began to kind of solidify down.

632
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:43,266
We had our community of players who would help defend us.

633
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:46,028
The arguments had already been decided.

634
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:49,452
It was just a case of linking players back to the argument,

635
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,815
saying, oh, don't ask again if it's the same as mobile.

636
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:52,235
It's not.

637
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:53,897
It's been said here, here, and here, and here.

638
00:32:54,257 --> 00:32:57,501
So definitely worth, in those first few weeks especially,

639
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,663
pulling out all the stops and doing nothing except for

640
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:01,605
sitting in front of your computer typing.

641
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:05,450
Or copy-pasting, if you've got your story prepared

642
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:05,890
correctly.

643
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:11,826
The game name was also something that we found was very important from a communication point of view,

644
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,167
because of what we were trying to do with it.

645
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:20,952
We wanted to make sure that we avoided any confusion with players around which features were in which version of the game.

646
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:25,475
It's quite scary taking our existing mobile game and slightly fragmenting it,

647
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:28,418
and we didn't want to... there was always going to be a bit of misunderstanding anyway,

648
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:30,399
but we needed to make sure that players...

649
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:33,521
When we were talking about the multiplayer that we're working on,

650
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:38,384
we could say the game name so that players didn't feel it was coming onto the mobile version,

651
00:33:38,404 --> 00:33:42,307
and then you've got mis-set expectations and everyone gets upset and angry.

652
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:45,469
For the name itself, we wanted something that clearly said,

653
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,350
same game, but better.

654
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:51,832
We wanted to maintain the brand, so we definitely wanted to have Plague Inc. as the core thing,

655
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:55,654
so that when people search for it online, they were able to find all the existing good stuff.

656
00:33:55,694 --> 00:33:57,375
They can find stories about the CDC.

657
00:33:57,395 --> 00:34:00,336
They can find stories about various scientists talking about the game.

658
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:03,497
We didn't want to lose any of that, so we had to keep Plague Inc. as the core name.

659
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:07,099
And we wanted to keep in the theme, so we ended up going with Plague Inc. Evolved,

660
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:10,400
which kind of ticks all of those boxes, and it sounds like it...

661
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:15,705
It's part of the same sort of disease-y environment.

662
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:16,946
It wasn't easy getting there.

663
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:18,647
That took about three months of discussions,

664
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:20,149
but I'm quite happy with it in the end.

665
00:34:21,252 --> 00:34:23,693
A more subtle thing to think about also is the game logo.

666
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:26,975
Now, I don't know actually how important this is, but I

667
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:27,495
felt it was.

668
00:34:29,176 --> 00:34:32,658
We wanted to support that branding difference by having

669
00:34:32,718 --> 00:34:34,860
something that, again, had the same brand, but it wasn't

670
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,640
quite identical.

671
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,421
It looked a bit sharper.

672
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:39,923
It fits in with the PC UI.

673
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:43,084
It makes more use of hexes in the background to, again, tie

674
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,545
back into that PC experience.

675
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:47,247
And this is something we use on lots of marketing materials.

676
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,728
So it was worth.

677
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:52,608
worth playing around with it a bit, just so that players can see graphically,

678
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:54,809
okay, they're talking about this one or this one,

679
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:58,349
but to an uninformed person, they will see both of them

680
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:00,890
and they will still recognize that it's plaguing.

681
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,151
So now we go on to the really big stuff which people trip up on.

682
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,691
Price. So price is the big elephant in the room here,

683
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:12,872
which is so, so hard to get right,

684
00:35:13,032 --> 00:35:17,213
and communicating the price is so incredibly important.

685
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:24,928
I think the key thing really here is that you have to accept that players will compare

686
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:26,128
price against mobile.

687
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:30,431
When I was looking at how other games were doing it, it felt often like sometimes people

688
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:34,973
were just hoping that players wouldn't notice that it was available on the App Store for

689
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:37,674
a tenth of the price, and maybe they'd be okay with it.

690
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:43,760
They will go and look and they will feel ripped off if they see the game is here for 99 cents

691
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,884
And you're asking me to pay $10. That's really fucking unfair. Why is that?

692
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:49,765
And they're going to want to know answers about it

693
00:35:49,805 --> 00:35:55,611
so you've got to meet them head-on and clearly explain why it costs more but

694
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,143
You can't just explain it using the actual logic that you came up with the price,

695
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:06,706
because if you'd said, oh, I'm going to charge $10 because I've had to completely retool the engine

696
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:09,707
to make it work on PC, the player doesn't give a fuck about that.

697
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:12,689
Like, that is not a player-relevant thing.

698
00:36:13,229 --> 00:36:15,990
It's, all they want to do is play the game.

699
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,392
And it's so tempting to be like, well, it's not fair.

700
00:36:19,472 --> 00:36:22,854
I've got this new resolution in it, it was all this wonderful technical stuff,

701
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:26,135
and we're basically geniuses for making it work, and we deserve to be paid for it.

702
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,797
But you have to break it down into things the player can understand.

703
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:31,718
Going back to our big tentpole features,

704
00:36:32,138 --> 00:36:34,960
it's multiplayer, it's custom scenario creator,

705
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,202
it's improved graphics, it's all tangible things that the player can touch.

706
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:43,439
And you'll see on the right-hand side of the slide,

707
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,782
we've got a section from our FAQs here,

708
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:50,426
which we're using the same messaging over and over again.

709
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:51,627
How much does it cost?

710
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:55,431
It costs this much because it's got this expansion,

711
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:56,452
these expansion packs.

712
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:57,654
It's got loads of new content.

713
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:00,496
It's got significant all new features for PC and Mac,

714
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:03,199
including multiplayer and custom scenario creator.

715
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:07,829
It's very helpful if you can justify the price difference mathematically,

716
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:09,269
because it's logic.

717
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,590
Players feel they can't... it's harder to argue with logic.

718
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,531
And so you'll see down on the second part of that image,

719
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:16,632
we're saying, why does it cost $14.99?

720
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,733
Well, it's because the mobile version costs 99 cents,

721
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:22,454
but when you take all of the expansion packs, that costs $6.99.

722
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,296
And actually, it adds a couple more dollars

723
00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:27,477
because we've added more expansion packs since writing this.

724
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:29,919
And so then we're just in a position where

725
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,642
it's actually you're paying $5 for multiplayer,

726
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,243
custom scenario creator, improved graphics,

727
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:38,865
and having it on PC with PC UI and stuff.

728
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:41,967
And that suddenly feels much less significant.

729
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:43,929
It's not $1 versus $15, it's,

730
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,690
oh, I'm paying a few extra dollars for that.

731
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,571
So you need to use this, clearly message it,

732
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:50,472
and then educate the players about it.

733
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:52,712
Make sure that you're repeating this logic everywhere,

734
00:37:52,932 --> 00:37:55,233
that you've got it in places where it can easily be found.

735
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:59,174
And then be prepared to repeat it over and over and over again.

736
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:03,695
Again, until the players agree with you and buy in with it,

737
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:06,196
and then they can start telling other people about it,

738
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:08,937
giving that more unbiased, honest approach to it.

739
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:12,818
Once you've won over your fans, then that's the main hurdle done.

740
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:20,728
You've got to be very careful about how you go about trying to make sure that you're getting the money,

741
00:38:20,808 --> 00:38:26,029
not just from in the price, but also around other forms of monetization or DLC.

742
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:31,090
I think coming from mobile, you're quite used to charging for expansion packs and adding additional content in.

743
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,131
It's worked very well for us on PlayGink on mobile, but on Steam...

744
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:41,176
Because of the mobile stigma, players will be watching for any sign at all of mobile behavior.

745
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:46,099
We have people coming on, has it got IAPs in it, are you going to add IAPs in it, is it pay to win still?

746
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,842
And for us at least, we just decided not to take any risks on it.

747
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:58,509
We're going to strip out all of the fact that on mobile you can pay to go on to the next level if you can't complete a level.

748
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:02,592
And we actually softened the game progression, so rather than having to complete it on...

749
00:39:03,913 --> 00:39:06,674
medium difficulty, you just have to complete it on casual difficulty.

750
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:08,974
To get the cheats, it's brutal instead of mega-brutal.

751
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:12,796
We just took it all down a level to make sure that players didn't ever

752
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:16,157
feel like they were actually being asked to pay,

753
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:18,158
even though actually that's the proper way I made the game.

754
00:39:18,198 --> 00:39:20,319
You should be able to complete it like that if you're a good player.

755
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:25,161
And we do even have people asking still for us to let people have the option to pay,

756
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:29,362
but it's just, it's not worth the potential reputational damage that you could get.

757
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:31,950
So how did things go?

758
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,952
We launched in early access on the 20th of February, 2014,

759
00:39:36,213 --> 00:39:37,154
and it went really well.

760
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,916
It vastly exceeded my expectations.

761
00:39:40,617 --> 00:39:44,200
The thing I'm most proud about are the ratings, the reviews.

762
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,503
We've got an overwhelmingly positive review score.

763
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:49,544
So I think it's 95% positive.

764
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:52,647
And that puts us in the top 2% of all Steam games.

765
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,188
I think it's around just under 7,000 reviews making that up.

766
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:00,572
This isn't some Metacritic thing, it's not a journalist deciding that it's good or anything else.

767
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:05,893
This is players talking, or sort of voting, voting with their mouse clicks.

768
00:40:06,314 --> 00:40:09,135
And it's nothing we can manipulate or encourage or anything else.

769
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:12,356
This just shows that players value the game that we've created.

770
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:16,017
Yeah, immensely proud of that statistic.

771
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:19,399
Of course, we need to make money so that we can keep on making games,

772
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,700
and the sales have been very healthy.

773
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:25,462
Across all channels on PC, the year one sales have been 500,000 units,

774
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:26,563
which has obviously been nice.

775
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:35,291
And then, a minor side, we've also, I think, been one of around the top 20 pirated games of the year.

776
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:39,816
Every now and again I go on to a file sharing site and have a look and we're always quite high up on the list.

777
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:43,940
Which is, maybe it's a bit annoying, but it's also nice that at least they care enough to download it

778
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,684
and it's not some mobile piece of crap that's not worth clogging up their bandwidth.

779
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,506
So, that's a nice thing to have as well.

780
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,642
So I feel that making a high quality PC focused game

781
00:40:55,862 --> 00:40:57,483
helped us beat the mobile stigma,

782
00:40:57,743 --> 00:40:59,704
even at a $15 price point.

783
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:03,185
The approach we took worked, and we were able to show

784
00:41:03,245 --> 00:41:04,846
that it can come from mobile,

785
00:41:04,866 --> 00:41:07,007
but it can still be a proper game.

786
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:09,608
It can cost more than on mobile,

787
00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:11,809
but it can still be a fair price.

788
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:15,983
And we've now got to a point where even the trolls mostly accept it.

789
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:20,545
Like, we don't get many trolls coming along trying to poke the mobile hornet nest anymore,

790
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:22,025
which is quite nice. They found other things.

791
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:25,806
But we've pretty much won the argument there.

792
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:29,568
And that's thanks mostly to help from the players,

793
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:33,449
who've helped communicate the message that we're trying to get to people,

794
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:36,390
and help make sure that people realize the truth about the game.

795
00:41:38,138 --> 00:41:45,323
Before wrapping up, I thought it'd be interesting to take a quick diversion and look at a few of the key differences that I noticed when going from mobile to Steam.

796
00:41:45,743 --> 00:41:47,864
Player numbers are way smaller.

797
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:53,568
We've got, I think it's 4,000 custom scenarios have been made by people.

798
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:55,329
I'm really proud of that number.

799
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:59,972
It takes hours to learn how to use the custom scenario creator and then to make a custom scenario creator.

800
00:42:00,473 --> 00:42:02,114
A custom scenario takes even longer.

801
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:05,056
But from a mobile mindset, that number's not even worth...

802
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,038
holding a space in your brain for it so tiny.

803
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:09,819
But on PC, it just makes a difference.

804
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,940
Sales numbers, again, 500,000 units.

805
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,702
Doesn't sound that impressive when you put it in mobile context,

806
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:16,964
but on Steam, at a premium price point,

807
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,865
it's very significant.

808
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:23,608
The thing I really like about Steam is that it gives me a much closer connection to players.

809
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:26,550
the Steam community is immensely valuable.

810
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,911
It can be toxic and make you feel like shit

811
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:32,193
if you're having some form of management issues,

812
00:42:32,293 --> 00:42:34,734
but if managed correctly,

813
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:36,975
you just get a really close link to players,

814
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:38,436
you can have a dialogue with people

815
00:42:38,716 --> 00:42:40,377
and understand what's happening in the game,

816
00:42:40,597 --> 00:42:41,657
what they like, what they don't.

817
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:44,599
And I haven't been able to get that anywhere

818
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:47,020
when doing it with a mobile game.

819
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:49,964
I don't think the social links are as relevant.

820
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,005
We still have a way where people can tweet and share

821
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:54,026
about how they've just wiped out the world of the disease.

822
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:55,807
It gets used a lot on mobile.

823
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,228
People don't really bother with it on Steam too much.

824
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:03,109
Analytics, I've struggled a bit to find great examples of

825
00:43:03,129 --> 00:43:04,710
where analytics are being used on Steam.

826
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,811
But I'm not sure if that's just me failing to look

827
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:09,672
properly, but there definitely seems to be less focus on

828
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:11,013
analytics than there are on mobile.

829
00:43:11,773 --> 00:43:15,736
And, I mean, finally, I think I found the Steam platform is very friendly for games.

830
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:18,338
It's been designed with games in mind from the beginning,

831
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:23,302
whereas the mobile stores have to do games and lots of other stuff as well.

832
00:43:23,503 --> 00:43:27,726
And they're both functional, but I think it just shows it's quite pleasurable

833
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:31,649
using Steam to be uploading games and changing stuff

834
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,771
and having control over what's happening.

835
00:43:35,497 --> 00:43:36,998
So what do I recommend other people do?

836
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:39,380
Bearing in mind the disclaimer I mentioned at the beginning.

837
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:43,043
I think you can absolutely go from mobile to Steam

838
00:43:43,063 --> 00:43:46,185
successfully, but only if you can beat the mobile stigma.

839
00:43:46,446 --> 00:43:48,547
There's no one approach fits all.

840
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,469
You're going to have to find your own way that will work

841
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:51,870
with your own plans for the game.

842
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,593
Personally, I think option one is quite a safe way to do it.

843
00:43:56,653 --> 00:43:59,896
And it hopefully might make you some money, but maybe

844
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:01,017
you're leaving money on the table.

845
00:44:01,257 --> 00:44:03,599
And option four, I mean, I'm biased, but that's worked out

846
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:04,520
quite nicely for us.

847
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:13,942
Option three I don't think makes business sense and option two I would be a bit wary of because you see quite a lot of games getting tripped up when they try that approach.

848
00:44:14,263 --> 00:44:20,825
I think you need to think how players will respond, clearly communicate it and just be very careful and sensitive to Steam players.

849
00:44:21,485 --> 00:44:27,246
Here are a few danger signs that I think are worth looking out for if you are bringing a game from mobile to Steam.

850
00:44:27,587 --> 00:44:33,348
If these are popping up, it doesn't mean you're going wrong necessarily, but it's worth being careful and looking at stuff again.

851
00:44:33,388 --> 00:44:40,370
If you've got the price higher for the same game, if you can't explain why that price is higher without going away from player-relevant stuff.

852
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:46,152
If there are no PC-specific features, if you're not using Steam functionality, if you're not using hotkeys even.

853
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:52,015
If you find it hard to communicate the benefits, the differentiations that you've done to the player,

854
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,716
that's potentially difficult.

855
00:44:54,137 --> 00:44:58,579
And if you're selling consumable currency, that's really fucking worrying.

856
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:00,860
Like, that's a landmine waiting to step on.

857
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,842
If you can find any other way, I would highly recommend it.

858
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:05,023
Just because it's a red rag to a bull.

859
00:45:06,364 --> 00:45:07,726
It doesn't matter how well you've done it,

860
00:45:07,786 --> 00:45:09,149
it's just the fact that it's there,

861
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:10,611
it fucks your whole story up.

862
00:45:11,112 --> 00:45:12,935
And selling multiple DLC at launch,

863
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:14,558
I mean, people don't like this when any game does it,

864
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,120
but again, because of the mobile stigma,

865
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:18,084
you've got to be extra careful.

866
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:24,075
And if you're worried about these things, then most people seem to feel that going on Steam first

867
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:26,818
and then going to mobile instead makes the most sense.

868
00:45:27,098 --> 00:45:29,861
And I think it does definitely make your life a lot easier.

869
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:32,283
Although I haven't tried it myself.

870
00:45:32,784 --> 00:45:37,349
And I don't want to scare everybody completely off going mobile to Steam

871
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:40,572
because there are also benefits that you get going from mobile to Steam.

872
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:45,734
You've got an existing game to build on, so all of the tech, the designs, the bug fixes there,

873
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:51,036
they're all there, you don't have to worry about that, you can focus purely on making it perfect for PC.

874
00:45:51,496 --> 00:45:56,078
You've got that existing fan base and brand awareness, so when we launched Plague Inc. Evolves,

875
00:45:56,478 --> 00:46:01,600
it instantly went into the top 10, maybe top 15 best-selling on Steam,

876
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,720
without us doing any advertising or anything.

877
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,581
And that was purely because we already

878
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:08,541
had this existing player base that we told about

879
00:46:08,561 --> 00:46:09,862
who were excited about it.

880
00:46:10,322 --> 00:46:11,802
There's a lot of cross-sell potential.

881
00:46:11,922 --> 00:46:15,323
So at the moment, we haven't yet told the mobile players

882
00:46:15,383 --> 00:46:17,703
officially that the PC version exists.

883
00:46:17,743 --> 00:46:19,524
But it's going to be very interesting to see

884
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:21,284
how many people actually then decide

885
00:46:21,304 --> 00:46:22,825
they want to get the PC version.

886
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:26,105
We do send people from the PC version to the mobile version.

887
00:46:26,526 --> 00:46:28,246
And it works quite well.

888
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:29,666
But because of the size of numbers,

889
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:31,467
it's not actually that significant

890
00:46:31,507 --> 00:46:33,727
if all of the Steam players go and get the mobile version.

891
00:46:34,887 --> 00:46:40,029
And I think the only other thing which is really quite helpful is that you're forced to design for the more restrictive platform from the beginning.

892
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:46,611
I think it's vitally important that you get, if you're working really hard on a game, you've got to get that game on as many platforms as possible.

893
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:53,373
But it's a lot easier to start off with the core game, which works on every platform, and then add bells and whistles to it.

894
00:46:53,673 --> 00:46:58,234
than have a wonderful game on PC and try and cram it into a very small mobile box

895
00:46:58,254 --> 00:47:00,815
where you have to make all these design sacrifices.

896
00:47:01,195 --> 00:47:05,956
So, I think designing with mobile from the beginning there can be quite powerful.

897
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:08,717
I haven't decided what I'm going to do with my next game yet,

898
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:13,318
but I think if I had to pick at the moment, I would probably still go mobile to Steam

899
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:15,118
just because it's worked for me so far,

900
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:17,599
although that's no guarantee of future success.

901
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:23,609
So my recommendation for you if you're trying to go from mobile to Steam,

902
00:47:24,189 --> 00:47:26,510
understand why you want to go on to PC.

903
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,971
What are your objectives?

904
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:31,493
And then work out how the mobile stigma threatens you.

905
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:34,234
If you're going to charge the same price as on mobile,

906
00:47:34,474 --> 00:47:37,156
then some of the stuff already isn't relevant for you.

907
00:47:37,336 --> 00:47:40,037
But work out where those potential pain points are.

908
00:47:40,598 --> 00:47:43,259
Design your approach to neutralize the mobile stigma.

909
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:45,740
I've given an example of how that might work here.

910
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:49,043
And then finally, this is a bit corny, but have fun.

911
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:53,506
Like, I've really, really fucking enjoyed taking plaguing onto PC.

912
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:56,129
I've got, it's just been so, so rewarding,

913
00:47:56,449 --> 00:47:57,790
and I can't recommend it enough.

914
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:00,352
So there we are.

915
00:48:00,552 --> 00:48:02,414
Thanks for sticking around for that.

916
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:05,336
If anybody's got any questions, we can take questions.

917
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:07,758
Otherwise, people can all run away and get free drinks

918
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:09,579
while they're going from wherever the parties are.

919
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,660
Thank you.

920
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:36,027
The question is, how did you avoid the pitfall of simultaneous multiplayer between mobile and PC?

921
00:48:37,488 --> 00:48:44,175
Well, because I'm not a particularly technically competent person, so anything to do with advanced technology like that really scares me.

922
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,831
It really, it was something we thought about briefly

923
00:48:49,931 --> 00:48:51,972
and then just thought the benefits aren't necessarily there.

924
00:48:51,992 --> 00:48:55,293
There's a reason why I haven't done multiplayer on mobile

925
00:48:55,513 --> 00:48:57,173
and that's because it's really, in my opinion at least,

926
00:48:57,193 --> 00:48:58,494
it's going to be really complicated

927
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:02,355
and the game is already doing really, really well on mobile.

928
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:04,155
There's no need to add that bit in.

929
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:07,356
So, I never really wanted to do it

930
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,937
and it hasn't really been asked that much, I think,

931
00:49:09,957 --> 00:49:10,938
because players...

932
00:49:11,738 --> 00:49:16,141
are hoping and understanding that we're going to be using more of the PC capabilities

933
00:49:16,201 --> 00:49:18,863
to make the multiplayer more complex and more sophisticated.

934
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:21,905
And I think there's very clear communication from the beginning

935
00:49:21,946 --> 00:49:24,688
that it was going to be on PC and not across the multiplayer.

936
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:29,151
Just sets the expectations and prevents people from building false hopes and stuff.

937
00:49:32,373 --> 00:49:33,354
Can you hear me? There we go.

938
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:41,395
Jason Calkins. So you mentioned briefly analytics. Did you have a lot of analytics in the mobile

939
00:49:41,435 --> 00:49:45,097
version and did you miss them when you went to Steam or did you not have them or could

940
00:49:45,117 --> 00:49:46,097
you just talk a little bit about that?

941
00:49:46,832 --> 00:49:49,733
So we're very unsophisticated when it comes to analytics.

942
00:49:49,793 --> 00:49:52,374
We don't do any of the monetization-related analytics.

943
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:55,396
We do have relatively simple analytics,

944
00:49:55,436 --> 00:49:57,637
which we can use to see how players are using the game,

945
00:49:57,657 --> 00:50:01,258
where they're getting to, even like what

946
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,539
the most popular diseases are, how many people are playing,

947
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:04,380
various scenarios.

948
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,121
And so we actually took all that,

949
00:50:06,181 --> 00:50:09,182
and we put it into the Steam version as well.

950
00:50:09,202 --> 00:50:10,683
So it's been helpful getting that.

951
00:50:11,703 --> 00:50:15,844
It's really more just a case of it's hard to find benchmarks

952
00:50:15,924 --> 00:50:17,544
or comparable metrics for other games.

953
00:50:17,624 --> 00:50:21,005
So there's a stat about how many players have finished a game,

954
00:50:21,025 --> 00:50:23,605
which always seems to float around, but beyond that,

955
00:50:23,885 --> 00:50:26,786
is it good if you've managed to get X number of players

956
00:50:26,826 --> 00:50:29,786
getting 75% of the way through the game?

957
00:50:29,846 --> 00:50:31,827
Is it good if they're spending this much time in it?

958
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:35,307
It's hard to know quite how you're doing compared to other people.

959
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:38,368
Yes, there.

960
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,488
Thanks for the talk.

961
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:47,540
Um, so Plague Incorporated is really popular internationally on the mobile platforms.

962
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:55,892
And I was interested, do you have any information you can share on how the PC version is doing internationally?

963
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:55,972
Yep.

964
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:59,921
So we localized it, PlayLink Evolved, in all the languages

965
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:01,582
that we localized the mobile version on.

966
00:51:01,982 --> 00:51:04,144
And it's done very well there as well.

967
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:07,966
It's hard to know how well, relatively, it's done in

968
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:10,808
various countries, because you can't get country-specific

969
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:11,689
sales charts.

970
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,132
But Russia is certainly a major market for us, or it was

971
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,913
before the exchange rates all shifted around.

972
00:51:19,895 --> 00:51:22,057
Germany's been very big, France.

973
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:24,919
I don't have specific numbers on the top of my head, but

974
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:27,121
localizing it has definitely been worth it.

975
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:28,222
We see a big surge.

976
00:51:28,402 --> 00:51:31,785
When we did localize it, we saw a big increase in country

977
00:51:31,825 --> 00:51:32,265
revenues.

978
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:34,968
And just a quick follow up.

979
00:51:36,048 --> 00:51:39,331
Has the country distribution been very different from

980
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:40,172
mobile to PC?

981
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,131
I don't know, actually.

982
00:51:43,552 --> 00:51:45,754
Russia, I believe, is certainly more intensive,

983
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:47,096
just because of the scale of Russia.

984
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,639
And China, so China's a lot less.

985
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:51,661
It's obviously very popular in China,

986
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:54,864
but we don't have the same install base on Steam.

987
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:56,046
So apart from those two,

988
00:51:56,206 --> 00:51:58,248
I don't have any stats at the top of my head.

989
00:51:58,568 --> 00:51:58,869
Thank you.

990
00:51:59,289 --> 00:51:59,590
No worries.

991
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:00,250
Hi.

992
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:02,130
This is Luke from Disney.

993
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:03,172
Love your game.

994
00:52:03,272 --> 00:52:04,974
We actually played quite a bit in the office.

995
00:52:05,234 --> 00:52:05,674
Thank you.

00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:08,858
My question would be, were there any key learnings you've

997
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:10,860
had from launching the game on Steam that you were able to

998
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,263
take and feed back into the mobile version?

999
00:52:19,945 --> 00:52:23,107
So I haven't launched anything else on mobile since.

1000
00:52:23,127 --> 00:52:26,129
So there's probably lots of stuff which I haven't

1001
00:52:26,149 --> 00:52:27,029
necessarily thought about.

1002
00:52:27,069 --> 00:52:30,351
I think one thing that has been interesting is seeing how

1003
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:33,953
players have responded to things like we added in some

1004
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:36,675
special cheats into the PC version.

1005
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:39,617
And that made them hugely popular.

1006
00:52:39,637 --> 00:52:41,258
So we took that back into iOS.

1007
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,560
The custom scenarios, so this is something that's been so

1008
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,140
popular.

1009
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:50,923
it would be nice if we can find some way to at least get the scenarios themselves onto iOS.

1010
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:51,643
So we're...

1011
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:54,905
The community as a whole is shaping PlayGink,

1012
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:57,606
and so obviously PC represents a huge increase in that community,

1013
00:52:57,646 --> 00:52:59,767
so they are putting in feedback and stuff.

1014
00:52:59,787 --> 00:53:00,127
It's very...

1015
00:53:00,187 --> 00:53:02,408
It is very important for me to have the core game

1016
00:53:02,988 --> 00:53:05,469
completely transmissible between all the different platforms,

1017
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:07,610
so if I spend several months making a new disease type,

1018
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,471
I can share it with everyone rather than have to waste the work.

1019
00:53:10,511 --> 00:53:13,713
But I don't have anything absolutely sort of wonderful

1020
00:53:13,753 --> 00:53:15,533
that I can share from that point of view, I'm afraid.

1021
00:53:16,508 --> 00:53:17,729
Thank you.

1022
00:53:18,389 --> 00:53:18,489
Hi.

1023
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:22,212
What chances do you see in taking a freemium ad-based

1024
00:53:22,252 --> 00:53:26,255
mobile game to a premium version on Steam?

1025
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:30,318
So I think it'd be very hard, because I think that the whole

1026
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:33,861
mobile stigma stuff, that they're looking for any

1027
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,723
opportunity to be really angry about it.

1028
00:53:36,823 --> 00:53:39,065
And Plaguink had it bad enough at $0.99.

1029
00:53:39,705 --> 00:53:42,147
And we are free on Android as well, actually, but it's kind

1030
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:43,128
of still a premium.

1031
00:53:43,648 --> 00:53:45,228
free game, if that makes sense.

1032
00:53:45,949 --> 00:53:50,650
I think it would be very challenging, but if you had the right value proposition, and

1033
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:56,552
you had the right messaging, and you could really easily show why this game is worth

1034
00:53:56,592 --> 00:53:59,232
that money, then you've got a chance.

1035
00:53:59,313 --> 00:54:02,473
But it's certainly going to be an interesting challenge to have.

1036
00:54:05,294 --> 00:54:05,994
Any other questions?

1037
00:54:07,355 --> 00:54:07,495
No.

1038
00:54:07,895 --> 00:54:08,255
Wonderful.

1039
00:54:08,475 --> 00:54:10,696
Well, thank you very much for listening, and take care.
