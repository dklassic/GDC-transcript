00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:16,610
Hello everyone, and welcome to No Budget DIY Marketing for Indie Games.

2
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,552
My name is Michelle, and I've been helping independent developers market their games for years.

3
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:26,773
Over the next hour, I'll give you advice, tips, and a plan to market your game

4
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:29,514
without spending any money and spending very little time.

5
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:32,800
This presentation is intended for people who don't have

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,022
experience marketing a game and who are looking for ways to do

7
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:39,324
it themselves. Um, so people who are solo devs or working in

8
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:42,806
small teams that don't have the time or budget to hire an actual

9
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:49,271
marketing person to help them out. My clicker does not work.

10
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:56,106
A bit about me before we get started, just so you know the information I'm giving you is legit.

11
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:02,154
I've been working in marketing and PR for over six years now, and specifically in indie games for the past three years.

12
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:07,440
I previously did marketing at an indie games publisher, where I worked on over a dozen games,

13
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:11,585
and I'm currently senior producer at indie games publisher, Armor Games Studios.

14
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:20,499
Over the years I've had the privilege to work on some truly incredible indie games like Cozy Grove, Sail Forth, the recently announced Baladins, and many more.

15
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:24,344
And I'm excited to share my experience in marketing indie games with you.

16
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:31,101
This presentation is divided into four sections that will break down marketing into a more

17
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:34,084
easily approachable set of tasks that you can do yourself.

18
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:38,468
First, I'll go over how to communicate the message of your game.

19
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:43,853
It's vital to be able to describe what your game is in as few words as possible, since

20
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:47,497
most of marketing is trying to catch people's attention as quickly as you can.

21
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:51,783
Next, I'll review social media and how to cultivate a following.

22
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:56,249
I know there are as many different opinions on social media as there are people out there,

23
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:58,873
but there's one thing that we should generally agree on,

24
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:03,921
and that is that it's very important to use social media to get the word out there about your game.

25
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,945
Then I'll go into the meat of this talk.

26
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,106
This is my hour-a-day marketing plan.

27
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,527
This plan will break down marketing tasks

28
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:14,869
into a schedule that takes one hour a day, five days a week.

29
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,031
Marketing a game does not have to be a full-time job.

30
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:20,472
And finally, I'll talk about marketing

31
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:22,613
around your game's launch and post-launch,

32
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:25,295
since marketing doesn't end once the game's released.

33
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:28,036
I'll also go through a little bit of the marketing beats

34
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:30,137
that you can do leading up to your game's launch.

35
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,580
To start, let's talk about developing your message.

36
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:38,113
Without a clear message, you'll have a hard time communicating

37
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:41,515
what your game is about, and that's the most important part of marketing.

38
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:44,277
The next few slides, I'm going to show you

39
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,879
a short description of an indie game without the title.

40
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,921
And once I show them, I'll let you take a moment

41
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,483
to see if you can figure out what game the short message is communicating.

42
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:56,665
Here's the first game description.

43
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:00,448
An online and local party game of teamwork and betrayal

44
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,589
for 4 to 15 players in space.

45
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:05,469
I'll give you a few seconds to see if you can guess this one.

46
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:08,790
Yep, this is Among Us.

47
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,351
Nearly everyone knows about Among Us now, but what I love about this description is

48
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:17,933
that it could very easily have been the description for the game when it released in 2018 when

49
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:20,114
it was a small indie game made by a small team.

50
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,954
This description hits some very important points.

51
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:25,955
It tells you what the style of gameplay is.

52
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:29,677
By starting the description with online and local party game,

53
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:33,698
this is communicating that social play is the most important part of the game.

54
00:03:34,238 --> 00:03:37,219
The space setting, the types of characters, the art style,

55
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,700
that's not necessarily the point of the game.

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,761
This game isn't being marketed toward fans of outer space,

57
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:45,401
it's being marketed toward fans of party games.

58
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:51,161
The words teamwork and betrayal, these three words communicate that this game is both a

59
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,402
cooperative and a competitive game.

60
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:58,804
It doesn't have to say, like the party game Mafia, to communicate that it is like the

61
00:03:58,844 --> 00:03:59,605
party game Mafia.

62
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:04,086
You don't need to compare your game to other games to explain what it is.

63
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:08,668
And if you find yourself relying on those comparisons, you should work on solidifying

64
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:13,570
a better idea of what your game is about that doesn't rely on the audience's knowledge

65
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,871
of another existing game.

66
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,193
4-15 players. Players know exactly how many people they need to play this game.

67
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:25,958
They won't buy it thinking it's a single or a two-player game and then get upset when it isn't.

68
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,482
And similarly, they know they can play it with a larger group of people.

69
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:32,565
And this is again emphasizing the party aspect of the game.

70
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:37,969
And then that final little tag, in space, this hints at the setting, which is honestly

71
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:41,091
enough to distinguish the description from other similar games.

72
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:45,254
Players don't need to know they're playing as crewmates in a spaceship and they have

73
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:48,097
to do tasks on the ship and figure out who the imposter is.

74
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:51,879
That information all bogs down the clarity of this description.

75
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,183
Among Us is first and foremost a party game, and that's what this messaging prioritizes.

76
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,426
Here's the second game description.

77
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,602
Even the smallest person can make a big difference.

78
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:07,984
Join Alba as she sets out to save her beautiful island and its wildlife,

79
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,005
and possibly start a revolution.

80
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,827
If you know this game, you already know what it is.

81
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:16,987
Alba, A Wildlife Adventure.

82
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:23,783
This short description tells you that it's going to be a heartwarming story with a small protagonist who has a big heart.

83
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:28,708
It prioritizes the story of the game, which shows you it's going to be a narrative-focused game.

84
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:33,213
It gives you the name of the character in the short description itself.

85
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:39,319
By including that name, it personifies the main character, and it helps people remember the title of the game.

86
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,021
It also tells you what the story is going to be about.

87
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:44,762
Alba has to save her island and its wildlife,

88
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:48,863
so you know it's likely going to be a story focused on conservation and nature.

89
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,224
And finally, it gives you a taste of the tone of the game,

90
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:56,665
with a slightly tongue-in-cheek and possibly start a revolution at the end.

91
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:01,126
This lets you know that it's not all going to be sweet and cozy,

92
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:03,647
and it'll probably grapple with some deeper themes.

93
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,499
Now the first step to crafting your game's message is to define your audience.

94
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,701
It's very important to make sure you know who is going to play your game and who wants

95
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:15,442
to play your game.

96
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:20,785
You can't just assume that anyone who likes video games in general is going to like your specific game.

97
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:25,187
So take some time to narrow down who you think is most likely to play your game.

98
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:30,671
Hopefully it is people like you, since you are presumably making a game that you like to play.

99
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,992
People who like the genre of your game, people who like the mechanics of your game,

100
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,513
and people who like the type of story that you're telling.

101
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,934
You can also find your audience in people who have interests that align with your game.

102
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:46,294
For example, if you're making a game about lassoing horses,

103
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:49,635
you can appeal to horse riders and fans of Western films.

104
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:54,776
A lot of times you can find an audience who don't necessarily play a lot of video games,

105
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:58,517
but they do have interests that are aligned with the kind of game that you're making.

106
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:05,534
The way you craft your game's message is up to you, but I'll give you a few good templates to start.

107
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:11,220
Remember, figure out what the most important part of your game is to communicate to your

108
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,703
defined audience and base your message around that.

109
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:19,369
For example, if you're working on an action-focused game, you may want to use the first template here.

110
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,911
Verb in a noun while you verb.

111
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:27,256
Say your game is a roller derby cowboy simulator where you need to protect your village from

112
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:30,759
hordes of horses whose sole goal is to trample everything they see.

113
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,485
You could say, lasso evil horses in the wild west while competing for the big roller derby title.

114
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:41,549
This lets players know that your game is focused on the action of lassoing,

115
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:44,951
it gives a little bit about the setting, and then it gives you just a little bit

116
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:48,515
more about the story of the game and what other actions you might be taking.

117
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:54,862
Or, if the game you're making is capitalizing on a popular genre, you could use this template.

118
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:59,003
Game name is a genre where you verb and verb.

119
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:04,364
For example, Horse Bandits is a roguelike shoot-em-up where you shoot horseshoes and

120
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:07,665
lassos at horses to stop them from stomping all over your crops.

121
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:12,646
If you're making a game in a genre that has a particularly avid fan base, it's good to

122
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:15,827
call out that genre as much as you can to attract those fans.

123
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:18,874
Or if you're making a narrative-focused game,

124
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:22,097
you could start the description with a brief bit of story detail

125
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,199
followed by a diegetic call to action.

126
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,643
So, the town of Horseburg used to be idyllic

127
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:29,185
before the evil horses attacked,

128
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,126
and only one hero can save them.

129
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:32,728
Will you take up the lasso?

130
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,672
This signals to the player that story is prioritized in the game,

131
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:39,635
so fans of narrative-focused games will be interested in playing it.

132
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:45,117
It's important to identify what your audience will find the most appealing about your game

133
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:49,318
and to come up with a pitch that concisely explains why they should be interested.

134
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:52,819
If you find yourself struggling to define your game in a simple way,

135
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,000
think back to when you first came up with the concept of the game and go from there.

136
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,001
Did you excitedly call your friend and tell them about your bullet hell with horses game idea?

137
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,723
Did you sketch a cowboy on a napkin with the name tag hero of horseburg?

138
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:12,885
That's a good way to get to the core of your game, what it's really about, and that can help you craft the message of your game.

139
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:23,788
After you've figured out your short description or your pitch, it's important to solidify a list of bullet points that clearly communicate more of the important aspects of your game.

140
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:31,851
This list is really useful to put on your Steam page, in your press kit, and to send to press and influencers when you're reaching out to tell them about your game.

141
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:37,235
Bullet points can include the following, depending on what's relevant and what's important to your game.

142
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:39,216
What's the gameplay like?

143
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,957
What are some of the mechanics of the game?

144
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:42,478
What's the story?

145
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:43,899
What's the art style?

146
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,801
Is it 2D, 3D, pixel art?

147
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:47,562
What's the soundtrack like?

148
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,084
How many levels or worlds are there?

149
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:52,245
Is it a multiplayer online game?

150
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:53,566
Is it a single player game?

151
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:55,508
What's the length of the campaign?

152
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:01,311
It's important to note that these bullet points should express the unique aspects of your game.

153
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:05,315
If you're making a fantasy RPG called Dwarves and Elves Go to War,

154
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:10,600
you don't need to include a bullet point about the fact that there are dwarves and elves going to war in your game.

155
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:15,785
But you should include a bullet point about the rhythm minigame set to 80s disco music,

156
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:20,710
since that is a unique aspect of the game that likely won't be clear in the title or the short description.

157
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:25,607
Here's a good example of some bullet points.

158
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,728
Shovel Knight does an excellent job representing what I've just

159
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:29,428
walked you through.

160
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:33,029
It tells you the style of the game, which is 8-bit.

161
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,751
It tells you a little bit about the mechanics of the game.

162
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:39,792
So there's jumping, there's fighting, digging up treasure,

163
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:41,432
exploring, upgrading.

164
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:44,734
It tells you the soundtrack and the composer.

165
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:47,635
If someone is contributing to your game that

166
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:49,915
is a well-known name or they have a lot of fans,

167
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:51,696
you can call them out in the bullet points

168
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:53,097
to get a little more attention.

169
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:57,795
It also tells you the art style, big beautiful pixels,

170
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:00,076
hearkens to the pixel art nature of the game.

171
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,939
It adds a little note that it's accessible to everyone,

172
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:06,220
it has balanced gameplay.

173
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:10,202
It has a little bit of information about the narrative,

174
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,643
so it lets you know that while it's not

175
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:14,345
a story-focused game, there is still story in the game.

176
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:18,167
It tells you about the challenge mode,

177
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,108
so this way it'll appeal to people

178
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:22,470
who are interested in a more challenging game.

179
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,553
And then there's information about the co-op mode for people who want to play with their friends.

180
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:32,017
Now, these bullet points don't necessarily tell you what happens in the game or what

181
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:36,781
the process of playing it is like, but they do lay out in an easily digestible way things

182
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,362
that may hook potential players.

183
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:45,988
Now that you've crystallized the message of your game, it's time to build a following

184
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,190
or refine the one that you already have.

185
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:53,709
There are four big things to remember when you're building a community for your game.

186
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,791
First, people follow people, not games.

187
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:02,253
Now, I'm going to contradict myself right away and say that this is not always true.

188
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:06,436
Huge games like Destiny 2 or Among Us or Cult of the Lamb,

189
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:10,118
they may find followers because of the people who like the game itself.

190
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:14,721
But it's also important to note that those communities have great community managers and marketing people.

191
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:20,364
But if you're at this talk, I'm going to assume that you don't already have a following of hundreds of thousands of people,

192
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:23,525
and you're looking for advice as to how to build up your community.

193
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:27,868
In the small indie space, people tend to follow developers instead of games.

194
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:31,436
If you're a fun and personable person to follow,

195
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,897
you'll be able to attract a community to you

196
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:36,278
that's interested in who you are and what you're doing.

197
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,639
Be genuine and true to who you are

198
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,800
and the space you want to be in.

199
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,521
If you're a shit poster, keep doing that.

200
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,521
You don't need to change your whole personality

201
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:46,762
to try to appeal to a bunch of different people.

202
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:49,163
If you like posting informative threads

203
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,984
about various aspects of game development,

204
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:53,305
that's a great way to share info about yourself

205
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,566
and about the game, and people love learning.

206
00:12:57,595 --> 00:13:01,516
When you're starting out, it's incredibly important to engage with other people on whatever

207
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:03,017
social media platform you're using.

208
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:04,858
No one is an island.

209
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,540
Make sure you're supporting other devs, you're interacting with your fans, show people you

210
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,561
care about them beyond them as potential consumers.

211
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:14,622
This is how you cultivate a community.

212
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:18,483
Your biggest fans will come from people that you're the biggest fans of.

213
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:22,745
They're your best marketing tools, but make sure you don't think of them as tools.

214
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:25,818
And most importantly, be kind.

215
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:30,182
Keep your public criticisms of other games, other people, etc. to a minimum.

216
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:34,626
You never know who's going to see your posts and you don't want to create a following of haters.

217
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:38,950
If you're constantly engaging in drama or criticizing other people or games,

218
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,594
the people following you are going to be people who enjoy consuming that sort of negative content

219
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:46,557
and also potentially creating that negative content,

220
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:50,000
which is not a good foundation of followers when you're trying to market a game.

221
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,487
Great, so now you know how to build a following,

222
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:57,489
but what are the practical steps you need to get started?

223
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:58,969
Well, I'm glad you asked.

224
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:00,630
If you're starting from scratch,

225
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,591
choose the social media platforms

226
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:05,152
that best suit your online style and audience,

227
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,212
and set up accounts.

228
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,233
I'll go into more detail later about how to decide that.

229
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:12,554
Then you want to set up a website and a press kit for your game.

230
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:16,175
The website should contain information and links to everything.

231
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:21,577
You want one central hub where people can go to get all the information they need about your game.

232
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:30,320
What it is, a trailer for the game, how to contact you, how to follow the game, when it's releasing, what platforms it's coming out on, etc.

233
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:33,890
You can Google Indie Video Games Press Kit,

234
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,751
and you'll get a template that's super easy to use.

235
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,952
And this is really vital to provide information to the press.

236
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,294
You don't ever want to be in a situation

237
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:44,555
where a member of the press wants to cover your game,

238
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:46,616
but doesn't because they don't have access

239
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,336
to important materials about your game.

240
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:50,277
That's why you want to make sure you have a press kit.

241
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,559
And then set up your Steam page.

242
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,223
Once you start building up followers, you need somewhere to direct them to go wishlist your game.

243
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:01,845
I'll go more into setting up the Steam page later.

244
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:06,348
And then set up a Discord if you have the capacity to manage it.

245
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:11,331
A Discord is not necessary, but it can be very important to keep your community in one

246
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:16,235
place to be able to interact with your fans directly and provide dev updates in a chill way.

247
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:18,332
and put up a demo.

248
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:21,294
This is a great way to get people interested in your game.

249
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:25,294
Don't do this until you're ready, of course, and be willing to hear and respond to feedback.

250
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:28,797
But there are plenty of SteamFests that you can put a demo up for,

251
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:33,797
or you can put a demo of your game up on itch.io to make sure that you can send people to a place

252
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:36,797
where they can play your game and get a better sense of what it's like.

253
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:40,279
A lot of people will discover demos of games just by scrolling through itch.

254
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:44,279
A lot of content creators do that as well, so it's worth looking into.

255
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:52,225
Now I'm going to go into the various social media platforms you can use to promote your game.

256
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:54,788
To start, let's talk about Twitter.

257
00:15:55,568 --> 00:16:00,233
I used to be a very strong proponent of using Twitter to engage with people and market your

258
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:04,097
game, but in the past two years, the site has fallen pretty far from grace.

259
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:09,462
So while it's still important for networking, it's not the most vital platform for marketing.

260
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:12,363
If you decide to start a Twitter,

261
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:17,407
you'll need to decide if you want a studio Twitter, a game Twitter, and or a personal Twitter.

262
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:23,311
A personal Twitter is good for showing the person behind the game. This goes back to the people follow people tip.

263
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:28,094
But it can also be harder to separate your personal musings from important stuff about the game.

264
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:31,957
So if you're the kind of person that likes to tweet every thought that pops into your head,

265
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,159
it's better for you to set up a separate account for your game.

266
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:40,206
If you're working with a group of people, you should either have a studio Twitter or

267
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:43,289
a game Twitter, so fans can follow one account to get updates.

268
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,854
It's hard to cultivate a community if your updates are scattered across multiple different

269
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:48,855
people's Twitter accounts.

270
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,145
Remember, people follow people.

271
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:56,507
So even if you're running a studio game Twitter, a studio or a game Twitter, followers will

272
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,648
still engage more when they know they're engaging with a real person.

273
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:03,570
Social media can feel disingenuous, especially if you're not used to it.

274
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,211
But try to be fun, kind, and engaging.

275
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:08,952
You don't need to be corporate or stilted.

276
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,474
You don't need to speak in marketing speak all the time.

277
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:12,914
You're making a video game.

278
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:14,195
That's a cool thing.

279
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:15,175
That's a fun thing.

280
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:19,077
And you want tweets that people will enjoy reading and want to interact with.

281
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:22,657
And feel free to post about more than just your game.

282
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:26,198
You can post random thoughts, support your fellow indie devs,

283
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:30,019
you can post, you know, a fun meme that's relevant to the game that you're making,

284
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,319
anything that'll get people to engage with the content that you're making.

285
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,880
And importantly, don't overload your tweets with hashtags.

286
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,181
They're not the discovery tool that you think they are,

287
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:41,281
and they're really only good for specific things,

288
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,702
like hashtag Screenshot Saturday, or Twitter campaigns,

289
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:46,942
or connecting directly with a community.

290
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:52,954
So here are a few examples of tweets from indie devs that have done really well. The

291
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:57,584
first is from my friend who's making a game called Olliefrog Toad Skater. Um, you'll notice

292
00:17:57,665 --> 00:17:59,228
a few things about this tweet.

293
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,888
It's not a lot of text, so people's eyes won't glaze over trying to read it.

294
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:08,610
It uses emoji to illustrate what the text is saying, which gives it a little bit of flair.

295
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:14,153
And it uses just one hashtag, the game dev hashtag, which can surface it in game dev

296
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:16,114
communities without overloading the tweet.

297
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:19,276
It also includes a very cool video that shows off the tweet.

298
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:21,397
And this is the most important part, the visual.

299
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:24,199
The video shows off what the text says.

300
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:27,001
It gets right into the action, and it stays in the action.

301
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:29,482
And it shows how vibrant and fun the world is.

302
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:36,349
Here's another example of an indie game tweet that appeals a little bit more to the development side of Twitter.

303
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,711
This is from the developer of the game Sail Forth, which I did some marketing and production work on.

304
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:45,833
Note that the text of the tweet isn't too technical or too much getting into the weeds.

305
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:49,990
This will catch the eye of people who know what the developer is talking about,

306
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,631
who can then read the rest of this Twitter thread,

307
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:56,232
because this was a thread going into the details of development.

308
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,133
But for people who aren't on the technical side of development,

309
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,814
for fans of games, for example,

310
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:04,216
the video does a good job visually representing what he's saying

311
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,476
in a way that still makes sense.

312
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:10,698
Gamers who don't know much about development can still appreciate this video,

313
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:14,380
and getting a behind-the-scenes glimpse makes them more excited to play the game,

314
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,160
to see how it plays out in real time.

315
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:24,431
And bolstered by the need to stay entertained and engaged throughout the pandemic, TikTok

316
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:29,215
has emerged as the top runner for best social media to promo your game on, if you can hit

317
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,056
the algorithm right.

318
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:35,621
Now this advice may very soon become irrelevant if TikTok gets banned in the US, but for now,

319
00:19:35,862 --> 00:19:36,783
let's act like it won't.

320
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:44,669
I'm not a TikTok expert, and there are a few other talks here at GDC that will have more information than I do

321
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,669
about how best to create content for TikTok specifically.

322
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,712
But much of the same rules as Twitter apply here.

323
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:53,216
Don't be too corporate, show your personality, have fun with it.

324
00:19:53,937 --> 00:19:59,280
Trends are important on TikTok, so make sure you take some time to understand the app before posting to it.

325
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,082
Learn how to use trending sounds and hashtags.

326
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:07,446
TikTok is hard to parse, and you will likely fail quite a bit before getting a hit TikTok,

327
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:12,710
but I really do think it's the biggest driver of interests and wishlists of all the social media platforms.

328
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,411
It's all about viral content.

329
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:18,412
It's a bit harder to cultivate a community through TikTok,

330
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:20,273
but it's a great way to reach the masses.

331
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:24,435
Games that go viral on TikTok often get noticed by journalists and streamers,

332
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:27,896
and all it takes is one popular video to get a lot of attention.

333
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:33,938
Here are a few indie game TikTok accounts that have been wildly successful.

334
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:37,860
I highly recommend you check them out to see what hits and what doesn't.

335
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,112
One More Multiverse is a great example of an account that uses being personable as a

336
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:44,112
way to explain their game.

337
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:48,194
A lot of times one of the developers will be in the video themselves showing their face.

338
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:54,617
The game Mail Time has found a lot of success by the creator showing her development process

339
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:57,378
and posting clips of funny bugs that are going on in her game.

340
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:02,720
Landfall Games is a bigger studio, but they've done a great job getting a huge following

341
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,602
on TikTok because they have a lot of silly games and they like to post little clips from that.

342
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,730
Inky Fox is the solo dev of the game Omno.

343
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,951
And if you can see, they're tiny numbers,

344
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:14,791
but you can see those first videos there all

345
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:17,792
have millions of views, which contributed

346
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:19,052
to the success of that game.

347
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:22,473
He posted a lot about what it's like being a solo dev, what

348
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:24,274
it's like developing this game, and that

349
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:25,434
got him a lot of followers.

350
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,076
And then this game from one of the creators of the game Tiny

351
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:32,437
Glade, you can see, again, that first video there

352
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,437
has almost 10 million views on TikTok.

353
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:40,571
Now, Anastasia Opara recently posted a great Twitter thread breaking down the TikTok strategy,

354
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:43,372
so definitely check that out if that's something you're interested in.

355
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:47,733
And often the people running these accounts will post blog posts or Twitter threads going

356
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,674
through their process.

357
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:52,835
There are plenty more examples out there, so do a little bit of research and chat with

358
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:57,277
your friends and other people you know who are using TikTok to see what approach is best for you.

359
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:06,829
Like I said earlier, Discord can be a really good place to build a community as long as you have the energy and time to take care of it.

360
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:09,951
A good Discord community can make an indie game.

361
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:13,974
But remember, your community is a reflection of your game and you.

362
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:17,377
So be sure to set rules and moderate to cultivate your community.

363
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:22,701
Make sure you use your Discord as more than a place to just throw devlogs in and leave it alone.

364
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:27,765
Chat with your fans, talk about the other games that you're playing, other hobbies that you have,

365
00:22:28,165 --> 00:22:29,386
show off your art to each other.

366
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:34,568
If you're comfortable with it, you can set up monthly voice calls or dev streams to chat

367
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:36,068
live with the people in your Discord.

368
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:39,229
It's good to give perks to people in your Discord.

369
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:44,010
These are the true fans of you and your game, and you want them to feel special and appreciated.

370
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,111
You can do game key giveaways, you can give them behind-the-scenes info, you can do polls

371
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:51,652
to let your community make small decisions about your game.

372
00:22:52,492 --> 00:22:56,453
You can even encourage them to do fan art of your game and chat with them about the

373
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:57,513
process of development.

374
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,481
Okay, yes, Steam is not technically a social media platform, but it is important to use

375
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:06,502
if you're planning to release your game on Steam.

376
00:23:07,282 --> 00:23:12,204
You'll want to set up your Steam page as soon as possible, unless you're seeking a publisher,

377
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:16,845
but even still, most smaller publishers are going to want to see a game on Steam already

378
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:19,846
so that they can see the interest and wish list that you have.

379
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:26,229
You want to set up your Steam page as soon as you have good art to use for the capsules and the screenshots.

380
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:30,311
You can change the art as many times as you want, so don't worry if it's not final.

381
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:35,313
Use that message that we came up with earlier as your short description,

382
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:38,954
and be sure to include the bullet points in the long description of the game.

383
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:44,108
Remember that wishlists convert anywhere from 10 to 30% to sales in the first year.

384
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:48,531
So make sure you're accumulating the number of wishlists you want before launch.

385
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:52,654
If you're the one setting your launch release date and you don't have the number of wishlists

386
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:56,417
that you really want to have in order to make the sales you want, you can just delay your

387
00:23:56,437 --> 00:23:58,518
game a little bit to do a little bit more marketing.

388
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,143
And use the Steam announcements feature to tell followers about your development process.

389
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:08,845
Any Steam events your game is in, when a new demo is up, anything like that.

390
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:13,468
Short of the $100 you have to pay to put a game on Steam, it's free marketing.

391
00:24:14,168 --> 00:24:18,651
The discussion section of your community page on Steam is a great place to cultivate your community.

392
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:22,593
Players will ask questions and leave feedback there, and those are going to be the most

393
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:24,674
excited and hardcore players for your game.

394
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:27,415
Be responsive, and they'll spread the word for you.

395
00:24:29,064 --> 00:24:33,528
Speaking of people spreading the word for you, this is also not technically a social

396
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:37,272
media platform, but word-of-mouth marketing cannot be underestimated.

397
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:41,976
There's going to be a portion of your players who aren't chronically online, who don't have

398
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:45,940
Twitter accounts or TikToks, and who don't check the Steam discovery queue every week

399
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,582
to find games that they'd like to play.

400
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:51,524
Word-of-mouth marketing is nearly impossible to quantify,

401
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:54,866
but it's important to remember that no one will talk about your game

402
00:24:54,986 --> 00:24:57,107
unless you're also talking about your game.

403
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,889
If there are people you regularly hang out with or interact with

404
00:25:00,969 --> 00:25:03,590
that don't know you're making a game, that needs to change.

405
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,391
You don't need to be annoying about it,

406
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:09,213
but keep your friends updated on what you're doing and what you're working on.

407
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:12,195
Making a game is cool. Your friends want to support you.

408
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:15,219
Even strangers will support you if you're friendly.

409
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:19,362
If you're taking regular horseback riding lessons, it would be a good idea to slip in

410
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:22,285
a, hey, did you know I'm working on a video game about horses?

411
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,327
And you'll get other people interested in what you're working on.

412
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,249
I'll give you a real life example.

413
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:31,953
Recently I had stopped by a smoked salmon shop in Seattle, where I'm from, to buy a

414
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:33,254
gift for my dad for the holidays.

415
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:37,876
I asked the cashier for some recommendations, and then we started chatting about when I

416
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,677
had moved to Seattle and what I was doing.

417
00:25:40,317 --> 00:25:43,038
Started talking to him about my job and the games that I had worked on.

418
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,479
And now he's writing down the titles of the games that I'm working on.

419
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,261
He's like, this is so cool, I'm really interested in this game, I'm going to go home and play it.

420
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:54,123
All because I just started up a small conversation with a person in a shop.

421
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:58,444
And that also means that other people in that shop were hearing me talk about the game that

422
00:25:58,464 --> 00:25:59,025
I'm working on.

423
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:00,405
And they may also be interested in it.

424
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:08,274
You should also make sure to have some sort of take home item about your game, especially

425
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:09,995
if you're going to a conference like this one.

426
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:14,396
This can be business cards or postcards with info about where to find your game.

427
00:26:15,097 --> 00:26:18,998
And a shout out to the developers I met yesterday who pulled out a Steam deck with a build of

428
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:19,739
their game on it.

429
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,899
That was a super cool way to see a game in action.

430
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,343
You could also consider making a cool t-shirt with your game's title and imagery on it,

431
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:31,666
or some sort of fun phrase that'll get people approaching you and asking you about it.

432
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:34,929
You could make stickers to hand out to people who seem interested.

433
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:39,572
Make the stickers cool enough to be attractive to people who are into more than just your game,

434
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:44,095
but also include the game's title or aesthetic so that people remember what it is about.

435
00:26:45,777 --> 00:26:49,179
But also be kind to the environment and don't put stickers all over everything everywhere.

436
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:56,128
There are a lot of other platforms you can use to build a following, and each has its pros and cons.

437
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:58,389
And here's a quick rundown of a few more.

438
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:03,771
Kickstarter is a lot of work, but it does give you a built-in following and funding.

439
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:08,793
It's up to you to decide if you're willing to sink the time and energy into running a Kickstarter.

440
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:11,133
Reddit is like the Wild West.

441
00:27:11,293 --> 00:27:15,855
I've seen indie games go viral on there successfully, but it seems to be mostly dumb luck.

442
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:21,578
If you're already an avid Reddit user, I'd recommend posting info about your games in the relevant subreddits,

443
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:24,219
but if you're not, I wouldn't say it's worth the time.

444
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:27,020
There can be a lot of specific rules to each of the subreddits,

445
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,643
and it can often be just a waste of time if you're posting things and not getting a lot of attention.

446
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:38,005
Instagram, Facebook, and Tumblr aren't worth your time unless you already have a big following on them.

447
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:40,586
If you have personal accounts on these platforms,

448
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:45,308
it may be worth it to occasionally post dev updates so your family members know what you're up to, but...

449
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:48,049
It's up to you if that's worth the energy.

450
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,932
And then in the wake of Twitter's impending collapse,

451
00:27:52,392 --> 00:27:54,614
a lot of other social media sites have been popping up

452
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:56,816
to take its place, but I've yet to see one

453
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:59,377
that's really been good for the purposes of indie marketing.

454
00:28:07,203 --> 00:28:09,965
All right, now let's get into the meat of it.

455
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:13,588
This is the hour a day marketing plan.

456
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:18,290
This is a plan I've invented that will take you one hour of work a day, five days a week,

457
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,432
from now until you launch the game, that will make marketing much more manageable.

458
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,793
Ta-da! Here it is.

459
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:29,556
I know, super exciting, right? I love fancy boxes with words in them.

460
00:28:30,764 --> 00:28:36,370
So, the overview of this plan. You do social media on Monday. That's posting and maintaining your

461
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:41,315
Twitters and your TikToks and all the other great places you've stuck stakes in. On Tuesday,

462
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:45,078
you're going to build out your press list. Till now, I've talked mostly about building an

463
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:49,743
audience, but it's important to engage games press and content creators with your game as well.

464
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,587
On Wednesday, you'll work on networking and applying to festivals.

465
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,921
Thursday is for writing up a dev log and working on your Steam page.

466
00:28:58,482 --> 00:29:00,163
And then Friday is content creation.

467
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:04,728
This is organizing screenshots and videos and editing them for posting on various sites.

468
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,593
So Monday, Garfield's favorite day of the week.

469
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,361
On Monday, you're going to schedule posts on your social media.

470
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:17,642
For Twitter, you can schedule posts natively in the desktop app.

471
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:20,982
So write them up, schedule them during a time of day that makes sense.

472
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:26,664
A lot of times you're going to want to be posting midday, Eastern Standard Time, unless

473
00:29:26,684 --> 00:29:30,084
you live, you know, across the pond, in which case, post it during the day.

474
00:29:30,224 --> 00:29:31,825
You don't want to be posting tweets at midnight.

475
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:33,645
No one's going to be awake to read them.

476
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,631
Create a TikTok or two and save it to your drafts post later in the week to make sure

477
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,451
you're spreading out your posting schedule.

478
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:44,232
And remember that visuals are the most important on any site.

479
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:48,093
So include a pretty screenshot or a fun gif or a cool video.

480
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:50,933
Talk to your community on social media day as well.

481
00:29:51,554 --> 00:29:55,534
You should be casually talking with them throughout the week, but Monday is the day to follow

482
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,855
up on replies to your tweets, check your DMs, all that good stuff.

483
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:03,258
And then you also want to work on your own list of following, people you're following.

484
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:08,061
So follow people that you're engaged or you're interested in and engage with their content.

485
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:12,604
That way you can strike up friendships online to find people to support you, your work,

486
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:13,204
and your game.

487
00:30:15,926 --> 00:30:17,767
On Tuesday, you're going to work on your press list.

488
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:21,929
This is going to be a spreadsheet where you keep track of press people and influencers

489
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,991
who would be interested in covering your game for major marketing beats.

490
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,772
When you have a new trailer, when you announce a release date, when the game actually comes out, etc.

491
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:35,374
Include the big people at the review, like the reviews editors at major sites,

492
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:38,316
but don't forget smaller streamers and niche game sites.

493
00:30:38,996 --> 00:30:43,158
I will continue to reiterate this, that's where you'll find your most ardent fans.

494
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,918
You can search tags on Twitch to find streamers who stream the kind of game that you're making.

495
00:30:48,438 --> 00:30:54,803
You can go to the reviews section of your favorite games press site and find reviewers who have written reviews for a game that's similar to yours.

496
00:30:55,343 --> 00:31:00,467
You can even set up a Google form and post it where people can easily fill it out so you can get their information quickly.

497
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,930
Do not make it hard for press and content creators to find and contact you.

498
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:09,590
Here's an example of what your press list could look like.

499
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,272
Make sure you have the person's name, email address,

500
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:16,214
Twitter handle, if applicable, website,

501
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,395
if they're a streamer, what site they stream on,

502
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:20,396
and if they're press, what site they write for,

503
00:31:21,077 --> 00:31:24,218
a link to the website, what platforms they play games on,

504
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,520
what region they live in, so when you send them emails,

505
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,321
you're making sure you're sending them at prime time,

506
00:31:30,162 --> 00:31:31,683
and any notes that could be helpful

507
00:31:31,763 --> 00:31:32,643
in your reach out to them.

508
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,432
It's important to note that you should only use publicly available information.

509
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:42,994
If a person doesn't have their email address listed anywhere on any of their social media

510
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,296
or websites, then they probably don't want to be contacted via email.

511
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:48,957
Use your best judgment and don't spam people.

512
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,221
On Wednesday, you're going to do some networking and you're going to apply to game festivals.

513
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:01,923
Especially if you're making a game by yourself, you don't want to isolate yourself from other devs.

514
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:04,965
Join your local indie dev group if your city has one.

515
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:10,128
Join discord for indie devs working in the engine you're working in or working in the

516
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,448
discipline that you're working in.

517
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:15,731
Find meetups, go to online conferences, go to in-person conferences.

518
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,512
Talk with people about more than just your game.

519
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:20,513
Make friends is what I'm saying.

520
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:22,234
Your friends will support you.

521
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:25,215
And hey, you're at GDC right now, so you're already doing this.

522
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:25,655
Good job.

523
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:29,157
When you've met every single indie dev in the industry,

524
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,618
or just when you're feeling a little less social,

525
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:34,099
you can also apply to game festivals on this day.

526
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:37,120
Big and small festivals are happening all the time.

527
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,301
And a lot of them are online and don't require

528
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:40,622
a lot in the way of content.

529
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:42,963
Steam has a ton of demo fests.

530
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:44,804
And there's a great resource put out

531
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:48,005
by the Indie Houses, which is a collective of indie publishers

532
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:49,486
that you can use to track events.

533
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,506
That website link is right up there.

534
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:56,670
Make sure your game is at the right stage of development before you submit, though.

535
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,792
Being IGF nominated would be incredible, but don't submit your game to IGF when you still

536
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:03,353
have three years left of development.

537
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:08,054
Some festivals focus on finished games, and some of them focus on in-progress games.

538
00:33:11,415 --> 00:33:14,996
Thursday is for writing up a devlog and updating your Steam page.

539
00:33:15,657 --> 00:33:20,718
You don't need to do a devlog every week, unless you love doing that, so this day can

540
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:22,339
also be to catch up on other things.

541
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:27,407
Devlogs don't have to be long or unique, it can just be a little blog explaining the new

542
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:32,589
content you've added to your game, bugs you've run into and how you fix them, and any upcoming

543
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:37,471
showcases you're in or demos you're planning to put up. Cross post this devlog to your

544
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:42,794
website, your discord, steam, link to it from twitter, maybe even make a small video to

545
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:46,516
put on TikTok. It's a great place to get a lot of content for a lot of the different

546
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:47,536
websites you'll be using.

547
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:52,985
For Steam maintenance, you're going to work on polishing the marketing copy for your game.

548
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:55,446
Update the art if it needs updating.

549
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:57,167
Check your wish list numbers.

550
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:00,708
And if you're into analytics, you can get into Steam UTM links.

551
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:04,510
Make sure your tags are accurate on Steam, since that's a way that a lot of

552
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,510
people will find your game.

553
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:09,372
And then check the discussions tab on your community page to see if anyone's

554
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:11,613
chatting about your game, asking questions about it.

555
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:15,595
Again, another great way to interact with the people who are interested in your game.

556
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:21,844
And then on Friday, you're going to create content to use during the rest of the week.

557
00:34:22,565 --> 00:34:26,530
Throughout the week, as you work on developing your game, you'll want to take screenshots

558
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,771
and videos as you work.

559
00:34:28,372 --> 00:34:31,055
On Friday, take that content and organize it.

560
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:37,923
Make GIFs, convert your 16 by 9 videos into 9 by 16 videos for TikTok, and consolidate your assets.

561
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:43,405
Keep these organized in a nice folder so you can easily access them to schedule them out on Monday,

562
00:34:43,445 --> 00:34:48,587
which is social media day. I like to do separate GIFs, screenshot, and video folders, and then

563
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:53,349
another folder that I title already posted that I move the asset to once I've posted it,

564
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,270
just to make sure I'm not posting the same content over and over again.

565
00:34:57,384 --> 00:35:00,645
On this day, you can also schedule a post for screenshot Saturday on Twitter.

566
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:04,666
And sometimes all you do on Friday is edit one TikTok video.

567
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:05,426
And that's great.

568
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:06,447
That's a lot of work.

569
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,287
TikTok videos take a long time to edit.

570
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:09,087
Good job.

571
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:09,928
I'm proud of you.

572
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:12,868
So there it is.

573
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:14,949
Five hours a week to market your game.

574
00:35:15,818 --> 00:35:21,161
Now, if you're thinking, five hours is still a lot of time to spend marketing a game, that's fair.

575
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:25,363
If you're working on your game in your free time, spending a whole hour on marketing a

576
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:26,863
day may seem absurd.

577
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:29,825
To that I say, spend as much time as you have.

578
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:35,288
You don't have to do devlogs, you can smoosh days together or shorten it to 30 minutes a day.

579
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,848
Whatever works for you.

580
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:39,870
The important thing is getting your game out there.

581
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,152
So however you can make it manageable to you is the best way to do it.

582
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,955
One post a week is better than no post a week.

583
00:35:47,175 --> 00:35:49,177
One devlog a month, or every two months,

584
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:50,258
is still better than none.

585
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,343
So once you've been marketing your game,

586
00:35:55,644 --> 00:35:57,826
building your press list, posting devlogs,

587
00:35:58,046 --> 00:35:59,888
finishing your game, what now?

588
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:03,031
Well, the marketing doesn't stop once you launch your game.

589
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,262
I'm going to take a second and go over the important marketing beats that you should

590
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:12,424
be reaching out to press to and posting everywhere for leading up to your game's launch.

591
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,305
The obvious first one is your game announcement.

592
00:36:15,886 --> 00:36:19,667
If you haven't done this already, make sure when you put up your Steam page and release

593
00:36:19,707 --> 00:36:22,909
your trailer, you're also letting everyone know that you're making a game.

594
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:29,092
So reach out to press and let them know, hey, I'm making this game, here's the trailer for

595
00:36:29,152 --> 00:36:34,395
it, here's some screenshots, here's, you know, if you have an anticipated release date, let them know.

596
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,512
The next big beat will be when you announce your launch time frame.

597
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,273
Now this can get a little tricky.

598
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:45,235
You can choose to announce your launch time frame at the same time as your game announcement,

599
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:48,797
or you can hold off until you have a solid date locked in.

600
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:54,119
But if it looks like it's going to be a year or two before you have another big marketing beat,

601
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,201
feel free to release an updated trailer with a coming Q3 2024 end slate.

602
00:37:01,612 --> 00:37:04,995
Then you'll want to reach out to press and content creators when you have a new demo

603
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,917
up or when you're going to be in big festivals.

604
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:11,461
Because there are smaller festivals happening all the time, you want to make sure to only

605
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,784
reach out to press for the really big ones.

606
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:15,405
That way you're not spamming their inbox.

607
00:37:15,746 --> 00:37:20,871
Things like PAX or The Mix or Day of the Devs or Indiecade, those are ones that press will

608
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:24,835
have an eye on and if you send them an email ahead of time, they'll know that they can

609
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,696
come check out your game at that festival.

610
00:37:27,987 --> 00:37:29,748
And then once you have a solidified launch date,

611
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:32,608
that's when you want to start reaching out for coverage interest.

612
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:36,289
You'll want to announce your release date no more than a few months in advance.

613
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:38,790
If it's too early, people are going to forget about it.

614
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,871
So around the same time that you announce your release date,

615
00:37:43,131 --> 00:37:45,531
or about a month before you actually release your game,

616
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,252
you'll want to start providing review keys to your press

617
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:49,412
and your content creators.

618
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,113
Make sure you give them plenty of time to review your game.

619
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,673
And also make sure to give them an embargo so they know

620
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,774
when they can start actually posting content about your game.

621
00:37:58,654 --> 00:37:59,755
And then finally, launch day.

622
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,375
That's your last, well, that's not your last big marketing beat,

623
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:05,716
but that's the biggest marketing beat that you want to reach out to everyone you know for.

624
00:38:07,657 --> 00:38:08,577
So, launch day.

625
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:12,698
On your launch, you're going to post everywhere, and I mean it.

626
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,379
Post on your Facebook account that you haven't used in years.

627
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:17,860
Dig up your Tumblr password and post there.

628
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,561
Print out a flyer and hang it up in the town square.

629
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:24,542
The hardest part of marketing is getting people to hear about your game.

630
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,263
So make sure everyone can hear about it.

631
00:38:27,883 --> 00:38:31,166
You're also going to want to send emails to your press and content creators list.

632
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:35,570
This email should be relatively brief. It should be clear what your message is.

633
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,511
The subject line is something like,

634
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:40,634
Roguelite Horse FPS Gun Horse releases today!

635
00:38:41,214 --> 00:38:43,997
And in the body of the email include your short description,

636
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:47,960
your bullet points, a link to the Steam page, a link to your press kit.

637
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:52,966
Your press release, a nice small-sized GIF or screenshot, and a Steam key.

638
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:58,453
You don't want to create an extra step by making the press and influencers have to ask you for a key.

639
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:02,658
The more steps they have to take to cover your game, the less likely they are to cover it.

640
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,532
And don't be afraid to ask for Steam reviews.

641
00:39:05,892 --> 00:39:08,935
They're super important for getting your game traction on Steam.

642
00:39:09,536 --> 00:39:13,761
Now Steam discourages you from explicitly asking for positive reviews in your game,

643
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:18,546
but you can reach out to your friends, your Discord, your followers, and very politely

644
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,810
explain that you'd love to hear their feedback in the form of a Steam review.

645
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,154
And reply to the reviews if you have reviews come in that aren't so positive,

646
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,376
but are calling out specific issues in your game.

647
00:39:28,717 --> 00:39:30,699
Like if someone leaves a negative review and says,

648
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:33,201
there are a lot of bugs and I didn't like it,

649
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:35,323
you can reply to that review and say,

650
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:36,925
hey, thank you so much for the heads up.

651
00:39:37,145 --> 00:39:40,569
I'm working on these bugs or I've released a patch that addresses these bugs.

652
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,531
I'd love for you to try the game out again.

653
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:48,106
And then launch with a launch discount. This is standard practice nowadays, so make sure

654
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:51,967
you've locked, locked in your launch discount at least two weeks before you release your

655
00:39:51,987 --> 00:39:56,549
game on Steam. People are more likely to buy a game when it's on sale, and if it's on sale

656
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,851
when you launch it, they're doubly as likely to buy it.

657
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:06,604
Now press release can be a good way to get the attention of press who might not otherwise see your game.

658
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,628
I won't go into the details of how to write a press release.

659
00:40:09,749 --> 00:40:11,111
It involves a good bit of formatting.

660
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:13,574
So if you haven't done it before, make sure to Google it.

661
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:15,137
But if you...

662
00:40:16,423 --> 00:40:19,164
Yeah, but make sure to Google it if you haven't written one before.

663
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:22,525
Once you have the press release, you're going to save it as a text file.

664
00:40:22,825 --> 00:40:25,446
You're going to get six to ten nice screenshots.

665
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:29,527
Make sure you include the key art for your game, both with and without the title.

666
00:40:29,687 --> 00:40:31,448
That's a big thing that press asks for a lot.

667
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:34,368
And then you're going to go to gamespress.com.

668
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:37,389
That's the website where press releases about games are hosted.

669
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,230
They'll give you information about how to send the press release to them,

670
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,171
and that way they'll ingest it and they'll post it on their website

671
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:48,972
where games journalists have access to it and they can see the press release that you've released

672
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,092
and they'll get access to the screenshots as well.

673
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:54,833
Make sure to include a way to contact you in the press release.

674
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:58,594
If you want, you can make a press at domain email address

675
00:40:58,654 --> 00:41:01,014
so that you don't get spammed at your personal email address

676
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:02,775
because this will be public information.

677
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,716
So you've done a bunch of marketing work and you've launched your game.

678
00:41:08,729 --> 00:41:11,912
But you're not sure how to tell if your marketing has been successful.

679
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:17,457
Well, measuring success is a tricky business, and if you want to get into analytics and

680
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,480
click-through rates and KPIs, this is not the talk for you.

681
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:25,624
But assuming you're a small dev who already has limited time to focus on marketing, here

682
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:27,326
are some great ways to measure your success.

683
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:32,208
First of all, set realistic expectations and goals that will make you feel good.

684
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:37,311
Everyone wants to be the next Stardew Valley or Vampire Survivors, but realistically, the

685
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:41,052
large majority of indie games only make a few thousand dollars in sales.

686
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:46,955
Knowing that, success could look like getting ten reviews on Steam on launch day, or posting

687
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:51,057
a tweet that gets a hundred likes, or getting two hundred subscribers to your Discord.

688
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,759
Or you don't have to think in numbers.

689
00:41:54,499 --> 00:41:57,802
It could be a friend telling you that they're so proud of the game that you've made.

690
00:41:58,222 --> 00:42:02,025
Or maybe your favorite small streamer compliments the lasso mechanic in your horse game.

691
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,568
Or maybe you get your first purchase of your game in another country.

692
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:11,032
Identify the success that matters to you, the things that will make you feel good, and

693
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:12,453
use those as barometers.

694
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:16,176
Don't base your game's success off of any other game's measure.

695
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:18,858
Comparing yourself to others will only bring you down.

696
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:25,726
So you've launched your game, you've had some successful and not so successful marketing beats.

697
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:28,889
What do you do now? How do you keep the conversation going?

698
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,952
First things first, be proud of what you made.

699
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:37,397
Making a game is incredibly difficult, and to do that and release it is a very impressive task.

700
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:42,903
If you're not thrilled with your sales, remember that most people buy games when they're discounted.

701
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,354
Check Steam's rules for how often you can discount your game,

702
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:49,436
and if you'd like a boost to your sales,

703
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:52,058
make sure you're following and keeping up with the discounts.

704
00:42:53,776 --> 00:42:58,199
Continue to engage with your community and make sure to address any bugs or issues that

705
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:00,040
come up in a reasonable amount of time.

706
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,863
If people see that a game is continuously being worked on, they're more likely to buy it.

707
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,845
If there's a feature that you didn't have time to get to before you launched your game,

708
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,006
now's the time to add it.

709
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:15,369
New content, updates, and DLC are all good post-launch marketing beats, and they can

710
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:17,070
drive more people to play your game.

711
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:22,088
Remember, people can only hear about your game if you're talking about it, and some

712
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:24,610
people might not hear about it until months after it comes out.

713
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,452
You can announce your game as many times as you want.

714
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:32,136
In a month or two, throw up another tweet that's like, my horse shampooing game is out

715
00:43:32,216 --> 00:43:33,938
now with an embedded trailer.

716
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:37,120
You never know when it's going to hit the right people at the right time.

717
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,423
Someone might see that tweet and be like, oh, this game just released, I have to go

718
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:43,385
buy it right now, even though you released it, you know, three months ago.

719
00:43:44,366 --> 00:43:47,528
and continue to seek out and submit to festivals and Steam events.

720
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:52,151
Now you can submit to the festivals that prefer finished games like IGF or IndieCade,

721
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:54,253
and there are always Steam events happening.

722
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:59,556
Chat with your fellow devs to know when genre-specific or content-specific events are happening.

723
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,398
Keep your fans engaged for your next game.

724
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:06,241
Keep chatting with them and let them know your plans ahead of time.

725
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:10,684
These are the people who are most likely to spread the word when you have your next game coming,

726
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:12,365
when you start working on another game.

727
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:13,786
So don't forget about them.

728
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,098
Anything can be a marketing beat.

729
00:44:18,678 --> 00:44:20,979
If you see a lot of interest for your game in another region,

730
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:23,560
find a localizer to translate your game and release it.

731
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,741
That's a marketing beat.

732
00:44:25,381 --> 00:44:27,702
If you feel like your launch trailer was a bit lackluster,

733
00:44:27,963 --> 00:44:30,104
cut a new one or hire a trailer maker

734
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:32,045
and re-announce your game with the new trailer.

735
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:41,201
If you really feel up to the challenge, you can release your game on another platform, another PC storefront for example, or you can look at mobile or console.

736
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:49,032
Just make sure you know what you're getting into and consider talking to a publisher or other devs that have self-published before looking into porting to a console.

737
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:52,192
You can also look for non-games related connections.

738
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:56,334
I worked on a game called Space Otter Charlie, where you play as an otter in outer space.

739
00:44:56,815 --> 00:45:00,857
And we reached out to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which has a Twitch channel where they live

740
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:04,559
stream, you know, live animals at the aquarium.

741
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:06,720
And they actually streamed the game for a few hours.

742
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,322
It was a really great way to make a connection to a non-games group that would not have otherwise

743
00:45:11,362 --> 00:45:12,063
heard about the game.

744
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,172
Here's a quick rundown of good talks to check out if you're interested in indie marketing.

745
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:23,794
If you want to take a picture of this slide and then look up all the things later, I know

746
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:24,854
it's a lot of content.

747
00:45:25,954 --> 00:45:29,736
The indie soapbox talk that is happening right after this one, that'll have Paige and Nick

748
00:45:29,776 --> 00:45:30,596
from Aggro Crab.

749
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:33,777
They've done a lot of great work marketing their next game on TikTok.

750
00:45:34,437 --> 00:45:37,478
And remember that these will all be in the GDC vault as well, so don't feel like you

751
00:45:37,498 --> 00:45:38,679
have to go to every single one.

752
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,500
There's three on Thursday, all at the exact same time, which, you know...

753
00:45:44,885 --> 00:45:49,546
But also remember that you're at GDC, so use this time to make connections and tell people

754
00:45:49,586 --> 00:45:50,128
about your game.

755
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:57,959
Thank you so much for coming to my talk. I hope you now have a better understanding of how to

756
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:02,864
market your indie game by yourself without a budget. Uh we have some time for questions so if

757
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:07,488
you have any questions um step up to the microphone and make sure to talk to say your

758
00:46:07,528 --> 00:46:13,393
question directly into the microphone and I will answer it as best as I can. Um if you'd like to

759
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:17,596
follow up on anything feel free to DM me on Twitter. I'm always happy to answer questions.

760
00:46:18,097 --> 00:46:18,377
Thank you.

761
00:46:29,374 --> 00:46:29,675
Start now?

762
00:46:30,076 --> 00:46:31,238
Yeah.

763
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:31,899
Quick question.

764
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,362
So what do you recommend?

765
00:46:33,382 --> 00:46:36,507
Well, I know it says no budget, but hypothetically speaking,

766
00:46:36,548 --> 00:46:39,613
if you had a budget for TikTok, what would you recommend on a daily basis

767
00:46:39,894 --> 00:46:40,836
and for what period of time?

768
00:46:42,087 --> 00:46:44,829
So if you do have a budget to spend on marketing,

769
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:47,910
this comes down to the connections that you've made.

770
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,572
You can find people who do work marketing indie games on TikTok.

771
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:54,733
Reach out to them, ask them if they have,

772
00:46:55,053 --> 00:46:56,614
you know, what their availability is like.

773
00:46:57,034 --> 00:46:58,675
A lot of times you're gonna wanna focus your marketing

774
00:46:58,695 --> 00:47:00,156
to right before the game's launch.

775
00:47:00,296 --> 00:47:02,077
So if you have the budget for three months

776
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:04,138
of TikTok marketing, make sure it's the three months

777
00:47:04,178 --> 00:47:05,178
before your game launches.

778
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:09,000
If you don't know what amount of time to do,

779
00:47:10,154 --> 00:47:14,939
Generally it's up to how much money you have and how much the person you're hiring costs. Um, you

780
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:20,965
wanna do maybe one or two TikToks a week. A lot of people will charge per video or per hour. Um, so

781
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:26,091
it's essentially up to the budget that you do have. So you're saying it's better to allocate the

782
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:31,036
dollars to a person that maybe like an influencer or something versus

783
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:35,448
me personally putting out the video. Is that what you're saying?

784
00:47:35,588 --> 00:47:40,291
No, so, so if you, if you have the money to like hire someone to run the TikTok for you,

785
00:47:41,212 --> 00:47:42,073
is that what you're asking about?

786
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:47,376
No, no, no. Like let's say I have a game and I have the money to promote the video.

787
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:49,198
That's what I'm asking.

788
00:47:49,278 --> 00:47:53,681
Yeah. In general, spending money to, um, spending money on ads or spending money to

789
00:47:53,701 --> 00:47:56,002
like promote a post that generally doesn't do well.

790
00:47:56,453 --> 00:48:02,597
Um, across the board, usually paid ads or promoted videos on TikTok or promoted tweets,

791
00:48:02,877 --> 00:48:07,300
they aren't worth the spend. Um, there's research that's shown that the click-through rates for those are-

792
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,742
are just- you generally aren't gonna get your money back on those.

793
00:48:11,383 --> 00:48:15,285
Okay, I understand. It was just that.

794
00:48:16,443 --> 00:48:19,226
The confusion about, you know, actually expanding the audience.

795
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,631
Not like you engage the audience, but then you need to actually build the audience.

796
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:25,134
So I understand what you're saying.

797
00:48:25,174 --> 00:48:25,734
Yeah.

798
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:26,195
Thank you.

799
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:26,696
Thank you.

800
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:32,601
Thanks, Michelle. My name's Corinne. I work for New Media Manitoba.

801
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:36,103
We help interactive digital media companies in Manitoba, Canada.

802
00:48:36,864 --> 00:48:41,487
And this is a great framework for many of our devs and new studios.

803
00:48:42,368 --> 00:48:47,832
At what point should our studios be considering working with a marketing firm

804
00:48:47,852 --> 00:48:49,673
and expanding beyond the do-it-theirselves?

805
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,142
So the biggest factor in that is if they have the budget for it.

806
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:59,206
If you find yourself with, you know, if you've gotten funding from a grant or, you know,

807
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:03,089
an external funding source, and you don't need that funding for yourself for the game's

808
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:06,691
development, that's a good time to start looking for external marketing firms.

809
00:49:07,752 --> 00:49:09,492
And it's also a good time to shop around.

810
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:13,053
You want to make sure that you have a firm that you both can afford and

811
00:49:13,093 --> 00:49:16,874
is also going to be able to give you the support that you need.

812
00:49:17,634 --> 00:49:23,656
But if you have money and it's a toss up between marketing or

813
00:49:24,076 --> 00:49:26,016
hiring a really good artist for your game,

814
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:28,637
you may want to put it toward the actual development of the game first.

815
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,718
And then if you get more money later on,

816
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:34,239
then you can move on to looking to outsource that.

817
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:35,559
Great, thank you.

818
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:35,899
Thanks.

819
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:44,011
Hi, thanks for the talk Michelle. Um, is it a good idea to use the same content across all of

820
00:49:44,071 --> 00:49:49,000
the different social media accounts or is it better to make sure every piece of content is unique?

821
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,915
Yeah, absolutely. So you definitely want to cross post your content. Um, if you

822
00:49:53,935 --> 00:49:58,357
make a video for TikTok, you can post that on Twitter, um, post it, you know, on Instagram if

823
00:49:58,377 --> 00:50:03,080
you have one. Yeah, if you're making one piece of content, make sure to post it on all of the

824
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,641
platforms that you have. That way you're not spending a lot of time making content for a lot

825
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:07,381
of different platforms.

826
00:50:08,198 --> 00:50:13,520
I see, and you mentioned, um, launch discounts, um, what are your thoughts on that versus, like,

827
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,841
pre-orders, and if you're offering a price for pre-orders, should you give a discount compared

828
00:50:19,861 --> 00:50:24,623
to that? Yeah, so pre-orders are a little tricky to do, but if you're able to manage them, I would

829
00:50:24,683 --> 00:50:29,744
say offer the pre-order at the same discount that you're offering the launch discount at, um,

830
00:50:29,864 --> 00:50:32,985
because that is also an extra incentive for people to pre-order your game.

831
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:37,467
because they'll see that it's preorder and get a discount. You could even offer the preorder at a

832
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:41,650
higher discount rate to get people more interested. Um, just make sure that the people who

833
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:46,913
preordered your game are not getting, you know, screwed out of, you know, the, the, the, the

834
00:50:46,953 --> 00:50:48,477
10% launch discount or whatever.

835
00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:49,477
Got it. Thank you.

836
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,477
Hey Michelle, really helpful talk.

837
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:57,000
So I was just wondering at what, uh, stage in the development process do you

838
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,341
think is the best time to start marketing?

839
00:50:59,634 --> 00:51:01,315
As soon as you have announced your game.

840
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:04,617
As soon as people know you're making a game, you want to start doing your marketing.

841
00:51:05,257 --> 00:51:11,322
If you have limited time to focus on it, generally, you know, six months before launch is sort

842
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:13,863
of the minimum amount of time you want.

843
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:15,745
A year before launch is good.

844
00:51:16,225 --> 00:51:19,987
If you're working on a game super, super part-time and you know it's going to take you like seven

845
00:51:20,048 --> 00:51:24,811
years, you still want to be talking about it, but you don't need to be doing the weekly,

846
00:51:25,271 --> 00:51:28,533
you know, the weekly plan that I had until about a few years out.

847
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:35,196
Okay, for sure. And a follow-up question to that. I was just wondering, do you recommend

848
00:51:35,256 --> 00:51:39,180
like kind of documenting your process as you're developing the game so that you can actually

849
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,143
– because I know there have been a lot of posts that have done really well where you

850
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:45,425
show like the early stages of your game and then moving on to like how far it's come.

851
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:48,648
So do you think that's a good idea to be documenting your process along the way?

852
00:51:48,987 --> 00:51:51,268
Yeah, absolutely. Documenting your development process is a

853
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,910
great tool for marketing. Um, for exactly the reason you said.

854
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,291
A lot of posts that are like, here's where the game started

855
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:58,633
and here it is, you know, three years later. Those posts do

856
00:51:59,073 --> 00:52:01,315
really well because people love to see the development process

857
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:03,356
of a game. Alright, for sure. Thank you so much. Thank you.

858
00:52:06,258 --> 00:52:07,258
Hi, thank you. Great talk.

859
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:16,882
So, trying to frame this, for my project I have a lot of anxiety about the tone clashing with marketing.

860
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:20,726
I'm going for a moody, atmospheric, mysterious type of game.

861
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:26,552
And if I'm making whimsical, funny posts, or if I'm showing behind the scenes of these

862
00:52:26,592 --> 00:52:31,416
things, I feel like I'm creating a clash between what I'm trying to deliver and what people are seeing.

863
00:52:31,837 --> 00:52:32,798
Do you have any thoughts on this?

864
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:37,299
Yeah, so the biggest thing to remember, um, you know, when you have a tone clash with

865
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:41,502
the marketing versus the tone of your game, uh, it goes back to the people follow people

866
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:46,485
thing. So humans are humans, um, and even if your game has a moody tone, the people

867
00:52:46,525 --> 00:52:50,728
playing it aren't gonna necessarily be, you know, that moody kind of person all the time.

868
00:52:51,028 --> 00:52:55,131
So they will want to hear the funny stories about the bugs that you run into or, you know,

869
00:52:55,251 --> 00:53:00,275
just a lighthearted chat about, you know, whatever specific thing is in your game. Um,

870
00:53:00,995 --> 00:53:04,877
Definitely focus your, your marketing a little bit more on the moody tone so that people know

871
00:53:04,977 --> 00:53:09,679
that is the tone of the game. Um, but remember that, you know, people like to see the human

872
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:15,022
element of game development. Um, and so it's, it's fine to have your marketing be, you know,

873
00:53:15,082 --> 00:53:17,283
more human than it is about the tone of the game.

874
00:53:18,223 --> 00:53:18,804
Awesome. Thank you.

875
00:53:22,606 --> 00:53:23,527
Fantastic talk, thank you.

876
00:53:25,308 --> 00:53:28,891
Quick clarifying question, you said that you want to get your Steam page out as soon as possible.

877
00:53:28,931 --> 00:53:35,336
Does that also count for many multi-year indie, unfunded projects, where it might be a long time before the game is out?

878
00:53:36,227 --> 00:53:41,829
Yeah it's so what time to get your steam page out can kind of be tricky and there's there

879
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:46,390
there are a lot of resources out there um that talk more about it. In general you want

880
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:50,511
to have it out as soon as possible again to drive people to do something um when you're

881
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:53,632
talking about your game you always want to have a call to action and that call to action

882
00:53:53,652 --> 00:53:57,793
in that case is to wish list it. Um there is a little bit of a boost that you get when

883
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:02,654
you first post your game on steam so like I said wait until you at least have you know

884
00:54:03,614 --> 00:54:08,558
the art to do the capsules and a good trailer to post your game or to to release your game on

885
00:54:08,598 --> 00:54:14,342
Steam um because you don't want to release a page that's barren um but even games that have been in

886
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:18,625
development for a long time it's it's always good to just have somewhere to point people where they

887
00:54:18,645 --> 00:54:22,848
can take an action if they're interested in the game. Okay so but sounds like yeah good art and

888
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:26,690
some mechanics and a video is what we want first. Yeah yeah. Okay thank you very much.

889
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:31,201
Hi, thanks for the talk.

890
00:54:32,542 --> 00:54:38,225
When it comes, with word of mouth being as powerful as it is, when it comes to spreading

891
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:44,909
word of mouth, should one rely on demos and discounts to sell the game, or how careful

892
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:49,712
should you be with giving out free copies of the game to friends and family or people

893
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:51,593
who might talk about the game when they play it?

894
00:54:52,073 --> 00:54:57,097
So yeah, the question about when to give out free copies of the game to encourage word

895
00:54:57,117 --> 00:54:59,418
of mouth marketing, it's a tricky one.

896
00:54:59,498 --> 00:55:03,421
You want to make sure that you're not devaluing your game, so if you're handing out like bundles

897
00:55:03,461 --> 00:55:09,166
and bundles of Steam keys to like everyone you know and don't know, then your game is

898
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:11,768
going to get a reputation of being like, oh, you don't need to pay for that.

899
00:55:12,328 --> 00:55:17,031
Um, so yeah, give out Steam keys to your family and your friends, um, and you know, the, the

900
00:55:17,091 --> 00:55:21,253
press and influencers that you've identified as good people, um, to talk about your game.

901
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:26,676
But make sure that you're not just giving one out to everyone that asks. Um, you can even sort of

902
00:55:26,976 --> 00:55:30,178
give a little hint. If people ask about your game, they're like, hey, I'm interested in

903
00:55:30,218 --> 00:55:33,860
covering your game, do you have a Steam key? And maybe they, you know, they don't have a

904
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,022
big following at all. Um, you can say something like, I'm sorry, I don't have any...

905
00:55:38,442 --> 00:55:43,847
to get out right now but the game is going on sale next week. Um let people know that there's a

906
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:47,250
time they can get it on discount. Um because yeah you want to make sure that you're not

907
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,616
devaluing your game in the process. Okay. Thank you. Hi so one of the questions I had was

908
00:55:50,616 --> 00:55:51,616
Okay. Thank you.

909
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,676
Hi so one of the questions I had was

910
00:55:54,676 --> 00:56:00,420
around um YouTube and Twitch. Do you see it as a devlog platform just a place to host trailers

911
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:02,622
um stuff like that?

912
00:56:02,972 --> 00:56:06,834
Yeah, for sure. So YouTube and Twitch are both good places, um, like you said, to, to put

913
00:56:06,874 --> 00:56:11,897
devlogs, um, to do dev streams if you want to do that on Twitch. Um, it's, it's a lot of

914
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:16,119
effort, which is why I didn't include it, uh, in the, the marketing plan that I have,

915
00:56:16,459 --> 00:56:21,002
because a stream itself could be more than an hour a day, you know. Um, but yeah, if you,

916
00:56:21,182 --> 00:56:25,484
if you, you know, have the tools to do it, uh, Twitch is a great place to show off your

917
00:56:25,584 --> 00:56:30,106
development process and YouTube can also be a good place to post, um, dev videos or

918
00:56:30,246 --> 00:56:31,387
post-stream videos.

919
00:56:32,508 --> 00:56:35,491
Or even little like, how did I make this thing in this game?

920
00:56:36,252 --> 00:56:39,155
So yeah, if that's something you're already inclined to do, feel free to do it.

921
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:42,078
I just think that the barrier to entry to making videos and

922
00:56:42,118 --> 00:56:43,419
streaming is pretty high.

923
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,584
So it does take a lot of time and effort to get started.

924
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:48,585
Okay, thank you.

925
00:56:52,332 --> 00:57:01,399
Hi, good evening, Michelle. Thank you for your talk. Excellent framework. I'm the co-founder and co-owner of tiny independent game studio, Wellfound Studio.

926
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:08,844
And my question is, what do you consider is more important between your marketing for your game studio or your game?

927
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:11,686
Or how do you strike a balance so one doesn't overpower the other?

928
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:15,979
Yeah, so in terms of marketing for a game versus a game studio,

929
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:19,961
I would say focus on the game first if you don't already have a following,

930
00:57:20,742 --> 00:57:23,344
because the game is going to get more attention.

931
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:26,586
Marketing for a game studio is a little harder to do,

932
00:57:27,147 --> 00:57:30,069
because people are going to be following your studio for the games you make anyway.

933
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:33,711
So market for the game first, get the following for the game that you've made,

934
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:36,953
and that way you can convert those followers to follow your studio

935
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:39,595
and get updates about other games that you may make in the future.

936
00:57:40,316 --> 00:57:40,816
Awesome, thank you.

937
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:51,031
Hi Michelle, thank you for the talk. How worth it is maintaining an email list or newsletter?

938
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:56,601
So that depends, oh to repeat the question, how worth it is it to maintain an email list or newsletter?

939
00:57:58,383 --> 00:58:03,585
It kind of depends on like what your following looks like and how the ability you have to

940
00:58:03,645 --> 00:58:08,326
send out newsletters. Um so if you you know use MailChimp or whatever if you know how

941
00:58:08,366 --> 00:58:12,548
to use those tools if you're able to format a nice looking newsletter send one out every

942
00:58:12,588 --> 00:58:17,729
few months or so then yeah it's a good idea to have um an email sign up on your website

943
00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:22,791
uh to drive people to that. But in general it's it's sort of hard to build a community

944
00:58:22,851 --> 00:58:24,891
off of that because it's not a two way

945
00:58:25,152 --> 00:58:29,117
communication stream. It's just, you're just blasting out this information to people.

946
00:58:29,437 --> 00:58:33,142
And it does take a little bit of work up front and a little bit of effort.

947
00:58:33,182 --> 00:58:37,006
So if it's something you already have down or something you've done, it's a good idea to do.

948
00:58:37,187 --> 00:58:39,029
But in general, it's not necessary.

949
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:54,701
Hi. I'm worried that there's a finite number of videos that I could make for my game that would communicate something new about it.

950
00:58:55,762 --> 00:59:03,371
Is that likely just nerves on my part, or are there some games that are harder to market through short clips?

951
00:59:03,909 --> 00:59:07,909
Yeah, um, so in terms of making, you know, video content about your game,

952
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:12,363
it is true that there are some games, especially games that are more about a singular gameplay loop

953
00:59:12,363 --> 00:59:16,363
that are gonna be a little bit harder to create new and interesting content with,

954
00:59:16,363 --> 00:59:19,363
um, but that's when you rely on other forms of, you know, the dev process.

955
00:59:19,363 --> 00:59:26,363
That's when you make videos about bugs that you've run into, you make videos about how you've, you know, made a certain aspect of the game,

956
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:30,363
or how you've decided on the character design or this mechanic. Um,

957
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:35,666
Just remember that any time, like at any point, someone could be watching the video that

958
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:41,249
you've posted for the first time. So it's not a big deal if you're repeating content or if a lot

959
00:59:41,269 --> 00:59:46,392
of your videos look the same. Um, but just make sure to, to, to add a little bit of variety in

960
00:59:46,412 --> 00:59:47,833
terms of what you're saying in the videos.

961
00:59:51,865 --> 00:59:52,325
Hi, Michelle.

962
00:59:52,365 --> 00:59:52,926
Thank you so much.

963
00:59:54,587 --> 00:59:56,788
So being on a student dev team who truly

964
00:59:56,849 --> 00:59:59,771
is on like a no budget DIY marketing kind of thing,

965
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:03,554
I was kind of curious about the reaching out

966
01:00:03,594 --> 01:00:07,577
to press lists type things versus going to networking events.

967
01:00:08,357 --> 01:00:10,099
Is it kind of like a feedback loop

968
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:13,021
of if you do the networking events, you will find press?

969
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:15,943
Or is it worthwhile to reach out to press

970
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:17,384
and then go to networking events?

971
01:00:18,021 --> 01:00:22,823
Yeah, thanks. Um, so the question was about, um, if it's worth going to networking events to meet

972
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:28,384
press and then, or is it, is it worth just reaching out to press out of time? Um, and the

973
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:32,206
answer is kind of both. Um, so when you go to networking events, you will meet with press and

974
01:00:32,226 --> 01:00:36,007
that goes back to the like making friends and, and talking to people as if they're people.

975
01:00:36,727 --> 01:00:41,469
Um, so you'll meet press there and then you'll be able to keep in touch with them. But also

976
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:45,010
there are a lot of press that you may not meet at events and you're not guaranteed to have

977
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:48,851
them available to network with. In which case it's good to reach out to them via email as

978
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:52,833
well. Um, a lot of times before events, if you're going to an event where your game is

979
01:00:52,873 --> 01:00:56,614
being showcased, you'll want to reach out to press ahead of time, um, who you know is

980
01:00:56,634 --> 01:01:00,215
gonna be there. Or even if you're not sure, just to ask and say, hey are you gonna be at

981
01:01:00,255 --> 01:01:03,336
this event? I'm gonna have a demo of my game there. I would love to chat with you about it.

982
01:01:06,822 --> 01:01:14,924
Um are there any other questions? Alright well thank you so much for coming out to my talk.

983
01:01:15,124 --> 01:01:21,186
Um remember to give, hold on I need to look at this thing, session evaluations. There will be

984
01:01:21,206 --> 01:01:26,767
an email sent to you to evaluate the session afterwards. Um but yeah if you're interested in

985
01:01:26,807 --> 01:01:31,649
chatting more about anything uh that's my twitter handle or if you like see me around GDC

986
01:01:31,669 --> 01:01:35,670
just feel free to come up chat with me. I love talking about this stuff. Thank you so much.
