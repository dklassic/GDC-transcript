1
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:08,394
I'm Nick Popovich. Thank you very much for showing up today.

2
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,317
If I see any familiar faces and I'm not waving,

3
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:13,240
it's because there's lights in my eyes right now

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,843
and I can't see anyone's faces, so I apologize.

5
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:19,146
Let's kick things off with who I am.

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,809
I'm the co-founder and CEO of Monami Park,

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,671
the game director of Slime Rancher.

8
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:25,917
Hopefully some of you have played it.

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,039
There's me on Twitter.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,682
I like to talk about game design a lot on Twitter,

11
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:33,024
so if you're interested in the contents of this talk,

12
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:37,068
some of it actually came from there, so there you have it.

13
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,992
And I'd also like to first put out a disclaimer

14
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:44,615
that this talk is not about how to make a great game.

15
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:48,840
You need one of those for the contents of this talk to matter.

16
00:00:50,142 --> 00:00:52,903
and that this stuff might not be a fit for your game,

17
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,844
and that's totally okay,

18
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:57,185
because I don't have all the answers,

19
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:58,466
no one at GDC does,

20
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:00,807
and this is not the one true way

21
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,668
of getting your game out there

22
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,129
and getting people to notice it.

23
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,230
But I do think that some of this stuff

24
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,931
will help your game succeed.

25
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:11,973
That's why I'm up here today talking about it.

26
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:14,634
And what are we talking about?

27
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:18,369
The three major topics of today are sell it with a gif,

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,493
staying relevant, and a place to call home.

29
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:26,438
The TLDR version though is that this talk is about

30
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:27,739
getting people to notice your game,

31
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,101
to buy it, and play it repeatedly.

32
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:34,806
That is the goal of what I'm about to do here.

33
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:37,469
So talk about your game, notice it,

34
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:39,090
buy it, play it repeatedly.

35
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:44,938
But first, let's have some rad game facts, shall we?

36
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:49,403
First rad game fact, thousands of games

37
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,344
are released every year.

38
00:01:51,898 --> 00:01:54,639
Second rad game fact, yes, seriously, thousands.

39
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,399
I highly recommend that you subscribe

40
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,820
to the ICO or I-C-O newsletter.

41
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,881
Just Google it and you will see all of the Steam games

42
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:04,961
that are released every week.

43
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:09,303
Last week, it was 156 games just before GDC

44
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:12,624
and that's one week, so that's what you're up against.

45
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:15,744
And also some of them even have marketing budgets

46
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,505
and you might not, so uh-oh.

47
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,724
And finally, you're competing with all of them,

48
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,047
every single one of them, whether they're good or not,

49
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:27,328
big or small.

50
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,870
And this is such a bummer that RadFox has decided

51
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,572
that he's gonna return to his home planet.

52
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,616
Okay, but why?

53
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:40,258
Why are you actually competing with all these games

54
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,740
despite the size of your game, your genre, et cetera?

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,502
Why is a AAA release that comes out tomorrow

56
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:48,424
actually taking customers away from you?

57
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:51,305
and that is because of time and attention.

58
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,587
And if you've been paying attention at GDC,

59
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,289
you may have heard more than a few people

60
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,630
talk about this at this point.

61
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,912
Time and attention is the focus of this talk,

62
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:05,637
and it's the core of why I make the games that I do

63
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,059
and put them out there in the way that I do,

64
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,781
and that's what we're talking about today.

65
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:12,863
So we're gonna get right into a takeaway, right off the bat.

66
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:16,648
that your game is what customers buy from you,

67
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,752
but time is what you buy from them.

68
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:21,033
Don't forget that.

69
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:25,279
It's not enough just to sell a game to someone

70
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,602
because you're still taking something from them,

71
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,003
and that is time.

72
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:34,823
So earlier I'd said everyone else's games were your competition.

73
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:35,843
It doesn't end there.

74
00:03:35,963 --> 00:03:39,325
I'm sorry that I'm starting with such a bummer at the beginning of the talk.

75
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:40,425
I promise it gets better.

76
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:46,087
But your actual competition is everyone else's games, as we just established, and that includes

77
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:46,488
Fortnite.

78
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:51,871
It's also Netflix and YouTube and Twitter and sad political news.

79
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:58,134
All of that stuff takes up time and attention and you need that if anyone's going to pay

80
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:01,036
attention to your game, to buy it and to play it.

81
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:03,578
But don't worry, you are not the only one.

82
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:07,780
Netflix says that Fortnite is bigger competition than HBO and Hulu.

83
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:13,844
That's not just Netflix throwing some shade at their competition, it's time and attention.

84
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:18,327
Also major game publishers are feeling the impact of peaking attention.

85
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:20,628
There is only so much going around.

86
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:27,175
And there's also stuff like this, which is that they're starting to put little trailers

87
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:31,660
before a normal trailer, and it's because they know that you've got to see explosions

88
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,105
like right away, or else you're going to stop paying attention or scrub to 30% of the way

89
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:38,628
through, which is what most people do with your video.

90
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:41,431
So that's concerning.

91
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:44,790
And we're gonna really quickly take a look

92
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,815
at the average day of an adult in the U.S. in 2018.

93
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,078
It was four hours on phone and tablet.

94
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:54,622
So if you make mobile games, you have an advantage here.

95
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:58,747
Four hours of live TV, that's not playing video games.

96
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:01,771
That's either watching sports online or on cable

97
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:02,992
or just watching cable.

98
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,642
6.8 hours of sleeping, 8 plus hours of work on weekdays,

99
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:12,543
and you check your phone a bunch of times a day.

100
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,865
And that doesn't even factor in eating, commuting,

101
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:18,726
other life things, bathing yourself, all of that.

102
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:22,448
So what we're left with is two free hours

103
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:25,290
during the weekdays for new information,

104
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,412
and 10 on the weekends, and of course,

105
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,072
that doesn't count any of the other stuff

106
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,573
that you're gonna do on the weekends.

107
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:35,334
So, like I said, starting with a bit of a bummer,

108
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:38,276
but context is necessary for the rest of this.

109
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:41,177
And so we're going to move on to our first major topic

110
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:44,439
and leave the rad 90s to sell it with a GIF.

111
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,101
Okay.

112
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:50,942
First of all, GIFs are good.

113
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:53,443
They communicate things very quickly,

114
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,284
they're a form of artistic expression,

115
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:58,266
and they're very mobile-friendly and easily shareable,

116
00:05:58,706 --> 00:05:59,586
especially on Twitter.

117
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,669
And speaking of Twitter, did you know that 31%

118
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:07,332
or Twitter users are 31% more likely to remember content

119
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:08,833
versus other online platforms?

120
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:10,955
Use stuff like this to your advantage.

121
00:06:11,215 --> 00:06:12,276
Find that stuff out.

122
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:16,639
But this part of the talk is not about

123
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,300
best social media practices.

124
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,782
So instead, we're gonna jump right away

125
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,022
to another takeaway.

126
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:26,706
And that is, can your game design fit inside a GIF?

127
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:33,023
Oh, so what do I mean by that?

128
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:37,305
Can you present your core gameplay loop in a GIF?

129
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:39,546
That is the thing that the player is doing

130
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,828
over and over and over, usually it lasts about two minutes.

131
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:46,650
Can you show that in a span of five or six seconds?

132
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,731
Can you show the killer app of your game in a GIF?

133
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,041
And that is the feature or the must-have or must-see thing

134
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:57,424
that is going to drive people to buy your game

135
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,605
or to check it out or at least want to know more.

136
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:02,647
This might be because you can't show your core gameplay loop,

137
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,888
but you can show that one powerful moment.

138
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:08,636
If you were Jurassic Park the movie, this is the T-Rex.

139
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,940
The T-Rex is not the focal point of the story,

140
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,963
but it sure as hell put people in seats to see that movie.

141
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,408
It can't just be explosions unless your game

142
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,810
is really about that and that's at its core

143
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,812
because we've seen explosions before.

144
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:26,393
In the case of Jurassic Park,

145
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,655
we hadn't seen a T-Rex like that before.

146
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:30,977
So what do you have as a killer app?

147
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,411
Can you teach someone to play your game in a GIF?

148
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:35,792
This one's amazing.

149
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:37,593
If you can manage to pull that off,

150
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:40,575
it doesn't have to be every single step of the way,

151
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,997
but if you can give someone the gist

152
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,699
of what it is to play your game,

153
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,180
and they can understand it,

154
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,882
and they can start picturing themselves playing your game,

155
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,424
you have just won an enormous battle.

156
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:55,426
You've walked right through a 1,000 foot firewall,

157
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:56,907
and you're onto the next step

158
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:58,268
of engaging with your customer.

159
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,068
Basically though, what it comes down to is,

160
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:04,129
can I get your game in a GIF?

161
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:06,370
Can I see it and can I get it?

162
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,031
I might have questions, questions are fine,

163
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:10,931
but does it answer something?

164
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,932
Does it answer something material?

165
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:15,713
That's what you want to be able to execute on in a GIF.

166
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,714
We set out to do this with Slime Rancher.

167
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:22,076
We were inspired by what I saw with Spelunky,

168
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,317
how it was able to really clearly communicate itself

169
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:26,538
in the form of a GIF.

170
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,339
And so we knew we had to do that.

171
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,260
The landscape was rapidly changing

172
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,280
when we were developing it.

173
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,301
And you may have heard this term before.

174
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:36,803
It was coined in Stranger in a Strange Land,

175
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,763
and it's called Grok.

176
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:40,564
People in game development use it a lot,

177
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,086
often grokking a game.

178
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:47,374
and it is to understand something intuitively or by empathy.

179
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:51,718
You are establishing an emotional rapport with something.

180
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:54,480
And often times we use it in game design when we say,

181
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,422
player has grokked your game,

182
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,005
they're really into it, they really get it,

183
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:02,147
they're in a position where they can evangelize it,

184
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,390
and they're willing to put up with some bullshit basically

185
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,833
in order to get more of that experience because they bought into it.

186
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:14,975
But here I'm applying this concept to before someone actually plays the game.

187
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:20,396
Now, obviously they're not going to grok your game via a gif in the same way that they would

188
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:24,256
had they spent hours and hours of playing it and achieved that level of groking.

189
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:30,318
But there is a shade of that, a grok light, if you will, where someone has bought into

190
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:34,058
it based on what you've put out there for people to consume.

191
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:39,135
And so really it comes down to what do you want the player to feel?

192
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:44,600
And I think this is an important question as an aside to ask that about every aspect

193
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,583
of your game design, everything that you're putting out there.

194
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:53,509
But this isn't just about emotional context in the narrative of your game, this is about

195
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:58,032
Do you want the player to feel frustrated at various points in the experience?

196
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:00,874
Do you want them to have an overwhelming sense of freedom?

197
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:05,137
Every decision that you make, every feature that you put in your game,

198
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:10,221
you should be thinking about what is the emotional context on the part of the player here?

199
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,302
What do I want them to feel?

200
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:15,844
Well, why would you stop with your game design?

201
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:20,588
Why wouldn't you think about how that relates to how it shows to people

202
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,989
on social media in the form of a GIF?

203
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,553
People make gifts of their gameplay all the time.

204
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,373
They make trailers.

205
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,695
But are you asking yourself,

206
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:31,677
what is it that I'm looking for the person looking at this

207
00:10:31,777 --> 00:10:33,639
to feel in response to it?

208
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,822
Because that might change what you decide to show.

209
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:39,344
And maybe it might change the kind of game

210
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:42,087
that you're making if you can't answer that question.

211
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:46,089
So, always ask that question.

212
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:48,851
You should always have something that you're trying to say.

213
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,993
And if you don't, you're just another game.

214
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:56,055
You're just another entry in a genre, if you're not saying anything different.

215
00:10:57,776 --> 00:11:02,259
So the reason this is important is, as we've previously established, everyone is distracted

216
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:03,059
all the time.

217
00:11:03,858 --> 00:11:05,560
The 90s segment taught us that.

218
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,282
And we have a finite amount of time and energy

219
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:11,205
to care about new things, your game included.

220
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:15,389
So the more time and energy is required, the harder the sell.

221
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,671
And I don't even just mean a game sale.

222
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,593
I mean to care about what I just saw

223
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,794
and maybe want to know more,

224
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:23,657
or to pay attention the next time I see that.

225
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:28,061
So basically reduce time to grok as much as possible.

226
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,623
So if you were selling burgers, for example,

227
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:33,866
to use a non-video game example,

228
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:36,710
and you just set up a stall, and you were making burgers,

229
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,873
you didn't put up a sign, you didn't put up a menu,

230
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:39,834
you didn't put up anything,

231
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:41,917
it's gonna be really hard to sell those burgers

232
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:45,042
until you put up a sign that says, burgers for sale.

233
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,443
Now I have context.

234
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:48,144
I know what it is that you're trying to sell.

235
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,926
But if you could then provide a picture of your delicious

236
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:54,189
burger that you're trying to sell and some reviews, you're

237
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:57,031
answering questions that people might have.

238
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:59,612
Even if it's just in their head, you are giving them

239
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:02,795
knowledge, and that's what's going to lead to either

240
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,616
wanting to know more or a sale.

241
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:09,419
So let's look at some games that do this very, very well.

242
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,501
And since I just mentioned Spelunky, I'll start there.

243
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,465
Spelunky, here's a GIF of it, shows you everything you need to know about this game in the form

244
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:21,925
of a GIF.

245
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:27,289
If you were my dad, you might look at Spelunky and say, this looks like Indiana Jones meets

246
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:27,849
Mario.

247
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,351
What is it?

248
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:34,814
But Spelunky shows you that it's a bunch of systems that are overlapping that generate

249
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:35,655
experiences.

250
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:36,896
This is just one GIF.

251
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:41,418
Any number of GIFs of Spelunky are going to show you different outcomes.

252
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:44,719
You may be looking at the same level, even though they're generated,

253
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:48,680
and seeing those different outcomes. And so as a player I'm looking at this now

254
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,762
and I'm thinking about all the different permutations of things that can happen.

255
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:56,924
It also does a really wonderful job of having fun by failing

256
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,826
and it shows you that in a GIF because the sequences that are occurring here

257
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:02,546
are comical.

258
00:13:03,006 --> 00:13:04,269
I think this is pretty funny here.

259
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,955
I think the player dies about six different ways here,

260
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,118
and I think that's really great.

261
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,563
So it does a great job of showing that off.

262
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,175
Another one is Superhot, and this is a great example

263
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:20,999
because it's showing you a very, very simple concept,

264
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,221
which is time only moves when you do,

265
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:26,924
and then demonstrating how a variety

266
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:30,448
of different scenarios can play out using that

267
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,931
as your main power in the game.

268
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:39,735
It also does a great example of showing that there's a huge difference between complex design and complex ideas.

269
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:47,561
You want to generally avoid complex ideas when you're trying to sell your game.

270
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:55,186
A perfect analog to this is in terms of simple idea but complex execution would be portal.

271
00:13:55,407 --> 00:14:01,171
I think that's probably the master class in this where you can very, very simply see in the form of a GIF.

272
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:05,554
to different portals and seeing what that means to you as the player

273
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:09,656
and then your mind just starts racing with all the different things that you can do.

274
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:12,719
If you, much like Superhot or Portal,

275
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,441
can get a player to start thinking about how they might play

276
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:19,743
your game, it's a huge advantage that you have.

277
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:23,646
I would actually relate this to how I used to

278
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,107
learn about games when I was...

279
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:29,670
A kid 9,000 years ago and opening up Nintendo Power and that's all we had.

280
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,712
We had screenshots to go by and really bad descriptions of those screenshots.

281
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:38,816
So you would make up in your head what this game could possibly be about and you got yourself

282
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:42,378
excited with lies that you were telling yourself.

283
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,699
And that's okay.

284
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:48,602
you might start thinking about the different scenarios in Superhot or the different weapons

285
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:53,305
that you might have, and that might not actually be in the game, but that's okay, because you're

286
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:58,068
getting your potential customers' imaginations excited. And those are the kind of things that

287
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:06,154
you want to be able to do with your game. So if you want to make games that people get quickly,

288
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:12,718
avoid complex ideas, but allow for complex design or execution on those simpler ideas.

289
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:19,194
Speaking of a simple idea, Rocket League, it's cars that play soccer.

290
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:23,695
But if I just told you that and you had never heard of Rocket League before, it was probably

291
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:26,956
a very awkward version of soccer that you're imagining.

292
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:33,118
Little did you know it's like rocket-powered matchbox cars that are also part ninja.

293
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,922
And I think there is not a lot in Rocket League

294
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:40,323
in terms of the moment to moment gameplay.

295
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:44,506
It's some cars and a ball and two goal zones.

296
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:48,568
But you can see that there's a number of different ways

297
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,690
that that can play out and it's exciting

298
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,412
and it gets right to the point and it's a huge hit.

299
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:58,277
something a little less elegant, Human Fall Flat.

300
00:15:58,517 --> 00:15:59,357
I really love this one,

301
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:03,358
because it's a kind of very different approach.

302
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:05,919
It's showing you awkwardness and silliness,

303
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,499
and comedy is great for GIFs.

304
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,300
It makes it very shareable.

305
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,461
But there needs to be room for extrapolation.

306
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:14,861
If you just show a joke,

307
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:16,901
if your game is the Wile E. Coyote,

308
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,745
you know, getting the dynamite blown up in his face,

309
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:21,186
it's a great joke.

310
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,549
But if there's no way that I can understand

311
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,050
how that relates to your game,

312
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,253
or how that might create interesting scenarios,

313
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:31,775
I'm left with nothing other than a great joke

314
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:34,518
that I share just like I share a bunch of other stuff online.

315
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:36,640
So with Human Fall Flat.

316
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:41,115
in part because I understand video games and that's a protagonist, I know that,

317
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:45,457
it's telling me that mundane things are being done stupidly in this game.

318
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:50,639
And especially if I buy into it and watch a couple other GIFs or check out a trailer,

319
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,162
I get that immediately. I've done mundane things before because I'm a normal human being,

320
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:59,824
and doing them stupidly and without consequence sounds really exciting to me. So I'll bite.

321
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:05,842
Next, Subnautica does a great job of showing you a single

322
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:07,803
breathtaking moment, it's killer app,

323
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:11,284
which is diving below the surface of the sea

324
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:14,125
and seeing a massive, mysterious,

325
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,026
underwater world for me to explore.

326
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:18,747
It has a huge advantage in that there just are not

327
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,168
a lot of underwater games, so it stands out in that regard.

328
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,769
It's also beautiful and it adds that mystery element to it.

329
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:29,310
I want to know more, I want to see more.

330
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,094
So Subnautica came out when there were a bunch of other survival games, but none of them

331
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:34,854
were underwater.

332
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:39,699
A lot of them you were rubbing rocks together and stuff in a muddy forest somewhere.

333
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,740
Subnautica was different.

334
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:47,365
It was gorgeous and beautiful and bright and I think that contributed hugely to its success,

335
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:50,688
all of which is communicated in an image or a GIF.

336
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,371
Next is Factorio.

337
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:58,889
I love this one.

338
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,254
I think it gets you very excited to play the game, and it's showing you scale of things

339
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:06,175
that you can do in it.

340
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:13,362
You can see machines that are working together with one another, and I don't know what the

341
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:18,947
goal of the game is, but I bet you it's to do big stuff and continue to do more and more

342
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:22,790
of it, and that's very exciting, and I want to build stuff like that.

343
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,033
But there's a few key points about what Factorio decided to do,

344
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:31,736
which is that it shows known machinery, like oil derricks and spaceships.

345
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:33,477
I think that's really important,

346
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:36,639
because the game might take place on a planet that you've never heard of,

347
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,581
and the point of the game might be...

348
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:43,722
that you're building this to defend yourself against, you know, bug people or something like that.

349
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:50,504
But it's showing me things that I can understand, and I can relate to what I'm seeing there.

350
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:56,065
And so it acts as a sort of inroad to me understanding more about this game.

351
00:18:56,125 --> 00:19:02,427
If everything were just alien machinery, I wouldn't get it as well as I do with what you're seeing here.

352
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:07,308
For example, if Rocket League was not cars playing soccer...

353
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:14,852
but it was UFO-like things hitting a Nova Cube through space or something like that,

354
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:19,835
and it was still soccer, it would be much less grokkable for people,

355
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:22,536
because I don't know anything about that.

356
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:25,238
So I kind of get that we're playing soccer here,

357
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,119
but if you can give me something that I understand,

358
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,362
that path to having more knowledge is a lot more open for me as a potential customer.

359
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:40,998
Next is They Are Billions, which does an amazing job of showing you scale and quantity.

360
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:48,666
It's very awe-inspiring, I think, to see the hordes of things that are attacking this city.

361
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,449
I immediately want to know what that's all about.

362
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,496
It doesn't tell me in this GIF who I am, but I imagine I'm not the zombie things.

363
00:19:56,676 --> 00:20:01,582
I imagine I'm the, you know, homes and castles and everything that seems like they are trying

364
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:02,523
to protect themselves.

365
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:07,509
So I have an idea right away about what this game is about, and it's showing me the killer

366
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:08,190
app, which is...

367
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,732
billions of zombies coming at once.

368
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:15,877
It's also not a giant 3D experience.

369
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:19,940
It's something that you might even be able to see on iPad.

370
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,162
And yet it does a wonderful job of having

371
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:25,304
an awe-inspiring scale moment.

372
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,547
You know, it doesn't need to have a giant 3D T-Rex.

373
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,430
It's showing lots of little characters running out of city.

374
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,012
And immediately you get this gut feeling like,

375
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:34,993
that's not good.

376
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:36,694
I should probably protect against that.

377
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,469
Slime Rancher similarly shows quantity.

378
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:47,014
We think that's one of our secret sauces, is that much like they are billions, in Slime

379
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:50,797
Rancher you're seeing hordes and hordes of slimes bumping into one another at any given

380
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:51,118
moment.

381
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:52,919
It's a physics nightmare under the hood.

382
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:57,983
But you don't normally see that in a game, so even if you're a person who doesn't understand

383
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,764
game technology or you're just a little kid.

384
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:05,428
You haven't seen something like that happen before as regularly in front of you, and so

385
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:06,749
it just feels different.

386
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:12,032
An RTS that has billions of things coming at you feels different.

387
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,232
So you're winning a battle.

388
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:13,793
However,

389
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,227
If you can do the giant T-Rex,

390
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,328
you should absolutely do the giant T-Rex.

391
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,549
If you have the budget for it,

392
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:22,290
I'm probably talking to the like four

393
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,750
triple A people in the room right now,

394
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,411
but if you have the budget for it, show it.

395
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,912
But I do wanna add that there is a wrinkle

396
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:29,753
to what Monster Hunter does.

397
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:31,874
I think it does it particularly well.

398
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:34,595
That is, I think they flip the script

399
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,856
and they focus on the monsters, not the player.

400
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,696
So Monster Hunter trailers

401
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:40,437
and anything that they're sharing online

402
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:42,778
typically is not showing you crafting systems

403
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:43,578
or anything like that.

404
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:49,143
That's all ancillary to the big show, which is giant monsters doing cool stuff.

405
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:53,026
And their marketing narrative is very, very consistent in that regard.

406
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:59,352
So any time I pick up some Monster Hunter marketing, a GIF that is being shared online,

407
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,033
it's a very consistent message.

408
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:07,939
I am a little, strong, brave, probably stupid warrior in this case, fighting enormous monsters,

409
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:12,443
and they seem very overwhelming, and that narrative is very, very consistent.

410
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,310
And you know I do include this.

411
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,791
I'm up here, so I'm gonna talk about Slime Rancher some more.

412
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:20,012
If you saw my previous talk,

413
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:22,833
we thought about this from the very beginning.

414
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:25,094
The action comes at the screen.

415
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:27,715
It's bright and cheery and very easy to parse,

416
00:22:28,135 --> 00:22:29,576
especially if you're just scrolling through

417
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:30,557
on something like Twitter.

418
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:32,898
And it has lots of physics,

419
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,238
and I already covered as to why

420
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:35,599
we feel like that's important.

421
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:40,911
Probably a better segue to this, to make it more powerful, would have been from Monster Hunter,

422
00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:43,453
but I'm going to go to one last one, which is Baba is You.

423
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:45,014
I think this game is great.

424
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:50,639
It's a recent release, and I mean no disrespect to it,

425
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:55,983
but on the surface, an indie pixel art turn-based puzzle game

426
00:22:56,464 --> 00:23:01,368
is probably not something that a mainstream gamer audience is going to care about.

427
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:01,568
However...

428
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,871
This game perfectly teaches you how to play it in a GIF.

429
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:09,612
This does it right here.

430
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:13,573
And I think it's a very, it is an otherwise sort of very

431
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:16,795
complicated game to understand, but it teaches itself very,

432
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:18,275
very beautifully.

433
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:21,076
And you immediately start thinking about all the

434
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:22,677
different permutations of this.

435
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:26,318
And I think it contributes hugely to its success.

436
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:29,580
It has a very strange name, has a very strange rule set,

437
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,560
and yet it teaches people how to play a game.

438
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,783
It's currently doing very, very well on Steam, last I checked.

439
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:36,645
I'm sure it'll do very well on Switch as well.

440
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:45,633
But I just want to play devil's advocate here and say that plenty of best-selling games

441
00:23:45,713 --> 00:23:46,553
don't do this.

442
00:23:47,274 --> 00:23:49,796
So I'm going to keep saying this throughout the talk.

443
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:53,780
If your game doesn't do the things that I'm talking about, it's fine.

444
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,101
You're going to do other things.

445
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:59,414
But in summary, your customers have finite time

446
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:00,454
and are highly distracted.

447
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:02,375
So make a game that customers don't

448
00:24:02,435 --> 00:24:04,055
have to work to understand.

449
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:06,996
Make a game that sells itself in the span of a GIF.

450
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,857
Doing so will actually affect your design.

451
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:11,437
If you set out to do this from the beginning,

452
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,898
it will affect your game design because you'll

453
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:17,039
have to be lean and focused in order to do this.

454
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:20,299
Customers need knowledge.

455
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,100
It makes it easier for them.

456
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,381
And as Johnny Utah famously said, knowledge equals sales.

457
00:24:29,347 --> 00:24:33,209
All right, so let's move on to the next topic,

458
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,210
which is staying relevant.

459
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:37,531
And I'll just say right now

460
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:39,432
that this is the most difficult and expensive part

461
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,333
of the three things that I'm talking about today.

462
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:44,054
So what is staying relevant?

463
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,816
It is having new content to play over time,

464
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,677
remaining community relevant to play over time,

465
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:52,759
remaining streamer or YouTube relevant over time,

466
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:56,200
with a goal to continuing to sell over time.

467
00:24:57,498 --> 00:24:59,603
Some of you are probably already doing this with your games.

468
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:00,504
And that's great.

469
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:01,807
This will just be a refresher.

470
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:03,511
Maybe I'll have something new to offer here.

471
00:25:04,694 --> 00:25:10,716
But the takeaway right away is that I believe that your game needs a pulse to survive.

472
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:16,598
Games with a beating heart have a far better chance of staying on the charts.

473
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:22,519
And very rarely does anyone these days release a game and just walk away from it.

474
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,000
And six months later, it's still a bestseller.

475
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:28,561
Those instances are extremely rare.

476
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:29,982
I wouldn't bank on that.

477
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:33,843
Unless you're Nintendo, they can manage to do that.

478
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:36,909
So how do we keep the pulse?

479
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,672
The two major ones are content updates for your game

480
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:45,734
and having a multiplayer sharing feature in your game.

481
00:25:46,395 --> 00:25:47,275
Both of those together,

482
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,236
and that's the most powerful cocktail.

483
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:52,438
But there's also content creation from your community

484
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:55,100
if you've released a tool set and you foster that

485
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,182
and players are able to make their own content, that's huge.

486
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:02,107
There's community scene and competition.

487
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:05,449
This pretty much requires multiplayer to work,

488
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:08,111
but you can be very, very clever about that.

489
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,293
And then porting to other platforms.

490
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,755
This might seem like it's not a means

491
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:16,236
of staying relevant over time,

492
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:18,277
and certainly maybe not as powerful

493
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:19,318
as some of the other ones,

494
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:23,040
but it is, on its own, a very useful tool,

495
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,182
especially if you are releasing special

496
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:26,963
or deluxe editions of your game

497
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:29,185
as you port it to new platforms over time.

498
00:26:30,306 --> 00:26:35,191
Basically, try to treat every port that you do as a new launch of your game.

499
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:39,736
Try and have some opportunity to scream about it again when you port it.

500
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,018
Don't just say it's now available on this platform.

501
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:42,359
Thank you.

502
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:42,679
Good night.

503
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,362
Then there's community engagement.

504
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,044
This one really is necessary to work,

505
00:26:48,504 --> 00:26:50,405
really requires some of the other ones

506
00:26:51,065 --> 00:26:53,007
in order to be best.

507
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:55,328
Very rarely can you just release a game

508
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:56,769
and engage with your community

509
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,270
and that's gonna keep you relevant

510
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,630
for six months to a year.

511
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:02,512
But it does work very, very well

512
00:27:03,013 --> 00:27:05,554
in concert with content updates, multiplayer,

513
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:08,396
and especially a community and scene competition.

514
00:27:09,772 --> 00:27:12,875
But why do you do this? It sounds expensive, it sounds like a lot of work.

515
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:17,440
Well, it's because long-term support of your game is becoming expected.

516
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:20,784
I'm sure you've read one or two Steam reviews that say things like,

517
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:25,489
dead game, negative review. As unfair as that is, it happens.

518
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:30,476
Supporting a released game is easier and less risky than building a new one.

519
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:33,221
Obviously you need to already have some traction.

520
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:39,470
If you have shipped your game and it didn't work out, continuing to support it might not

521
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,091
be for you.

522
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:44,153
and just remember that concurrency is king.

523
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:50,116
And that is not just about making an online PVP game,

524
00:27:50,156 --> 00:27:53,237
so obviously you need concurrency in order for it to work.

525
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:55,839
I'm talking about at any given moment.

526
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:01,643
the total number of people playing your game in this moment, by the day, or by the week,

527
00:28:01,824 --> 00:28:06,988
is really important and really relevant to your success, even if you have, like we did,

528
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:13,213
a single-player offline game. And the reason for that is it's relative. You don't need to

529
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:18,757
target 10,000 concurrent users in order for it to be material to your success. You need to target

530
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:22,841
a relatively small number of people that can grow into a bigger one.

531
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:30,167
And that will then lead to sales because it is a tiny little zeitgeist that can grow into a bigger one.

532
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:34,170
And since I just mentioned it, how does this lead to sales?

533
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:38,453
Well, viral mechanisms on Steam, PS4, and Xbox.

534
00:28:38,513 --> 00:28:41,576
This is one of the principal ways that we sell on Slime Rancher.

535
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:43,557
We don't spend money on marketing.

536
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:47,421
We rely on this, which is we support the game over time.

537
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:52,003
and people play it over time, including existing players

538
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:53,964
who have stuck with us, that's really important,

539
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:56,385
because all the while, they are blasting

540
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:58,687
to their friends list on these platforms

541
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:00,708
that they're currently playing Slime Rancher.

542
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:04,350
And if you're the new release for today,

543
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,631
and you have some of your friends are playing that game,

544
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:10,233
you're gonna hear about it,

545
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:11,774
it's gonna pop up in their friends list,

546
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:13,514
you're like, any other game that's been released.

547
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:16,116
And I might pay attention to it, I might not.

548
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:21,839
And if that's your only chance that you're going to encapsulate that little weak launch moment,

549
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:27,442
or weak launch moment, and that's it, you just drove right past a billboard and you just crossed

550
00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:32,804
your fingers that maybe people paid attention. But if you keep beating that drum and releasing

551
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:37,527
new content over time and people keep blasting to their friends lists that they are currently

552
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:44,030
playing your game, eventually, like a billboard that you drive past to work every day, they see it.

553
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,853
and now they're finally paid attention to it, now they maybe remember the name,

554
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:52,316
and now they're associating with this game that their friends seem to play a lot of,

555
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:56,819
and finally it just sort of worms their way into their head, and they're familiar enough with it

556
00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:00,762
that they have that little bit of knowledge, and it could lead to the next step,

557
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:03,724
which might be a sale, it might be wanting to know more,

558
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,686
and reaching out to their friends, or...

559
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,549
at least looking at the game page, but it is a step.

560
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:11,691
It's very important, and you earn those

561
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:13,052
by doing long-term support.

562
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:17,136
Wishlist conversions and gifting from sales is another one.

563
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:22,521
There is a constant churn of your wishlist

564
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:24,963
that as long as you're doing things right

565
00:30:25,263 --> 00:30:27,646
and you have a game that people want to play,

566
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,327
you will just get a constant churn

567
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,970
of people converting on your Steam wishlist.

568
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:36,001
into sales over time though.

569
00:30:36,522 --> 00:30:39,282
And a lot of that comes up when Steam broadcasts

570
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:41,663
to customers that a game from your wishlist is on sale.

571
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:45,304
Well, if they vaguely remember it, don't remember it,

572
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,564
or something like that,

573
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:49,064
that it's gonna be a much harder sell.

574
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:52,265
If it's that game that they have now passed the billboard

575
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:54,986
many a time and their friends are still playing it,

576
00:30:55,306 --> 00:30:56,526
maybe now is the time.

577
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:57,826
But maybe it's not.

578
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:02,609
And that's my third point, that sometimes people are just busy and distracted and maybe

579
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:04,109
they're not going to buy your game now.

580
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:07,871
We establish that everyone's very distracted, we don't have a lot of time going around.

581
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:10,672
It doesn't mean that they hate your game or they're never going to buy it.

582
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:14,094
I think sometimes we fall into this trap of thinking, I'm going to release my game.

583
00:31:15,014 --> 00:31:20,936
And all the people that are going to either buy it or not are going to do so, and that's

584
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:21,156
it.

585
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,457
You've got to keep working it.

586
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:28,819
And I've backed things on Kickstarter that I've never even played.

587
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,999
That's the situation that we're dealing with.

588
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:33,800
Don't just be another entry in someone's Steam library.

589
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:40,976
So, the other final point is just joining the bandwagon and discussion.

590
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:43,818
This is why concurrency is powerful.

591
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:47,599
It's because then there are people talking about your game, and if you can get people

592
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:52,722
talking and sharing things like a GIF on social media, then we're all part of this discussion.

593
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:57,804
It's a much easier sell if the customer thinks that there is momentum behind it.

594
00:31:58,144 --> 00:32:00,865
And some of that you can kind of generate on your own

595
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,525
by just pushing that out there,

596
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:05,326
let's say in the form of GIFs on Twitter,

597
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:07,386
or by supporting your game

598
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:09,967
and having people blast it to their friends

599
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:11,907
that they're playing your next content update,

600
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,167
playing it, playing it, playing it.

601
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:14,868
You're generating your own buzz

602
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:16,608
in people's friends' networks.

603
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:20,369
So in summary, I hope you noticed, by the way,

604
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:22,589
that the tomatoes have been growing slowly over time.

605
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:23,950
We put some effort into that.

606
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:26,820
Your game is a garden, nurture it.

607
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,822
Stay relevant by doing the things

608
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:30,923
that give your game a pulse.

609
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,806
And keeping a pulse keeps you selling your game.

610
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,011
And you can enjoy delicious tomatoes.

611
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,714
Final section for the talk is a place to call home.

612
00:32:48,055 --> 00:32:49,076
And so we're gonna kick things off,

613
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:51,037
instead of a takeaway, with a question.

614
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:56,764
Have you ever sat down to play a game and not chosen a specific one because you can't

615
00:32:56,784 --> 00:33:01,189
recall where you left off, the game is stressful or difficult and you were looking to relax,

616
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,594
you know that you will need to find a group like a multiplayer game, or you remembered

617
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:08,096
that you were stuck on something?

618
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:12,921
I'm sure many of us have done that, and that is as a result of friction.

619
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:14,743
All of that stuff is friction.

620
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,231
And so now we're gonna get right away into a takeaway,

621
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:20,152
which is that friction kills.

622
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:24,494
Friction being a killer is well-known in game design.

623
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:25,895
We often think about this, though,

624
00:33:25,995 --> 00:33:29,237
in terms of game systems and game experience.

625
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,358
So it is after the player is playing the game.

626
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,439
If they encounter things that are bad

627
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,500
or that impede their progress or are confusing,

628
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,701
anything that keeps them from playing your game

629
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:39,842
and keeps them from enjoying it

630
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:43,163
that you are likely responsible for, that is friction.

631
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:49,548
But I'm talking about the idea of friction being friction itself.

632
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:56,233
So not to get too out there, but it's the idea that friction exists in the game that

633
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:58,775
is creating friction from anyone playing your game.

634
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:02,096
And so the solution to this is to give your game

635
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:03,678
a place to call home.

636
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:07,122
So what is home?

637
00:34:08,603 --> 00:34:11,827
Home, by my definition, is any environment,

638
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:15,511
mode, or activity in a game that allows for relaxed,

639
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:18,314
low-consequence play, but still issues

640
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:20,616
meaningful rewards or progress.

641
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:27,701
I don't think this is talked about nearly enough in games, and I think this is really important,

642
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,382
and so that's why I devoted a whole section to it.

643
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:34,631
This is not a literal home base in your game.

644
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:39,754
This is often the kind of the cozy aspect of your game.

645
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:42,096
And it doesn't mean because you're making

646
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:43,997
Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley

647
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:45,438
and you've made a cozy game.

648
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:49,280
There can be cozy moments in very stressful games

649
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,402
and very big action oriented games.

650
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:56,365
And as long as it conforms to this definition here,

651
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:58,066
that would be this game's home.

652
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:00,870
And so I'll give you some examples.

653
00:35:01,531 --> 00:35:03,953
In Destiny, it's running patrols and bounties.

654
00:35:05,294 --> 00:35:09,217
So this is an activity that is available to you at any time.

655
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:11,278
I'm sure everyone's familiar with what this is,

656
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:13,360
but just in case you're not,

657
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,541
you're allowed to drop on a planet,

658
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:16,142
you're not doing any one specific mission.

659
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:20,486
You're kind of wandering an open world and things will happen in front of you and you

660
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:22,068
can choose to engage with those things.

661
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:25,011
And you also have a little quest list of things that you can be doing.

662
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:29,996
The rest of Destiny content is PvP and high stakes missions and raids.

663
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:36,442
And it's all a higher tier of play, a higher form of commitment to playing Destiny for

664
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:37,123
that evening.

665
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:42,788
So you are able to, in Destiny, by running patrols and bounties, to wait for friends

666
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:46,651
to come online or finish the activities that they're currently engaged in.

667
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,733
And you're not staring at a matchmaking screen when you're doing that.

668
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:51,695
You're wandering around doing your own thing.

669
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:58,160
And you might be waiting for a raid group, but this acts as a first tier of play commitment

670
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,222
to those other tiers that I mentioned before.

671
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:06,266
And it's important to note that even legendaries can drop when you're wandering around here.

672
00:36:06,286 --> 00:36:08,027
One of the best rewards in the game.

673
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:11,490
Diablo 3 does a fantastic job of this, where

674
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,654
go in a direction, and you'll be rewarded equally for whatever it is that you're doing.

675
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,517
So it just feels good. It's like Mac and Cheese the video game.

676
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,613
Fortnite, PvP game, I'm terrible at it.

677
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:30,338
I get killed right away, but there is a battle pass

678
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,321
and that has objectives that allow me

679
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,805
to get meaningful rewards and do things

680
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:37,429
other than trying to be one out of a hundred.

681
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:43,090
So this, I think, was one of Fortnite's brilliant moves,

682
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,731
is they realized we have a game

683
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:47,591
where we put 100 people in the room

684
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,892
and 99 of them are losers.

685
00:36:50,372 --> 00:36:52,372
And you might not think about it that way.

686
00:36:52,432 --> 00:36:56,613
You might be very, very happy getting in the top 10%.

687
00:36:56,753 --> 00:36:58,673
I'm happy if I can kill one person in it.

688
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:02,714
But it has these things that I can pursue on my own

689
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:04,635
whenever I want to, and hey.

690
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:07,137
a bunch of times it's just doing the thing,

691
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:08,878
it's just playing the game and I can decide

692
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:11,860
to go somewhere, do something, or have a different objective

693
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,863
that isn't being the best out of 100 people.

694
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:20,187
Mario Odyssey is obviously a pretty relaxed experience,

695
00:37:20,227 --> 00:37:23,029
but there are definitely bigger challenges in it,

696
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:25,951
and it isn't really just about sheer difficulty

697
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:27,953
that we're talking about, but it's version of home

698
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:30,435
is collecting moons from past levels.

699
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:34,900
And the reason for this is, like I said, you don't sit down with Mario Odyssey and think

700
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,323
this is going to be like Counter-Strike levels of stress.

701
00:37:38,984 --> 00:37:44,870
But going to a new world, having a new world open up to a player, like when you leave,

702
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,954
I don't know if I'm remembering correctly, but leave the desert and go to the city.

703
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:52,058
That is a source of anxiety to some degree.

704
00:37:52,078 --> 00:37:53,899
I mean, you might be totally fine with it,

705
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:55,641
but there's a big unknown.

706
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:58,163
You now are gonna have a bunch of new objectives

707
00:37:58,223 --> 00:37:58,884
thrown at you.

708
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,206
Anytime like a zone opens up in a world,

709
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:03,848
it's a mixture of excitement and anxiety for the player.

710
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:08,971
And so going back to levels and places in a world

711
00:38:09,011 --> 00:38:10,632
that you are very, very familiar with

712
00:38:11,152 --> 00:38:12,994
and doing it kind of on your own terms

713
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:15,535
and knowing that you don't have to maybe finish

714
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:17,716
the whole level, you just have to get the moon

715
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:18,837
that was halfway through it,

716
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,579
and it is overall contributing to your progress

717
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:26,041
and your ability to go to newer places in the world later,

718
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:27,182
that's huge.

719
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,063
Because if it were just about forward momentum,

720
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:33,265
you are gonna have players that get stuck eventually.

721
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:38,862
Next, MMO, Daily Quests, love them or hate them.

722
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:42,743
They're a great way of getting people just to sit down

723
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:44,144
and actually log into the game

724
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:46,824
and immediately have something meaningful that they can do

725
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:49,065
because at any given time,

726
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:51,506
most people don't have a lot of friends online

727
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:54,426
that they can play the same game with.

728
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:57,627
A lot of times, playing games with your friends is...

729
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:01,981
different people are playing different games or we're in the same game, much like I was

730
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:04,783
talking about with Destiny, we're just doing different things and chatting.

731
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:11,007
So dailies give you that entry into a giant, complicated world with a lot of moving parts,

732
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:15,990
but it gives you a focused daily thing that you can sit down and grind out and you get

733
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,731
rewards for it.

734
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,403
In the case of Spider-Man, I like this one because its version of home, which is swinging

735
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:28,546
around the city looking for things to do and perhaps encountering things happening randomly

736
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:32,148
in front of you, is also the best feeling thing in the game.

737
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:35,770
You might like its combat or its story or whatever, but you're wrong.

738
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:40,433
Swinging through the city is the best part of any Spider-Man game ever.

739
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:50,047
And it's great that in this game, that is how you get around and find new things and engage with higher tiers of play commitment.

740
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:55,996
But swinging feels good all the time, and that's huge for Spider-Man.

741
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:58,177
Spider-Man's having a great year.

742
00:39:58,197 --> 00:39:59,397
It's just, it's huge.

743
00:40:00,837 --> 00:40:03,538
Next, Minecraft and games like it

744
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:05,778
basically are just pure home,

745
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,439
gathering for projects and building them.

746
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,139
Everything that you can collect contributes

747
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:12,879
to grander visions and projects.

748
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:16,780
So in Minecraft, you might be looking for diamonds,

749
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,180
but if you're collecting other resources,

750
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,781
eventually you might use them.

751
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:21,641
That's huge.

752
00:40:21,741 --> 00:40:23,381
It always feels like wandering

753
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:25,461
equals some form of forward momentum.

754
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:31,153
So, again, you might not be making Minecraft, you might not be making a game like Minecraft,

755
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:36,105
but think about how Minecraft achieved that and maybe you could do something like that.

756
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:42,320
Breath of the Wild is just almost another pure home experience

757
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,203
other than when you're doing dungeons and kind of the higher level challenges in the game.

758
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:50,306
But Wandering Over the Next Horizon, it's always offering you something.

759
00:40:51,546 --> 00:40:56,390
And unlike a game like Skyrim, which allows you to wander over the next horizon

760
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:00,312
and encounter whatever, Shrines in Zelda are great

761
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:04,475
because I personally, I'm not usually wild about doing them,

762
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:06,396
but they are something in the environment.

763
00:41:06,877 --> 00:41:10,763
that I can either bookmark or do right away,

764
00:41:10,983 --> 00:41:15,570
and it's going to give me overall further progress for my character.

765
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:16,973
That's very material, whereas...

766
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,172
When I wander into a cave in Skyrim, for example,

767
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:22,913
there might be loot, there might be spiders,

768
00:41:22,953 --> 00:41:24,494
there might be bears and spiders.

769
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:26,035
I don't know what I'm getting.

770
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:28,656
And that on its own is powerful,

771
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:32,419
but being able to spot things in the world

772
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,859
and go that is going to contribute

773
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:36,041
to my overall progression just by the virtue

774
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,302
of my doing it and engaging with it, that's great.

775
00:41:39,022 --> 00:41:40,723
Agility orbs and crackdown are another one.

776
00:41:42,224 --> 00:41:45,005
Slime rancher, also tending to your ranch, wandering.

777
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:48,390
You know, home is kind of my thing,

778
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,192
so I wanted this game to have this from the very beginning.

779
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:53,894
I always kind of think of the games I make

780
00:41:53,934 --> 00:41:55,415
as like little gardens of play

781
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:57,097
and not a series of challenges.

782
00:41:57,597 --> 00:41:59,879
And so this comes very naturally to the experiences

783
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:01,160
that I want to create.

784
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,181
The next game I make, I guarantee you

785
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,223
there will be some version of home within it.

786
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:07,925
But finally.

787
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:10,850
sort of playing devil's advocate again a little bit.

788
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,631
It's also sort of a design talk,

789
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:15,692
so you had to say Dark Souls at some point

790
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:17,433
or the lightning bolt would hit me and I'd die.

791
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:20,794
So Dark Souls doesn't really have home,

792
00:42:21,194 --> 00:42:23,335
but I wanted to bring this up because,

793
00:42:24,216 --> 00:42:26,957
you know, you might not have an opportunity

794
00:42:26,997 --> 00:42:29,378
to introduce home in the way that I've defined it

795
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:30,458
in your game, but.

796
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,740
Dark Souls does have a kind of version of home.

797
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,143
It's kind of like a campground that you visit on your journey that you leave behind.

798
00:42:38,564 --> 00:42:42,606
And that is, you know, Dark Souls can be very challenging and punitive.

799
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,850
When you collect a bunch of souls, you die, you lose all those souls.

800
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,070
So...

801
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:53,373
You know, that first level of anxiety is I have a bunch of souls and I just lost them.

802
00:42:53,893 --> 00:42:58,314
Now we bring that anxiety up to another level, which is all of those souls that you have are

803
00:42:58,434 --> 00:43:04,417
sitting over there by that giant dragon. You have one shot to get it. So now the anxiety has peaked

804
00:43:04,857 --> 00:43:06,017
for the player at this point.

805
00:43:06,337 --> 00:43:08,198
We are nowhere near home at this point.

806
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:10,179
Home is a distant memory and it's burning

807
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:11,259
and you can smell the smoke.

808
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,261
But if you die then, if it's catastrophic failure,

809
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:17,281
what do you get?

810
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:19,422
You've basically cashed out.

811
00:43:19,922 --> 00:43:22,483
Now you have zero souls and you're back at the hub.

812
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:26,384
And that's a huge freeing moment for the player

813
00:43:26,824 --> 00:43:29,145
because now I can go anywhere I want.

814
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:35,110
and do anything, and unlike before, there are zero consequences to my actions.

815
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:41,855
So I can decide to try that boss again and know I can maybe experiment with a new tactic this time.

816
00:43:42,335 --> 00:43:47,879
I can go and find loot hidden away in dangerous places that I permanently get to keep.

817
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,963
Or I could just explore and do whatever. I could try something wild.

818
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:56,884
and then eventually I'm going to accrue a bunch of souls and I'm back to that anxious moment again.

819
00:43:57,305 --> 00:44:02,006
But it's key that Dark Souls routinely, because that dragon's going to keep killing you,

820
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:04,527
is offering you this moment of reprieve.

821
00:44:04,987 --> 00:44:10,889
And it doesn't matter if you're making a really challenging or obtuse experience or something.

822
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:16,291
If you can find ways where you basically release that steam valve every once in a while for the player,

823
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,092
it's going to be hugely beneficial for your experience.

824
00:44:21,124 --> 00:44:23,506
So let's get into why players respond to home.

825
00:44:23,686 --> 00:44:25,368
I think I've already kind of touched on this a little bit,

826
00:44:25,508 --> 00:44:27,449
but games are recreational

827
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,371
and home basically allows you to relax.

828
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:32,234
We're accustomed to visiting platforms

829
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,056
and exploring for content like Steam, Netflix, and Twitter.

830
00:44:35,236 --> 00:44:36,557
You might call this a bit of a stretch.

831
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:39,460
I kind of agree, but I think there's some truth to it.

832
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,663
A lot of our experiences these days are visiting platforms.

833
00:44:44,024 --> 00:44:47,006
that offer a wealth of content that we dig a little bit

834
00:44:47,246 --> 00:44:50,449
and we go further and further, further tiers of engagement

835
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:51,570
with these platforms.

836
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,532
So you might be deciding, am I going to play games,

837
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,034
or watch a movie, or watch sports tonight?

838
00:44:57,374 --> 00:44:58,175
You choose movies.

839
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,278
So now you choose between your service providers for those.

840
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:02,699
You choose Netflix.

841
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:03,880
Now you're browsing.

842
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:07,141
through the content that you could consume.

843
00:45:07,482 --> 00:45:08,782
You decide to act on one.

844
00:45:09,102 --> 00:45:09,863
Maybe you watch it.

845
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:11,463
Maybe you go for the next episode.

846
00:45:11,723 --> 00:45:14,745
You have continued to engage further and further and further.

847
00:45:15,185 --> 00:45:19,987
So one, why not let your game be just as easy to engage with

848
00:45:20,347 --> 00:45:22,448
and why not let the game itself

849
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:24,629
offer that experience to someone?

850
00:45:25,029 --> 00:45:26,750
Because it is really easy for me.

851
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:32,736
If the dragon crushes me, and then I lose a level if I've had zero souls and dark souls,

852
00:45:32,776 --> 00:45:37,340
for me to shut it off, pull out my phone, or watch Netflix because I'm done with this shit

853
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:45,729
for the night, I'm tired of failing. So offer home, and I firmly believe that it'll allow players to

854
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,134
engage with your game more easily, make that decision to sit down with it.

855
00:45:51,195 --> 00:45:53,097
There's always some amount of anxiety around PVP,

856
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:55,720
team play, spending currencies, ranked play,

857
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,102
I think I've already covered this.

858
00:45:57,662 --> 00:45:59,725
So home gives you a starting point

859
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:02,508
and a go-to during play sessions.

860
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:04,691
So home is what gets people in the door,

861
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:07,454
but it's also that comfy couch that you can return to

862
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:10,958
in between higher tiers of commitment within the game.

863
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,111
But why is Home good for your business?

864
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,212
So selling a copy of your game just isn't enough.

865
00:46:18,673 --> 00:46:20,413
Having people play your game,

866
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:22,334
and play your game repeatedly,

867
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:24,195
as I've covered earlier, is key.

868
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:25,335
Home does this.

869
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:29,217
So players playing your game over time will increase sales.

870
00:46:29,657 --> 00:46:30,977
Home gets players into your game.

871
00:46:31,398 --> 00:46:33,518
And Home increases overall playtime

872
00:46:33,598 --> 00:46:34,899
because of lack of friction.

873
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,321
Now you might be saying, just wait a dang minute.

874
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:47,875
Isn't some of the stuff in this talk the kind of strategy that is used by games as a service?

875
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,031
And I would say yes, and that's okay.

876
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:56,832
Copying business practices that work is okay.

877
00:46:57,292 --> 00:47:00,793
Even if you're not really in that business, it's okay.

878
00:47:01,254 --> 00:47:02,414
Steal the good stuff.

879
00:47:03,374 --> 00:47:05,855
I could learn something about selling my game

880
00:47:06,075 --> 00:47:07,996
from that successful burger stand

881
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:09,276
that I talked about earlier.

882
00:47:09,756 --> 00:47:10,396
Copy it.

883
00:47:10,797 --> 00:47:11,297
Why not?

884
00:47:11,577 --> 00:47:13,677
Why not just try and fit in the mold

885
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,918
of what everyone else is doing?

886
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:17,179
If you do that, you're another game now.

887
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:21,647
To kind of bring it all together with Slime Rancher,

888
00:47:22,308 --> 00:47:24,009
it was a single-player offline indie game.

889
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:25,890
It was released over three years ago.

890
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,831
The original dev team was three people.

891
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:29,852
Very, very humble beginnings.

892
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:33,654
And it is also not a typical games-as-service genre,

893
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:34,935
not by any stretch.

894
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:37,136
Single-player offline indie game

895
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:38,997
about ranching slimes and farming.

896
00:47:39,277 --> 00:47:40,358
It's far away from that.

897
00:47:40,998 --> 00:47:46,881
But that didn't stop us from releasing 18 significant content updates so far, with another

898
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:47,521
one on the way.

899
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:54,105
It has weekly and holiday activities and community contests, and those activities are just generated

900
00:47:54,145 --> 00:47:54,685
within the game.

901
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:57,087
We took a page from Animal Crossing, basically.

902
00:47:57,487 --> 00:48:01,529
Animal Crossing is not, at least the older ones, weren't an internet-connected game,

903
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:03,450
and yet it had daily stuff.

904
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,311
It felt alive.

905
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:05,471
We just copied that.

906
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:10,374
It's still being ported to new platforms, we make a big deal out of it every time we

907
00:48:10,414 --> 00:48:10,834
do that.

908
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:15,896
It has maintained strong revenue since its release in December 2018, which was our best

909
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:21,198
month ever for what was then almost a three-year-old game.

910
00:48:22,287 --> 00:48:24,849
And I basically want to say that I'm practicing what I preach here.

911
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:30,214
It sells itself in a gif, it has maintained relevancy by nurturing the game since its

912
00:48:30,254 --> 00:48:33,417
release, and it has copious amounts of home in it.

913
00:48:34,118 --> 00:48:38,121
That is usually one of the number one things, they're not using home, but the number one

914
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:40,183
things that our reviewers point out.

915
00:48:40,743 --> 00:48:44,044
is that they can relax when they play it, it feels cozy.

916
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,665
And again, you do not have to have a bright, warm,

917
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:48,245
and fuzzy game for this to work.

918
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:50,905
You just have to elicit those feelings.

919
00:48:51,246 --> 00:48:53,846
Again, what do you want your players to feel?

920
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:54,586
Do it.

921
00:48:55,906 --> 00:49:00,807
But it also does other things not covered in this talk.

922
00:49:02,468 --> 00:49:04,728
And it also doesn't do lots of things

923
00:49:04,768 --> 00:49:07,949
that make other games successful, maybe including yours.

924
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:09,569
And so remember,

925
00:49:11,104 --> 00:49:13,625
that the stuff in this talk will help your game succeed,

926
00:49:14,026 --> 00:49:16,327
but it is not the only path to success.

927
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:20,169
So I say, instead, take the stuff from this talk

928
00:49:20,529 --> 00:49:23,011
and everyone else's talks that makes sense to you

929
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:26,212
and your game and make your own path to success.

930
00:49:27,373 --> 00:49:28,073
And good luck with that.

931
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:48,846
So he's back. Thank you very much. I want to thank Ray and Kara who helped me put this talk together, and everyone at Monami Park.

932
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:51,848
I believe there is some time I can take some questions.

933
00:50:00,152 --> 00:50:04,734
I really love the talk, so it's a good follow-up to what you did last year, too, a couple years ago.

934
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,723
Kind of reflecting, you said that December was your best month revenue-wise,

935
00:50:10,503 --> 00:50:13,526
what would you tell yourself beginning Slime Rancher?

936
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:18,169
I know that you probably tell yourself a lot, but what's maybe a couple of key lessons

937
00:50:18,469 --> 00:50:22,873
having gone through that whole process now, especially from this perspective?

938
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:27,176
So the question is, what would I tell myself three years ago

939
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:33,901
from when we were in December of last year and at the peak revenue?

940
00:50:35,263 --> 00:50:39,464
Yeah, so we had set out to sell 100,000 copies of the game.

941
00:50:39,524 --> 00:50:40,584
That was our goal.

942
00:50:40,965 --> 00:50:44,226
And I think this is important, that obviously we

943
00:50:44,426 --> 00:50:45,446
sold way more than that.

944
00:50:45,946 --> 00:50:50,867
But we weren't thinking in terms of let's just

945
00:50:50,927 --> 00:50:51,808
see what will happen.

946
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:54,208
We tried to make a game that we thought we could

947
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:56,169
sell 100,000 copies of.

948
00:50:56,909 --> 00:51:02,251
And we had a plan for what we would do if that happened.

949
00:51:03,372 --> 00:51:08,435
And I think that is very relevant to what I was talking about with concurrency.

950
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:11,337
We weren't aiming for let's see what happens.

951
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:16,661
We wanted that 100,000 because we knew that was the momentum necessary to maybe get us more.

952
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:19,483
And it turns out that was very much the case.

953
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:22,265
But, you know, I think...

954
00:51:24,227 --> 00:51:26,729
Yeah, I don't know if I totally answered your question there.

955
00:51:27,149 --> 00:51:29,190
Obviously, I would be very excited.

956
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:32,253
But I think I might be slightly discouraged

957
00:51:32,273 --> 00:51:35,915
at how much hard work was necessary to get to that moment.

958
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:38,237
Working at the long-term support, nurturing the game,

959
00:51:38,497 --> 00:51:40,179
it's a very, very difficult thing to do.

960
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:41,640
And we just had to stick at it.

961
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,181
You can't get bored and want to make your next game.

962
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:45,963
You just have to keep selling.

963
00:51:45,983 --> 00:51:48,445
So, next one.

964
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:53,526
So a question about how to make an effective GIF for telling your game.

965
00:51:54,007 --> 00:51:58,073
If your game is based around mechanics which are not represented visually very well,

966
00:51:58,253 --> 00:51:59,815
like a sound game or an audio game,

967
00:52:00,296 --> 00:52:02,559
or something that involves creation of intangible things,

968
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,223
can you think of a way to kind of work that into a GIF?

969
00:52:06,162 --> 00:52:09,164
Well, GIF is a visual medium with no audio.

970
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:12,947
So as I said in the beginning in the disclaimer,

971
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:14,528
this just might not be for you.

972
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:19,432
But certainly, that's a very unorthodox experience.

973
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:22,474
So immediately, that's a firewall

974
00:52:22,854 --> 00:52:24,675
that you have to be able to somehow get

975
00:52:24,715 --> 00:52:25,656
people to walk through.

976
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,697
And so it's really on you to think.

977
00:52:28,298 --> 00:52:31,539
what is the shortest path through that.

978
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:34,320
And yeah, I think a lot of this,

979
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,701
because in relation to a GIF, it's visual.

980
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,582
There isn't a whole lot that we can do with just pure audio.

981
00:52:41,282 --> 00:52:44,323
Perhaps there's, you know, Twitter, like I said,

982
00:52:44,363 --> 00:52:46,724
is very good for delivering that visual information

983
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:47,304
very quickly.

984
00:52:47,784 --> 00:52:50,165
Find a platform that delivers audio information

985
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:52,806
very quickly, but you're definitely up against it

986
00:52:52,906 --> 00:52:55,787
because even movies on Twitter and that will have

987
00:52:56,988 --> 00:53:00,773
subtitles on it because they know people just aren't listening to audio.

988
00:53:01,013 --> 00:53:02,976
So you have your challenges ahead of you, I'm sorry.

989
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:03,276
Okay.

990
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:03,376
Yes.

991
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:10,997
Sorry.

992
00:53:11,077 --> 00:53:11,977
Fantastic talk.

993
00:53:12,158 --> 00:53:12,358
Thank you.

994
00:53:12,378 --> 00:53:13,859
I'm going to force my whole team to watch it.

995
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:15,620
It's exactly what we need right now.

996
00:53:17,521 --> 00:53:19,483
Specifically about the GIFs, I was

997
00:53:19,503 --> 00:53:20,764
wondering if you could talk a little more

998
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:22,064
about the creation of them.

999
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:24,186
Literally, what tools you're using?

1000
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:26,828
Are you recording actual gameplay?

1001
00:53:26,888 --> 00:53:29,990
And then how long it takes you to edit it and put it together?

1002
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:32,312
And just the production of the GIF,

1003
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:35,894
what's the effort and tooling you're using to do it?

1004
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:39,349
So the question is, best practices for making GIFs,

1005
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:39,969
how you do it.

1006
00:53:40,409 --> 00:53:42,630
Fortunately, I have someone who does that.

1007
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:48,031
Early on, what we did was we added a feature in Slime

1008
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:48,291
Rancher.

1009
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:50,012
A lot of people don't know that this exists.

1010
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:54,453
But on PC, hitting G generates a GIF of the last, I think

1011
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:55,993
it's five seconds of gameplay.

1012
00:53:57,113 --> 00:54:00,714
There are third-party solutions to that as well.

1013
00:54:01,434 --> 00:54:05,895
I think it took Mike, the other co-founder of Monami Park,

1014
00:54:05,955 --> 00:54:06,135
Mike.

1015
00:54:06,796 --> 00:54:08,036
probably half a day to put it in.

1016
00:54:08,837 --> 00:54:12,558
It has generated a ton of community GIFs, which are great,

1017
00:54:13,399 --> 00:54:15,380
but also it allowed us to very quickly

1018
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,160
create those moments early on

1019
00:54:17,201 --> 00:54:21,863
when it was just two or three of us that worked online.

1020
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,524
They were probably totally unoptimized

1021
00:54:23,644 --> 00:54:25,905
and Kara, our communications manager at Monami Park

1022
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:28,406
would probably never put those things online,

1023
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,727
but when you're small and lean, scrappy,

1024
00:54:30,827 --> 00:54:31,747
that was a great solution.

1025
00:54:33,168 --> 00:54:35,529
She could probably do a talk on best practices

1026
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:37,430
in terms of recording footage and that,

1027
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:40,031
but there are a number of people who are really,

1028
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,952
really good at making GIFs,

1029
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,013
and they will share those processes with you.

1030
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:48,995
I don't know if you've, I totally forget the name,

1031
00:54:49,015 --> 00:54:50,415
but there is someone who makes like amazing

1032
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:52,996
Devil May Cry GIFs, and they're not Capcom.

1033
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,157
Definitely check that out,

1034
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:58,018
because they're gorgeous and perfectly formatted.

1035
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:00,600
So, but early on, I totally recommend.

1036
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,485
put a make gift button in your game, it will save you a ton of agony later.

1037
00:55:05,186 --> 00:55:05,866
Thank you so much.

1038
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:07,649
Thank you.

1039
00:55:08,128 --> 00:55:17,313
Hi. So you touched on a little bit with the first question saying how you went into this saying you wanted to sell a certain amount of games.

1040
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:23,036
You also touched on earlier on about games as a service and how Sly Mantra is, as you say, a game as a service.

1041
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:28,479
Did you go into that, even early on, like the first year where you were developing, to make it a game as a service?

1042
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:31,661
Or did you go in thinking it was going to be a one-shot and then you wanted to move on to the next project?

1043
00:55:32,536 --> 00:55:36,057
Okay, so the question was, did we walk into it thinking we were going to use the games

1044
00:55:36,117 --> 00:55:36,957
as a service model?

1045
00:55:37,197 --> 00:55:40,338
I actually covered this in a talk from a couple years ago, but in brief.

1046
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:45,880
We knew we were going to Early Access, and we also didn't want to do the Early Access

1047
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,801
version where it's like, here's a bunch of bug fixes, see you in six months, and maybe

1048
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:52,482
we'll have some content, because I think people get very angry about that.

1049
00:55:53,443 --> 00:55:58,667
So, as soon as there was a response to it, we got our stuff together and leveraged, I

1050
00:55:59,787 --> 00:56:03,350
used to make MMOs, and so did Mike, the other co-founder of Monami Park.

1051
00:56:03,831 --> 00:56:07,714
We immediately leveraged basically our MMO experience.

1052
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:12,677
Games as a Service was definitely taking off at that point, it was just a natural fit.

1053
00:56:13,338 --> 00:56:19,863
I got an amazing education at Three Rings as to how to make and run an online game,

1054
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,044
so I had that experience.

1055
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:27,990
So, definitely seek out things like that, learn, like I was saying, steal other people's

1056
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,111
business practices.

1057
00:56:29,371 --> 00:56:34,877
There is things that WoW does that is applicable to your, perhaps, very, very small game.

1058
00:56:36,338 --> 00:56:40,943
And so, yeah, we immediately conformed our early access experience to be more games as

1059
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:41,403
a service.

1060
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:42,284
We...

1061
00:56:44,766 --> 00:56:50,468
had our patches that were completing early access as content updates and we made trailers for them and gave them key art

1062
00:56:50,848 --> 00:56:54,869
and we got people very excited about just normal early access updates.

1063
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,150
But there was always a hero element to every patch.

1064
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:02,111
So we would never, like I said, just do, here's some bug fixes and we

1065
00:57:02,811 --> 00:57:04,032
change the bridge model

1066
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:07,713
and the backpack now in Slime Rancher looks a little bit different.

1067
00:57:08,113 --> 00:57:10,755
we had something that we can put on a piece of key art

1068
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:13,217
that was exciting, ideally a character,

1069
00:57:13,237 --> 00:57:16,219
to get people excited about this content update.

1070
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:19,222
And then really, it just sort of worked that way.

1071
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:24,105
Because early access is launching your game, period.

1072
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:26,307
I've said that before and stand by that.

1073
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:27,488
So, thank you.

1074
00:57:27,788 --> 00:57:28,309
Thank you so much.

1075
00:57:31,225 --> 00:57:31,546
Hey, Nick.

1076
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:32,006
Hi.

1077
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:33,007
Thanks for the talk.

1078
00:57:33,067 --> 00:57:36,911
So on the topic of home, do you always

1079
00:57:37,232 --> 00:57:38,993
design for your personal sense of home,

1080
00:57:39,254 --> 00:57:42,157
or do you ever try to create a generic sense of home?

1081
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:46,041
And if so, how do you go about finding that generic, broad

1082
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:46,981
sense of home?

1083
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:50,967
So the question is, do I design for my own personal taste

1084
00:57:50,987 --> 00:57:52,767
of home or a broad one?

1085
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:55,808
I think it's a bit of both, which is probably not

1086
00:57:55,828 --> 00:57:56,629
what you were looking to hear.

1087
00:57:57,549 --> 00:58:00,650
But you can't avoid putting your own personal taste

1088
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,731
and preferences into experiences.

1089
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:07,673
But in terms of the generic sense of it,

1090
00:58:08,533 --> 00:58:10,434
I think there's some very easy things to do,

1091
00:58:10,474 --> 00:58:13,615
which is just basically sticking to the definition

1092
00:58:14,495 --> 00:58:15,195
that I put out there.

1093
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:22,539
features that aren't punitive, relaxed play,

1094
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:25,460
getting someone to stay for as long as they want to.

1095
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,001
That is something that I really value,

1096
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:29,322
is I really hate it in games

1097
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:30,963
where it tells me mission complete.

1098
00:58:31,183 --> 00:58:33,564
I know this is definitely a personal preference,

1099
00:58:33,604 --> 00:58:35,605
but I don't want anyone telling me

1100
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:37,266
when the experience is over.

1101
00:58:37,286 --> 00:58:37,746
I want to like...

1102
00:58:38,226 --> 00:58:41,111
Like, can destiny go up to orbit when I feel like it?

1103
00:58:41,872 --> 00:58:44,276
So for me, that's a huge part of my personal taste,

1104
00:58:44,356 --> 00:58:47,981
is just, it's freedom, it's not taking control away

1105
00:58:48,001 --> 00:58:50,385
from the player, I like that, that's my jam.

1106
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:54,880
First of all, I'm going to thank you for the talk.

1107
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:59,083
And I have a question regarding the topic of nurturing the game.

1108
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:06,188
So I want to ask, what do you think is the optimal frequency of pushing out significant updates?

1109
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:10,431
Because there's a risk that players do not like the new updates,

1110
00:59:10,511 --> 00:59:14,854
and there's a risk that the player has not fully digested the previous updates.

1111
00:59:14,874 --> 00:59:18,817
So what do you think is the optimal frequency to push this significant feature?

1112
00:59:19,898 --> 00:59:25,224
So the question is what is the appropriate cadence of content updates when you're nurturing your game?

1113
00:59:25,244 --> 00:59:28,808
So you've committed to long-term support. You're gonna release content updates over time

1114
00:59:29,629 --> 00:59:30,931
Again, I think that varies by game

1115
00:59:32,313 --> 00:59:37,859
One of the ways that you can figure that out is you look at your tail. So you release your game

1116
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,342
even if you release it in early access,

1117
00:59:40,762 --> 00:59:43,524
you're gonna get the bump, and it's great to be up here.

1118
00:59:43,544 --> 00:59:46,206
And then eventually it goes down,

1119
00:59:46,706 --> 00:59:49,348
and if all you've decided to do is release your game

1120
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:51,410
and walk away from it, now you're here.

1121
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:54,352
You've exited the peak and you're in the valley

1122
00:59:54,452 --> 00:59:56,554
probably forever until you put your game on sale,

1123
00:59:56,934 --> 00:59:58,295
and then just like a roller coaster,

1124
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:01,218
that bump is never gonna be as big as that first one.

1125
01:00:01,918 --> 01:00:03,559
That's actually how roller coasters work,

1126
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:05,201
which is super cool, and I didn't know that

1127
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:06,782
until relatively recently.

1128
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:13,365
Anyway, so look at that and release your content update, see what it does to the bump.

1129
01:00:14,065 --> 01:00:19,768
And then you have to determine for yourself how deep and how wide do you want that valley

1130
01:00:19,808 --> 01:00:20,128
to be.

1131
01:00:20,548 --> 01:00:24,610
But if you've done an effective update, you can get a data point where you say, you know

1132
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:24,830
what?

1133
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:30,932
we must have filled that valley full of dirt in the last update because the valley is now

1134
01:00:31,072 --> 01:00:35,834
higher than the valley used to be and that's the critical bit of information. If what you did

1135
01:00:36,254 --> 01:00:40,936
makes your bottoming out higher than your previous bottoming out and looks like it's

1136
01:00:40,956 --> 01:00:47,558
going to stay that way, you have done something effective to build value into that game. If what

1137
01:00:47,578 --> 01:00:52,440
you get is an exact replica of what you had before, maybe that's fine because the peak

1138
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,442
equals the effort at least that you put into it.

1139
01:00:55,762 --> 01:00:58,643
And the reason breaking even there is a victory

1140
01:00:59,644 --> 01:01:01,745
is because you've built now value into that game

1141
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:02,926
for the new customer.

1142
01:01:02,946 --> 01:01:04,887
When we're working on Slime Rancher,

1143
01:01:04,987 --> 01:01:07,348
we think about what are our current players gonna want

1144
01:01:07,468 --> 01:01:09,309
and what's gonna get them to keep playing the game.

1145
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:13,251
but we're constantly thinking about the newest customer.

1146
01:01:13,751 --> 01:01:15,452
And so sometimes we add a feature

1147
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:19,353
where we realize our existing players

1148
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:20,614
chew through it very quickly,

1149
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:24,015
and it's because they only focused on doing that one thing,

1150
01:01:24,035 --> 01:01:25,076
and that's unfortunate.

1151
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:28,277
But then other times, with that same example,

1152
01:01:28,637 --> 01:01:31,939
they are able to, a new player is able to experience that

1153
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:33,239
and other things whenever they want.

1154
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,761
So, yeah.

1155
01:01:37,081 --> 01:01:39,482
Okay, I'll just take one last question, is that okay?

1156
01:01:39,716 --> 01:01:39,876
Yeah.

1157
01:01:43,102 --> 01:01:43,523
Oh, OK.

1158
01:01:43,563 --> 01:01:43,903
I'm sorry.

1159
01:01:44,404 --> 01:01:45,766
I think we're wrapping up.

1160
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:47,289
I'll take your question after.

1161
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:51,316
So I'll hang outside if anyone else has any other questions.

1162
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:51,757
Thanks again.
