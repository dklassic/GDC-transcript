1
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:20,167
Thank you everyone for coming today This is why care about wholesome games anyway Before we get started.

2
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:26,689
I was asked to ask everyone to silence your phones I'm very clumsy so if something goes off.

3
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:30,591
I'll probably be startled and fall off the stage, so please keep that in mind and

4
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:34,807
Today we're talking about wholesome games.

5
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:42,109
It's a genre of games that's grown a lot in the past few years, but maybe isn't the most clearly defined or best understood yet.

6
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:47,250
So we're going to be trying to shine some light on both of those things today.

7
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,770
My name's James Tellman.

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,450
I've been working in games for about eight years.

9
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,851
Currently I'm working on a game where you run a sushi restaurant and you play as a cute little robot.

10
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:01,452
It's called Rolling Hills, and I'll be the moderator for today's discussion.

11
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,570
Our first panelist is Jenny Wendham.

12
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,991
She's from Portland, Oregon.

13
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:18,759
She's a producer at Soft Knot Week, a senior influencer manager at Kepler Interactive, and she's a streamer who some of you may recognize as the host of the annual Wholesome Direct Showcase.

14
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:31,148
Next up, we have the very beautiful and very talented Matthew Taylor.

15
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:35,037
He's the founder of the Wholesome Games organization.

16
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:43,563
He started the Wholesome Direct Showcase, and currently he's the creative director at Catch & Release, working with me on Rolling Hills.

17
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:46,965
He gets it, too.

18
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:54,991
And finally, this one will need no applause cue.

19
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:58,915
This is, on the end here, is Victoria Tran.

20
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:00,996
She's the community director at InnerSloth.

21
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:03,999
She's worked on hit games like Among Us and Unpacking.

22
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:06,141
She was part of the Forbes 30 Under 30.

23
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,663
You've seen her as a co-host of Wholesome Direct.

24
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:14,408
And she's, most importantly, the only member of this panel who's ever appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

25
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:33,786
Now, one thing that I wanted to mention before we get started is you probably noticed from the introductions that all of us are involved with an organization called Wholesome Games.

26
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:37,967
And today we're talking about a genre called Wholesome Games.

27
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:42,549
We're not here to promote Wholesome Games or Wholesome Direct or anything like that.

28
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:50,031
We just have had the benefit of front row seats to this genre because of our work with Wholesome Direct.

29
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:56,293
and we want to share some of the data we've gleaned from that and let you draw your own conclusions about it.

30
00:02:57,453 --> 00:03:10,537
So with that in mind, any time today that I'm talking about Wholesome Games, the organization, the capital W Wholesome Games, I will do my best to call that out and draw attention to that distinction.

31
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:13,778
Otherwise, you can assume we're talking about the genre.

32
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:20,055
Finally, I'm going to slip into the shadows very soon so we can keep the spotlight on our panelists.

33
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:22,157
Sorry if I hit you today, Jenny.

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,502
But I just wanted to mention my role as moderator, I feel, is to be your voice on this stage.

35
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,125
Not everyone here is an expert on Wholesome Games already.

36
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:40,568
I've been involved with the organization for a while now, so I like to think that I am.

37
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:53,276
But I'm going to try to forget everything I know about that and approach this as someone who maybe came here because they just saw it on the schedule and thought it was interesting or has heard about Wholesome Games in a tweet or something like that.

38
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:59,200
And with that in mind, I think the best place to begin is, what are Wholesome Games?

39
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,022
That's a lovely and big question to kick it off with.

40
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:11,585
I think there are three words and concepts I usually go back to every time I refer to wholesome games.

41
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:23,251
They're titles that often offer compassion, comfort, and coziness to player through elements like the narrative, the gameplay mechanics, art and sound, and so on.

42
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:28,674
And what's really interesting to me personally is while some of these can be really

43
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,422
more clearly defined and articulated.

44
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:41,211
A lot of what's cool about wholesome games to me is the amount of subjectivity that it provides because these same things aren't cozy for everybody.

45
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:48,718
And I did want to say there's a sort of a synonym that we're using between cozy and wholesome.

46
00:04:49,710 --> 00:05:07,359
I think if you really want to nerd out with me, I will go into why I think there are differences between the concepts of coziness and the concept of wholesomeness, partially because I think wholesome games can address sometimes uncozy topics in a really gentle and compassionate manner, but we can talk about that later.

47
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,802
But we'll use it pretty synonymously, I feel like, for this panel.

48
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:20,860
Matthew, a lot of the discussion of wholesome games comes from or traces back to a Twitter account that you started.

49
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:27,965
Could you give us any, well here are a few of the games that you've curated on that Twitter account.

50
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:33,310
Could you give us a little insight into why you choose games like these?

51
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,952
First of all, pardon the earthquake happening next door.

52
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,499
Well, they're great games.

53
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,063
I mean, first and foremost, there's not a game up here I wouldn't recommend just as a game.

54
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:47,767
The mechanics are all very different, but I think they're united by a feeling, right?

55
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,729
They allow players to do good and feel good.

56
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,193
And being united by a feeling is really the core of what Wholesome Games has always been about.

57
00:05:56,253 --> 00:06:00,036
It's like a genre that's not about a particular mechanic, but it's about a feeling.

58
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:02,678
So I think all these games are united by a feeling.

59
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:04,880
And if you play them, I think you'll feel that.

60
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:11,801
How do you think your curation has impacted how other people think about wholesome games?

61
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:31,540
If you look at the Wholesome Games Twitter or watch Wholesome Direct or something like that, you're going to have like a vocabulary instantly, I think, to talk about this kind of stuff.

62
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,322
So I hope at the very least it's giving people a baseline.

63
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,603
Jenny mentioned Cozy Games as a term.

64
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:43,846
Did you consider any other names when you were creating that Twitter account that started it?

65
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:46,828
Is Cozy Games something that entered your mind?

66
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:48,375
It didn't at the time.

67
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:56,659
I know a lot of people are using that term really well and really descriptively now, but I feel like at the time I just thought wholesome was a little more inclusive.

68
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,820
Like I feel like cozy is one type of feeling that I'm describing.

69
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,002
And I think wholesome can contain a lot more than that.

70
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,602
Like I know it's not a perfect term.

71
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:13,486
I know, um, there are a lot of people who have feelings about it, but I feel like it's really simple and evocative, which is what you need when you're creating something like this.

72
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:23,488
Victoria, you've been a professional in the games industry for a while now, and you're the newest member of Wholesome Games, the organization.

73
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:27,912
So I just wanted to ask you, what was your first impression of Wholesome Games?

74
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:30,394
Like, when you encountered this term, what went through your mind?

75
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:44,989
Yeah, I thought it was really cool and I'm not going to lie, one of the first things I saw was the absolute discourse behind Wholesome Games, so that was really interesting.

76
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:47,512
What do you mean by the discourse?

77
00:07:48,604 --> 00:08:06,277
Yeah, I think, and I totally get it, and for a lot of reasons, I think I've seen that there have been a lot of critique of the word wholesome and kind of its use to maybe skirt around accountability and or deeper subjects kind of embedded within the game space.

78
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:16,464
So is toxic positivity a concern when dealing with something like a term like wholesome?

79
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,021
Yeah, I really think so.

80
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:31,412
I think terms like wholesome have to be treated with a lot of respect as a creator and honestly as a marketer because it does risk losing a lot of like trust and goodwill with the kind of genre that comes with it.

81
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:38,738
So especially with the audience, right, like they're usually expecting some sort of manner and some sort of values, I think, behind it.

82
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:46,444
And I think kind of similar to how you can see an oil company that uses like, you know, like, oh, it's green and here's a leaf.

83
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:47,384
and

84
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:03,993
talk

85
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:45,758
something offensive and really seeks to use the wholesome branding to I think skirt criticism and exploit an audience and I think it is really difficult though because as we've all talked about like we're not here to really define what wholesome is and wholesome is a more subjecting and like feelings-based term rather than something like racing or FPS where it has to be a very certain thing before you are like okay like yeah that's definitely a racing game

86
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:54,003
So yeah, I think that's just something that we need to keep in mind when we talk about Wholesome, and kind of where I think a lot of critique comes from.

87
00:09:54,323 --> 00:10:10,874
Yeah, that question of what makes a game wholesome comes up again and again, and there are themes that emerge, and like I said, if you engage with the Wholesome Direct and stuff like that, you'll probably see some things, but I just think it devalues the conversation to think that there's going to be this algorithmic answer to what is a wholesome game.

88
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:13,956
I just don't think that's coming, and even if it were, I don't know that I'm interested in it.

89
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:14,256
it's

90
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:32,687
I feel like

91
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:54,069
coming to

92
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:15,427
and

93
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:35,750
You know, as a developer, I just do what I would want, which is like really simple and honest feedback.

94
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,412
Sometimes you see a game that's great, it's not ready yet for a spotlight.

95
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:46,995
And sometimes you see something that is just awesome, but it's not a good fit for our audience or what I think our audience is.

96
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,315
of the game.

97
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:04,523
I want to seize on a word that you used, which is audience.

98
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:13,129
When we talk about the Wholesome Games community or the audience for Wholesome Games, who exactly are we talking about?

99
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,151
Is that something you can go into a little more detail for us?

100
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:17,151
Yeah.

101
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:29,780
What's really cool is seeing just, first of all, the expanse and the increase of people who are showing an interest in this type of game, whether it's players, influencers, developers, publishers.

102
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,241
It's been wonderful to see

103
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,685
We see people across platforms like Twitch, Discord, YouTube, TikTok.

104
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,508
I have a few numbers I'm just going to throw out to you all.

105
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:49,556
When looking at TikTok you can see the hashtag CozyGames has over 753.4 million views current like as of two weeks ago.

106
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:58,463
WholesomeGames hashtag has 195.1 million views and what's great is we see streamers and influencers taking on

107
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:08,685
This as the genre of choice that they are completely dedicated to featuring these types of games and fostering a community with this sort of shared sense of value.

108
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:26,950
What's also really exciting is that demographically, we've found that just looking at the types of streamers and creators and players who engage with these games represent a wider swath of demographics, typically not seen and thought of as traditional gamer.

109
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:35,237
So if you look at like the top 50 creators on Twitch or YouTube, they are predominantly white and male presenting.

110
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:42,283
But if you look at the top cozy and wholesome creators, they represent a wider variety of underrepresented groups, which is really cool.

111
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:44,163
Yeah, for sure.

112
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:56,435
And just to build off of Jenny's demographic data, I did want to caveat that I don't think the lack of participation in more violent games is not a direct product of gender or anything.

113
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:57,456
It's not like, oh, boy,

114
00:13:59,176 --> 00:13:59,797
Shooting Game

115
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:41,690
and I don't really want to like preach to the choir necessarily since I'm sure if you're listening to this you have like some sort of interest in wholesome games and all that kind of thing and you probably have some sort of open mind towards it but in general especially I think with the public and like outside of the Twitter sphere outside of like the social media bubble we can see a lot of misconceptions when it comes to what's cool or acceptable or real games that gamers play and I feel like we've had this discussion

116
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,891
numerous times

117
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:25,474
and things like the Financial Times wrote an article called why gamers are hugging animals rather than fragging enemies that talks about how wholesome games that avoid violence are rising in popularity and reaching new audiences and then gamesindustry.biz themselves wrote about how E3 2021 the 33% of games at E3 2021 and summer games fests were actually non-violent thanks to a lot of indies so good job indies yay

118
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:40,216
Now thinking about those social media numbers and the views for Wholesome Games, the discussion around Wholesome Games, I have to ask, like, the numbers can be impressive, but people don't always vote with their wallets.

119
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:46,662
Are Wholesome Games actually financially viable, or is this just a feel-good fad?

120
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:50,204
Well, I think you're going to have to define success, right?

121
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:57,307
Because everybody in this room knows Animal Crossing and Stardew, games that kind of changed the world and changed the industry in a lot of ways.

122
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:03,829
But if we define success as less than a mega hit, which I don't know how many of us are expecting that kind of success,

123
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,010
I'm ready.

124
00:16:20,757 --> 00:16:21,698
Yeah, definitely.

125
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:27,202
And there are so many that aren't, I think, just farming sims.

126
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:33,427
I think like a lot of us, when we talk about wholesome games, a lot of the times, like the first successful game we can think of is a farming sim, which is great.

127
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,028
I personally love farming sims.

128
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:46,096
But I do want to kind of highlight other games that aren't necessarily farming sims that have done really well, just to kind of give you a breadth of the genres that are successful within wholesome games.

129
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:49,739
There's beer and breakfast, obviously, a short hike, Dorfromantik.

130
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:57,144
And then, because I know we all love numbers and being read out numbers, I have a list of numbers I'm going to give you right now.

131
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:58,044
All right.

132
00:16:58,445 --> 00:16:58,885
I know.

133
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:00,186
Just prepare yourselves.

134
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,247
It's going to blow you away.

135
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:04,689
I tried to pitch that.

136
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:04,949
OK.

137
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:16,317
But first, we have Unpacking, an organizational puzzle game that sold 100K units in the first 10 days and within a year hit one million units sold worldwide.

138
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:17,678
Very exciting.

139
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:21,981
Second is Spiritfarer, a management game about dying.

140
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:28,065
This also sort of has farming in it, I suppose, but it also has a lot of other things, so I'm adding this in.

141
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:32,348
It came out in August 2020 and then they hit 1 million sales in December 2021.

142
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:39,493
Coffee Talk, a visual novel, made 550k USD in gross revenue in less than a month following its release.

143
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:42,934
We have Slime Rancher, a first-person sandbox game.

144
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:49,636
This sold over 5 million units and has spawned an incredibly successful sequel, Slime Rancher 2, which I'm obsessed with.

145
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,697
This sold over 100k copies in 24 hours in early access.

146
00:17:54,277 --> 00:18:04,601
And the last thing I will throw at you is The Wandering Village, which is a city-building sim, and this sold over 150k copies within one month in early access.

147
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:08,342
So the entire point of me listing this off is to just be like,

148
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:31,234
wow it sells amazing so there are numerous examples of commercial and critical success to be had in the game genre and still a lot of content and themes to be explored and the audience is honestly really hungry for it i am also really hungry for it i'm just saying if you want to make a really nice cooking game i'm lining up i'm right there yeah you've already got one sale it's

149
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,681
Now a lot of the games that you mentioned were featured in Wholesome Direct.

150
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:50,610
We're not here to plug that showcase, but is there anything you can tell me about the impact of these targeted showcases on Wholesome Games and their financial success?

151
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:51,993
Yeah, definitely.

152
00:18:52,093 --> 00:19:07,904
I think what's really cool is that showcases just in general provide this ability for developers and publishers to kind of get a gauge of success and sort of start seeing what reception is like for their title in specific moments in time.

153
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:15,709
And so, as Victoria said, moments like E3, Summer Game Fest, they are proving points for games to be able to get in front of those audiences.

154
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:16,870
And what's interesting is

155
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,393
a lot of the more traditional game shows have been catered towards the traditional quote, gamer.

156
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:34,281
And so what's been exciting is just through showcases like the Wholesome Direct, as well as there's a Paper Mario showcase, a Mother Direct, a, you know, PS1 horror title showcase.

157
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:40,766
There's so many that are cropping up that address specific hungers and needs and desires of audiences.

158
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:44,488
And so to answer your question, the Wholesome Direct

159
00:19:45,829 --> 00:20:03,866
is a showcase that cropped up to meet the needs of a specific audience looking for a specific type of game and for context we've gotten over 3 million views excluding co-streamers and what's really exciting is there has been a dramatic wishlist increase for participating titles so in 2021

160
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:09,749
22% of games saw at least a 10K wishlist increase.

161
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:17,532
And this was regardless of whether they had maybe a 15 second spot in like a sizzle reel or they had a larger feature.

162
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:30,137
And so it was really exciting just from just us seeing the showcase and seeing the impact is it's not necessarily the duration, but it's just finding the audience that really resonates with what you want to show them.

163
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:31,238
And that was really exciting.

164
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,830
I'm

165
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,222
They had, the mix is wonderful.

166
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:58,567
The Nintendo Indie Directs do an incredible job of showcasing wholesome titles.

167
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:03,172
Day of the Devs, which is also here, so you can check out some really great games there.

168
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:11,060
So what's neat is seeing again, it's not just us doing it, but it's all of these showcases finding the right games and the right audience for it.

169
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,531
I feel like we've answered a lot of technical questions.

170
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:16,232
We've listed a lot of numbers.

171
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:16,793
More numbers.

172
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:22,298
We've talked about who's talking about wholesome games, who's playing wholesome games.

173
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:25,621
Beyond that, why should we care?

174
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:32,447
Like, money isn't... I'm sorry for saying this at GDC, but money isn't the only thing, right?

175
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:33,688
I'm out.

176
00:21:33,748 --> 00:21:34,208
What?

177
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:35,169
Bye.

178
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:38,052
Sorry, Victoria's just finding this out for the first time.

179
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,553
I'm revoking your badge.

180
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,242
Why should we care?

181
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:59,164
I mean, what I love personally is that we talked a little bit about how it's expanded the definition of what it even means to be in this industry as a player, as a developer.

182
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:06,887
It's really exciting to see people more and more consider themselves as, I feel like it's a dirty word, but like, I play games or I'm a gamer.

183
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:11,609
It's becoming more and more acceptable for more people.

184
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:15,631
forgot to say this earlier, I did say one more number.

185
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,472
I want to say one more.

186
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:24,018
What's interesting is like with the wholesome director, we've seen about like 77% of our audience is identifies as women.

187
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:29,342
And that's a little bit out of the norm, I would say for a lot of traditional again, showcases.

188
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:40,150
And so it's really exciting to see just a more nuanced demographic of players, a new nuanced industry where more people are creating games and more stories are being told.

189
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,131
And

190
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:45,124
like unpacking boxes or guiding people into the afterlife.

191
00:22:45,184 --> 00:22:45,604
It's great.

192
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:51,145
In addition to the more diverse player base, could you talk about the diversity of the developers?

193
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:55,566
Yeah, so what's really interesting, I am the numbers person.

194
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:58,667
Let's pull out the calculator.

195
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:08,929
About half of the teams in the Wholesome Direct, we take surveys after the direct to just see how we're doing and what sort of the makeup is.

196
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:24,081
Half of the teams in the direct included at least one BIPOC core developer, not including contractors or interns, 79% included at least one women core developer, and 37% included at least one non-binary developer.

197
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:42,444
Did you, were you aware, like, when curating games for the Direct, were you aware that you were picking these diverse teams and their games for this, or was that a consideration coming into it?

198
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:57,550
I think it came about naturally, kind of, due to the kinds of games that we curated, but also due to the specific rules that we have protecting a lot of marginalized individuals and banning hatred and bigotry from the Direct itself.

199
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,573
And that care kind of follows through I think in the diversity of the developers who submit their game and were showcased in the direct.

200
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:16,239
I know many of the games are quite vulnerable when it comes to wholesome games like a lot of it is tied to identity and that is really important and knowing kind of what you're getting into is a really important thing that you want.

201
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:16,659
to

202
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:36,148
even able to submit.

203
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:47,658
And as someone who has seen a lot of showcases and been a part of them, sometimes you do actually just need to know someone in order to even be considered or to have your email read, which is sad, I will say.

204
00:24:47,678 --> 00:24:55,005
And you don't need a publisher or third party platform, like you don't need that one contact to somehow get to us or whatever.

205
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:59,809
So whether you're just straight out of college, an established indie or AAA group,

206
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:07,694
there is a chance to be featured in Wholesome Direct, which explains, I think, why a lot of underrepresented groups show up in our numbers.

207
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:12,036
So money, network, and geography, especially, can be a huge gatekeeper.

208
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:19,060
So I'm glad that there are other showcases as well who allow for this more free submission process, which is really nice.

209
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,082
And again, this isn't an advertisement for our showcase.

210
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:29,847
It's just something to consider, I think, as an industry of who we let in and who actually gets the opportunities to do these kinds of things.

211
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:36,286
I want to switch gears a little bit, but I think this still falls under the umbrella of, why care about wholesome games?

212
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:50,158
But a question I hear a lot about games as escapism in general, but especially with wholesome games, I think, is the world we live in is a violent and scary and dangerous place.

213
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:54,882
With that in mind, are wholesome stories dishonest?

214
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:57,044
Like, is this something that we need, or is it

215
00:25:57,966 --> 00:26:02,478
um deflecting or hiding from some of the darker realities of the world

216
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:18,205
As a person whose day job is to promote a game about murder and gaslighting, I did want to say that there is a lot of positivity and reflection in wholesome games that we need in the world.

217
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:27,590
I know the industry, and I do this 100% all the time, we talk about spite fueling us, which is valid, and I respect that.

218
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:42,134
Honestly, I do think that it can make us run out of fumes quite quickly If we aren't also like caring and loving the art form and the developers that we work with So the wholesome games team has said this before but I'm stealing it.

219
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:57,138
So that's not real smart, but Sometimes it's a radical act to make dark or upsetting art and sometimes it's radical to make hopeful art in times of adversity Met

220
00:26:58,871 --> 00:26:59,291
I wanted to

221
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:38,516
creative limitations like that can force a lot of creativity right and it always goes back to that feeling first versus mechanic first kind of idea like if you're writing a song and you start with lyrics you're going to end up with a different song than if you start with chords or something so like it gets you to a different place um

222
00:27:39,352 --> 00:27:40,813
Ooblets is a really great example.

223
00:27:40,833 --> 00:28:04,493
I always love to use them because they start making a game that's really cute about farming these cute creatures and then the default verb that they kind of land on is we'll make it like Pokemon so these creatures are going to fight each other and then they find their audience and start like interacting with those people a little bit and everyone starts to realize all this doesn't make much sense like why would we want these cute creatures that we've literally plucked from the earth

224
00:28:05,274 --> 00:28:29,664
you know to fight each other that doesn't make much sense so then they go back to the drawing board they come back with dance battles where the Ooblets are like cutely battling against each other in a dance battle and see who has more hype from their moves and that got them something like infinitely more creative I think so like that's an example of the genre or at least kind of listening to your audience working for you and giving you something more unique that's better suited to your game

225
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,507
Is that unique to wholesome games as a genre?

226
00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:16,779
some limitations are bad some like we don't want to be limited by you know our budget or whatever but i don't think it's a bad thing to say i want to evoke this feeling out of the player how do i get there like that's a different path to walk than saying what's a cool mechanic to play with so you're just going to end up with a different game and i think that can spur a lot of creativity

227
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:23,700
What's kind of cool, we talk about this a lot because again, we just talk about this topic a lot.

228
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:37,664
But what I really love about this, this sort of genre and designing for it is it does allow and encourage folks who are creating these games to find sort of almost the simple things in life and really expand upon them.

229
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:56,347
So, so many of the games that were listed up on the slide earlier, they all took really mundane tasks or very slice of life, everyday activities and turn them into something magical and wondrous and needed to be captured in a full game and I think that's what's really cool about

230
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:56,847
talk

231
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:27,993
I will say, unfortunately, as moderator, I think one of my jobs is to, in the sake of being unbiased, dump a bucket of cold water on everyone when they talk about how cool and freeing it is to make wholesome games.

232
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:33,875
So with that in mind, we're coming up on our question segment soon, but before that I wanted to

233
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:38,732
I wanted to ask about the challenges of making wholesome games.

234
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:45,139
You've said that they're financially viable, they give creative opportunities, there are people playing and talking about them.

235
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,063
If everything's great, why isn't everyone doing it?

236
00:30:50,971 --> 00:31:00,838
I think drawing back on the kind of socialization point I made before, and I think I touched upon it a bit too, I do think one of the biggest challenges to wholesome games is the industry itself.

237
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:13,929
Can we create diverse games and support developers and keep a diverse audience if other elements of the industry, like discrimination in work, funding, power, stay stacked against developers?

238
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:31,466
Can we remove the stigma of cozy games not being as prestigious and still get key visibility in places like storefronts, third-party platforms, or showcases, especially when the people potentially making the decisions aren't the people who have maybe wholesome games like best interests at heart?

239
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:45,358
Yeah, and just to hop on that, I think what's really interesting, I agree with all of that, a major struggle for a lot of wholesome games is they tend to be smaller, they tend to want to be bite-sized experiences, right?

240
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:49,702
Unpacking is a game about unpacking rooms, but that's not going to be a 60-hour

241
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:52,264
I mean, it could be.

242
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:53,065
I wouldn't be mad.

243
00:31:53,585 --> 00:32:00,809
But generally, if you're designing a wholesome game, they tend to be smaller experiences in scope and funding request.

244
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:09,635
And so finding a viable source of funding, a publisher who's willing to put that money in for an unproven concept can be really difficult.

245
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:13,057
Often you'll see, perhaps if you're pitching it

246
00:32:13,797 --> 00:32:29,953
If a publisher doesn't understand, oh, I want to make a game about guiding spirits into the afterlife and giving them hugs, that's harder conceptually than I want to make another roguelike, which I love roguelikes, but it's not as tested, it's unproven.

247
00:32:30,717 --> 00:32:45,165
It's interesting because, like, you were talking earlier about finding these, like, small mundane things and, like, on the developer side I really like the idea of finding something smaller and, like, easier to scale than, like, a farming game that has a bajillion systems that I have to get working.

248
00:32:46,286 --> 00:32:55,651
From a funding standpoint, like, because you've looked for funding with your games and your developer, like, is it hard to find smaller funding?

249
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:59,834
Because I would think that that would be easier and yet it doesn't seem that way.

250
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:01,927
It's very strange.

251
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:14,652
There is a weird, I feel like there's a weird gap between very small funds that would not sustain a studio, a development beyond, you know, just a hobby project almost.

252
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:22,535
And the larger funds that need big teams, you know, a big office space, more multi-million.

253
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:28,537
Like, um, for context, I also participate and I'm an advisor for Colin Knights, which is an indie game fund.

254
00:33:29,237 --> 00:33:42,241
And what I've noticed, not just with Kowloon or a lot of other publishers, they're looking for titles that commercially are a larger success than what some may anticipate from a bite-sized game.

255
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:45,322
So half a million, million, five million plus.

256
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:46,302
and a lot

257
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:07,608
a lot

258
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:50,818
And that's not really a point So I think a lot of the complications that come with trying to make a bigger game to add systems to a game that You already have planned out and you have a design doc for and you're like this is the game I want to make I don't want to owe you even more money and take right have you take more of the rev share of my game just so that I can hopefully hit like the the 2 million mark right and when they just want the 250k and

259
00:34:51,778 --> 00:35:02,963
Well, that idea of scope is really interesting, too, because if you are wanting to make a bite-sized game and that's sustainable for you, making the next Stardew Valley is probably not.

260
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:08,005
As a producer, I'm saying, look at scope, cut it down.

261
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:14,828
And so I think that's exactly it, where we don't, at least we collectively, I feel like,

262
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:21,760
We don't want to push developers to create these larger games to compete on a scale that they don't necessarily want to.

263
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:32,944
But how can we create space then for these bite-sized, really wonderful projects that should exist, but there just is not really a space for sometimes?

264
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:44,908
If you could give one piece of advice to improve things, to help developers, to help our industry, what would that be?

265
00:35:46,801 --> 00:36:04,972
Um, just because again of my perspective, having been on both the developer side as well as the funding side, I think I would genuinely like to call out folks who have the power at places like funds, publishers, people who have the money to invest in these kind of experiences.

266
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:16,456
This is a rhetorical question you don't have to answer out loud, but if you're in that role right now, what are you doing to meet the needs of an increasingly non-traditional audience?

267
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:22,478
Like Victoria was saying, how are you creating spaces for this type of game to even happen?

268
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:26,019
And just who is even in the room making these calls?

269
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:30,420
Just who's helping these games be seen in the first place?

270
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:35,244
And with that, I think we have some time for questions.

271
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:42,789
If you would make your way to the microphone if you want to ask something, and we'll get it started.

272
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:45,982
Hi guys, I'm Emily.

273
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:47,564
I'm the founder of Sondring Studio.

274
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:51,528
I make narrative games with heart with a focus on Asian American representation.

275
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:57,834
I wanted to touch on something that you said earlier, Jenny, about how a game can be wholesome but deal with uncozy topics.

276
00:36:58,195 --> 00:36:59,656
That's kind of my next game.

277
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:03,560
It's wholesome but can deal with uncozy topics like

278
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,020
talk

279
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:23,366
marketing campaign.

280
00:37:42,760 --> 00:38:08,184
that bittersweet that's so lovely where you have these very tender moments but mixed in with that are these really heart-wrenching experiences as well and these really tough concepts that you know we deal with in daily life and so I think being gentle but honest with your audience is really important and I think very appreciated especially in our experience when we communicate with our folks you know an audience on places like TikTok and

281
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:26,372
Twitter one of my favorite words to describe wholesome games is uplifting because it implies that you're gonna deal with really tough topics But it's like your trailer even can show hey, we're gonna dive into this But we're going to say something about it and have you know some optimism about it I think spirit fear does such a great job with that.

282
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:34,396
So that's the kind of the direction I would go in is focus on those like uplifting elements, but don't shy away from you know the struggles that you're talking about and

283
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:37,250
Yeah, I'll do a quick jump in.

284
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,411
Agreed, look into those things.

285
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:55,261
One of the things I actually think you could explore is actually to see which horror games that use wholesome elements display their horror bits because you can draw a lot of inspiration from that and looking outside of the genre usually helps quite a bit to kind of inspire how you can present these kinds of things.

286
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:56,661
Thank you.

287
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:57,861
I actually never thought of that before.

288
00:38:58,661 --> 00:38:59,002
Thank you.

289
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:00,062
Thank you for your question.

290
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:01,702
Hello.

291
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:03,822
I'm Meg from One More Multiverse.

292
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,163
I have a question about marketing.

293
00:39:07,163 --> 00:39:09,624
So you have to convey a game at a glance.

294
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:16,565
I'd recommend wholesome games almost always as a first entry point to gaming for people who may not identify as gamers.

295
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:22,686
But how do you hit a more mainstream audience that may see these games as juvenile at first glance?

296
00:39:23,146 --> 00:39:26,128
What meaning does wholesome really carry to casual gamers?

297
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:27,909
It's a good question.

298
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:39,637
Like I remember James telling me about when we started wholesome games, like his core thing was like, I don't want the last of us to be the only thing that gets like critical acclaim and kind of considered like a real experience.

299
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:44,100
And I do think even though we're kind of in this bubble, that's still a big part of the struggle.

300
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:50,264
So I'm glad you brought it up because people still inherently think of a lot of these games as like Nintendo slash kid games.

301
00:39:50,504 --> 00:39:52,425
And that's a real like, you know,

302
00:39:52,745 --> 00:39:53,645
something to overcome.

303
00:39:54,005 --> 00:40:03,467
I don't have the perfect answer but certainly in our work we're trying to like reach those people more than ever and get those games and spaces where they're seen by more traditional players.

304
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:07,048
Cool, thank you.

305
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:10,729
Hi, my name is Sharif.

306
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:17,810
I do a lot of work in citizen science games, games where players contribute to scientific research by solving puzzles.

307
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,591
I'm curious if you would consider those wholesome games.

308
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:32,106
We get a lot of educational game pitches, I would say, and it's interesting to find that balance because, you know, it's one of those things that's absolutely wholesome in a general sense, right?

309
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:35,127
Does it fit the capital W wholesome games?

310
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:35,787
I don't know.

311
00:40:36,288 --> 00:40:39,109
But that doesn't mean you can't market it that way, right?

312
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:45,732
Like, if you think it's relevant to that audience, and frankly, if it's a relevant keyword to that audience, then you should use it.

313
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:48,213
Thanks.

314
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:51,849
Hello, my name is Ryan.

315
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:53,271
I made a game called Blood and City.

316
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:54,793
It's very pastel-y and cute.

317
00:40:55,815 --> 00:41:01,784
And the reason I bring this up is because something that I noticed with a lot of wholesome games, they're extremely...

318
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:03,135
of

319
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:34,176
I think so.

320
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:42,963
I think it's one of those things again where it's not like we can necessarily define wholesome in itself, but I think of a lot of the ways in which

321
00:41:44,454 --> 00:41:45,895
I'll use Among Us, for example.

322
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:55,698
Among Us is not supposed to be a cute game, it's not supposed to be wholesome, but a lot of fan art and a lot of creations, a lot of marketing that we get, they think it's really cute.

323
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:56,999
We didn't expect it to be.

324
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:01,540
So I think the aesthetics doesn't necessarily have to be uwu, pastel, whatever.

325
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:07,843
And I'm sure there's examples of games like that, I just can't think of it off the top of my head, that do exist in that space.

326
00:42:08,303 --> 00:42:17,526
Yeah and when we're reviewing games for wholesome direct or something I care more about the theme than I do the style like success on social media that's a different thing but like my definition it absolutely includes it.

327
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:37,531
Yeah I would definitely just agree with everything said and also the fact that like what's really interesting just as a tangent is this element of looking at coziness as elements within non-cozy spaces I think is really interesting and so like your example of a Junji Ito like comic which

328
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,050
to

329
00:42:59,466 --> 00:43:11,172
One that always made me really happy was talking about the wholesome elements in Death Stranding, which is a game you wouldn't consider for that, but you're making deliveries that save people's lives, they're thanking you for it, there's this theme of connection.

330
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:18,795
So I think it's very fruitful, even if you're not making a game that you think is 100% wholesome, to consider those elements.

331
00:43:19,575 --> 00:43:20,376
Thank you, great question.

332
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:23,918
Hi, my name's Anna.

333
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:24,739
Thank you for your talk.

334
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:28,579
I was just wondering where you see the future of cozy games going.

335
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,440
I know there's a cozy MMO in the works.

336
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,942
I was just wondering if you see that kind of progression, like a cozy MOBA, or where you see it going, really.

337
00:43:38,522 --> 00:43:39,382
Cozy esports.

338
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:41,162
I don't know.

339
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:42,403
Here we go.

340
00:43:44,611 --> 00:43:45,491
Yeah, I don't know.

341
00:43:46,712 --> 00:43:50,653
I think right now all you can do is ride the wave and see where it's heading.

342
00:43:50,853 --> 00:44:01,277
But I definitely think and am actively concerned about giant companies attaching it to games that mechanically and thematically are not wholesome.

343
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:04,238
That's why the aesthetics of it are the least of my concern.

344
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:32,323
I'm sure it'll happen like you look at a game like in the aftermath of something like Animal Crossing so many things like implemented elements of that So I'm sure that'll happen I think everything kind of progresses at two different speeds and like the Indies are kind of the testbed for all this stuff So I think a little delayed you will see like big studios like you're describing attach it to all kinds of genres And hopefully there's really fruitful stuff from that experimentation

345
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:34,397
I agree with that.

346
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:50,343
I think also what's really interesting is gaming is such a young industry, and so when we, you know, back when we started making games I feel like a lot of the, there were some really prominent verbs that we were engaging with, and they were all very like

347
00:44:50,723 --> 00:45:18,493
kind of active maybe a bit more aggressive in a lot of ways and it's almost this pendulum swing where we've now said okay well what's almost the opposite we can do and I think what I what I would love to see is a continue almost a meet in the middle where people are experimenting with these genres with these verbs and finding ways to just make games that are more nuanced and a little bit more continue to reimagine what it's like to create and design games in general.

348
00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:20,014
Thank you.

349
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:20,622
Thank you.

350
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:22,843
Hey, my name's Cooper.

351
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:26,944
I'm a student journalist from OU, the University of Oklahoma.

352
00:45:27,544 --> 00:45:35,907
My question was just about kind of like how, so you guys talked about starting this Twitter account that started getting a huge following.

353
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:39,788
I guess my question would be like, how did you, how and why did you start that?

354
00:45:39,808 --> 00:45:44,049
And then how did everyone just like join on after that popped off?

355
00:45:44,332 --> 00:46:01,861
Yeah it was, I mean I started it because I saw two main games, Maneco's Night Market and Ooblets were the two games that I saw and I was like it seems like there's a groundswell of like indie developers kind of getting the power to make the games they want to make and then they're making some really like experiences that resonated with me.

356
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:12,808
So then you just start a Twitter account just to literally like catalog as many of those games as you can and I think it's a testament to the hunger that was there that people did start following it, right?

357
00:46:12,828 --> 00:46:26,817
Like I could have made that account and nobody cared but apparently people wanted more experiences like this and you wanted people if you were interested in this game you might not yet know about this game and all of a sudden that connection proved really valuable for people so

358
00:46:27,315 --> 00:46:29,637
That's something I would love to see happen with other genres.

359
00:46:29,837 --> 00:46:31,639
I just think curation is at the heart.

360
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:39,646
We have so many indie games that people need to play, and as a result we need more and more curators to make sure the best ones get attention and find their niche.

361
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:45,611
When you were tweeting about how much you like Pikmin, did you think it would lead to the GDC stage?

362
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:47,633
No, absolutely not.

363
00:46:47,653 --> 00:46:49,414
Chibi-Robo, I never thought you'd get me here.

364
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:50,995
Thank you for your question.

365
00:46:52,994 --> 00:46:54,055
Hi, my name's Ariana.

366
00:46:56,316 --> 00:47:16,989
I had a question about, like, we've talked about, like, marketing your game as a wholesome game, but I've had an experience where a game that I've worked on, one that was more about dealing with some tough topics like sex and bodies and objectification, had a review, a small review, and somebody described the game as very wholesome.

367
00:47:17,149 --> 00:47:18,870
I was very confused by that.

368
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:19,911
So, like,

369
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:47,968
I want to ask you, what can we, I'm not quite sure how to phrase this, but I guess just to talk about what it means when somebody else, either positively or negatively, experiences your game and considers it wholesome or cozy or something like that, in ways that you may not have intended, and how do you

370
00:47:49,355 --> 00:47:53,332
work with that audience, talk with them and understand their perspectives and things like that.

371
00:47:53,823 --> 00:47:55,203
Yeah, it's a great question.

372
00:47:55,243 --> 00:48:01,525
I think ultimately with any art form, right, you put it in front of an audience and it's going to be up to them to interpret it however they want to.

373
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:08,307
It's a great example of something where we control the capital W and not the lowercase w wholesome games.

374
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:15,869
We're really keen on the idea that like these progressive themes are wholesome and we want to make sure those are included in the conversation.

375
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:20,450
So in a way, it kind of makes me happy that your experience, your game was described that way.

376
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:22,611
What do you guys think?

377
00:48:24,144 --> 00:48:31,490
Yeah, I think what's really difficult is if you intended for the game to be interpreted in a certain way.

378
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,733
It can be difficult when others take it and make it their own.

379
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:37,856
And so I think that's just an internal artist struggle.

380
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:48,024
Just from a marketing perspective, I think if that is feedback that you're getting about your game and you want to reframe the way folks are thinking about it, I think

381
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:49,626
team.

382
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:07,158
convey what you're hoping to get across.

383
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:10,319
So a very vague answer, but I hope it fits somewhat.

384
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:13,300
It's so important to find the people that you want to speak to.

385
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,540
So it's another example of marketing being like super important.

386
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:32,163
Yeah, I will say one of the things is sometimes, especially with the interpretation of a game or art or whatever, people will interpret it however they want, no matter how much you try to push back against it sometimes, which is maybe unfortunate, maybe cool, depending on what you want from your game.

387
00:49:32,884 --> 00:49:37,790
So an example is, I know the Descenders folks, this is not a wholesome game, maybe it is, I don't know.

388
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:50,886
The Descenders folks from No More Robots wanted their mountain biking game to be like, they wanted to talk all about the really specific things and how cool it was, and anything they tried, all people would talk about was go downhill fast.

389
00:49:51,607 --> 00:49:51,847
Thank you.

390
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:52,088
Thank you.

391
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:09,188
Hello, thank you for the great panel.

392
00:50:10,248 --> 00:50:11,068
My name is Indrani.

393
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:14,790
I'm the marketing and communications director at Pariah Interactive.

394
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,872
We're an indie studio based out of Mumbai and Brooklyn.

395
00:50:18,312 --> 00:50:21,853
All that context because back in India where I'm from, TikTok is banned.

396
00:50:22,474 --> 00:50:31,198
And TikTok seems to be like the platform if you want to find, you know, critical and commercial success as an indie, especially working with like wholesome games.

397
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:35,580
Do you have any recommendations specifically directed to marketing?

398
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:44,221
to reach similar critical mass when you don't have access to the platform as a game dev as well as consumers.

399
00:50:45,444 --> 00:50:46,964
Yeah, this one is really difficult.

400
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,325
It kind of ties into what I was talking about.

401
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:57,086
Geography and network and money are huge factors on what games usually find success and things.

402
00:50:57,126 --> 00:51:00,807
And that's why we need less gates, I think, when it comes to these sorts of things.

403
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:02,707
But even then, that's really difficult, right?

404
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,207
We're all speaking in English right now.

405
00:51:05,928 --> 00:51:12,009
And I think for places that often can't access different

406
00:51:12,854 --> 00:51:13,134
talks.

407
00:51:31,107 --> 00:51:31,287
talk

408
00:51:48,963 --> 00:52:14,350
any other sort of like social media platform hopefully you can access and honestly working within your local community I found a lot of people have found a lot of success in that like really harnessing like you know what like this is my community this is like things I'm going to play really closely to that can have a lot of resonance especially for people overseas who like you know might come from India right they might be like oh my goodness this is amazing that sort of thing but I don't know if anyone else has

409
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:16,687
No, I think that's pretty good.

410
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:17,728
Yeah.

411
00:52:17,748 --> 00:52:18,048
Good luck.

412
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,149
Thank you so much.

413
00:52:19,189 --> 00:52:19,530
Thank you.

414
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:21,788
Hi, great talk.

415
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:22,148
Thank you.

416
00:52:22,288 --> 00:52:24,269
My name is Celeste Bean, hardware engineer at PlayStation.

417
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:30,072
You talked about the kind of commonality of wholesome games and maybe that there is no kind of core thing that is wholesome.

418
00:52:30,933 --> 00:52:38,157
When I think about them for myself, I think of games that lack a time pressure, you know, where I'm not like, oh God, if I don't do something, someone's going to shoot at me.

419
00:52:38,177 --> 00:52:40,959
Like, oh God, I can like build my flowers at my own pace.

420
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:48,864
Would you say, or do you have any counter examples to that where there is kind of this mechanic or lack of mechanic where you have to do something with a time pressure?

421
00:52:50,373 --> 00:53:00,460
I think, well, this is not the entire point of Little Gator Game, but there are time challenges, I would say.

422
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,381
I think there are a lot of games with time challenges.

423
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:10,506
Yeah, I feel like the time challenge itself isn't as much of a big deal as the high stakes of, if you don't do this, it's game over right now.

424
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:18,972
So, yeah, nothing springs to mind for me immediately, but I feel like that's not an unwholesome thing on its own as long as the stakes are low.

425
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:21,248
Yeah, I would agree with that.

426
00:53:21,308 --> 00:53:25,933
I think what is interesting is the context in which these mechanics are happening.

427
00:53:26,294 --> 00:53:39,568
If you feel like you have the opportunity to try again, if you know that there's no punishment for failing that first time around and you can go back and retry the race or whatever you're doing, that's really important.

428
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:55,855
Yeah, there's a really, it's maybe like a decade old at this point, but there was a really interesting paper written by Tanya Short and a bunch of folks about designing for coziness and kindness, I think was the title, just coziness.

429
00:53:56,475 --> 00:54:01,577
And it discusses and dives into the ways in which mechanically

430
00:54:02,157 --> 00:54:02,217
I'm

431
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:16,379
maybe in experimenting with things or going deeper into themes that are hard.

432
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:41,720
I think Celeste is a really great, I personally find Celeste very wholesome because it's a difficult game, it's really hard, but the way that accessibility allows you to toggle on and off the different scaffolds, it allowed me as a player to feel like I could try and practice and get better each time and gradually add or remove scaffolds as I needed and it felt very wholesome.

433
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,161
for me, personally.

434
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:52,064
And I would add, too, that it's not all or nothing in the same way that we talk about how dark games or horror games can have wholesome elements.

435
00:54:52,124 --> 00:55:02,049
You can certainly have wholesome games that have elements that are stressful or anything like that, like cooking games, for instance, always have a lot of time or usually have a lot of time pressure.

436
00:55:02,129 --> 00:55:03,429
But yeah, great question.

437
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:03,890
Great question.

438
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:04,470
Thanks so much.

439
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,155
Hello there.

440
00:55:07,456 --> 00:55:08,296
Hi, I'm Kendrick.

441
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:12,998
I'm a producer with quite a few different drafts for Wholesome Games, including a Coded King game.

442
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,759
So this is kind of a follow-up question.

443
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:25,204
In your perspectives, is there a line in the sand where there's too many horror or dramatic moments to the story that really turns away the target demographic?

444
00:55:27,378 --> 00:55:27,959
It's a great question.

445
00:55:27,979 --> 00:55:30,861
I mean, I think in some instances you might need like a trigger warning, right?

446
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:48,157
Like if you create a game that's really dark in some way, that might not appeal to the majority of Wholesome Games players, but I don't think there's this clear line so long as it is uplifting, so long as you have something to say about those difficult topics as opposed to just kind of wallowing in them.

447
00:55:49,017 --> 00:55:51,019
I don't think there's necessarily a line in the sand.

448
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,381
It is about context, at least for me as a player.

449
00:55:55,621 --> 00:56:00,083
If I'm informed and I know ahead of time what I'm getting into, I can mentally prep for that, right?

450
00:56:00,463 --> 00:56:11,307
So I could have a game with maybe, I don't know, one scary moment, and if I don't know, that will completely change my experience as a player versus if I know something is coming up.

451
00:56:12,188 --> 00:56:12,828
That's a great point.

452
00:56:13,048 --> 00:56:13,328
Thank you.

453
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:14,048
Okay, thank you.

454
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:15,889
Yes, please.

455
00:56:17,076 --> 00:56:21,118
Hello, my name is Darren Kearney.

456
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:24,479
I make games in my spare time.

457
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,601
I came over from Ireland and thank you very much.

458
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:29,282
It's been really nice to hear the panel here.

459
00:56:30,062 --> 00:56:34,524
Earlier on when you were talking about why we should care about wholesome games,

460
00:56:35,356 --> 00:56:50,617
and there was talk about the composition of teams being more diverse and wanting to kind of change the industry to be better and that's something that really hit home with me.

461
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:56,828
and has been a part of the approach that I've taken as an indie game developer.

462
00:56:56,908 --> 00:56:58,930
Like, why am I doing this my way?

463
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:04,997
Because I don't like the way the industry is just kind of this tire fire mess and I want to do it my way.

464
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:09,622
So one of the questions I'd like to ask is,

465
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:36,774
there's lots of these tensions when you're making a computer game and deciding what you want to make deciding like what you can make and with the team that you work with and so those are tensions that are common to every game but there's this additional thing with wholesome games I think where

466
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:42,617
you're also trying to do it with maybe a principled approach.

467
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:44,901
And I was wondering

468
00:57:46,345 --> 00:57:53,426
because we'll all come across periods of time when we're making a game where we're kind of under a lot of pressure.

469
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:55,587
What?

470
00:57:55,887 --> 00:57:56,607
Yeah, I know, right?

471
00:57:57,487 --> 00:57:59,388
That was a surprise for me somehow.

472
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:11,410
But I had a kind of rough time when we gave ourselves this kind of arbitrary deadline where we wanted to release our game and

473
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:15,912
we kind of got into this crunchy thing because we're all very passionate about what we do.

474
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:27,438
So I was wondering if you have advice for people who are making wholesome games, who are passionate about what they do, but don't want to let that passion turn into crunch.

475
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:30,439
Yeah.

476
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,741
I mean, that's another question that I feel like is inherent to all art forms.

477
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:37,823
Like if you become really, really passionate about something and we have a lot of

478
00:58:39,344 --> 00:59:07,191
examples and I think a lot of them are really unhealthy examples of great artists throwing themselves at something to you know create something bigger than themselves and I think that I don't know I imagine you apply the same techniques you would apply to any crunch but you have to be a lot more stern with yourself when you're working on something that is a passion project something that you feel is important I would just remind you that you're not the only person on that you know side of the world you know there are other people

479
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:13,672
trying their best to make important things and make things that can make our industry a better place so it doesn't all fall on your shoulders.

480
00:59:14,156 --> 00:59:16,998
And with that, that's our time for today, sadly.

481
00:59:17,198 --> 00:59:17,778
Thank you very much.

482
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:19,660
We will be in the wrap up room.

483
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,580
Yeah, we'll be in the wrap up room.

484
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:26,244
Before we go, I just want to say really quick, a big thank you to our other panelists who couldn't be here as may.

485
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:30,267
Thank you to our Wholesome Games moderators who make our lives much easier.

486
00:59:30,307 --> 00:59:35,350
That's Jacob, Julia, Celine, Vex, Mai, Crystal, Angela and Toma.

487
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:43,496
Thank you so much to the AV and tech folks here, all of the CAs and GDC people who've been helping us out throughout the week, our advisor.

488
00:59:44,556 --> 00:59:47,799
Helen and Violet, our interpreters, James and Jenny.

489
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:51,603
And just a reminder to please rank this session.

490
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:57,728
Not only does that feedback help us improve, it lets GDC know that people are interested in things like this.

491
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:00,351
And with that, thank you so much.
