1
00:00:02,053 --> 00:00:02,754
All right, here we go.

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:08,837
So the name of my talk today, Get Your Game Out of My Movie,

3
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:10,398
Narrative Design in Mass Effect 2.

4
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:12,799
So I want to talk about the title,

5
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:14,960
because actually a lot of people have been asking me about this

6
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:16,841
and what it kind of means.

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:20,283
And really, for a Bioware game, we really

8
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:22,764
don't differentiate between game and story.

9
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:24,545
They're pretty much the same thing.

10
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,107
We start with story and we add gameplay,

11
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:29,888
but really they're.

12
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:32,448
they're symbiont to each other.

13
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:35,030
We don't really differentiate between the two.

14
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:38,753
And really, I think the title itself kind of

15
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:42,696
just encapsulates what we believe the rest of the industry

16
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:44,077
is really struggling with right now,

17
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:47,820
which is the fact that we have story, we have gameplay,

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,121
but we're really trying to merge them.

19
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,743
So what this presentation's going to be about

20
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:55,206
is how we solve those issues for Mass Effect 2.

21
00:00:57,127 --> 00:00:59,329
So who's this guy talking to you?

22
00:00:59,469 --> 00:00:59,649
Well.

23
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:04,069
My name is Armando Torrice. I'm the lead cinematic designer on the Mass Effect franchise.

24
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,491
I've been with the team for about four and a half years now,

25
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:10,992
and I've been running what we call the cinematic design department.

26
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:16,434
And cinematic design is really kind of an odd thing. It doesn't really exist in a lot of places.

27
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:19,315
And we just kind of...

28
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:20,996
Sorry, Frank.

29
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:28,798
So, yeah, that would be a good one for later on.

30
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:35,260
Um, so what is cinematic design? Well, we're narrative designers, um, uh, first, and we're

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,563
cinematic artists second. And what we really deal with is the how of interactive storytelling

32
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:45,025
and the how of interactive narrative. We provide the writers with the tools and the processes

33
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:50,388
to create the interactive conversations that are in the game. And when we talk about the

34
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:54,470
interactive conversations, we're really talking about the main way that we're communicating

35
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:58,753
with the player. It is the main device in which we, um, we, um, we communicate with

36
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:02,767
get story to the player and have them understand

37
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:05,148
what the intent of the writer

38
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,750
and the rest of the narrative design team is doing.

39
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,912
So, really, what are we talking about here today?

40
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,633
Well, we're gonna talk about a couple of things.

41
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:15,215
First thing is story perspective.

42
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:16,796
And if there's any writers out there,

43
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:18,457
they understand that story perspective

44
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:19,578
is a very powerful thing.

45
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:22,139
And it even gets even more complicated

46
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,741
once you add the player to the mix

47
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,902
of protagonist and antagonist.

48
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:29,424
And we're going to be addressing some of those issues.

49
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:34,697
that we encountered in the many role-playing games that we've made at Bioware.

50
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,318
The second is the agreement.

51
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:42,679
And the agreement is really the rules in which we deal with interactivity in the cinematic space

52
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:48,901
and how we apply those rules to what we're trying to achieve with the role-playing experience.

53
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:54,583
And, you know, we all know them, don't know if we all love them, but QuickTime events.

54
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,964
We've added QuickTime events to conversations in Mass Effect.

55
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,453
I'm gonna, we're gonna go through kind of what the process was in designing those and

56
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:07,795
making sure that they, they're a part of this agreement.

57
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:10,897
You know, they fit into our narrative design structure.

58
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:15,679
And we're gonna have some Q&A at the end of this, so you can ask me all types of great

59
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,159
questions.

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,243
So firstly, a BioWare game is composed of what we call the pillars of design.

61
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,625
And really they're story, exploration, progression, and gameplay.

62
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:29,066
So...

63
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:31,855
We have this concept of activity chaining,

64
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,776
which happens between these four different quadrants

65
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:36,856
of the player experience.

66
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:40,237
And the one we're gonna be concentrating on today is story.

67
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:43,278
But that's not to mean that the other parts

68
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:45,358
don't have story, like they obviously do.

69
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,459
But in terms of referencing and framing

70
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,780
this discussion today, we're going to be talking about

71
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,280
this interactive cinematic space.

72
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,441
And this is our product.

73
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,662
This is the conversation system that hopefully a lot of you got to play.

74
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:10,424
And we're going to be talking about the mechanics behind Story and how we navigated the minefield

75
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:14,586
of different player choice and agency.

76
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:20,027
So firstly, let's try to define what we call a conversation.

77
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,809
And the first thing that I think of, really, is that it's a narrative tool.

78
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,250
It's a way for us to communicate with the player.

79
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,372
And there's lots of narrative tools that we use.

80
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:31,374
We use ambient dialogue, we use video screens,

81
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:36,478
we use codexes, we use a myriad of techniques to communicate.

82
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:38,540
But this is our primary narrative tool.

83
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,563
And secondly, it's a game system.

84
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:46,606
It is a massive, massive thing that we develop at BioWare.

85
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:51,190
And it allows us to coordinate the content from disciplines

86
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,651
like art and writing and animation.

87
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:57,564
and level design and bring it all together to make these great interactions.

88
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:01,886
And it's also a philosophy. When we talk about conversation in Bioware, we're talking about

89
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,229
this character interaction, this emotional

90
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:09,191
storytelling that we're really trying to achieve. So this is something we're always

91
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:10,852
working on, always trying to evolve.

92
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:16,395
And this is the scary part of a Bioware game.

93
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:19,637
This is the conversation tree.

94
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:23,260
And I know a lot of people have a lot of opinions about conversation trees and

95
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,019
and you know whether or not they're a good way

96
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,021
to do interactive narrative and interactive dialogue.

97
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,501
But it really works for us.

98
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,443
We really have spent many, many years refining

99
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:38,925
this particular way of communicating with the player.

100
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,867
And you know, and it's the one thing that's very common

101
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:42,868
to all Bioware games.

102
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:44,629
We all use this basic technology.

103
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:48,170
Everything from Baldur's Gate to the new MMO

104
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:51,272
uses this technology and this design principle.

105
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:55,806
But if you look very closely and very deeply into this crazy web,

106
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:59,809
you'll notice that there's one thing that's inherent to what we're trying to achieve.

107
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,571
And it's the idea of choice.

108
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:07,575
And choice in cinematics is something we take really seriously at BioWare.

109
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:11,018
And it's the culmination of all the animations, the cameras,

110
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:15,361
the scripting, the dialogue, the VO, and we bring it all together.

111
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,603
And what we're trying to do is just really make sure that the player understands,

112
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:20,365
hey, you know what, this is your story.

113
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:22,536
This story doesn't belong to the writers.

114
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:24,598
This story belongs to the players.

115
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:27,580
And we really try to imbue everything we do

116
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,841
with that kind of sensibility.

117
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,884
So in order to frame this discussion,

118
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:34,485
we're gonna be talking about perspective.

119
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:36,907
And when we talk about perspective,

120
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,548
we're talking about a couple of different things.

121
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:41,030
We're talking about the point of view

122
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,931
in which the player interacts with the story.

123
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:45,913
And in Bioware games, it really comes down

124
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,535
to two different types of...

125
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:55,204
of categories. One is subjective and one is objective. So subjective, we have a huge history

126
00:06:55,384 --> 00:07:01,886
of doing these types of games and I'm sure you can recognize a lot of them up there.

127
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:09,129
And really what a subjective game is, is a traditional computer role playing experience.

128
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:15,551
It's the one that we've all known for many many years where you are the avatar or the

129
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:16,232
playing character.

130
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:19,695
Dialogue responses that you make are verbatim.

131
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,875
There's no interpretation.

132
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,236
What you say is what your player says.

133
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:31,797
There's uninterrupted agency, which means that my character doesn't act without me actually telling him what to do.

134
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,978
He doesn't act on his own.

135
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:39,519
There's always a level of choice that happens moment to moment between me and my avatar.

136
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,525
And it's really great.

137
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:45,465
It allows us to quickly empathize with the avatar

138
00:07:46,406 --> 00:07:47,726
in order to get into his head.

139
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:50,966
And this is really the design of, you know, this is you.

140
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:53,467
This is not someone else.

141
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,847
This is you playing the game.

142
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:57,087
But there's a couple of things that happens

143
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,248
and that we're going to be looking at right now.

144
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,528
And the first is really some of the side effects

145
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,569
that happens from the subjective point of view.

146
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,149
And it's temporal distortion and really lots of dialogue.

147
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:10,390
So temporal distortion happens when choices are being made.

148
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:14,591
or your player says something and we usually say,

149
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:15,812
oh, your player's silent.

150
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:17,653
But no, your player's not silent,

151
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,374
we just sped up time really fast.

152
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,476
And we just chopped out that time

153
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:23,978
and we went straight to whatever the response was.

154
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:28,201
And really, what happens is, in that type of situation,

155
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:32,624
the NPC has to hold up a lot of the dialogue on their own.

156
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,745
So there's a lot more exposition needs to happen.

157
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:37,047
So we're gonna take a look at a clip here

158
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,608
from Knights of the Old Republic.

159
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:43,100
in which we use this subjective storytelling technique.

160
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:47,902
Back again?

161
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:50,624
Is there something old Garuk can do for you?

162
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:54,526
Or did you just come to chat with a lonely old man?

163
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:58,327
So once again, this is the distortion that happens

164
00:08:58,588 --> 00:08:59,668
when you're making a choice.

165
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:04,290
That's why I'm giving up the gambler's life.

166
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,132
But I think I can still manage

167
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:09,093
to answer some simple questions.

168
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:17,694
And again, some more distortion when you make a choice.

169
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:19,736
We're saying time has stopped at this point

170
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:23,158
and you are now contemplating your next choice.

171
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,320
So, and forgive me for the choppy video.

172
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:29,562
I'm running this thing off my little laptop here,

173
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:32,384
so just forgive me for that, please.

174
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:34,705
So here we go.

175
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:36,326
Now we get into the objective story.

176
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,808
And this is kind of what some of our newer titles are doing,

177
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,190
especially for the Mass Effect franchise.

178
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,151
And it actually brings along a lot of new challenges.

179
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:49,896
So when we talk about objective story, it's really counter to the traditional role-playing model.

180
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:55,721
You are not the avatar. So when people say that, they get kind of weirded out, because they're like, Shepard's me.

181
00:09:56,361 --> 00:10:01,826
But you're not, no, it's really not. And I'm going to explain why most people feel that way about Shepard.

182
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:07,751
But you are not Shepard. Shepard has his own motivations, he has his own voice, he's an actual

183
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:14,776
character. He's more akin to Kratos than anything like on Dragon Age or any of the other titles.

184
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:18,455
So Avatar has his own voice and motivations.

185
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:20,756
The player is now voyeuristic to the whole experience.

186
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:22,758
And this is when we get into what we call

187
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:24,099
the interactive movie model,

188
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:28,142
where you're very objective to what's happening

189
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:30,404
and you're kind of watching things

190
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:32,546
and then trying to control it through your choice.

191
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:36,609
So there's a lot of reasons why we try to do this.

192
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,892
Really, it's this idea of real-time narrative environment

193
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:43,154
that actually removes a lot of these temporal distortions

194
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:44,495
that we saw with the previous clip.

195
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:49,912
And the temporal distortions being when you make a choice or you're waiting for a choice

196
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:56,213
So this allowed us to really break through and add drama to these interactions

197
00:10:56,513 --> 00:11:03,015
Which is something which our project director really wanted to do and this is really the breakthrough in interactive storytelling that we made with

198
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:04,115
Mass Effect

199
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:07,136
so we're gonna take a look in Mass Effect and

200
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:09,676
We're gonna be we're gonna see this real-time

201
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:11,577
environment in action

202
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:16,387
What are you looking at?

203
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:18,148
The man who damn ugly.

204
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,211
I'm not looking for trouble.

205
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:22,412
Maybe I am.

206
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:25,355
Maybe you better get out of here before I find you some.

207
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,018
Alright, alright. I've got stuff to do anyway.

208
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:31,060
Come on, let's get out of here.

209
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:45,367
and a lot of cool stuff just kind of happened around you and it really feels like it's real

210
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:50,571
time and it really feels good. It feels very cinematic at that point. But I'm wondering

211
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:54,514
if a lot of people out there who are very traditional notice something very odd about

212
00:11:54,554 --> 00:12:01,639
what Shepard did. And so if you can take just a little quick guess at what I'm trying to

213
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:04,841
allude to. Let's roll the clip again and let's take another look.

214
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:13,966
The man who's damn about to ruin it.

215
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:15,947
Ah, I'm not looking for trouble.

216
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,128
Maybe I am.

217
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:21,811
Maybe you better get out of here before I find you some.

218
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:23,752
Alright, alright. I've got stuff to do anyway.

219
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,793
Come on, let's get out of here.

220
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:31,417
So, um, I wonder, did anybody catch it at all?

221
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:37,661
He, uh, he expounded on the choice of the game.

222
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:38,601
Oh, nice, exactly.

223
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:40,322
So, what it was is, auto-reply.

224
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:44,923
So Shepard acted on his own without me telling him to do something.

225
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:46,904
I didn't want to say that.

226
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:49,825
As a player, I'm like, okay, well what if I wanted to turtle?

227
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,145
What if I wanted to make another choice?

228
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:53,646
You know, Shepard just did something.

229
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:54,766
Maybe I didn't want to.

230
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:57,607
Like, you know, am I disconnecting from this roleplaying experience?

231
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,588
My agency has just been interrupted.

232
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:02,409
Like, so, you know, what's going on here?

233
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:04,149
Was it lack of choice?

234
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:06,270
Was it an anti-roleplaying design?

235
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:09,909
And really, with so many of these traditional rules broken,

236
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,892
why is Mass Effect such a successful RPG experience?

237
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:15,654
And really, it comes down to what we call the agreement.

238
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:18,416
And the agreement is something that we have with the player.

239
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,678
It's a set of rules that binds us to the player

240
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:22,879
and the player to the designer to make sure

241
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,063
that their role-playing experience is always expected

242
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:30,305
and is always in line with their expectations.

243
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,087
So, what is the agreement?

244
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,149
Well, it's a covenant the designer makes with the player.

245
00:13:36,495 --> 00:13:39,257
It's a set of rules that governs choice and expectation.

246
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:41,178
And we'll be getting into these in some detail.

247
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,741
It binds the player to the role-playing experience

248
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:48,524
and allows the player to access the avatar.

249
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,886
So it allows us to have this very fluid,

250
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:56,009
very first-person, very subjective role-playing experience

251
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,772
while still maintaining this objective

252
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,034
point of view in the story.

253
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:05,116
So what is the agreement we made?

254
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:12,665
Well, every time we're writing things at BioWare or at Mass Effect, we always come down to

255
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:17,048
some certain principles, which is a litmus test for us to say whether or not this is

256
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,630
a good role-playing experience or not.

257
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:21,512
And really, these are them.

258
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:25,134
And we often describe them as the covenant.

259
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:31,019
This is something, to us, is very sacred and something that we always come back to and

260
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,862
something that's just so important for us to maintain that role-playing experience.

261
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:35,282
So first...

262
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,900
Interface for choice is always predictable.

263
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,302
Choice produces results the player expects.

264
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:43,924
Give the player the choices they want,

265
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,066
and hopefully when they want to make them.

266
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,527
And the last one is the player story.

267
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:53,409
Like I said before, the story doesn't belong to the writers.

268
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,871
The writers give you this great multi-path narrative,

269
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:59,593
they give you this probability space to play in.

270
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:01,374
But you make your own story.

271
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,924
So let's look at some of these things.

272
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:07,225
So interface for choice is predictable.

273
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,125
And what are we really talking about?

274
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:11,106
Well, it's the conversation wheel.

275
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:14,467
The conversation wheel is a GUI interface

276
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:16,967
that we introduced that replaced the list system

277
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:20,388
that we see with a lot of the subjective narrative games

278
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:21,369
that we produced.

279
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:26,250
And really, it was in response also to the high-def era

280
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,871
and the fact that we didn't have the black bars,

281
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:31,452
the letter boxing.

282
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:32,733
to put words in.

283
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:35,093
So we needed something that was very slick and very intuitive.

284
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:39,615
And also, now that we moved to this different model,

285
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:42,076
now that we're objective to the experience,

286
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:45,057
we didn't have to write out the whole response anymore.

287
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:47,958
So we came up with a slick little interface,

288
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:51,319
which actually ended up becoming a very core component

289
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,379
to our narrative design.

290
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,420
So if we look behind this interface,

291
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,201
it's the dialogue tree, which we saw.

292
00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:59,602
And really, when we look at the blue responses

293
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:02,522
These are all Shepard's responses,

294
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:05,903
or his potential responses, for that interaction.

295
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:08,924
So we're taking this and we're mapping it

296
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:10,524
to a nice simple GUI that a player

297
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:12,705
can easily interface with.

298
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:16,786
So we know what the conversation wheel is.

299
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:20,167
It's a dialogue navigation interface

300
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,368
which allows the player to interface with the story.

301
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,989
And we get all those choices and we map them

302
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:29,850
to these various points of the radial.

303
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,152
And we have an indicator that we move around

304
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:35,193
and we can make choices.

305
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,374
And it's pretty easy breezy.

306
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:40,315
It's a very simple kind of interface.

307
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,077
But we're gonna look deep into it

308
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:45,658
because even though it appears to be very simple,

309
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,220
there's a lot of mechanics that run behind it

310
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,422
which allow us to keep that predictability

311
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:52,362
that I was speaking of.

312
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:58,145
So firstly, we talk about the behavioral player.

313
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:00,707
And when we talk about behavioral,

314
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:01,547
we're talking about.

315
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:08,508
The different parts of the wheel actually mean something different to a writer or to

316
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,268
an interaction.

317
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:15,594
For example, if you look where it says Paragon, every time you pick the upper right, it's

318
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,736
a Paragon response, regardless of what it says or what it does.

319
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:23,461
It has a subtext or it has an emotion that's attached to it.

320
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:27,464
In this case, Paragon means do the right thing in the right way.

321
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:32,587
Whereas neutral is, you know, it's very kind of bland, usually ends the dialogue.

322
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:36,768
Renegade is do whatever you want, like do what you have to do to get the job done.

323
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:39,549
Friendly and hostile, pretty self-explanatory.

324
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,190
And investigative is always give me more information.

325
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,471
So we have this kind of interface now where someone can just be flicking the stick around

326
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:54,253
without getting into a lot of detail and really get whatever they want out of that interaction.

327
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:56,973
If they're playing as a paragon or if they're kind of mad at the guy,

328
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:02,860
they can switch it to renegade, and they don't really have to read too far into exactly what's

329
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,523
going to happen. They don't have to read too far into that role-playing experience.

330
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:16,673
So obviously this is the first layer of predictability. So it allows us to shape the narrative according

331
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:23,779
to the behavior of the player. Mapped emotional reactions, and reaction is exactly it.

332
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:28,679
Most of the time people who play this way don't really wait for the scene to end.

333
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,042
They're just, as soon as the wheel pops up, they're just making choices.

334
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:35,945
And they're getting rewarded with a very fluid cinematic experience at that point.

335
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:43,992
And one of the things that it does, it also, the direction on the wheel also colors what

336
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:44,913
is going to happen.

337
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:47,315
And we'll get into that on the next slide.

338
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:50,878
But really, it adds a lot of subtext to what's going on.

339
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:52,379
And I'll explain that in the next slide.

340
00:18:54,892 --> 00:19:01,577
So the cognitive player. The cognitive player is the role player. It's the person who wants

341
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:07,062
to really read into what's going on, wants to make a careful choice and be very exacting

342
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:11,985
on what's going on. So we add these things called paraphrases. And paraphrases are really

343
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:18,190
small, I think it's 32 characters that were allowed in a paraphrase. But they're a condensed

344
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,332
version of what is going to be said next.

345
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:26,452
it's really sometimes it can even be described as what's in the player's head right before

346
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:27,372
he says it as well.

347
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:31,275
So when we look at this, we have several kind of choices here.

348
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:36,418
So we're going to be looking at the first one here, second layer of predictability,

349
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:36,698
sure.

350
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,881
We're going to be looking at this first choice here.

351
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:49,186
So when we look at this choice, which is I'll look into this, we understand it to be in

352
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:51,047
the paragon section of the wheel.

353
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:56,604
So when, as you can imagine, that line can be said or interpreted in so many different

354
00:19:56,644 --> 00:20:01,085
ways, but because it's in a paragon section of the wheel, we understand it to be something

355
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:04,126
that, you know, Shepard's going to do the right thing in the right way.

356
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:12,288
So in this case, it gives it a dramatic coloring, which is now we understand it to be something

357
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:16,268
very positive, like, you know, Shepard's going to, he's going to look into this.

358
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:18,329
He's not just doing it flippantly or whatever.

359
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,510
It allows us to really narrow down the interpretation.

360
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:23,713
of what that choice means.

361
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:28,476
And also, if we look at the investigate, abusing suspects,

362
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:32,258
my expectation here is that I'll be getting more information

363
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:35,080
about who's abusing suspects.

364
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,922
So, like I said, there's two layers here,

365
00:20:38,982 --> 00:20:40,163
and that's the big takeaway here.

366
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:42,885
There's the cognitive and there's the behavioral,

367
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:44,446
and they interact with each other

368
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:46,627
to allow us to have predictability

369
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,608
in the role-playing experience.

370
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,550
So, the next one.

371
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:56,400
is choice produces results the player expects.

372
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,562
So this is pretty self-explanatory.

373
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:02,544
If you make a choice, you expect something to happen.

374
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,185
If, as a designer, if I don't meet that expectation,

375
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:07,207
your role-playing experience is now busted.

376
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,809
So we're gonna look at something here.

377
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,111
We're gonna look at a dancer on Ilium,

378
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:15,632
and we're gonna use what we learned

379
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:17,894
on the predictability of the interface here,

380
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:21,676
and we're gonna move around just one little aspect of

381
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:27,698
the narrative design and just see how much of a change that makes to what the player expects.

382
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:36,545
So, as we ship the game, when you talk to this dancer, you can tip her and she'll dance for you

383
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:41,949
and all that. So it's in the paragon position, which is like, okay, well, the subtext can be

384
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:48,134
interpreted as, you know, Shepard's tipping her. He, you know, maybe he liked the dancing and

385
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:48,915
gives her a tip.

386
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:51,871
And really that closes my expectation.

387
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:53,413
Like, you know, it's like, wow, that's cool.

388
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:54,595
And I can move on.

389
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:56,037
I'm not really expecting much more.

390
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,841
So let's take a look at that interaction.

391
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,203
So at that point, the player's like, oh, okay, that's cool.

392
00:22:35,263 --> 00:22:36,785
It's a very light interaction.

393
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:38,026
It just happens in one of the clubs.

394
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:39,548
And, eh, okay, that's fine.

395
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:42,211
But what happens now if I move the tip

396
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:45,054
to the investigate portion of the wheel, right?

397
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:49,439
Now it's kind of like, okay, well, what's next, right?

398
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,701
So let's take a look at that one

399
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,604
with the subtext of there's more information.

400
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:24,486
So as you can see, nothing happened.

401
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:31,792
Like, I made a choice and I got kicked out back to the first choice and nothing really occurred, right?

402
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:38,477
So, really, at this point, the player could feel really cheated with this interaction going,

403
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:42,421
okay, well, do I have to keep tipping her for a plot to open up?

404
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:44,983
Is there something else that I need to do?

405
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:46,584
I'm very confused at this point.

406
00:23:47,163 --> 00:23:49,765
So, really, that would be an error in design,

407
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:51,546
in narrative design right there,

408
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:54,188
where we don't meet the expectation of the player.

409
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,512
So, once again, what if we moved it to the Renegade?

410
00:23:59,052 --> 00:24:01,594
Well, you know, use your imagination.

411
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:03,355
It could be pretty much anything at that point.

412
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:05,837
But, you know, as you can see,

413
00:24:05,897 --> 00:24:07,699
by just changing positions on the wheel,

414
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:12,062
we're adding subtext to just a word that says tip.

415
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:15,605
and we're adding that predictability to the interface

416
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:18,746
and we're trying to meet expectation whenever possible.

417
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:23,147
So the last one, or third I should say,

418
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:24,047
it's one more after this,

419
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,448
is give the player choices they want.

420
00:24:28,788 --> 00:24:31,668
Now, and I often preface this with

421
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:35,009
when they want to make them, which is also very important.

422
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,390
So one of the things that we're gonna be looking at here,

423
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,980
is another video clip.

424
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,562
And this video clip is of an interrogation sequence

425
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:43,142
that happens.

426
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:46,103
Now, Shepard's interrogating somebody.

427
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:48,845
So, you know, if I'm a player

428
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,385
and Shepard's interrogating somebody,

429
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:52,967
I expect Shepard might get rough with him.

430
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,929
So, as a designer, if I don't put that interaction in,

431
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:59,150
I'm not meeting someone's expectations

432
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,251
of what an interrogation should be.

433
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:03,852
So that's exactly what we did with some interrupts

434
00:25:04,513 --> 00:25:05,293
with this interaction.

435
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:07,254
I wanna see my advocate.

436
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:10,517
Your advocate hasn't arrived. We're trying to find him.

437
00:25:11,037 --> 00:25:13,498
I'm not saying a damn word until he's here.

438
00:25:14,218 --> 00:25:15,559
You two are in way over your-

439
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,859
Pay attention, Mr. Kellum.

440
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:20,601
That wasn't a good idea, kid. That is gonna cost you.

441
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,302
Control your temper. We wanted to talk.

442
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:28,724
Sorry, my associate gets a little... excited during interrogations.

443
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:32,925
Hit me again, asshole. Every punch is another credit in my pocket.

444
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:33,445
Works for me.

445
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:45,004
to you when I get out of here. Keep it up, tough guy. You'll leave in a bag. Go to hell.

446
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:54,088
I think Female Shepard rocks, by the way. So, what happened there? So the VO and the

447
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:58,950
situation all kind of supported and focused the player to have this interaction which

448
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,092
allowed them to hit them. So, you know, while he's saying it and you're like, wow, this

449
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:06,913
guy really sucks, like, God, I wish I could hit him. And bang, that thing pops up.

450
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:08,922
And you're like, that's fantastic.

451
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,922
I really feel like I wanted to make that choice,

452
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:11,783
and there it was.

453
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,904
Other kind of examples of that would have been

454
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:19,905
on the game when Tali's dad's kind of dead there.

455
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,145
Spoiler alert.

456
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:26,427
But, and she's crying, and most players are like,

457
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:28,087
wow, you know, I wish I could just hug her.

458
00:26:28,507 --> 00:26:30,568
And then the interrupt comes up, and then you can hug her,

459
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:32,648
and it closes that loop on expectation,

460
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:35,149
and you feel really great and good about that interaction.

461
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,052
So we're gonna look at the opposite now,

462
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:41,933
where, you know, maybe things don't go good,

463
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:43,755
like there's a lot of stuff in this game, right?

464
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:46,678
So we're gonna look at somewhere where choices

465
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:49,100
are kinda weird and kinda didn't work.

466
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,242
So in this one, we're gonna look at a shopkeeper

467
00:26:52,282 --> 00:26:52,823
on the Citadel.

468
00:26:55,065 --> 00:26:55,866
Good day, my friends.

469
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,087
Welcome to the Citadel.

470
00:26:57,987 --> 00:27:00,930
So we're given a choice, which is like a cuse of classism.

471
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,133
And it's just like, okay, well, you know,

472
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:06,375
there was no setup, I have no idea.

473
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:07,802
She just said welcome.

474
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:12,165
So let's just see what happens if I press this button.

475
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:15,067
You know, for a bunch of cheap touristy crap,

476
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:16,268
your prices are pretty high.

477
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:18,329
I am sorry you feel that way.

478
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,450
There are many stores on the Citadel.

479
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,752
Perhaps another would be more in your price range.

480
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:25,954
So you're saying I'm poor?

481
00:27:26,574 --> 00:27:28,275
Just because I'm not as well off as you doesn't mean

482
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:29,496
you can hold yourself above me.

483
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:30,617
What?

484
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,338
No, I.

485
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:34,519
Hey, everyone.

486
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,861
This store discriminates against the poor.

487
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:38,663
Please, calm down.

488
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:42,145
As an apology, I'll let you have my station employee discount.

489
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:43,246
Is that acceptable?

490
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:45,128
Well, alright.

491
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:47,049
But you still have my field.

492
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,951
Please, enjoy your shopping experience.

493
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:50,772
So...

494
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:54,635
And we all really love that interaction.

495
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:56,857
But it actually doesn't really work.

496
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:59,098
Because it's like, okay,

497
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:01,380
accuse of classism, make a choice,

498
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,382
and kind of sit back and watch and...

499
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:08,528
really I don't really have any agency and Shepard's talking and I can't say anything.

500
00:28:08,588 --> 00:28:13,632
So it breaks a lot of the rules of the agreement. And that's really a great example of where

501
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:17,855
things go wrong. And ways we could have fixed it could have been we gave a little interaction

502
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:22,999
with somebody right before we stepped into them, maybe we give her some lines, maybe

503
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,941
some ambient stuff. Like there's things we could have done to repair that situation,

504
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,644
but with times constraints the way they are, some things have to slip.

505
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,059
So really we have these two ideas of choices you want

506
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,260
and results you expect.

507
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,042
And really, it really is a cycle that happens

508
00:28:41,622 --> 00:28:44,963
when we're dealing with this objective narrative.

509
00:28:45,764 --> 00:28:47,405
So when we talk about choices you want

510
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:48,985
and results you expect,

511
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:51,286
and that's always being constantly reinforced

512
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:52,027
as you're playing,

513
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:54,028
we get what you call role-playing flow.

514
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:56,889
And you're really in the zone at this point,

515
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,309
and you're getting what you want,

516
00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:59,730
and you're making choices,

517
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,811
and it's really awesome.

518
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:01,611
But really.

519
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,043
you're not, this is not a real traditional role-playing experience.

520
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:09,086
This is like, you know, like I said, this is not you, this is another character.

521
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:15,653
And, you know, through fantasy fulfillment, through this idea of, you know, keeping people

522
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:21,959
in the zone, we can still maintain a lot of the characteristics of the traditional role-playing

523
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:23,561
experience in this new model.

524
00:29:25,643 --> 00:29:25,783
So,

525
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:32,825
One of the other ones that we got here is it's the player story and this is something that we really take seriously

526
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:40,167
At Bioware and you know what sometimes it backfires on us like you get into a lot of situations

527
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:44,049
When it's like wow you're ready to go to endgame and everything's really awesome

528
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:49,430
And you know you got your love interest, and it's really good, but then you stop by the citadel by fish right

529
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,251
It's just that

530
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:55,797
It's this idea of absurdity that can happen in the narrative.

531
00:29:55,857 --> 00:29:58,518
And if you ask writers and traditional cinematic artists,

532
00:29:58,538 --> 00:29:59,958
they all go kind of crazy and they're like,

533
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:02,378
no, no, no, but drama and this and that and the other.

534
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:04,119
But it's all emergent.

535
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,159
It's the idea that you can do whatever you want

536
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,559
and you're building your story.

537
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:08,520
It's unique to you.

538
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,340
And that's what we're really trying to push with Bioware.

539
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,541
So let's talk about the player story for a second.

540
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,302
And kind of one of the biggest things that we did.

541
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:22,977
with the sequel and what we're planning to do with Mass Effect 3 as well is this idea

542
00:30:23,397 --> 00:30:30,202
of importing your save game. And this is something which was obviously very technical to try

543
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:35,686
to do on a number of levels, but it really illustrates our commitment to making sure

544
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:41,070
that the actual whole story is yours, you know, this is something which is unique to

545
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:45,273
you and you can tell your friends and compare notes and go wow, you know, like

546
00:30:45,575 --> 00:30:50,739
I had this experience and that experience and it really just becomes about you at that

547
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,059
point.

548
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,180
So what is it?

549
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,162
It's your continuing story for Mass Effect.

550
00:30:56,923 --> 00:31:03,127
It allows us to get some plot threads and bring them forward and it really is the uber

551
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:05,248
feature of the Mass Effect universe.

552
00:31:05,788 --> 00:31:07,129
We are story driven games.

553
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:10,512
BioWare is committed to making the best story driven games in the world.

554
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:15,335
So features like this really fall in line with what we are trying to achieve.

555
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:20,075
So how much actually came across?

556
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:23,775
And I see a lot of things in the blogosphere and the rest

557
00:31:24,236 --> 00:31:27,536
about it not being, there's not enough choice,

558
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:28,956
not enough things came across.

559
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:31,617
But in reality, we had 700 different hooks

560
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:35,758
that came across from ME1 to ME2

561
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:38,058
that changed the narrative based on choice

562
00:31:38,078 --> 00:31:39,098
you had from the first one.

563
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,699
And what we found really is it's the small things

564
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,139
that matter.

565
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,480
It's the small things that make it.

566
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:50,838
your story. Obviously with a second title it's really hard to branch the narrative in

567
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:57,722
some gigantic way. You know, scope gets out of control. You know, it's just not practical

568
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:03,865
to do. But what can we do? How can we make this your personal story? So I'm going to

569
00:32:03,885 --> 00:32:08,128
show you some examples of things, just real small things. And if you can imagine the next

570
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,869
thing kind of, you know, multiplied by 700.

571
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,712
you can get an idea of what we've been trying to accomplish with this particular feature.

572
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:24,034
So here's a shot of a really ugly shepherd on ME1.

573
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:26,095
And I don't know if anybody remembers this.

574
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:29,676
This is the big choice, save the council, let the council die, let the council live.

575
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:33,298
So we let the council die.

576
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:38,119
You know, they weren't much use to us and they were kind of off-putting.

577
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:43,384
So we're going to take that choice and we're going to bring it forward to Mass Effect 2

578
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:45,985
and give you some examples of things we did with that.

579
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:57,231
So we have these advertising kiosks on the Citadel and they did allow us to do some really

580
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:03,115
cool things and what we're going to see here is a movie that someone made of your exploits

581
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:04,856
on the Citadel for Mass Effect 1.

582
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:08,894
and there's a lot of things that change about that movie

583
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:11,436
based on your choices and actions on the first one.

584
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:12,917
So we're gonna take a look at The Council is Dead.

585
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:13,997
This began with an attack on a human settlement

586
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:27,307
in the Traverse, but Saren won't stop there.

587
00:33:57,927 --> 00:34:02,532
So, there's a couple of things in there. It's a fall release. It's not a summer blockbuster.

588
00:34:03,873 --> 00:34:10,379
You know, Shepard's actions were there. It was male Shepard in the ad. So, let's see

589
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,963
what it looks like, Council is Alive, but this time with a female player.

590
00:34:21,665 --> 00:34:28,433
settlement in the Traverse. But Saren won't stop there. His guests aren't going to stay on the fringes of Citadel space.

591
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,596
So, Summer Blockbuster, fantastic.

592
00:34:55,536 --> 00:35:00,957
So, what we saw there was really four different permutations

593
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,897
to one interaction that could happen.

594
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:07,118
You know, council's dead, alive, male, female,

595
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,038
and this is a very simple example of something that we do.

596
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,199
Pretty much everywhere in the game

597
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,079
in order to make your story.

598
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:19,840
So, the last topic here, I'm gonna try to get through it.

599
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,780
I know everybody's, we're running a little late here.

600
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,061
So the idea of quick time events, and you know, these things got a real bad rap over

601
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:31,062
the last little while, but we're gonna, we're gonna, I'm gonna show you how we kind of took

602
00:35:31,102 --> 00:35:35,103
the idea of quick time events and integrated it into our philosophy of the agreement.

603
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:40,424
So what are we trying to solve for with, with, with interrupts?

604
00:35:40,524 --> 00:35:43,724
Like, you know, if we're gonna add a feature, we gotta be solving some sort of problem.

605
00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:46,185
So this is what we were trying to solve for.

606
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:51,546
So...

607
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:59,163
okay

608
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:00,004
looking at somebody

609
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:05,986
is getting uncomfortable

610
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:09,908
so

611
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:19,525
we still have problems with temporal distortion.

612
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:22,607
And really it's a side effect of adding interactivity

613
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:23,928
into the cinematic space.

614
00:36:24,629 --> 00:36:26,250
So the idea of quick time events,

615
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,011
or really this idea of adding these interrupts,

616
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:31,793
or these very visceral quick time events

617
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:35,115
that would allow the player to take control of situations,

618
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:37,397
and really allow them to steer the narrative

619
00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:38,478
in a real time way.

620
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,679
So this is our first sort of foray

621
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:45,342
into the real time character interaction side of design.

622
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:50,495
So when we talk about interrupts, we're talking about a couple of things.

623
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:53,616
We have these renegade interrupts.

624
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:55,957
We have paragon interrupts.

625
00:36:57,078 --> 00:36:59,459
But we never have both on the screen at once.

626
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:07,223
And it was one of the design philosophies we had is the fact that, okay, well, making

627
00:37:07,263 --> 00:37:09,984
a choice, and we had to make these very binary.

628
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:14,426
We found that giving people too much choice in this real-time space confused a lot of

629
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:14,746
people.

630
00:37:14,786 --> 00:37:15,607
It was just too much.

631
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:19,447
So really, we just ended up making it one choice or the other.

632
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:22,069
This moment was either renegade or paragon.

633
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:25,311
But there was a lot of interesting things that came out of that.

634
00:37:25,491 --> 00:37:28,113
And one of the interesting things that we found is,

635
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:31,436
if you're playing as a paragon and a renegade moment came up,

636
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:34,618
people were very conflicted about whether they should take it or not.

637
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:37,481
Because, man, if they see a flashing icon, they really want to take it.

638
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:39,222
But...

639
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:41,550
that's not the way I'm playing.

640
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,531
And like, you know, and if you look at some

641
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:45,592
of the biometric readings on this stuff, man,

642
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:48,093
it's just all over the map and they haven't done anything.

643
00:37:48,193 --> 00:37:49,754
Like, you know, it's like they're just sitting there

644
00:37:49,794 --> 00:37:51,435
and they're just really getting conflicted

645
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:53,216
and having some internal conflict.

646
00:37:53,816 --> 00:37:56,337
So not having, not making a choice

647
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,658
was actually very powerful.

648
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,800
So we kind of kept everything very constrained

649
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,061
to that sort of design philosophy.

650
00:38:04,422 --> 00:38:07,803
So let's apply the agreement to this and see how it lands.

651
00:38:08,324 --> 00:38:08,884
So firstly,

652
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:15,415
Interface for choice is predictable. Sure, there it is. It's Renegade, it's Paragon,

653
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:20,198
it's left side, it's right side, it's pretty easy. When it comes up I can train the player

654
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:24,360
to always take that one and, you know. So I would say, yeah, okay, that makes sense.

655
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:30,324
Give the player choices they want. Well, as we saw with the interrogation scene, you know,

656
00:38:30,344 --> 00:38:33,966
it really depends on the writing and iterating with the writers to make sure that they do

657
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:37,288
give you choices they want. It's the player's story.

658
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:41,326
Like I said, sometimes not making an interrupt can be more powerful than taking one.

659
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:44,368
So yeah, you know, I'd say it's a player's story.

660
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:47,250
Choice produces results the player expects.

661
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:53,313
Well, this ended up being a little hard for us because it was a real-time interaction.

662
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:59,917
We didn't have the ability of getting any of the cognitive sort of paraphrasing into

663
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:00,918
this space.

664
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:03,625
What do we do?

665
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:06,307
You know, on the first implementation,

666
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:08,508
it was really a lot of broken role playing,

667
00:39:08,528 --> 00:39:10,710
you know, people accidentally shooting

668
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,791
other people in the face.

669
00:39:11,971 --> 00:39:15,293
It was like, it was all over the place.

670
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,055
So we had to really come up with a different idea

671
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:19,016
of how to implement it.

672
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,858
And what we came up with was this idea of telegraphing,

673
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,300
which is really just a visual paraphrase.

674
00:39:25,221 --> 00:39:26,862
It helps predict the specific action

675
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:27,743
that's going to be made,

676
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:30,165
and lets the cognitive player make a meaningful choice.

677
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:33,924
So I'm going to show you some examples of what I mean by a visual paraphrase.

678
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:39,867
So we have a situation where Shepard talks to a suspect and then Shepard just attacks

679
00:39:39,907 --> 00:39:40,027
him.

680
00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:46,050
So if there was an interrupt there, you would have no idea that, like, yeah, you know it's

681
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,372
going to be a renegade action, but there's so many shades of grey there.

682
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:53,874
If he could slap him, he could shoot him, he could push him, he could do, he could talk

683
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:58,297
mean to him, like, you know, there's just so much there that it really doesn't help

684
00:39:58,337 --> 00:39:59,337
with the predictability.

685
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:05,884
of the role playing. So let's take a look at what that interaction looks like without

686
00:40:05,924 --> 00:40:06,524
a telegraph.

687
00:40:11,566 --> 00:40:14,248
Yeah, yeah, I told you, I ain't saying nothing.

688
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:19,230
Fine, we'll do it the hard way.

689
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:22,571
Oh, God, Dave, help me.

690
00:40:24,312 --> 00:40:28,494
So, you know, in that case it's like, okay, well, I didn't want to push on this poor kid.

691
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:33,599
Like, you know, you have to, like, people have a lot of really strong feelings toward these digital actors.

692
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:34,900
Like, you have to really respect.

693
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,661
So, it's like, wow, you know what, I didn't want to do that, my role playing's broken,

694
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:42,062
Bioware, I hate you, it just goes on and on.

695
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,503
So, we add this idea of a telegraph.

696
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,164
So, this wouldn't work.

697
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:49,904
So, oh, fine, what do we do now?

698
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:55,566
So, we add another shot to the sequence where Shepard starts to crack his knuckles.

699
00:40:56,624 --> 00:41:00,845
and this allows us to say hey you know what this I have now I have a really

700
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:03,426
good idea not only do I know that it's a renegade action

701
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:06,466
he's cracking his knuckles I bet you he's gonna hit him

702
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,667
so let's see what that looks like now

703
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:19,489
but you can't for me you gave another drill instructions for an assassination

704
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:23,150
who's the target? I don't know I didn't ask

705
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,931
because the people I work for

706
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,647
We don't have time for this.

707
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:32,049
Ow.

708
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:32,449
God dang.

709
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:38,073
So the cinematic designer there very cleverly just put a small little knuckle crack animation,

710
00:41:38,393 --> 00:41:42,216
which now made the role playing experience what people expect.

711
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:44,297
So we would consider that very successful.

712
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,742
So in conclusion, I just want to hit a couple of really powerful points here.

713
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:53,964
Interactivity is a very potent narrative device.

714
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,832
Putting activity into cinematics is something we should all be looking at.

715
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:05,396
Really the idea of the linear cinematic has been around for a long, long time and hasn't

716
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:06,236
really changed much.

717
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:10,939
You know, yes, we get into facial mocap and a lot of the crazy stuff to make the fidelity

718
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,463
up, but we're forgetting these are game systems and what they do really well is be interactive.

719
00:42:17,163 --> 00:42:21,105
The other is perspective is powerful, so making sure that when you start writing your game

720
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:22,927
you choose your perspective very wisely.

721
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,930
and discover your agreement and whenever you can stick with it.

722
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,653
Thank you very much.
