1
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:06,402
Yay.

2
00:00:06,422 --> 00:00:10,006
So by way of prequel, I have a lot of questions

3
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:12,909
about what in the hell that title meant.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,294
I'm not actually talking about a specific game

5
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:19,818
or a specific thing today as much as a methodology.

6
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,139
So people are kind of confused.

7
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:28,879
And so I wanted to start, before I get into the meat of the talk, with actually a little bit of a background as to why I chose the title I did.

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,560
And really there were three different reasons.

9
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:33,203
The first was the literal meeting.

10
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:36,386
Information, stats, analytics, all the things, right?

11
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,469
Like, big data is everywhere now.

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,994
So much of what you do every day is being monitored and recorded.

13
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:48,116
and analyzing that data has become a major worldwide business.

14
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:51,677
And as a designer, you need to be able to understand what it all means

15
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:55,539
in order to use that data effectively in your maps and in your games.

16
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,220
It's all relevant, and it's all important.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,281
And the second reason is that it's a play on words

18
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,722
with another talk I'm doing tomorrow called The Importance of Nothing.

19
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,668
One is everything, one is nothing, ha ha, very funny.

20
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,970
And I mention that not to boost attendance

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,071
and get everybody to go, obviously you're all invited,

22
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,992
but because in my talks with the GDC board

23
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:19,434
when I was planning this talk, somehow that's

24
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:22,896
the only talk in the entire main conference that is specifically

25
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:23,996
about level design.

26
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:27,718
And I've got to wonder how in the world that happens.

27
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:32,201
Every one of you could have and should have submitted a talk.

28
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:39,401
I saw a quote yesterday that said that everybody you meet knows something that you don't.

29
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,354
And you have to understand that you are not a button monkey.

30
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:46,977
You do impossible, amazing things every single day.

31
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:49,078
And even a simple topic, like how

32
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,160
to tie your shoes from this TED Talk,

33
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,622
can be important and inspiring.

34
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:56,805
Ideas, no matter how small, are worth sharing.

35
00:01:57,425 --> 00:02:00,028
And that brings me to the third reason behind the title

36
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:00,508
of the talk.

37
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:02,229
And it's that every time I come up here

38
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,872
and I do something like this, my heart is racing.

39
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:07,974
I'm pushing myself to try something new

40
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:08,835
and to do something.

41
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:10,656
I push myself to do better.

42
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:15,901
And I would strongly encourage you all to push yourself to new limits, to start a conversation,

43
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,582
and to share your ideas.

44
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:22,466
You may not realize it, but everything you do, every day, is important.

45
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,852
So, onto the actual talk itself.

46
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:29,833
Information is now everywhere.

47
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:32,375
If you work for a large company or a publisher,

48
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:34,436
somebody's going to come to you at some point

49
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:36,397
with charts and numbers, and you're

50
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,038
going to have to be able to have a conversation with them.

51
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,059
You have to be able to understand them and talk

52
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,521
about them intelligently in order to put them to good use.

53
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:46,822
As a student or an indie dev, you're not exempt from this.

54
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:51,584
All this information is also out on industry websites.

55
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,405
You're going to get feedback from your play tests.

56
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,886
You're going to see reports online.

57
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:56,026
It's all there.

58
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,947
And again, you need to be able to understand it in order

59
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:01,689
to talk about it and to be able to implement it effectively.

60
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:05,330
So my goal today is not to talk about math.

61
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:09,127
I'm not talking about formulas or statistical analysis.

62
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:11,950
I want to talk about actual methodology.

63
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,354
My goal is to show you that you can use data to improve the way you build from the ground

64
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:23,740
up and the process of analytics is really, really similar to the process of level design.

65
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:30,466
When you work on a project, you need to ask yourself honestly and objectively what you're

66
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:30,746
building.

67
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:34,047
why you're building it, and who you're building it for.

68
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:36,588
And those sound like really simple questions,

69
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:39,431
but if you can honestly and objectively answer them,

70
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,552
the answers may surprise you.

71
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:45,985
So, I recently came back from a trip to Disney World,

72
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:49,326
and they have this new program called the Magic Band,

73
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:51,326
which is this little plastic bracelet they give you

74
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:52,627
with an RFID chip in it.

75
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:54,967
And it has your name, your nickname,

76
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:57,308
you get to pick a color, and you can decorate it

77
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:58,348
and do all this stuff with it.

78
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:01,069
And then they mail it to you once you've ordered it,

79
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:02,289
and it comes in this cool box,

80
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:03,589
and it's like this family event.

81
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,509
It's really fun and exciting to open it.

82
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,930
And Disney goes out of their way

83
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,890
to really make this important to you,

84
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,211
because you wear it during your entire trip.

85
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:20,271
When we got off the plane, we put on our wristbands, and then we used this band to get a shuttle to the hotel.

86
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:23,174
At the hotel, we waved the band, and it registered us.

87
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:27,738
We went to our hotel room, we touched the band at the door, the door opens, it was our ticket into the park.

88
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:34,304
They've even gotten rid of their FastPass system, so that now you actually register online for what rides you want to go on,

89
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,747
and then you show up and you walk right on. There's no waiting.

90
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:39,269
It really is kind of magic. It's cool, right?

91
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:44,436
And then after my trip, when I got home, they had sent me a photo journal

92
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:47,298
that said everything I did while I was in the park

93
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,800
and all these cool, amazing things that I did with my family.

94
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:53,103
And this is when it dawned on me.

95
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:55,365
I never asked them to take pictures of me.

96
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:58,247
I didn't even know that they were taking pictures of me.

97
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,270
If they had these pictures, then they knew everything.

98
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:05,733
They knew when I arrived in my hotel room,

99
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:08,515
when I arrived at the park, how long I was there.

100
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:14,112
They know what food I ordered, where I ordered it, when I ordered it, what rides I went on,

101
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:18,196
how long I was in line, and even the exact car that I was in.

102
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:23,361
Can you imagine the power this gives them to customize an experience?

103
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:30,288
Can you imagine the possibilities of what they could do with this kind of information?

104
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,247
and wouldn't you like to magic band one of your games?

105
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:37,969
How much would your work improve if you could better predict

106
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:39,889
what your players were going to do

107
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,730
or what they were going to enjoy?

108
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,331
Pardon me.

109
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:51,015
So, not surprisingly, this is exactly

110
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,535
what a lot of companies are doing.

111
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:58,118
Back in 2009, Google's chief economist,

112
00:05:58,938 --> 00:05:59,819
that's an awesome title,

113
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:04,907
I said that the sexiest job in the next 10 years

114
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,549
was going to be statisticians.

115
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,234
And sure enough, analytics has become the driving force

116
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:13,618
behind mobile, free-to-play, and all these different game

117
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:14,099
systems.

118
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,582
And all of the effects of that are bleeding over

119
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,284
into every aspect of game design.

120
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,231
These techniques are often considered to be dirty,

121
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:25,653
because they force you into these compulsion loops,

122
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:27,054
or trying to get you to spend money.

123
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,716
But they don't have to be that way.

124
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,578
Used properly and generously, these techniques

125
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:33,440
can actually be beneficial.

126
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,022
Our industry has grown, and we've changed,

127
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:39,424
and we've gone beyond the point where just your gut feeling,

128
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,447
that isn't enough to predict whether or not

129
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,208
your game is going to be successful anymore.

130
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,305
And it's not just about money.

131
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:51,107
It's about making something that will impress, inspire,

132
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,708
and really impact people's lives.

133
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,150
And to me, this is the heart of level design.

134
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,031
You create the part of the game that faces out to the player,

135
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,892
the part that gives them that touch point

136
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:08,633
to interact with whatever crazy ideas and concepts

137
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:10,074
your team has come up with.

138
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:15,908
everything you do is important. So I started to dabble in analytics and I kind of

139
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:20,911
stumbled in blindly and I thought that if I had enough information, if I could just get all

140
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:25,333
these numbers and everything in front of me, I could make sense of them. But I actually

141
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:32,477
ended up overwhelmed and it was all way, way more difficult than it appeared. So a little

142
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:38,720
bit of audience participation. How many of you have ever heard of the company Trafodata?

143
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:42,357
I'm actually impressed we have someone.

144
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:45,799
So Trafidata was a small company from Seattle, Washington

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,583
formed in 1972 to analyze traffic patterns.

146
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:53,606
Founding members Paul Allen and Bill Gates

147
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:57,209
would go on to combine their passion for microprocessors

148
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,991
and software to grow their partnership

149
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:01,933
into a slightly larger company that I'm

150
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:03,194
sure you've heard of today.

151
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,157
Is anyone familiar with the Homebrew Computer Club?

152
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:11,442
probably a few more, yeah. So this was Gordon French, invited

153
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:14,463
some of his friends over to his house in 1975, they just decided

154
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:17,184
to geek out and talk about computers for a bit. But the

155
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:21,625
club grew, attracted people from all over Silicon Valley, until

156
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:26,627
one day, two of its members, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs,

157
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,668
put their heads together and decided to build something.

158
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:34,550
Needless to say, their creation, the Apple computer, impressed

159
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,851
the club and a few other billion people around the world.

160
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,550
And I'll be impressed if anyone knows who this is.

161
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:45,712
No hands, awesome.

162
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:48,892
Small boy, 1982 in Potomac, Maryland,

163
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:51,273
filled his parents' basement with a bunch of computers

164
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:52,914
and set out to make something.

165
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,114
He tried and tried and tried.

166
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,875
10 years later, he released his first shareware game

167
00:08:58,095 --> 00:08:58,515
called ZZT.

168
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,212
This is Tim Sweeney, now a young man.

169
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:05,215
He didn't want people to know that he was just working out

170
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:06,196
of his parents' basement.

171
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,658
So he came up with two really big words

172
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:12,402
and crammed them together to make his company Epic MegaGames.

173
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:16,866
As the company grew, it had a few successes along the way.

174
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,328
And since, we have been fortunate enough

175
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,190
to grow into an international business.

176
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:24,413
So why am I talking about all this?

177
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:30,456
How could you have looked at these teams and determined beforehand if they would have been a success?

178
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,977
If you could have put a magic band on their lives,

179
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:37,078
what patterns could you have found and recreated to ensure your own success?

180
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,840
If only it were that simple, we'd all be doing it.

181
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,581
There is no formula that can predict success.

182
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,722
Analytics aren't magic bands.

183
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:47,782
They simply don't work that way.

184
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:52,084
It's not like these teams just sprouted out of Zeus's head, emerging as gods.

185
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:57,283
They each had their share of both success and failure along the way.

186
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:02,366
What set them apart was that they were driven by their passion to learn from those mistakes

187
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,547
and try again.

188
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:07,010
It's a great lesson, something we should all do in our lives,

189
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,490
for sure.

190
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:10,412
It's also a big part of iterative design, which

191
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:13,134
we've talked about a lot today, and coincidentally,

192
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,695
is the very foundation for analytics.

193
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,758
You make a hypothesis, you gather data, and then you test.

194
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:22,359
And through an understanding of the failures

195
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:25,681
of that hypothesis, you form a new one, you retest,

196
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:29,283
and ideally, improve your outcome every time you cycle.

197
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,757
The goal of analytics is what's called improving your probability space over time.

198
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:39,479
If it were simple as looking at a bunch of numbers and reading answers,

199
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,220
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

200
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,981
So, here is a great example.

201
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:47,243
This chart shows a list of the top 25 games of 2011.

202
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,464
It's like 18 months ago.

203
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,906
The games with the blue popularity were all very successful games.

204
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,066
They were good, they were profitable.

205
00:10:56,715 --> 00:11:00,555
the games with green in their popularity were mega hits.

206
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:04,376
They were profitable on a scale 10 to 100 times that

207
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:05,736
of the blue games.

208
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:08,517
So the question then is,

209
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:10,897
what separates the blue from the green?

210
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,558
How do you get your game to cross over

211
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,718
from a blue game to a green game?

212
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:17,859
The simple assumption is that the green games

213
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,139
are better games.

214
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:20,659
And if that's true,

215
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,220
their review scores should reflect that, right?

216
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,092
Not really, it's kind of all over the board.

217
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:28,674
It's not to say that quality isn't important.

218
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:30,855
These were all pretty well-reviewed games,

219
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:31,996
they were all fun games,

220
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:35,098
but beyond a base threshold of acceptable quality,

221
00:11:35,718 --> 00:11:38,580
score becomes a somewhat meaningless statistic.

222
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:42,722
And remember, I said it's not always just about money.

223
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,924
You need to create a meaningful experience for your players.

224
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:48,126
So rather than review score,

225
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:52,048
look at how much time people spent playing these games.

226
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:55,678
That's a little bit stronger of a correlation.

227
00:11:56,819 --> 00:12:00,243
So while baseline quality is obviously important,

228
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,728
a more significant factor of success

229
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:08,030
might be how to keep your players engaged.

230
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,312
Again, this doesn't give you any answers.

231
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:11,954
It just leads to the next question

232
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:13,716
was, how do you accomplish that?

233
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:19,342
And to be perfectly clear, I don't expect you to take anything away from the results of this particular study.

234
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:24,106
I'm simply trying to show you that my initial assumptions,

235
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:27,909
what I would actually say are pretty common assumptions, were incorrect.

236
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,314
And as I drilled down deeper, I didn't necessarily find any answers, only more questions.

237
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:37,257
I had to cycle and improve my probability space over time.

238
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:39,919
Assumptions just weren't enough.

239
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:44,235
But just having mountains of data isn't useful.

240
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,356
You need to actually do something with it, right?

241
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:48,897
So really, we're looking at a three-step process here.

242
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:51,057
And each step is a little bit more complicated

243
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:51,677
than it seems.

244
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,119
The first step is gathering and recording data.

245
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,359
This is the information is everywhere thing

246
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,460
that I talked about before.

247
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:03,634
The second step is organizing and reading that data.

248
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:04,874
And that's metrics.

249
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:06,555
That's how you visualize your data.

250
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:10,258
You create measurements or comparisons of that data

251
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:11,839
that you've already collected.

252
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,080
And then finally, you analyze.

253
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,642
And this is where you come into the picture as a designer.

254
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:21,084
You need to understand how to interpret all this information

255
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:23,826
and then combine it with your instincts

256
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,527
and your design insights.

257
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:30,947
data, metrics, analytics, it might seem like annoying semantics, but it's really important to

258
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,573
understand each of the terms and their differences in order to apply them correctly. And data is

259
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:43,079
really important because it's kind of the building block for all of these different pieces. And as I

260
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:49,365
mentioned, data is just information. Which is great as long as you really understand that

261
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:50,926
that's all that it is.

262
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,721
So let's start with this study.

263
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:56,844
It's a poll to show who plays video games.

264
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:58,065
Simple question.

265
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,667
But the results of this were actually

266
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:01,708
pretty surprising to me.

267
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,650
Because it skewed a lot older than I thought it would,

268
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:08,253
with the largest group being college-aged,

269
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,296
and it was more female gamers than male.

270
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:15,719
Now, everyone knows that gamers are like geeky teenage boys,

271
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:15,979
right?

272
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,202
Except that this data says otherwise.

273
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:21,604
So take one last look at that chart.

274
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:26,866
And then let's look at the four most popular games

275
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:27,946
in the world today.

276
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:31,608
Can you guess which games they are based just

277
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:32,789
off the demographics?

278
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,652
This one is possibly, probably, is the most popular game

279
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:39,492
in the world right now.

280
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,494
Note that the bulk of the players

281
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:43,074
are women over 35 years old.

282
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,075
Anyone have a guess as to what it might be?

283
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:48,237
You're all on target.

284
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:49,078
You're all on target.

285
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:51,299
All right, number two.

286
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:58,132
Massively male audience, bulk of whom is around 18 years old. We're probably looking at a shooter game. Any thoughts?

287
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:05,098
And note, note,

288
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:10,903
bulk of the users are 18 years old and older. This is not necessarily a kids game.

289
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,526
All right, so this one massively male audience,

290
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,629
slightly older than Minecraft. Any thoughts on what this one might be?

291
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,221
Call of Duty, heard League of Legends, no.

292
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,562
This is World of Warcraft.

293
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:29,863
And again, not as female as most people

294
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,104
would generally assume.

295
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:33,365
All right, last one before we move on.

296
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:35,926
Massively male audience, Scream Shooter, what is it?

297
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:39,507
Nothing, nobody has a guess.

298
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:40,968
I heard one person say Call of Duty,

299
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:42,129
so I'll give it away.

300
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,849
It is not, it is League of Legends.

301
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,431
None of these games are shooters.

302
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:48,051
The most popular games in the world

303
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,772
are shooters played by teenage boys, right?

304
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:51,205
Not at all.

305
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:53,346
And then take another look.

306
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,168
Not a single one of those matches up

307
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,850
with the general data of who plays games.

308
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,852
If you had used that data to inform whatever

309
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:05,214
it was you were building, you would have been way off base.

310
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:08,397
And here's where I melt your brain even a little bit more.

311
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,459
Not a single one of those charts is accurate.

312
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:12,760
They're all wrong.

313
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,761
Because it's never that simple, right?

314
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:18,463
All of this data is self-reported, which skews it.

315
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:22,536
And it all comes from Facebook, which biases the source.

316
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:27,459
And I did this to show you that data by itself is meaningless.

317
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,440
It's just information.

318
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,161
It has to be processed, and it has to be interpreted.

319
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:35,722
And it all comes down to how you decide to look at it.

320
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,044
So data is objective, and it's factual.

321
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,566
But its tangible connection to the real world

322
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,747
is exactly what makes it interesting and easy

323
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:45,467
to misinterpret.

324
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:49,993
Every map that you create is just a collection of data points.

325
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,418
But how many times have you heard about driving the narrative of your game

326
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:56,301
or using it as a means of environmental storytelling?

327
00:16:57,122 --> 00:17:00,687
Intentionally or otherwise, every map tells a story.

328
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:05,795
This is a map of a neighborhood in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I live.

329
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:13,417
It's called Boylan Heights, from a cartographer named Dennis Wood, and he uses datasets to

330
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:14,437
tell stories.

331
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:19,158
He says that maps exhibit and promote a political orientation.

332
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:22,159
They're about something, and they have an agenda.

333
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,425
As an example, here's another one of his maps

334
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:27,005
overlaid on top of the original.

335
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:30,226
And rather than houses, this one shows the distribution

336
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:32,407
of power lines in that same neighborhood.

337
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:33,867
OK.

338
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:37,068
And now here's a third one that shows

339
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:40,029
the trees in his neighborhood.

340
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,391
And did that switch?

341
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:46,171
It did.

342
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:47,251
Why didn't it switch here?

343
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:51,893
There we go.

344
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:57,592
All right, so individually, each of these maps is just aggregated data.

345
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:01,595
But viewed together, they start to establish a narrative.

346
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:05,898
It talks about urban sprawl, expansion, and encroachment.

347
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,582
Again, maybe that's how you might interpret that narrative,

348
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,944
and probably that's what he wants you to build as a narrative.

349
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:18,550
But the reality is you can't say for sure, because data is just information.

350
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,830
There are no answers there.

351
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,631
Wood hasn't written anything.

352
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:23,753
He hasn't made any statements.

353
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:27,755
But he's used raw data to make a social commentary.

354
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:32,998
So the lesson to remember here is that everything that you do in your map, even the very act

355
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:36,320
of you being the one who creates it, tells a story.

356
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,282
And that's especially true when it's viewed in context.

357
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,105
Now some companies like Google and Valve rely very heavily on data to drive their decision-making process.

358
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:53,169
At their recent Steam Developers Days, they discussed how, like many modern companies,

359
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:56,632
they monitor everything that goes through the system, everything that goes across Steam.

360
00:18:57,072 --> 00:19:03,898
But Valve distinguishes themselves by making every bit of that data available to each and every one of their employees.

361
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:11,503
And so anybody who wants to start a conversation or make an argument is actually encouraged to reference that data in support of their point,

362
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:16,047
because an informed decision carries much more weight than a straight opinion.

363
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:21,711
When a decision is made using data, there's less chance for a random outcome.

364
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:25,954
But remember that data is only information out of context.

365
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,727
So data should inform your decision-making process.

366
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:31,148
It's the middle of the equation.

367
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:36,553
But since it's only information, data alone should never make a decision for you.

368
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,537
And this is where things get tricky, because you see data being used in the context of

369
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,458
a social science.

370
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:47,062
And in the social sciences, there are no hard and correct answers.

371
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:50,959
So whenever you see data being presented in any visual format,

372
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,920
any chart, any graph, anything like that,

373
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,101
understand that you're seeing it through someone else's filter,

374
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,362
often with their bias.

375
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,883
This isn't something that people do maliciously or even

376
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:01,523
intentionally.

377
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:03,123
It's just human nature.

378
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:06,025
Data can always tell you a story,

379
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:09,446
but only if you try to interpret what that story is.

380
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:14,528
So like many things in life, you have

381
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:16,208
to start by asking questions.

382
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,758
And this is where metrics come into play.

383
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,460
And they can be absolutely useful,

384
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,882
but you have to embrace and understand

385
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,544
that they too are limited.

386
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:29,670
Technically speaking, metrics is distance in metric space.

387
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,912
It's just a measurement.

388
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,615
All these charts and graphs can be very pretty

389
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:35,797
and very interesting to look at.

390
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,768
but they don't suggest change.

391
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:42,389
They compare data or measure aggregates of data

392
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:43,749
across different points.

393
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,610
But it's just information for you to interpret.

394
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,271
You need to provide that context.

395
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,772
You need to use your design skills.

396
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,533
And in order to get to the right answers,

397
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,653
you need to ask the right questions.

398
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:01,083
The level design team at Epic uses metrics in various ways.

399
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:03,585
This is one example from Gears of War Judgment

400
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:07,187
that shows how the game's, a couple of different levels,

401
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:09,189
how their frame rate changed over time.

402
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:11,991
And it's cool to see, you can see the line trends upward,

403
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:13,371
which is exactly what you want, right?

404
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:16,293
But once you have this kind of information,

405
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:18,275
you really need to start questioning it.

406
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:22,077
Does this data indicate that the map is getting better?

407
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:24,679
Put the map aside for a moment.

408
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:27,648
Did someone change something in the rendering pipeline?

409
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:29,489
Has pathfinding been fixed?

410
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:32,330
Have they fixed that quirky bug with the particle system?

411
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,191
If you answer yes to any one of those questions,

412
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:37,271
then your game and your level's frame rate

413
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:41,793
is going to get up, even if the level itself is still

414
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:43,953
just a huge, unpolished mess.

415
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:48,075
These charts track change, but they don't

416
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:50,115
say what caused that change.

417
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:55,858
In order to figure out what was going on here, we had to dig and find more answers.

418
00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:03,322
Now here's another one that shows, uh, tracks deltas in population in our online servers.

419
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:05,863
And the different colors represent different game types.

420
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:11,326
And you can see here that there is a spike where people just suddenly stopped playing Execution,

421
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:15,248
which was the number one game type, and then started playing a bunch of other stuff.

422
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:16,669
So what happened?

423
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:19,945
Well, you can infer that that change was due to a server

424
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:20,345
reboot.

425
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:24,006
And you might even look, and the time stamp on that

426
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:27,187
might coincide with that change in population.

427
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:28,467
But it's not enough.

428
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:30,308
You have to question even deeper,

429
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,189
because there's so many other factors that could

430
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,469
influence a change like this.

431
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:35,970
What day of the week are we talking about?

432
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,350
Was it a weekend?

433
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,511
Or were people going off to school?

434
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,091
Was it a holiday?

435
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:43,532
Was there some major news event in the world

436
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,593
that pulled people away from gaming for a little bit?

437
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:47,355
Who knows, at the end of the day,

438
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,417
I have no idea what caused that spike.

439
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:50,717
It just happened.

440
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,639
It was just a random chart I just pulled off of our servers.

441
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,341
I can't explain it, because this chart by itself

442
00:22:57,622 --> 00:22:58,902
isn't enough information.

443
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:03,305
In all of these cases, metrics are your starting point.

444
00:23:03,785 --> 00:23:05,286
If you want to dive deeper, you need

445
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:07,968
to account for those social science aspects of design.

446
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:09,989
Get into the mind of your players

447
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:13,251
and understand the reasons behind their actions.

448
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:18,157
So a few years ago I did a talk about a map called Trenches.

449
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,358
Is anybody there for that?

450
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:22,001
Yeah, a couple people.

451
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:26,987
Heatmap showed that players were only using one side of the map,

452
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:29,009
and the other side was being completely ignored.

453
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:34,460
We figured this was some artifact of player preference or player behavior,

454
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:38,826
and so we just kind of pushed things around and didn't really deal with it.

455
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:42,911
And then during the beta, this map was a complete and utter failure.

456
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:45,414
People stopped playing the map almost entirely.

457
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:48,825
And this was entirely our fault.

458
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:52,426
We forgot that heat maps are just measurements.

459
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:55,368
At no point did they imply why people

460
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:57,068
were in those specific locations.

461
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,830
They simply measured how many people were there

462
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,110
and where they were.

463
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,851
And since it did so poorly.

464
00:24:04,163 --> 00:24:06,285
We decided to look at that map again after the beta,

465
00:24:06,685 --> 00:24:08,587
and this time we went in objectively.

466
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:12,250
And sure enough, we discovered that we had trapped players

467
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,071
in their spawns.

468
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:15,392
This was not player preference.

469
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:18,755
When we fixed that problem, the real problem,

470
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:22,218
the map went on to become one of our most successful maps ever.

471
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:29,348
Now, this is exactly why you need to ask questions that explain your metrics.

472
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,749
You need to stay honest and objective.

473
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,791
Sometimes you fall in love with a design because it looks cool,

474
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:37,112
or because, I mean, quite frankly, you built it, right?

475
00:24:37,212 --> 00:24:38,052
So it has to be good.

476
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:41,674
When in reality, it may not be that great of a design.

477
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:45,255
And when that happens, you run the risk of only seeing

478
00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:47,616
the data that supports your argument.

479
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:52,868
This is one of the reasons that iteration and communication is so important.

480
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,711
You need to establish your hypothesis, test, measure, and repeat.

481
00:24:58,152 --> 00:24:59,273
Question everything.

482
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,220
You even need to question your questions.

483
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,841
And what I mean by that is, ask yourself

484
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:07,281
why you want to know to begin with.

485
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:10,562
Are you expecting a specific answer when you ask a question?

486
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:13,382
If you are, then you have to be especially careful

487
00:25:13,682 --> 00:25:16,503
not to bias that question by leading the results

488
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,363
to your expected answer.

489
00:25:19,903 --> 00:25:21,323
And this is where we failed in trenches.

490
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:24,984
We used heat maps to justify our design decisions

491
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,604
rather than looking at it as just information

492
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:28,905
leading to a solution.

493
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:34,867
And then, once you do have answers, it's pretty safe to start questioning those as well.

494
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:38,769
Is that answer an actionable item?

495
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,352
Remember, your curiosity here isn't what you're important.

496
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:43,632
That's not why you're doing this.

497
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:46,895
Your goal should always be meaningful change.

498
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:51,609
And since metrics don't provide you with answers,

499
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,131
but what does make them special

500
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:56,813
is that they help you identify the important questions.

501
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:59,716
And questions are what force you to be objective,

502
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,038
to think outside the box and look at your work

503
00:26:02,258 --> 00:26:03,699
from a unique perspective.

504
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:07,342
And the why is the most important thing you can ask.

505
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:09,924
Why was the frame rate low in those charts?

506
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:12,125
Why did the population numbers fall?

507
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:15,068
Why were players on only one side of the map?

508
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:18,737
And the most important why of all, and I can't stress this enough,

509
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,702
is to ask yourself, why do you want to know the answer?

510
00:26:24,804 --> 00:26:27,327
So in the trenches map, we failed to ask why.

511
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,217
We were looking for answers that justified our assumptions

512
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:34,338
without even really understanding what the hell it

513
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:35,339
was we were looking for.

514
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:38,520
But we did learn a valuable lesson.

515
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,462
And when a similar problem popped up in a different map,

516
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:43,062
we handled it quite differently.

517
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:47,164
This is Academy, which was from a later Gears DLC.

518
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,666
And it had this round area in the middle of the map

519
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:53,027
that was elevated with very tight and controllable

520
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,429
entrances, and lots of cover leading up to those entrances.

521
00:26:57,877 --> 00:27:01,337
And of course, Heatmap showed an incredible accumulation

522
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:04,298
of movement and death all in this one spot,

523
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:06,299
while the rest of the map was being ignored.

524
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,739
Sound familiar?

525
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,060
So we wanted to figure out why.

526
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,640
We had some ideas, but rather than just assuming

527
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,681
we knew what the problem was,

528
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:17,861
we approached it objectively.

529
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:20,962
We looked at how players were dying, not just where,

530
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:22,882
where they were in cover,

531
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,043
and why they were there to begin with.

532
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:30,592
And what we were able to determine was that teams would charge into this area to get the boom shot,

533
00:27:30,872 --> 00:27:33,733
which is arguably the most powerful weapon in any Gears game.

534
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:35,754
And then they would just camp there.

535
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:38,675
And as they camp there, more and more people would run up there,

536
00:27:39,035 --> 00:27:42,777
and since they had the most powerful weapon in the game, they would kill them over and over and over.

537
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:45,878
So why would you ever leave, right? You had the power spot in the map.

538
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:51,780
So, to fix it, we moved the boom shot to the far opposite end of the map.

539
00:27:52,735 --> 00:27:53,916
And then we continued to test.

540
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:56,377
And we saw a dramatic shift in player movement

541
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:57,998
away from this one area.

542
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,020
The new results fell much more in line

543
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,081
with what we expected and hoped to see.

544
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:06,643
We were able to say, hey, this was a fixed problem,

545
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,284
and it was high fives all around.

546
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:13,127
Until people started dying in the spot

547
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:14,708
where we moved the boom shot to.

548
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:17,569
All of this data was telling us was

549
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:20,591
that everywhere we put the boom shot, people were going to die.

550
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:25,331
And this is exactly where our previous lesson came into play.

551
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:27,212
Question everything.

552
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:28,432
Ask why.

553
00:28:29,232 --> 00:28:32,033
Why were players dying in this spot?

554
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:34,413
Remember, once you have your hypothesis,

555
00:28:34,453 --> 00:28:36,774
you need to test it, find the failures,

556
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:39,314
and then formulate a new hypothesis

557
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:41,055
based on the current results.

558
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:43,695
Just because the answer to the previous why

559
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:45,715
was people were dying because of the boom shot,

560
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:48,456
that didn't mean it was the same answer

561
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:50,917
to this question right now.

562
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:55,584
So we set all that boomshot data aside and we started from scratch.

563
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:59,669
And here's a screenshot of that same area from a slightly different camera angle.

564
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,914
And it turns out that people were abusing their over-the-camera shoulder

565
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:06,437
and had a line-of-sight advantage right by that arrow.

566
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:06,497
So...

567
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:12,064
we didn't know at first why that happened.

568
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:13,784
So we went back and looked,

569
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:15,745
and all of our previous testing had been done

570
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:17,945
when the map was an undecorated shell.

571
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,166
And if you watch right by where the arrow is,

572
00:29:20,446 --> 00:29:22,387
you'll see that the walls in that version

573
00:29:22,547 --> 00:29:23,707
were significantly higher.

574
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,848
And so when the map was decorated,

575
00:29:26,168 --> 00:29:28,068
and those walls were inadvertently lowered,

576
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:31,669
it opened up a line of sight that didn't previously exist.

577
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,990
So we simply just filled that space back in.

578
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,831
The more we tested,

579
00:29:37,747 --> 00:29:45,213
Sure enough, everything fell into line, heat maps started to show a nice distribution of deaths all across the map, and everything was golden.

580
00:29:47,174 --> 00:29:52,238
We knew, based off of what we had in trenches, that we had to look at these as two separate problems.

581
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:56,882
There was a correlation to the boomshot moving, but there was no causation.

582
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:03,046
You have to resist the urge to be satisfied with the status quo, and always remember to question everything.

583
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,958
Alright, so data is information, metrics are measurements, comparisons of that information,

584
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,888
analytics, and this is the meat of the thing, are used to interpret that information.

585
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:19,080
And analytics and metrics are very often confused,

586
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,462
but they have some very, very distinct differences.

587
00:30:22,663 --> 00:30:24,705
Metrics is math-based.

588
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:27,407
It's hard science versus analytics,

589
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:29,788
which, and this is a little bit controversial to some people,

590
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:33,151
is a social science that doesn't necessarily

591
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,332
imply a real, true answer.

592
00:30:35,372 --> 00:30:38,234
It's something that you have to interpret or infer

593
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:40,776
into the future versus metrics, which

594
00:30:40,836 --> 00:30:42,017
is a measurement of past data.

595
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:45,216
Really, analytics has two functions.

596
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:49,418
First, you use data analysis to gain insight.

597
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:53,600
And the goal there is to separate fact from opinion.

598
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,440
Everyone has opinions.

599
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,761
And so it can be impossible to ever decide,

600
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:00,602
when you have two conflicting opinions, which one is right.

601
00:31:01,283 --> 00:31:02,823
And opinions lead to arguments.

602
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:05,525
And that can create unresolvable conflict.

603
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:12,138
So in order to prevent yourself from just aimlessly spinning on and on forever,

604
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:16,900
you need to look at the facts and see how they relate to the team's common goal.

605
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,342
It makes sense. If you don't have a finish line, you're never going to get there.

606
00:31:23,062 --> 00:31:27,144
If you don't have a starting point and a finish line, then there's nothing to measure.

607
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,365
So before you start anything...

608
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:33,623
outline your goals, and define your success state.

609
00:31:34,403 --> 00:31:36,864
The purpose of analytics isn't just to impress people

610
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:39,125
with pretty charts and mountains of numbers.

611
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:42,326
You need to separate facts from opinions

612
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:45,948
and then use those facts to help you understand

613
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:47,969
what's going on in your maps.

614
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:50,850
And this is the second major function of analytics,

615
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,691
using those facts to guide decision making.

616
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:56,678
If your goals are outlined before you start,

617
00:31:57,178 --> 00:32:00,642
then they can be used to inform your process rather than

618
00:32:00,662 --> 00:32:03,925
the result. This makes you proactive rather than

619
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:04,605
reactionary.

620
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:07,328
Go back to the beginning of my talk, and what were the

621
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:09,410
three things I wanted to talk about?

622
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,813
Ask what you're building, why you're building it, and who

623
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:16,736
you're building it for. Those answers define your goals.

624
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:18,318
And if you stick to them,

625
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:20,907
you can tell when change in your map

626
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:23,908
is actually going to be something meaningful

627
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:25,829
rather than just decorative.

628
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,092
Outlining your goals helps keep you focused.

629
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:32,293
There's less chance you'll be distracted

630
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:34,434
by misleading information.

631
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,195
You have to be especially careful

632
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:37,776
of really good presentations

633
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:40,417
because visualization can be very important,

634
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:43,939
but remember those maps of the Boylan Heights neighborhood?

635
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,641
The visualization didn't necessarily explain anything at all.

636
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,592
Analytics is all about patterns, and our brains love patterns.

637
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:56,295
We have this kind of inherent need to explain patterns.

638
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,737
So you see a pie chart, and your brain veers off to thoughts,

639
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:02,599
Pac-Man, and you end up chasing ghosts.

640
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,323
Charts can mislead you to believe that false information is real,

641
00:33:07,643 --> 00:33:10,004
like seeing deaths due to boomshot in Academy,

642
00:33:10,285 --> 00:33:13,106
when really, there is no deaths due to boomshot in Academy.

643
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:16,942
Or think about those player charts that I showed you in the very beginning of the talk,

644
00:33:17,302 --> 00:33:22,187
and how if you had used them to inform your design process, you would have been so far off base.

645
00:33:22,888 --> 00:33:26,491
This is why some people call data visualization a halfway house.

646
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:31,616
It's that middle point, it's the stopping point from data to decision.

647
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:34,619
And remember my Steam slide, there it is right in the middle.

648
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:39,583
It isn't answers, it helps, analytics help guide you toward a decision.

649
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:44,382
All right, and this is exactly where you come into the picture designer.

650
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:47,124
Take all those pretty charts and all that information

651
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:51,027
and fold it into your knowledge and your design sensibilities.

652
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:53,910
By combining your instincts with data,

653
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,873
you go beyond functional solutions into something that can become

654
00:33:58,294 --> 00:34:03,118
emotionally resonant, that enables your players to make those connections

655
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:06,060
with your game, with your level, and with your work.

656
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,261
This is how you ask or how you answer what, why, and who.

657
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:14,182
And this is a very specific skill set

658
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:16,623
that distinguishes a designer on the team

659
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:19,324
from everybody else who contributes to design

660
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,004
by offering their opinions.

661
00:34:22,865 --> 00:34:25,946
Everyone has opinions and ideas, but not everyone

662
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:30,067
understands the importance of how and when to actually make

663
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,988
changes and how to make that change meaningful.

664
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:36,068
Does anyone use Spotify or Pandora?

665
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:39,818
Cool. So most of you know what they are.

666
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,519
They use algorithms to predict what music you might like to listen to

667
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,140
based off your basic listening patterns.

668
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,701
And for the most part, they are pretty accurate.

669
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:50,122
But to make a playlist that's really good,

670
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:52,463
one that I really care about,

671
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,485
still requires human input into the process.

672
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:59,967
You have to go through and thumb up and thumb down those songs

673
00:35:00,327 --> 00:35:03,848
to get beyond just a list of computer-generated suggestions.

674
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,467
Data only gets them halfway there.

675
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:08,588
It still requires that human input

676
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:11,010
to get from predictive to meaningful.

677
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:17,413
Now, Netflix has a similar system on television and movies,

678
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:19,193
but they've taken it one step further.

679
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:22,435
Again, data can't tell them how to make a TV show,

680
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:25,196
but they think it can tell them what they should be making.

681
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,577
When they created House of Cards,

682
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:30,218
they weren't just guessing at what people wanted,

683
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,560
they were analyzing patterns in their database.

684
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:34,768
So what do those patterns reveal?

685
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,771
The Perry Mason effect.

686
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:42,334
What would you guess is the most popular show

687
00:35:42,394 --> 00:35:43,695
streaming across Netflix?

688
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:46,137
Perry Mason.

689
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:50,260
Who are the most popular actors on everything viewed on Netflix?

690
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:52,822
The actors from Perry Mason.

691
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:54,784
OK, let's get abstract.

692
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:57,226
If you look at just the themes of the shows

693
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:59,708
across all the shows that are being streamed on Netflix,

694
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:01,989
what comes up as the top list of themes?

695
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:06,585
those viewed in Perry Mason. All the data that they had

696
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:11,107
suggested that they should be remaking Perry Mason. So why

697
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:15,708
did they make House of Cards? As an individual data point,

698
00:36:16,148 --> 00:36:19,950
Perry Mason is meaningless. Netflix calls this a ghost in

699
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,971
the machine. It's a byproduct of complexity. In slightly more

700
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,992
technical terms, as you increase the number of variables that

701
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:30,433
you're measuring, you increase the odds of a false positive

702
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:30,813
result.

703
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:36,217
In any system, there's always the chance that some of your results will come back as being

704
00:36:36,317 --> 00:36:40,538
statistically significant, even if they're totally fake or wrong.

705
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:47,460
Someone at some point is always going to camp at that boom shot location in Academy.

706
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,761
That's just human nature.

707
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,802
And anyone could suggest a change to make them move.

708
00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:56,563
But it's the designer's job to question why they were camping there.

709
00:36:57,363 --> 00:36:59,204
Why did Perry Mason show up?

710
00:37:01,362 --> 00:37:05,023
because that was a playlist generated by algorithm,

711
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:06,804
with no one to thumb it up or down.

712
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:10,426
I can look at any Call of Duty map or any popular map

713
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:13,707
from any game, deconstruct the technical aspects of it,

714
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,769
go through everything in there, and then recreate it.

715
00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:20,131
But is my new version going to be a success?

716
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:22,091
Is it going to be emotionally resonant?

717
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:24,773
Or is it just going to be a copycat?

718
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,018
If you're looking at a bunch of data,

719
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:29,580
then probably so is everyone else.

720
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,502
If you use that data, they're going to as well,

721
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:33,803
and you're probably going to end up

722
00:37:33,843 --> 00:37:34,984
with really similar results.

723
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:37,125
You're going to make a copycat.

724
00:37:37,846 --> 00:37:40,168
You're going to go and you're going to make Perry Mason.

725
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:43,410
And remember, that key component is the human touch,

726
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:45,132
and that's Netflix's secret,

727
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:47,113
one that they guard very closely.

728
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:49,735
What human influence do they put on their data?

729
00:37:50,316 --> 00:37:51,276
How is it interpreted?

730
00:37:52,057 --> 00:37:55,099
How did they get from Perry Mason to House of Cards?

731
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:57,142
I don't know, they won't say.

732
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:00,965
One can assume that they followed the logical associations

733
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:04,347
of character archetypes and themes and things like that,

734
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,609
but the specifics of that process,

735
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,971
how they combine their data with their instincts

736
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:11,633
is part of the secret sauce that makes them special.

737
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,153
This is the same design instinct that makes you special too.

738
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:19,834
You can use data to inform your process,

739
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:22,975
but don't let it lead you blindly into a decision,

740
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:26,116
or you'll just end up making another copycat.

741
00:38:26,376 --> 00:38:29,657
You'll make the same level as everyone else over and over.

742
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,259
So, throughout the history of the Gears franchise,

743
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:35,920
we struggled with balancing our shotgun.

744
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,958
Every single time we looked at the stats, the Nasher was at the top,

745
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:44,722
sometimes responsible for as much as 90% of all kills in a given month.

746
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:46,723
That's broken.

747
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:48,817
So we tried to fix it.

748
00:38:49,437 --> 00:38:51,478
And every time we tried to fix it, we messed it up.

749
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,759
Our player base kept yelling at us.

750
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,440
They kept being upset, saying we just didn't understand.

751
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:58,381
But we continued to watch the data,

752
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:00,202
and we shared everything with them.

753
00:39:00,562 --> 00:39:02,343
We made these big presentations like this one

754
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,444
that tried to explain the changes we were making,

755
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:06,825
and we buried them and ourselves

756
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,246
under mountains and mountains of data.

757
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:12,287
We did range, we did kill counts, we did damage values,

758
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:14,549
we analyzed the pellet distribution patterns.

759
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:15,209
We did everything.

760
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,022
but we never added that human touch.

761
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:22,886
We never stopped to ask why people were using the shotgun in the first place.

762
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:29,211
We had no end goal, no idea of what a fixed shotgun would actually look like.

763
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:32,734
And as it turns out, the Nasher wasn't broken.

764
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:37,906
It was this huge passion for how it felt to move through the map with the Nasher at your side.

765
00:39:38,446 --> 00:39:42,870
Firing the gun was fun, the effects and the sounds were satisfying,

766
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:45,433
connecting with it was totally empowering.

767
00:39:45,893 --> 00:39:50,717
Using the Nasher was a hugely successful and rewarding experience.

768
00:39:51,398 --> 00:39:55,001
From a design perspective, it was achieving every goal that we were striving for.

769
00:39:55,842 --> 00:39:57,063
It was meaningful.

770
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:01,149
It was all the other weapons that were completely deficient.

771
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,371
And it wasn't until the third game in the series

772
00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:05,212
that I think we really started to realize this

773
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,374
and truly appreciate what was going on.

774
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:10,896
This was our ghost in the machine.

775
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:13,598
We had all the information in the world about the Nasher

776
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:16,460
and tons of really pretty charts and graphs to look at,

777
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:18,261
but we were attached to them.

778
00:40:18,602 --> 00:40:21,163
And they prevented us from seeing the real problems

779
00:40:21,744 --> 00:40:23,845
because we had all these cool looking charts

780
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:25,506
and there was so much information there

781
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:26,627
that we couldn't get through it.

782
00:40:27,462 --> 00:40:33,244
We saw a problem in weapon balance, but we had no idea the solution that we were looking for.

783
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,925
There was no defined state of success.

784
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:43,487
So, in Gears of War Judgment, we were finally able to address this in what I think was a meaningful way.

785
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:52,149
And with all of our weapons balanced equally, we toyed with the idea of giving everyone one single base weapon to start with,

786
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:54,170
the Lancer rifle, and nothing else.

787
00:40:55,697 --> 00:40:57,558
All the other weapons, including the Gnasher,

788
00:40:57,978 --> 00:40:59,918
were scattered throughout the map as pickups.

789
00:41:00,578 --> 00:41:04,159
And because each weapon was now equally worthwhile,

790
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:06,000
they were all worth searching for.

791
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,800
And this gave the game a little bit more

792
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,701
of an old school shooter feel, which is great.

793
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:13,241
But at the end of the day, we wanted

794
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:15,062
to give our players more choice.

795
00:41:15,102 --> 00:41:17,382
We wanted them to have some customization

796
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:18,423
and personalization.

797
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:23,424
So we decided to move to kind of a more modern feeling loadout

798
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:23,724
model.

799
00:41:28,074 --> 00:41:29,756
Knowing our players affinity for the Nasher,

800
00:41:30,596 --> 00:41:33,098
it was being used as a lure in that original model

801
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:36,081
so that we had shotguns scattered all over the map

802
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:38,062
and people would go to all four corners

803
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:40,424
and you can see a nice, even distribution of play.

804
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:44,228
After we changed to the loadout system,

805
00:41:44,848 --> 00:41:47,971
our players immediately fell back into patterns of camping

806
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:50,993
that plagued all the previous iterations of Gears.

807
00:41:52,154 --> 00:41:55,297
Now, our heat map showed people moving and dying

808
00:41:55,397 --> 00:41:56,898
in these tight, collected groups.

809
00:41:58,088 --> 00:42:01,909
And we started to question if we had really addressed those problems in weapon balance,

810
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:02,850
why was this happening?

811
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,311
Well, in contrast to our previous games, Judgment maps were all asymmetrical.

812
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:15,253
Rather than a single individual front that pulled players to a common ground, every point

813
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:17,554
in the map had to be a defensible front.

814
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:22,675
And since players were now starting with their favorite weapon, the gnasher, and they could

815
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:26,596
use it effectively everywhere, why would you ever leave?

816
00:42:27,218 --> 00:42:30,259
Why not just spawn, wait for somebody to run up to you and shoot them in the face?

817
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:31,379
You didn't have to go anywhere.

818
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:32,539
This is exactly what they did.

819
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,660
They all started camping.

820
00:42:36,481 --> 00:42:40,562
This was, of course, a fixable problem, and it led to some overhaul on a few of our maps.

821
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:44,763
This is the overhead from the map called Gondola, if you're at all familiar with this series.

822
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:48,945
And we had to add some extra access points to the top of the map

823
00:42:49,405 --> 00:42:52,626
and open up this kind of highly defensible side area

824
00:42:52,926 --> 00:42:55,046
because those two areas were really easy to camp.

825
00:42:56,163 --> 00:42:59,427
Of course, this also meant that we had to rearrange our weapon loadouts,

826
00:42:59,547 --> 00:43:02,010
add some extra escape paths down from the bottom,

827
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,932
rework some approaches,

828
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:06,315
move a couple walls to accommodate other changes,

829
00:43:06,395 --> 00:43:08,837
open up lines of sight, on and on.

830
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:13,142
It was this endless cascade of issues that we were completely unprepared for.

831
00:43:13,903 --> 00:43:15,826
And this was only one map.

832
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:22,373
Just like data without context, change without defined purpose is meaningless.

833
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:27,096
It can only lead to churn, wasting time and resources.

834
00:43:27,796 --> 00:43:31,518
We rebalanced all of the other weapons in the game to accommodate the shotgun.

835
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:34,660
And that changing, and then changing to the loadout model,

836
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,941
was just one more small change in the system.

837
00:43:37,742 --> 00:43:41,844
But we were never able to address all the other problems that it created down the road.

838
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:46,047
And the game always felt imbalanced and off as a result of that.

839
00:43:47,205 --> 00:43:53,607
Now, there's no question that our goal was absolutely to improve our players' experience.

840
00:43:55,488 --> 00:43:57,329
But how do you define what that actually is?

841
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:00,410
There's no end, there's no measurable result there.

842
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:06,071
There was no tangible goal and no understanding of the complexity of all the other systems

843
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:07,772
that were involved in this process.

844
00:44:08,657 --> 00:44:13,142
We didn't address what we were building, we didn't address why we were making the change,

845
00:44:13,422 --> 00:44:16,165
and we didn't address who we were making those changes for.

846
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:20,930
We changed just for the sake of change, and we ended up churning for months.

847
00:44:22,211 --> 00:44:25,976
And remember, no problem is ever, like this, is ever really 100% fixed.

848
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:31,855
When we moved that boomshot in Academy, we didn't solve the problem.

849
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:37,598
We created a new hypothesis, that players would move away from that area,

850
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:41,340
and we found that the new data supported our new hypothesis.

851
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,821
Statistically seeking, we saw that players were, on average,

852
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:46,922
moving away from that area instead of camping it.

853
00:44:47,983 --> 00:44:51,224
Theoretically speaking, we could continue to test forever.

854
00:44:52,114 --> 00:44:53,995
You get more information every time you do it, right?

855
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:55,236
You refine your hypothesis.

856
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,637
You improve your probability space.

857
00:44:57,157 --> 00:44:59,699
It's not like that data is ever going to get old or be thrown

858
00:44:59,759 --> 00:45:00,079
away.

859
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:00,999
It just piles up.

860
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,061
But the reality is that at some point, you do need to stop.

861
00:45:04,341 --> 00:45:05,182
You have a schedule.

862
00:45:05,222 --> 00:45:06,022
You have a budget.

863
00:45:06,342 --> 00:45:08,424
And you have all these other things that need prioritization.

864
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:11,986
In complicated systems, like a multiplayer game,

865
00:45:12,406 --> 00:45:15,488
there's always the chance that the results of your next play

866
00:45:15,528 --> 00:45:19,630
test are going to reveal a new ghost in the machine.

867
00:45:20,622 --> 00:45:22,343
So at some point, you need to stop.

868
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:27,446
You need to accept that you know the best that you can know right now and move on.

869
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:35,209
In order to avoid churn, in order to keep from chasing ghosts, you need to outline your

870
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:37,731
goals and define success from the start.

871
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:42,993
All right, cool stories, bro.

872
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:44,254
What do I do with all this information?

873
00:45:45,888 --> 00:45:51,390
Good design is very often about simplification, streamlining, and clarification.

874
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:56,693
I look at analytics as a mindset that helps me focus on those principles

875
00:45:57,173 --> 00:46:02,076
and use them to inform the decisions that I make every single day.

876
00:46:02,995 --> 00:46:08,658
Continuing to ask why strengthens the impact and validity of every decision that we make.

877
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:13,740
It helps focus on what you're building and how you should approach it, and this helps

878
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,241
us to define our goals.

879
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:19,563
And once change is made, it can be quantified and measured.

880
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:25,105
This separates opinions from information and leads to meaningful change in your maps.

881
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:29,834
And remember, there are no guarantees.

882
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:33,617
One of the most famous sayings in Hollywood comes from screenwriter William Goldman,

883
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:36,259
who says, nobody knows anything.

884
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:41,142
Not one person in the entire motion picture field knows for certainty what's going to work.

885
00:46:41,723 --> 00:46:43,104
Every time out, it's a guess.

886
00:46:44,065 --> 00:46:49,148
This is why people passed on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Star Wars, and Harry Potter,

887
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,531
and the Twilight series, all predicting their inevitable failure.

888
00:46:53,735 --> 00:46:56,736
Failures just like those goofy kids that started Microsoft,

889
00:46:57,176 --> 00:46:58,797
and Apple, and Epic Games.

890
00:47:00,177 --> 00:47:03,178
But reality is, games do fail every day.

891
00:47:03,218 --> 00:47:03,998
It's bound to happen.

892
00:47:04,398 --> 00:47:06,979
Temple Run was this huge success right out of the gates.

893
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:10,100
But you have to remember that they were an anomaly.

894
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,781
It's more telling that Rovio had 56 other games

895
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:15,941
before Angry Birds.

896
00:47:16,481 --> 00:47:18,882
And that Candy Crush, the number one game in the world,

897
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:20,802
was more than 150th in King's roster.

898
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:25,621
So it's really easy to look back and say,

899
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:26,883
yeah, this is what we did right,

900
00:47:26,923 --> 00:47:27,984
or that's what they did right.

901
00:47:28,525 --> 00:47:30,608
But it's even harder to look forward

902
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:34,053
and predict this is what we should be doing.

903
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:36,597
Because there are no guarantees.

904
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:40,692
But analytics can improve your chances for success.

905
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,553
They help you both understand your players

906
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,374
and the content that those players are consuming,

907
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:48,695
the content you are building for your players.

908
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:51,116
The better you understand your own maps,

909
00:47:51,616 --> 00:47:53,577
the better you can predict the way people

910
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:54,898
will interact with them,

911
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:56,838
and the better you'll be able to innovate

912
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:58,599
and come up with new and interesting

913
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:00,400
and meaningful surprises.

914
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,741
The cycle of innovation and experimentation

915
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:06,062
is how you magic band your maps.

916
00:48:06,932 --> 00:48:09,453
Experimentation is the foundation for analytics,

917
00:48:09,813 --> 00:48:13,434
in the same way that iteration is the foundation for design.

918
00:48:14,755 --> 00:48:16,335
This is Six Sigma.

919
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,277
It's an analytical model that was

920
00:48:19,317 --> 00:48:20,997
designed for the manufacturing industry.

921
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,578
It's this weird process that requires

922
00:48:23,618 --> 00:48:26,079
like training and certification, and I don't have any of it.

923
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,460
But when I saw this, it struck me

924
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:32,622
how similar the methodology is to level design.

925
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:35,963
Start at the top right and look at the defined state.

926
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:37,525
What are you building?

927
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:39,067
Why are you building it?

928
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:40,108
Who are you building it for?

929
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:42,630
Does it support a game system or the narrative?

930
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:44,412
What are your goals?

931
00:48:44,532 --> 00:48:45,933
What are you trying to achieve?

932
00:48:46,474 --> 00:48:48,976
Outline your goals and define your success.

933
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,382
and then go on to measure.

934
00:48:53,002 --> 00:48:54,383
With a clear outlining of your goals,

935
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:56,064
you can define your starting point.

936
00:48:56,204 --> 00:48:57,385
If you know where you are now,

937
00:48:57,485 --> 00:48:59,367
you can measure where you're gonna be later.

938
00:48:59,847 --> 00:49:01,028
This is metrics.

939
00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:03,050
Maybe you're introducing a new weapon

940
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,371
and you wanna track success.

941
00:49:04,431 --> 00:49:06,712
Maybe there's some important visualization

942
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:09,755
or a visual element like a tower

943
00:49:09,815 --> 00:49:11,296
and you wanna use heat maps to track

944
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,237
where and when people are getting there.

945
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,219
Just remember that once you have this data,

946
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:18,741
it still needs to be interpreted and analyzed.

947
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,423
Data is information.

948
00:49:20,643 --> 00:49:21,944
It is not answers.

949
00:49:23,385 --> 00:49:24,847
So then you analyze.

950
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:25,607
Cover your bases.

951
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:28,070
Don't just accept that first answer that pops up.

952
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,011
Maybe players are dying frequently

953
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:31,112
around a powerful weapon.

954
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:34,195
But maybe there's other factors, like map geometry.

955
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,338
Separate correlation and causation.

956
00:49:38,573 --> 00:49:40,675
One of the biggest lessons I've learned as a designer

957
00:49:40,955 --> 00:49:44,758
is that if I need to repeatedly defend a design decision

958
00:49:45,879 --> 00:49:49,422
with my team, with my players, it's probably a bad decision.

959
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:53,505
And that's especially true if the information

960
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:58,248
that I'm using to support that decision is pure statistics.

961
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:01,651
There's always going to be people who don't immediately get.

962
00:50:02,684 --> 00:50:04,806
a change that you make or a design decision that you make.

963
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:06,588
But if they don't get it quickly,

964
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:08,431
through testing and iteration,

965
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:10,533
you need to step back and ask why.

966
00:50:11,014 --> 00:50:13,557
What part of your design isn't being communicated?

967
00:50:14,117 --> 00:50:15,279
Question everything.

968
00:50:16,332 --> 00:50:20,877
Analytics don't give you answers, but they do improve your chances for success.

969
00:50:21,497 --> 00:50:24,420
You are the one who adds that human element.

970
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:27,343
This is where we get to improve. This is your moment to shine.

971
00:50:27,363 --> 00:50:29,145
This is your role as an LD.

972
00:50:29,725 --> 00:50:31,487
Anyone can look at those data and read the numbers,

973
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:35,811
but it's the designer's job to know how and when to incorporate that data

974
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:39,495
to make a change that results in meaningful impact.

975
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:42,350
And then finally, control.

976
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,371
Understand that every change you make has consequences.

977
00:50:45,852 --> 00:50:47,312
Systems are complicated.

978
00:50:47,813 --> 00:50:49,754
Change one system, and it affects another.

979
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:53,515
Always ask, what's the bigger impact of this small change?

980
00:50:53,936 --> 00:50:55,857
What's the goal of that change?

981
00:50:56,617 --> 00:50:57,397
Nothing is simple.

982
00:50:58,018 --> 00:50:58,998
Every change matters.

983
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:01,420
And you're going to mess it up.

984
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,861
But that's okay, that's part of the process.

985
00:51:04,201 --> 00:51:06,162
Be honest about it and learn from your mistakes.

986
00:51:06,202 --> 00:51:09,604
When you fail at something, go back, redefine, retest.

987
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:13,427
This is exactly why this process is a continuous loop.

988
00:51:14,187 --> 00:51:16,889
You identify a question, you develop a hypothesis,

989
00:51:17,209 --> 00:51:19,070
you test, you measure, and you repeat.

990
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,611
This is iteration.

991
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,532
Every time the loop repeats,

992
00:51:22,592 --> 00:51:24,413
your chances of success get a little better.

993
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:26,435
You improve your probability space.

994
00:51:27,848 --> 00:51:29,649
So much of science is about patterns.

995
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:33,651
And as I've mentioned, analytics is about discovering those patterns.

996
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:36,973
But there's patterns in non-science areas as well.

997
00:51:37,653 --> 00:51:38,574
Look at pop culture.

998
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:42,876
A few years ago, we had shooter after shooter coming to the market,

999
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:46,298
and everyone was fighting this endless stream of World War II battles.

1000
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:51,387
kill Nazis, kill Nazis, kill Nazis, until modern warfare showed up.

1001
00:51:51,748 --> 00:51:56,188
And it changed the context to something that was suddenly culturally relevant.

1002
00:51:56,848 --> 00:51:59,349
They mixed in some RPG elements and did some other things,

1003
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:05,470
but that setting made sense to the current pop culture patterns.

1004
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,831
They broke that copycat mold by innovating.

1005
00:52:08,851 --> 00:52:11,411
They shifted the paradigm of the entire industry.

1006
00:52:11,831 --> 00:52:12,772
And how did people react?

1007
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:17,151
Well, they started making modern warfare, modern warfare, modern warfare.

1008
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:22,513
It's early, but I feel pretty safe in saying that the same guys are going to break that

1009
00:52:22,553 --> 00:52:24,314
pattern again with Titanfall.

1010
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:29,756
They understand the importance of innovation, the human element, of setting the bar and

1011
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:30,536
achieving goals.

1012
00:52:31,016 --> 00:52:34,837
They know what they're building, they know why they're building it, and they really know

1013
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:36,018
who they're building it for.

1014
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:40,820
They understand the importance of everything, and this is your challenge.

1015
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,192
If there's one thing I want you to take away from today,

1016
00:52:44,212 --> 00:52:46,654
it's that analytics can guide you

1017
00:52:47,074 --> 00:52:50,037
toward a true understanding of your game and your players.

1018
00:52:50,737 --> 00:52:51,698
It's not about the math,

1019
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:53,679
it's about asking the right questions

1020
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,562
and knowing when and how to mix in

1021
00:52:56,622 --> 00:52:59,104
your own personal instincts and insights.

1022
00:53:00,267 --> 00:53:02,327
Create meaningful change for your players.

1023
00:53:02,768 --> 00:53:07,029
Understand not just who they are, but how and why they play.

1024
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:09,450
Not to milk them for money, but to help

1025
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,611
you create an experience that they

1026
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:16,793
deem is worth the time and investment of their attention.

1027
00:53:17,713 --> 00:53:19,714
Their experience is in your hands,

1028
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:22,495
and everything that you do is important.

1029
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:23,575
Thank you.
