00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:08,507
Hi there, I'm Catherine Himes.

2
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:12,509
I am equal parts designer, player, and big old fan

3
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:14,750
to many tabletop games.

4
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,392
When I play something, it is often

5
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:20,334
a dicey split between enjoyment in the moment

6
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,536
and overanalysis to try and figure out

7
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,197
what makes this game tick.

8
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:29,779
I love collecting mechanics for my game design toolbox

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,662
as a way to hone craft and answer the ultimate question,

10
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:35,303
why is this fun?

11
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:39,747
With that in mind, I want to offer up a neat mechanic

12
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:43,549
for study and inspiration that has had a recurring role

13
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,311
in a growing number of recent tabletop games.

14
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,894
Today, I'm here to talk to you about games

15
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:54,275
that make things as you play them.

16
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:58,878
There is a fascinating line of titles over the last decade

17
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:00,279
across many formats

18
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:03,621
that tinker with the notion of artifacts of play.

19
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:07,858
By that I mean items we create by virtue of playing the game.

20
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,623
Think the final map of a game of pandemic legacy

21
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:15,205
or the mingled drawing outliving a session

22
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:16,186
of exquisite corpse.

23
00:01:16,947 --> 00:01:18,629
These artifacts stick with the players

24
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:21,191
long after the game session itself is over

25
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:23,714
and bring with them a whole lot of opportunity

26
00:01:23,814 --> 00:01:26,676
to increase the long-term impact of a tabletop game.

27
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:30,958
So at the end of this talk, you should have a taste of how

28
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:33,940
artifacts of play are being used in games across many formats,

29
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,562
how they can be used to make games more intimate, more

30
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:41,665
personal, and more marketable, and how you too might

31
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:43,947
incorporate them into your board game design

32
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:47,069
practice for more resonant and impactful experiences.

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,002
A little more about me as background.

34
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,224
I'm a co-founder of Thorny Games.

35
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:57,167
We're a game studio out of Berkeley, California.

36
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,829
We specialize in tabletop role-playing

37
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,850
and live-action games.

38
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:04,273
Our games often deal with the more intimate

39
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:07,135
and human sides of language and cryptography.

40
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:10,146
We've been lucky to have won a few awards,

41
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:13,648
including tabletop Game of the Year categories at IGDN,

42
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:15,449
Gen Cons Annie's in IndieCade Europe.

43
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,373
All of that is just to say that, like many folks at GDC,

44
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,455
games are an important part of my life and work.

45
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:27,558
And I spend a healthy chunk of my energy on them,

46
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:31,461
both in play and design, which sometimes leads

47
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,704
to the late night question, what do we keep from games?

48
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,543
What do we keep from play as game inclined folks?

49
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:44,828
We spend large parts of our lives in play around the table

50
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:45,589
or online.

51
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:48,933
When end up being the keepsakes for all of this?

52
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,076
And how do we remember the experience?

53
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,602
One answer is through how we document play.

54
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,464
Through all the tools at our disposal

55
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:00,486
to record and capture moments,

56
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:04,449
we record video and stream live play.

57
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:06,871
We take photos of our tabletop spreads.

58
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:10,454
For example, this is a personal favorite,

59
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:14,257
a GIF of the mighty Lee Sedol playing AlphaGo

60
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:17,419
as humanity's last hope in a human AI showdown.

61
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:25,626
This captures the exact moment where Lysadol places his hand of God move, ultimately winning the game.

62
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:35,789
This is an epic snapshot of an historical game that is worth capturing, sure, and not quite the

63
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:41,331
same stakes, but I've played out lots of games that are important in my life that I want to keep too.

64
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:45,071
And by documenting play, we're acknowledging

65
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:47,914
that play is meaningful and that playful experiences are

66
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,996
things that deserve to be kept and revisited.

67
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,019
And documentation can act as mementos

68
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,242
to take us back to the table and help us hold on to game

69
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,004
experiences like we would hold on

70
00:03:58,044 --> 00:03:59,646
to any other momentous thing.

71
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:03,810
So with that, I'd like to introduce

72
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,832
the idea of an artifact of play.

73
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,662
In its broadest sense, an artifact of play is something created during a game that outlives

74
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:19,806
the session itself. Simple. This is a wide definition that welcomes lots of the ways

75
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:24,668
that we document play. Beyond documentation, just lots of what we keep from play.

76
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:29,318
Many things fall under this definition.

77
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,042
There is a wide world of artifacts at play.

78
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:35,886
Examples like recordings with live streams,

79
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:40,092
actual play, the throne of Twitch, play preparation.

80
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:42,455
Think of all of those detailed GM notes

81
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:44,758
and nifty maps for your D&D campaign.

82
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,443
note-taking, like character sheets, score pads, filled out crossword puzzles, even move-by-move

83
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:56,046
transcription. We have tables of recreated chess games and Go matches that we can pour over

84
00:04:56,166 --> 00:05:00,568
centuries after those games have been played. And the list goes on to the many things that

85
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:06,531
we keep from play. But within that wide world of artifacts of play,

86
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:11,001
There is one particular category where I'd like to focus this talk,

87
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:15,725
a subset of artifacts of play that deserves particular attention

88
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:19,527
and where there is a lot of exciting design to tread.

89
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:22,609
And we'll do that by adding one more piece to the definition.

90
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,112
So from here on out, we'll focus on artifacts of play

91
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,014
that are directed by the rules of the game.

92
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:35,189
There is a growing class of games that are designed to create things as you play them.

93
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,311
These are games that include an artifact by design.

94
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:41,093
So to play the game is to make the artifact.

95
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:47,176
This is different from our epic Go photo, live streams, DM notes.

96
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:50,778
Those are player driven and not inherent to the game itself.

97
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:54,247
So under this narrower definition,

98
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,768
this means that an artifact is reliably produced

99
00:05:56,948 --> 00:06:00,590
by a game session and also reflective of the choices

100
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,212
in that game session, unique to the particular time, space,

101
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:06,093
and people who are part of making it.

102
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:08,634
So from here on out, this is what we'll focus on

103
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:09,934
when we say artifacts of play.

104
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:14,877
We have some shared language now.

105
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:17,898
Let's dig into what makes artifacts of play fun

106
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:18,738
and effective.

107
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,868
and how they can be a powerful tool for tabletop game design.

108
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:26,511
So to do this, follow me on a small tour of artifacts of play.

109
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:29,072
We'll name a few standout artifacts

110
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:31,594
and how they have been used to up the fun

111
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:33,795
and deepen the emotional and narrative

112
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,196
resonance of their design.

113
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,638
I'll offer a quality and an artifact that exemplifies it,

114
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:43,360
and along the way, sing the praises of a few great games.

115
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,863
Artifacts as playful documentation.

116
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:53,288
Artifacts of play can be a form of documentation, as we can see,

117
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:55,509
and they can be how you remember the experience.

118
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,473
But unlike a photo, say, they are inherently more playful

119
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,175
and true to the particular experience created at the table,

120
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:09,519
since they are born out of it. They are keepsakes and mementos that are

121
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:14,262
directly produced from the game. So more than a photo, the character of a

122
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:16,583
game is better captured by an artifact.

123
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:17,664
A

124
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:23,653
Great example of this is the shared drawing pad in the fantastic party game,

125
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,214
A Fake Artist Goes to New York by Oink Games.

126
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:33,096
Fake Artist is a hidden role game between real artists and one fake who is trying to stay under

127
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:38,558
the radar. In this game, everyone draws a single picture together on a pad of paper based on a

128
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:43,660
prompt. Every round there's an artist adding something to the picture bit by bit, a leg here,

129
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,281
circle there, squiggle over here.

130
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,579
But the fake artist goes in blind,

131
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,940
not knowing what's being drawn at all.

132
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,721
And it's their dirty job to bungle their way through

133
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,161
without being detected.

134
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:57,143
So the artifact in this game is the shared drawing pad

135
00:07:57,263 --> 00:08:01,705
that becomes the canvas for this weird and collaborative art

136
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:02,805
that you make together.

137
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:06,167
The artifact is thematic to the game itself,

138
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:10,489
where you just see these snooty artists stroking their beards

139
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:12,730
around the canvas, sussing each other out.

140
00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:16,840
But the drawing also contains so much relevant information

141
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,361
about what happened here.

142
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:20,724
You can see the fake artist's hedge.

143
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:23,326
You can almost write out stroke by stroke

144
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:24,668
where the fake artist blew it.

145
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:28,952
It becomes a log for the silly hijinks among friends

146
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:31,815
all captured in just one drawing.

147
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:41,910
So now every time that you open the box, you can flip to that pad and smile at the ridiculous art that you've created and all the good times you've had with your friends.

148
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,552
And that makes it pretty magical.

149
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:49,216
Artifacts of play are immersive.

150
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:54,120
They forge a link between the game world and the real world.

151
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:59,536
And because an artifact is something you create from within the context of a game,

152
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:02,939
they can help blur the lines of what is play and what isn't.

153
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,402
And because they last beyond the end of a session,

154
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:10,946
interacting with them can bring you more deeply back into the world that was created at the table.

155
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:17,812
A fantastic example of immersive artifacts comes from the role-playing game

156
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:21,215
Thousand-Year-Old Vampire by Tim Hutchings.

157
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:27,159
Thousand-Year-Old Vampire is a solo role-playing game where you wallow in the

158
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,002
inner musings and the macabre life events of an ancient vampire.

159
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:35,923
The rulebook is a beautiful and immersive product itself.

160
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:40,386
It uses all the trappings of old bound journals and the intricacies of print,

161
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:45,928
but ultimately it's a model for the artifact that you make by playing the game.

162
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:52,011
Which is, the rules lead you to create your own sad and twisted vampire's journal.

163
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:57,153
chronicled over years in vampire time, you detail events,

164
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,034
you gain attributes and stats,

165
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:01,395
you encounter old loves and grudges,

166
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:03,456
and you do this playing out the game

167
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,477
through a journal of your own making.

168
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:09,278
In the end, you have created this ghoulish testimony

169
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:12,379
of an old vampire and have a lasting artifact

170
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:13,140
of the experience.

171
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:16,701
This journal lives in the physical space

172
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:18,462
the players occupy as human beings,

173
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:21,765
which gives it a more visceral and physical relationship

174
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:22,886
with the game itself.

175
00:10:23,546 --> 00:10:25,788
You can touch it, you can fold it, doodle on it,

176
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:26,629
interact with it.

177
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:30,272
And having this physical journal artifact bridges the worlds

178
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,613
and then puts you back in vampire mode

179
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:34,115
each time you return to play.

180
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,097
You can totally imagine a version of this game

181
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,259
played with verbal prompts or without writing,

182
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,981
but it would be a poor experience for it.

183
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:45,553
the artifact itself makes the game more impactful.

184
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:51,195
Friendly warning for anyone who is in the middle

185
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:53,815
of their Risk Legacy campaign and avoiding spoilers,

186
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:55,616
just skip to the next slide.

187
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,499
So artifacts of play can help to personalize the game.

188
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,400
They can make the game particular to a time and place

189
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,500
and the people who are part of it.

190
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,503
They become a vector for how to leave your mark on the game.

191
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:14,365
Choices you make are funneled into the artifact,

192
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:16,626
and that means in big or small ways,

193
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:18,588
the end product will reflect you.

194
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:21,990
You feel like you have given something of yourself

195
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,550
to the game.

196
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,632
Every game is different, and there's a clarity

197
00:11:25,672 --> 00:11:28,254
that you, in particular, not just some generic set

198
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:29,795
of stand-ins actually played this game.

199
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:37,086
So a great example of this is from tabletop board games

200
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:41,290
in the finished map from a game of Risk Legacy.

201
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,994
In particular, the artifact that is built

202
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:47,076
from the win reward in Risk Legacy.

203
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:48,938
So Risk Legacy is.

204
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:55,204
a campaign game, multiple sessions where rules are added, bent, and molded over the course of play.

205
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:58,905
There are many interesting and transgressive things that you're led to do over the course

206
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:03,385
of a campaign, but one of the winning conditions in particular transforms the board

207
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:10,427
from a more generic map into an artifact to play. When you win a session of Risk,

208
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:14,228
you get the reward of naming a portion of the map and writing it on the board.

209
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:18,588
It lives there, then as a record for your past success.

210
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,707
and last through subsequent games.

211
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:22,427
And along with the other choices you

212
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:23,928
make that permanently affect the board,

213
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:27,570
the board then becomes an artifact of your campaign

214
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,532
that is a capstone of this epic multi-session experience.

215
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,253
A quick Google search for RISC legacy boards

216
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:38,935
will bring you many framed versions like you see here.

217
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:43,717
So keeping it as a trophy of a personal world takeover

218
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:46,278
is a common inclination.

219
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:54,373
Artifacts of play can affect who has control in a game.

220
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:57,536
By empowering players to create something

221
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,878
as they follow the rules, you are giving them choices,

222
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,402
offering them more authority as free agents to shape play.

223
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:09,464
How you build artifacts of play can set the contract

224
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,766
for how players should also interact with one another.

225
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:16,569
A shining example of an artifact that channels control

226
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,031
is the collaborative map from The Quiet Year.

227
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:25,969
This is Avery Alder's game about telling the story of a community in a lone quiet year before

228
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:31,750
the end times. So the quiet year is a story game but with no central game master, so no single

229
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,951
player that is in charge of world building or what happens. It's fundamentally collaborative.

230
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:43,393
Every turn the active player turns over a card which asks them a question which they answer

231
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:46,433
about what's happening to the community and they take an action.

232
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,985
And every answer is reflected on the map

233
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:53,488
that the players collaboratively draw and create during play.

234
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:57,250
The map that you build together ends up

235
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,092
being a reflection of choices that you make

236
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,934
and how they interact with the choices of your fellow players.

237
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,896
As an artifact, then, the map itself

238
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:06,958
becomes a different canvas for play

239
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:09,379
and a means to portion out control.

240
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:12,698
On your turn, you make a choice and you change the map,

241
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:14,959
but the map is this living record

242
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:17,821
and forces you to acknowledge the choices from the past

243
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,802
and then build on them.

244
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:21,845
In this way, the map almost becomes a filter

245
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:22,965
for collaborative control.

246
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:27,169
This isn't to say every artifact of play forces collaboration,

247
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,751
but rather it can be a lens to emphasize

248
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,173
who has control at a given point in a game.

249
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,878
Artifacts of play can be compelling marketing tools,

250
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:44,640
If something is made out of fun or part of a playful experience,

251
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,342
it often just makes for an intriguing and attention

252
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:50,183
grabbing object that people will want to know more about.

253
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:52,885
It invites conversation.

254
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:56,186
If an artifact is well-designed, it's also something

255
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:59,108
that people will choose to keep, display, and show off.

256
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:01,169
And that can be marketing gold.

257
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,232
An example artifact that does this nicely is from TKO.

258
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:08,633
That's one of the Jackbox games.

259
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:12,166
TKO is a digital party game which makes it choice

260
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:13,888
for playing with friends and family remotely.

261
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:17,771
Gameplay is about smashing together silly puns

262
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,592
and awkward drawings made by the players,

263
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,614
then funneling that mess into t-shirt designs

264
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,055
which then go head to head in battle.

265
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:27,758
It's a great time that just guarantees laughter.

266
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,600
But there's a brilliant stroke at the end of the game

267
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:33,022
where you have the option to take it with you

268
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,644
by actually buying physical shirts

269
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:37,666
from your own knockout t-shirt design.

270
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:42,124
This shirt is a sweet marketing artifact of play.

271
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:46,527
As a player, I feel compelled to wear it because it's something

272
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,468
I made while having fun with my friends.

273
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,829
It's an inside joke come to life.

274
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:54,291
Night and day from some generically branded game shirt.

275
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:58,253
With this you just get the fun by seeing the artifact.

276
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:02,008
And while wearing it, it naturally invites the question

277
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:05,331
for people who I encounter, what the heck does that mean?

278
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,234
And that is a choice marketing moment if I know one.

279
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:17,861
Artifacts of Play can also make games feel more intimate.

280
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:20,744
Co-creation is a bonding experience

281
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:24,147
and funneling that energy into an artifact

282
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,709
can create a deeper connection between players.

283
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:30,709
Let's talk about the artifact of play in one of our games,

284
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,450
Dialect, a game about language and how it dies.

285
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,170
This is a tabletop role-playing game

286
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,091
where you tell the story of an isolated community

287
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:40,432
by building their language.

288
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:44,153
In the game, you gradually build up elements of language

289
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:47,074
among players as you tell the story of this community

290
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,074
and what happened to them.

291
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,115
That means that people gain fluency

292
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:54,136
in their own dialect over the course of play.

293
00:16:55,454 --> 00:16:58,276
The artifact in dialect is the language you create

294
00:16:58,436 --> 00:16:59,396
as the game unfolds.

295
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:03,879
It's intangible, unlike many of the other artifacts

296
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,400
that we've highlighted, but it's sticky in the minds of players

297
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,982
who make up words to mark these story beats.

298
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,764
We found players really love using their dialect long

299
00:17:13,904 --> 00:17:15,084
after a session has ended.

300
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,907
The artifact of language drives a really interesting

301
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:21,188
connection among players.

302
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:24,676
In the game, you use words you make together,

303
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:28,579
which leads you to play with the artifact as it's being made.

304
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,061
It offers the stealthy way of connecting the players

305
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,042
to both the story and each other,

306
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:37,484
all the while tying up their choices into their dialect.

307
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:40,506
Co-creation is moving on its own,

308
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,209
but it packs an extra punch when it's captured in a word.

309
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:47,331
This plays on the same dynamics and intrigue

310
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:48,551
of a secret handshake.

311
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:51,713
You are creating your own language for an in-group.

312
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,815
And that is a great way of accelerating

313
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:56,276
a feeling of intimacy.

314
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:03,580
Artifacts of Play offer a lot for tabletop design.

315
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,803
This is a small helping of example games and artifacts,

316
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:11,765
but it should give a taste in how varied they

317
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:13,286
can be across type and tone.

318
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:17,999
Artifacts can amplify the underlying feeling of the game,

319
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,020
be it silly or serious.

320
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,841
They make games feel more personalized and intimate.

321
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:27,364
From social party games, big feelings, RPG session,

322
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:30,966
strategy campaign, tabletop, all can benefit

323
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:32,447
from a well-designed artifact.

324
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,251
So if your interest is piqued after this tiny tour

325
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,032
and you're eager to start designing these

326
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:42,573
into your next tabletop project.

327
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,091
let me offer a few words of advice to clear the way.

328
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:52,153
The first point, make it immersive.

329
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:55,654
In my opinion, this is an artifact's

330
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:56,894
most exciting property.

331
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:58,934
It is the biggest reason you should care.

332
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:03,055
Sometimes people will use the term the magic circle

333
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:06,376
to talk about the space within which a game takes place,

334
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:10,077
where meanings change and the rules and social conventions

335
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,238
of a game are accepted as true.

336
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,393
Artifacts of play as we've defined them

337
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:19,414
are made within the magic circle and will emphasize the meaning

338
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:20,395
that you create there.

339
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:22,576
This is really powerful.

340
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:26,477
It means that you can keep a lasting taste of an experience

341
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:28,778
that typically ends when a game stops.

342
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:31,819
As a designer, you should ask yourself,

343
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,540
what part of the game's fiction do you want to spotlight?

344
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,481
Where do I want to bridge the game world and the real world?

345
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:40,922
Let that guide how you design the artifact.

346
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,432
Next, where's the fun in your game?

347
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:50,093
Such a simple and important question.

348
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:52,434
What makes your game interesting and worth playing?

349
00:19:52,914 --> 00:19:53,795
What is the main point?

350
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,296
In any project, you should have a clear answer.

351
00:19:57,316 --> 00:20:00,358
And as a designer, to me, it is always

352
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,218
surprising how that straightforward question can

353
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,520
get muddled and pushed aside as you

354
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,761
deal with the many other moving parts of tabletop design.

355
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:11,063
In your game, you should clearly know where the fun is

356
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,903
and what is scaffolding for the fun.

357
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:16,754
Once you can name where the fun is in your game,

358
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:21,358
that's a great place to consider how an artifact could be used to amplify it.

359
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:26,162
If the fun is making silly puns with friends, put it there.

360
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:31,247
If it's the sweet taste of victory in head-to-head combat across a world map,

361
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:36,391
put it there. If it's big feelings RPG session where you grapple with your own

362
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:38,253
monstrosity, put it there.

363
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:41,384
So if you're looking for where an artifact to play

364
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:44,125
may fit into your design, tie it to where the fun is.

365
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:46,986
A good artifact will amplify what it points to,

366
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:49,908
and it will be a keepsake of the game as a whole.

367
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:52,148
So make sure you do that for the fun of your game

368
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:53,749
and not for the scaffolding.

369
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,752
Artifacts last beyond the session of a game.

370
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:02,072
They are for keeps.

371
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:04,894
When designing an artifact into your game,

372
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,875
ask yourself, what is something a player would want to keep?

373
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,532
For one, there is an aesthetic consideration.

374
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:14,314
An artifact for keep should be something interesting

375
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:17,556
to look at, something playful or evocative of the experience,

376
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:19,757
something that people will want to show off.

377
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:23,620
Depending on how heavily gameplay features the artifacts,

378
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,361
this may also influence how important

379
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,402
the related craftedness of it is.

380
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,664
Also consider the practicalities of keeping it.

381
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:32,706
Is the artifact something people can store,

382
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:33,886
something they would display?

383
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:35,327
Is it something tangible at all?

384
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:42,422
On the flip side, as designers, we should ask ourselves what we want players to keep about the game.

385
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:47,267
Things that last have a way of dominating the memory of an experience.

386
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:52,113
So a photo really might be all you remember about that birthday party or vacation.

387
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:58,480
If an artifact is for keeps, as designers, we should make sure it's built in such a way that it can stand in place for the game.

388
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:08,138
Designing with artifacts of play is an act of giving up control.

389
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,541
In big or small ways, you are ceding control to your players

390
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,042
to leave their mark on the game.

391
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,964
In some ways, it's empowering players to be co-authors.

392
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:21,987
That means you won't have full control on the ins and outs

393
00:22:22,027 --> 00:22:23,107
of the system that you design.

394
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:27,030
An artifact forces you to make space in your design

395
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,031
so that players can make something that's

396
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:29,892
unique to their session.

397
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,934
This creates almost a built-in conversation

398
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:34,195
between designer and player.

399
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,077
When you design to include an artifact to play,

400
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:40,900
it can become a catalyst to relinquish authority

401
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,862
as a designer and give more to the players.

402
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:47,345
So ask yourself, where can you give up control to your players?

403
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:49,607
Let that guide your choices.

404
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,650
So.

405
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:59,508
If you design tabletop games and are looking to push the emotional resonance of their experience

406
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:05,252
further to make your games more intimate and memorable, consider Artifacts of Play as part

407
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:13,398
of your design toolkit. At Thorny Games, we have grown as a studio by grappling with some

408
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:17,441
of these questions and finding a place for Artifacts of Play in our work.

409
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:21,350
We feel like there is so much rich design space

410
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,676
to tread in making games that make things.

411
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,281
Thanks a bunch.
