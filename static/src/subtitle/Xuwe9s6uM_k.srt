00:00:04,177 --> 00:00:12,100
Hello there GDC, good evening and welcome to the GDC Microtalks of 2017 where this year

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:18,542
you find us playing with our hearts just because we're really utterly passionate about game

3
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:18,963
design.

4
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:23,664
Please mute the chirping of your external brains and don't forget to use the feedback

5
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:27,826
form to send us your love notes, your constructive feedback and your favourite cat memes.

6
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:31,667
My name is Richard Lemarchand and I'm a game designer.

7
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:33,848
I used to work at Naughty Dog on the Uncharted games

8
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:36,370
and now I teach game design, development, and production

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,511
in the USC Games program in Los Angeles,

10
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,492
where I'm also doing design research

11
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:42,353
with a series of experimental games.

12
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:44,674
So.

13
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:47,688
What exactly is a microtalk?

14
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:53,370
Well, this session was inspired by those short talk formats that use a peculiar and game-like

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,751
constraint to help people talk about their deepest thoughts, their biggest dreams, and

16
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:00,552
their brightest hopes without running over on time.

17
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,613
Each of today's speakers has 20 slides.

18
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:10,137
Each one of those slides will automatically advance after exactly 16 seconds, giving each

19
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:15,400
speaker a total of 5 minutes and 20 seconds to let us in on their game-related preoccupations,

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,582
prognostications, and wisdom.

21
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:23,285
My hope each year is that the GDC Microtalks is a place where you can come to charge up

22
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:28,207
your inspiration batteries, broaden your outlook about games and play, and walk back out into

23
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:31,929
the Moscone Center brimming with passion for this incredible form of ours.

24
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,032
Of course, you have definitely realized by now that I'm already giving you my Microtalks,

25
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:42,694
so with just one more pause for a very deep breath, allow me to introduce you to the brilliant,

26
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:47,236

56
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:57,947
and public speaker.

57
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:01,049
James Baldwin said,

58
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:08,193
Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without, and know we cannot live within.

59
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:11,738
What a horrible year.

60
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,760
So many of our friends right now are suffering renewed injustice and persecution

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,561
because of their faith, because of where they were born,

62
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:23,823
because of their gender or sexual identity, because of the colour of their skin.

63
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:26,484
Some couldn't get visas to come here.

64
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:30,483
For some people, this is surprising and alarming.

65
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,445
For other people, who have been dealing their whole lives with the violence

66
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:38,747
born of the racism, misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia

67
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:42,208
that's built into our way of life, it's maybe nothing new.

68
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,390
I've been trying to write an inspirational opening for weeks.

69
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,151
Something, something, the ambiguity of play.

70
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:51,832
Something, something, uplift people with our work.

71
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,794
But for once in my life, I can't find the words.

72
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:57,255
Maybe this isn't the time for my words.

73
00:04:58,688 --> 00:04:59,589
James Baldwin again.

74
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,472
Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does.

75
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:06,994
Love is a battle.

76
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:08,555
Love is a war.

77
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,376
Love is a growing up.

78
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:17,260
We're about to settle into a wonderful hour of game design thought, and as you listen,

79
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,423
I hope you'll find something in here that helps your heart, whoever you are and whatever

80
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:22,904
you're doing.

81
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:25,225
Our speakers are great, and I know you're going to enjoy their talks.

82
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:25,946
I want you to be a part of that.

83
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:26,666
I want you to be a part of that.

84
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:27,347
I want you to be a part of that.

85
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:32,410
I want to thank our wonderful speakers in advance, and thanks to Megan Scavio, Megan Bundy, and all the folks at UBM.

86
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:39,094
Thanks to the GDC Advisory Board for having us back again this year, and to the amazing conference associates for their tireless awesomeness.

87
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:44,177
And thanks to you, the Microtalks community, both here and on the GDC vault.

88
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:45,618
That's my talk.

89
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:55,564
Thanks.

90
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:57,625
So let's get the show on the road.

91
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:01,206
I would like to introduce you to Stephanie Bayer, who

92
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:03,867
has some advice for all of you who are either directly

93
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:07,169
or indirectly involved in community management.

94
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:09,390
Please welcome Stephanie Bayer.

95
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:20,914
All right.

96
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:22,615
Time for memes and for me to go fast.

97
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,458
As humans, we all have hearts.

98
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:28,020
It's just a factor of anatomy.

99
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,321
What we do with those hearts, how we express emotions,

100
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,283
empathy, and feelings is how we begin to differ.

101
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:36,346
While I enjoy robotic precision and neo-retrofuture aesthetic,

102
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:38,328
I'm still a human with a heart and must remember,

103
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:40,109
expressing emotions is OK.

104
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,993
In regards to video games, community management, and player management, that's where things

105
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,273
can get a bit more tricky.

106
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,954
I play with players' hearts every day, and as much as they sometimes tell me they don't

107
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,835
want me to do so, this dance is required.

108
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:56,036
But, and this is an important but, if you're playing with hearts, you have to be a player

109
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:56,836
with heart.

110
00:06:58,057 --> 00:07:01,197
Act one, we all have to start somewhere, and that start is the waiting game.

111
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:05,458
Whether you're building a community or managing an existing community, deciding the tone of

112
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:09,399
voice, discussion types, and transparency into development must be decided before a

113
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,000
post goes up.

114
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:15,147
Act two, how do you break through the digital wall?

115
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:16,749
By listening and reading.

116
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,473
Understanding the audience you're trying to interact with is key.

117
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:23,339
Even if they are angrily spewing words on a screen, they're there for a reason.

118
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,204
Now to just shape the conversation positively and genuinely.

119
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:30,459
Act 3, your first post.

120
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,981
This can either mean nothing or mean everything.

121
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:35,743
It truly depends on the state of your community and what you post.

122
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:39,526
While main game updates or content releases can be written in the voice of the company,

123
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,329
individual opinions and responses should be in your voice.

124
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:45,011
It's okay to admit you're an actual human posting on a page.

125
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:45,831
Humanizing helps.

126
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:49,514
You're totally thinking, hasn't the internet and jerks screwed this up for us though?

127
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:53,215
Let's never diminish those who've experienced the ugly side of the internet.

128
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:57,016
Never pretend harassment on the internet doesn't exist or that people don't suffer because

129
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:57,236
of it.

130
00:07:57,636 --> 00:08:00,457
But I still believe true connections can be made.

131
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:03,918
I have hope that we can stand together.

132
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:04,798
We can unite.

133
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,039
Finding commonality in simple things can be powerful, such as the explosive pineapple

134
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:09,839
on pizza debate.

135
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:14,020
While it may seem trivial, it does prove the point that finding community can be as easy

136
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,081
as agreeing or disagreeing on a pizza topping.

137
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,962
Approaching an audience with a sense of heart means staying cool and balanced, addressing

138
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:24,404
negative issues swiftly while still highlighting the good things in the community all at once.

139
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,125
But still you wonder, how?

140
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:29,067
How can everyone partake in the empathy game successfully?

141
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,431
Some are gifted with emotional intelligence.

142
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:36,491
Most have to learn it.

143
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,913
Empathy is a skill that becomes better with practice.

144
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:41,895
Though you're still dealing with the changing landscape of human emotion.

145
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:44,153
No striving for perfection.

146
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:48,495
Practice what you can, like active listening, micro expressions, and tone can help make

147
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,156
you a more heart forward communicator.

148
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:51,837
You're doing posts.

149
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:52,337
Now what?

150
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,998
Do spend more in depth time with your biggest supporters.

151
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,700
Don't stretch yourself too thin communicating on all platforms.

152
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,641
Do realize you can only do so much.

153
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:01,501
Don't try to own every conversation.

154
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,443
Be honest and let the community know you still deserve down time.

155
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:06,805
Still too much negativity?

156
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:10,386
I could spend lots of time on this topic, but here's my shortest version possible.

157
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:12,826
I run communities on a two-strike rule.

158
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:15,847
First offense, call them out and request respectful communication.

159
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,848
If they still go ham, remove them.

160
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,528
Don't be afraid to tell them to go.

161
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:21,429
If their goal is to troll, you don't need them.

162
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,849
Feel like you don't know what you're doing?

163
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,750
Hesitation is normal in the beginning.

164
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,070
If a reaction is negative, don't beat yourself up.

165
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,651
Just spend time figuring out where your message is going wrong.

166
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:31,651
Is it content?

167
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:32,311
Delivery?

168
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:32,791
Tone?

169
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:33,832
Don't give up.

170
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:41,370
When your audience goes negative, in most cases a faux pas post can be fixed.

171
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,732
So take a breath and then get ready to work again.

172
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:45,673
Go back to Act 2, reading.

173
00:09:46,114 --> 00:09:47,975
Read the complaints, read between the lines.

174
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:49,596
Really try to absorb the issue.

175
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:52,138
Stay open-minded, don't get defensive.

176
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:56,448
Pro tip, pick a loud dissenter and a loud supporter

177
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:57,790
and have a Google Hangout with them.

178
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,453
Really listen to what they have to say, good and bad.

179
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,335
Don't allow yourself to be abused, though.

180
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:03,917
If they can't behave, end the Hangout.

181
00:10:04,277 --> 00:10:05,639
Take notes during the conversation.

182
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,541
Create an actionable item list from it.

183
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,985
Sometimes you have to apologize for the hearts you've broken.

184
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:16,109
If you've truly listened to the community and a mistake was yours, sincerely apologize

185
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:16,810
and move forward.

186
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,794
If a direct apology is unnecessary, create a post that displays an understanding of the

187
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:21,635
community's feelings.

188
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,339
Directly acknowledging them is key to regaining trust and making amends.

189
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:30,021
Once an apology recognition post is posted, get back to business as usual.

190
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:31,883
Remind players of positive stuff coming up.

191
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:35,345
Feel free to highlight an in-joke in a post to show them that you're still reading what

192
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:35,885
they're saying.

193
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:39,248
Use digital icebreakers or pop culture posts to get them talking again.

194
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,029
It may seem cheesy, but it works.

195
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:44,447
Here are two ways I went hard forward at work.

196
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:49,373
Innocuous contest posts I did led me to chatting with a cancer patient who I ended up bringing

197
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:50,675
into the studio to meet the team.

198
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:55,221
I reached out to the angriest grandma ever on Facebook and she ended up becoming a weekly

199
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:56,643
tournament runner for our game.

200
00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:00,406
What can be gained by playing with hearts or sharing your heart?

201
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:04,070
You can gain different perspectives on how players interact with your content, as well

202
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,092
as a reminder that players are people too.

203
00:11:07,393 --> 00:11:10,376
98% of your players just want to have fun and have their joy tank filled while you're

204
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:11,137
playing your game.

205
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:13,159
You make content that touches hearts.

206
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,915
In summation, playing with hearts is tricky but worthwhile.

207
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,956
It's okay to help make people happy.

208
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:21,098
It's okay to find joy in making others happy.

209
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:23,200
It's okay to play with hearts as long as you're willing

210
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,121
to share your heart as well.

211
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:25,982
It may be scary or make you nervous,

212
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:27,704
but hearts and passion are what build

213
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:29,285
successful long-term communities.

214
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,933
While not trying to promote unhealthy habits, if you ever speak to a community manager and

215
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:37,174
they talk about drinking a lot, that's because the toll on their heart is sometimes quite

216
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:37,434
great.

217
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:40,996
If you see your community manager looking down, don't hesitate to ask them what's up,

218
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:43,237
offer a cup of coffee or even just say thanks.

219
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:45,718
This small gesture does wonders for the heart.

220
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:46,978
Thank you.

221
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,480
Thank you so much Stephanie, thanks for getting us going.

222
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,162
And next, please welcome, Kat Small.

223
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:20,385
Cool. So one of the many things that I do is user experience design or UX for short.

224
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:26,273
And UX design is a relatively new field and what user experience designers do is advocate

225
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:30,619
for users while ensuring that business goals are met by making sure that technology is

226
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,140
reliable.

227
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:36,649
So in terms of games, UX designers ensure that games interfaces are intuitive and that

228
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:40,852
games are challenging while also making sure that they're not frustrating enough to quit.

229
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:45,657
And game development studios are noticing and starting to hire them, which is awesome.

230
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:51,482
So it's very easy to think that one must be an expert to know how to create a seamless,

231
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:52,983
intuitive, engaging game.

232
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:56,706
But you don't have to be an expert to think about UX design, and it's actually important

233
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:59,208
that everyone on the team is thinking about it.

234
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:08,319
So here are several tricks, four in total, to start thinking about UX design. And these are

235
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:13,061
things that game development studios, whether you're a million people or one person can use

236
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:18,904
to make your games more usable and therefore immersive if that's your cup of tea. Trick

237
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:23,967
number one, arts and crafts. So UX designers are known to carry around a toolkit of like

238
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:27,808
dollar store stuff, including things like pens, paper, sticky notes, et cetera.

239
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:32,170
Because we basically never left kindergarten and it helps us to work better in the long term.

240
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:39,181
So firstly I usually start by drawing a user flow diagram and that can be on paper or

241
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:43,022
digitally and this helps me to figure out logic before I get too far into the

242
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:47,184
programming process so I'm not building anything yet. So I can actually start focusing

243
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:52,646
on systems design before I've started prototyping or programming. I also then proceed

244
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:58,068
into drawing those different states by fleshing things out again on paper so that I can

245
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:00,929
visually explain my idea without getting too far again.

246
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:05,213
So you can find that your ideas come out better when you're not preoccupied with the code

247
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:06,354
or how things look.

248
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:11,419
And all of this requires just three shapes which are circles, squares and triangles.

249
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,104
And I just want to like really point out that you don't have to be an artist to be a UX

250
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:20,268
designer or do UX design because we're not making things pretty, we're figuring out systems.

251
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,684
So trick number two is compassion. And I use this word because empathy is a bit of a buzz

252
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:33,308
word right now. And I just want to note what the definition of that is. It's the feeling that

253
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:38,211
arises when you are confronted with another suffering and you want to actually relieve

254
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:43,515
that suffering. So in 2017, people are much less tolerant regarding things that take up

255
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:47,498
their time. So you want to make sure that you're considering their emotions when you're

256
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:48,518
making design choices.

257
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,820
So figure out ways to keep people engaged without relying on tropes that cause frustration

258
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,101
like grinding.

259
00:14:55,141 --> 00:15:00,943
And you want to also make your game worth playing by ensuring that every piece of complexity

260
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:04,264
that you're putting into your game is weighed against the value that it provides.

261
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:09,005
So usually what UX designers do is prioritize the most important features and either de-scope

262
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:10,666
or completely cut out ones that don't matter.

263
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:15,988
Trick number three is research, which happens at every point of the design process.

264
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:19,728
Because we all make assumptions, and it's really important to kill those assumptions

265
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,009
before they tank your project, basically.

266
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,630
So I'm going to talk about three that I rely on as a designer who makes games.

267
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,191
The first of which is doing competitive analyses.

268
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:35,032
So I make sure that I understand the competitive space before creating solutions by asking

269
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:36,472
things like, who's doing a great job?

270
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:38,033
Where's there space for improvement?

271
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,373
And how is our project different?

272
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:41,513
And this helps to provide a great direction for us.

273
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:49,805
Then I do interviews. So I talk to perspective players and I again use that to help me kind of

274
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:53,711
kill my assumptions by asking questions like what kinds of games do you play? Can you

275
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:57,937
recall a time that you quit playing a game and why? Or just watching them play games like mine.

276
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:04,035
And then I get to testing. So once you actually have something built, you can start to test

277
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:09,082
your ideas. And by testing those solutions, you can get data that helps to back the

278
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:13,108
solution that you actually go with in the final version. And you keep testing until the

279
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:14,950
product feels good enough to launch.

280
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:20,928
And then trick number four is sharing. So one of the biggest things that I do as a user

281
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:25,270
experience designer is kill the secrecy because people love to be in their own corners doing

282
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:31,612
their own thing without sharing stuff with each other. But UX is all about transparency. So

283
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:36,754
user experience designers talk to their team very often. They share learnings and work to

284
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:42,456
ensure that everyone is on the same page. And this helps to let people communicate better and

285
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:45,957
work better and deliver work much faster than they would otherwise.

286
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,831
Next it also helps you to get more feedback which is great because everyone thinks

287
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:57,513
differently and you want to make sure that you're figuring out who your audience is and

288
00:16:57,553 --> 00:17:01,074
that feedback can really help you because some of it's not going to be that great to be

289
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:06,116
honest. Some of it's going to be terrible. And then finally it also helps you to get more

290
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:09,958
attention by sharing your progress with the public for example. You can actually get

291
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:14,759
people excited before they actually see the game or actually play it in real life and you

292
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:15,900
can actually use that for feedback.

293
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,573
So that's everything I wanted to cover in this very quick talk. I hope this helps you

294
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:26,596
understand a little bit about what I and other UX designers do every day because every game

295
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:30,800
I've made has benefited from my work as a designer and I'm really excited to see us all

296
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,243
making better, more usable games. So thank you so much and have a great rest of your

297
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:36,064
conference. Yay!

298
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:36,264
Thank you.

299
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,832
Superb. Thank you, Kat.

300
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:49,852
Next on deck, please welcome Darby McDevitt.

301
00:17:58,235 --> 00:17:59,655
Just a quick preface to mine.

302
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,476
I have a couple hyperlinks on some of these slides.

303
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:04,216
I don't expect you to furiously write them down,

304
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:08,438
but take a photo if the subject interests you, or watch it in the poll.

305
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:13,369
Have you ever read A Good Car Chase?

306
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,770
I can't recall where I first heard this question,

307
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,470
but I do remember having more fingers than examples.

308
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:20,611
I know the question is reductive,

309
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:22,391
behind it is the idea that every medium

310
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:24,492
has its own particular expressive power.

311
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:29,653
Books communicate with language,

312
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:31,413
film through visual montage,

313
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,453
music through non-linguistic sound.

314
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,714
So when we consume a piece of media,

315
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:38,134
its form acts as a filter for the kind of meaning

316
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:40,815
we can derive from it, even when the content is similar.

317
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:49,099
Modern video games complicate this filter by scrambling existing forms together.

318
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,100
They are a multi-medium, often with no fixed source of meaning.

319
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,182
Some games are novelistic, some are cinematic, while others flout all conventions.

320
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:58,824
But most games do have a common formal quality.

321
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:06,688
Because of their interactive nature, games are singular in that they communicate meaning through dynamic systems.

322
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:10,410
And by interacting with these systems, players can learn how to recognize them,

323
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,951
how to think about them, and how to change them if need be.

324
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:21,462
We can call this heightened awareness systems literacy.

325
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:24,545
Just as we talk about musical literacy, or visual literacy,

326
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:26,868
or language literacy, systems literacy

327
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,590
is a description of a person's ability

328
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,173
to think abstractly about dynamic systems.

329
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:32,815
Click.

330
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:40,299
In real life, the political and economic and social systems that influence our behavior

331
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,042
can be vast, vague, and almost invisible to us.

332
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:47,547
And when they break down or fail us in some way, we don't always comprehend the scope

333
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:48,888
or the shape of the problem.

334
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:50,029
For example...

335
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:57,569
In the 1960s, French sociologist Maurice Duvorger observed that two-party political systems

336
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:01,770
were often an emergent property of win-and-take-all elections in single-seat districts.

337
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,692
In other words, America's voting system has created its two parties.

338
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:12,034
Political scientists know this statistical effect, but there is little mainstream discussion

339
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:16,856
of it, resulting in those who argue that strengthening third parties in the USA is only a matter

340
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:17,816
of voter willpower.

341
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,517
If we only voted our conscience, then we could fix it.

342
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:28,833
But this is wrong. To produce real change, we'll need to amend our voting laws in ways

343
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:33,475
that foster multiple parties. Unfortunately, this level of abstract thinking doesn't come

344
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:37,377
naturally to many people, but a well-designed game could make this abundantly clear.

345
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:41,560
And that's a great website if you want to see it. Oops.

346
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:46,734
Desire paths are another common example of a lack of systems literacy.

347
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:48,474
We've all seen situations like this.

348
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:52,656
Desire paths occur when the system we design does not adequately serve the needs of the

349
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:53,376
people using it.

350
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,656
But this failure can be instructive.

351
00:20:57,217 --> 00:21:00,858
When we have a direct experience with dynamic systems, we can think more clearly about how

352
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:02,619
they affect us and how we can affect them.

353
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,359
This is Michigan University.

354
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:08,480
All the walkways on this campus began as desire paths that were later paved over.

355
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:13,887
As game developers, we're all familiar with this process.

356
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,989
We design, we experiment, we test, we redesign.

357
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,592
And at the end of this process, if we've been vigilant, we haven't just made a game,

358
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:24,455
we've built a small system that can tell our players something true about the world.

359
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:30,239
Games are good at teaching large-scale systems in meaningful ways.

360
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,842
When I play Pandemic, I don't just learn about exponential disease propagation,

361
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:35,863
I manipulate it.

362
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:40,486
And when I play Twilight Struggle, I participate in a zero-sum Cold War conflict.

363
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:46,415
What thrills me about our industry is that we can take this process much further.

364
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:55,222
We can explore political, economic, and social systems, combine them, and infuse them with empathy and style in a way that poses difficult questions.

365
00:21:57,604 --> 00:22:01,607
Does Bioshock's gameplay critique Randian objectivism or miss the point entirely?

366
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,170
How does Fallout 4's survival mode fundamentally alter a player's behavior?

367
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,992
Does Spore champion evolution or creationism?

368
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:10,594
Should Bungie have gotten rid of Destiny's loot cave?

369
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:17,246
As a novel, Papers, Please might have been one of a thousand moderately interesting Cold War stories,

370
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:21,589
but as a game, players participate directly in an indifferent bureaucracy,

371
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,752
which on its surface seems a model of efficient protocol.

372
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:32,097
As a film, This War of Mine might have won an Oscar for best set design and costume design,

373
00:22:32,677 --> 00:22:37,901
but as a game, it implicates its audience in the daily struggle to balance an individual's need to survive

374
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:41,023
against his or her desire for trust and community.

375
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:46,627
I recently played this wonderfully infuriating game to build a better mouse trap.

376
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:52,633
It's a very sober look at the near impossibility of treating laborers humanely in an economic

377
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:56,497
system that prioritizes constant economic growth.

378
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:03,350
This is only a sample of course. Consider all the subjects that would be best served

379
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:09,312
not by a story but through a dynamic system. Evolution, climate change, institutional racism,

380
00:23:09,713 --> 00:23:13,794
the war on drugs, mental health issues, even subprime mortgage lending.

381
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:19,251
Unfortunately, we do live in interesting times.

382
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:21,594
Interesting and increasingly complicated times.

383
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:24,257
But this complication can be upset by the work that we do.

384
00:23:24,598 --> 00:23:26,420
Through systems literacy, we can teach players

385
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,184
how to navigate a world full of intricate and dynamic systems

386
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:31,447
that are guiding us, whether we know it or not,

387
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:32,348
into the future.

388
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:33,170
Thanks.

389
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,070
Thank you so much Darby.

390
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,830
Now she's a little bit husky.

391
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,571
I'm sure some of you are losing your voice after a week,

392
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:54,032
half a week of hollering, but please welcome Giselle Rosman.

393
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:58,373
APPLAUSE

394
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:01,734
I'll just check that you can actually hear me before Richard leaves.

395
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:05,634
My apologies profusely, but let's do this.

396
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,695
Hi, I'm Giselle and I've never been so nervous in my life.

397
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:12,199
Thanks for inviting me along, Richard.

398
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,299
I'm not a game designer.

399
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,100
I don't even know how to make a game.

400
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:20,702
But I can tell you about making spaces and communities

401
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:22,403
both locally and globally.

402
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:24,744
I've been a strange,

403
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:26,464
you're not a real game dev person

404
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:28,225
in games for about 10 years now.

405
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:30,386
I fell into it through love.

406
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,787
Specifically, my husband's best man

407
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,808
offered me a job at a games educator in 2007.

408
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:38,049
Things kind of snowballed from there.

409
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,764
Australia's been making games for quite a while.

410
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:45,585
The Hobbit, an illustrated text adventure published in 1982,

411
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:48,665
is recognised as Australia's first major title.

412
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:52,726
It was made at Melbourne House, where I also got started in games.

413
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:57,787
From then on, we kept making games, some of them rather good.

414
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:00,587
Most of them as work for hire to US publishers,

415
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:03,188
thanks to our cultural similarities in the low Aussie dollar.

416
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,788
It was a classic studio set up,

417
00:25:06,328 --> 00:25:09,349
where it was all about NDAs and secrecy in silos.

418
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:16,019
And then, and then the GFC hit, the dollar strengthened and most publishers pulled out of Australia.

419
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,662
We lost around 70% of our industry between 2008 and 2010.

420
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:26,544
Those who remained did so because games are their love and their passion.

421
00:25:26,844 --> 00:25:27,364
It was rough.

422
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:30,166
Well, fuck. Let's go to the pub.

423
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:36,827
I rebooted IGDA Melbourne in 2009 to make a space where at least we could commiserate

424
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:38,708
and maybe even collaborate.

425
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:43,310
Good things can happen at pubs.

426
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,692
At the pub and in the park and online we learned we're stronger together.

427
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:49,993
We developed a community of sharing.

428
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:54,554
We realised we're not in competition with each other and our neighbours' success can

429
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,255
actually help with our own success.

430
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:00,997
Hands up if you've played any of these games.

431
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,963
The App Store opening in 2008 was also a stroke of luck

432
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,924
that Australian Game Dev capitalised on,

433
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:11,647
but mostly it was classic guts and determination that kept us going

434
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:13,589
and yielded some impressive results.

435
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,072
Crossy Road would never have happened

436
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:19,574
if it weren't for supporting emerging dev developers

437
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:23,017
and having industry veterans who aren't locked away in ivory towers.

438
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:25,218
Thanks to a scholarship program,

439
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:27,760
Andy Sum met Matt Hall at GCAP in 2013

440
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:30,363
and went on to form Hipster Whale.

441
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:36,114
Through IGDA, Melbourne, I discovered Global Game Jam and Melbourne joined in 2011.

442
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:42,120
As I got more involved globally, I got to watch, learn from and encourage some of the

443
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,105
most diverse collaborations across borders, races and religions.

444
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:48,608
The language of play is universal.

445
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:54,650
The number of people across the world it takes to make a game jam like Global is nothing

446
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,690
short of inspiring.

447
00:26:56,151 --> 00:27:02,015
With 800 organisers in a slack and everyone working together with their strengths together,

448
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:03,436
magic can be made.

449
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,992
This year again was our biggest, and I'd even say smoothest, jam.

450
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,554
We came together and made good things happen.

451
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:15,777
But it was also in some ways unusual, given the backdrop of the US inauguration weekend,

452
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:18,379
which looked a little bit more like...

453
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:19,579
Whoa.

454
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,502
We made games on inauguration day and continued while women marched,

455
00:27:24,902 --> 00:27:26,263
and it felt like the world burned.

456
00:27:27,164 --> 00:27:31,146
We did what devs do when we expressed ourselves in the universal medium of games.

457
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,508
It was a nice shield for a bit, to be honest.

458
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:40,939
The jam ended and reality set in, but my reality includes communities keen to organise spaces

459
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:44,021
for collaboration, innovation and experimentation.

460
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:48,905
We can use our craft to create our own realities and influence those around us.

461
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:55,166
We can share our craft, we can empower and amplify voices.

462
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:57,828
Not always heard.

463
00:27:57,848 --> 00:28:02,091
I want to hear those stories, I want to see them, I want to play them

464
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:05,253
and I want to make spaces and have them made for them.

465
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,856
Here are my challenges to you.

466
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:11,958
Lift up and amplify the quiet voices.

467
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:14,099
This made me laugh when I was practising today.

468
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,302
The underrepresented voices.

469
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:20,684
Help them be heard and teach them the language of games.

470
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,190
Don't treat the games economy as finite.

471
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:29,552
Your neighbour's success can help your success.

472
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:31,173
So help each other out.

473
00:28:31,573 --> 00:28:35,495
You can share ideas and resources and support others.

474
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:38,797
When we all make games, the pie gets bigger.

475
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,289
Come and visit us in October, see for yourself.

476
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:45,610
Meet our amazing and clever, talented games community

477
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,811
that struggled and worked together to create a successful and sustainable sector.

478
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:54,153
There's a few of us around at GDC, so just say g'day, we're pretty friendly.

479
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:59,614
Remember, we're stronger together, we're more interesting if we're diverse.

480
00:29:00,094 --> 00:29:03,035
Being part of something bigger than yourself, or even your studio,

481
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:05,516
is the most wonderful and amazing thing.

482
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:09,037
Share, care and collaborate. Thank you.

483
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,450
You're good, mate.

484
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,770
You're good, mate.

485
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:28,291
And Giselle, thanks to you and all of your collaborators for the Global Game Jam.

486
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:48,275
And now, it is my very great pleasure to welcome to the stage the winner of the 2017 Independent Game Festival Award for Excellence in Narrative, Christine Love.

487
00:29:57,793 --> 00:29:59,934
Hi, I'm Christine and I make visual novels.

488
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:03,635
My most recent was Lady Killer in a Bind, an erotic comedy where you pretend to be your

489
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:06,396
twin brother and get into a series of kinky lesbian escapades.

490
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:10,237
You know, it's a game that you play if you're into experimental, non-linear, choice-driven

491
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:12,318
narratives but also really like cute tits.

492
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:16,099
Okay, but seriously, I'm the writing half of Love, Congress, All Games.

493
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:19,280
Before I got into games, I originally wrote novels and short fiction.

494
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,162
I believe that games are an incredibly powerful storytelling medium and that when making games,

495
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:24,322
the narrative should come first.

496
00:30:24,842 --> 00:30:25,903
And I'm sure when you hear that you're thinking,

497
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:29,263
oh, so she doesn't think game design is as important as the story, right?

498
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:30,404
No, wrong.

499
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:31,704
Game design is the story.

500
00:30:31,944 --> 00:30:32,784
They're inseparable.

501
00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:35,445
Player interactions are how the story is told.

502
00:30:35,945 --> 00:30:38,766
So I'm going to talk about the most important to me

503
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,987
and very neglected fundamental unit of game design and storytelling, pacing.

504
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:45,168
Everything else is just built on that.

505
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,722
We've always thought about things structurally, but it's especially important in a comedy like Lady Killer.

506
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:54,784
The best description I've seen of what makes comedy funny is simply doing what's unexpected.

507
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:57,766
You can't subvert expectations without first creating them.

508
00:30:58,086 --> 00:31:01,608
And you create expectations by creating a structure that the player understands.

509
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:06,171
If the player doesn't understand your structure, or worse,

510
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:10,193
if you're just playing everything by feel while writing and don't have one, they get restless.

511
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:14,096
They start anticipating the next choice and stop paying attention to everything in between.

512
00:31:15,346 --> 00:31:16,687
Worse, they get bored.

513
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:20,528
You could just break it up by having lots of small choices, of course.

514
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:21,629
Plenty of games do this.

515
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:22,869
Long explanation.

516
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:23,310
Pause.

517
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,290
But, Hero, what do you think of that?

518
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:26,711
This is bad, too.

519
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:30,313
It comes across as needy, as if the person you're talking to is desperate for your opinion.

520
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:31,773
I would never do that.

521
00:31:34,384 --> 00:31:35,725
No, that's a lie. I absolutely would.

522
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,828
The quiz is only good if it's conveying character.

523
00:31:39,108 --> 00:31:41,389
It's weird if everyone cares about your opinion.

524
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,431
It's meaningful if one person cares a lot.

525
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:47,234
But in order to actually pull this off, you need to be flexible about your choices.

526
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:53,125
In Lady Killer, we developed a unique dialogue system.

527
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:55,487
Choices appear as they occur to the protagonist,

528
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:58,128
and they disappear as they're no longer relevant to the conversation.

529
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:01,250
This gives a more naturalistic feeling to the pace of conversation,

530
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,712
and it also gives us a lot of flexibility in how we build sets of choices.

531
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:09,574
Players learn quickly that they don't always have to say something

532
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,575
the moment a choice appears.

533
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:12,716
It's really hard to write for this system, by the way.

534
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,337
We had to iterate a lot before we learned how to make this work.

535
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:18,799
Here's just a few examples of some techniques that we discovered

536
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:19,880
that work with this.

537
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:31,358
So the first thing that appears on screen is always the impulsive response, the one

538
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:32,759
where you fly off half-cocked.

539
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,401
It's something that's always tempting to say.

540
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:40,786
But it also leaves the player waiting to see if something better will come up.

541
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:43,509
For example, will a more witty rejoinder come to mind as they wait?

542
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:47,212
We tie these into the game system so there's a risk-reward element involved.

543
00:32:47,553 --> 00:32:49,875
We don't want the player to feel like there's always one correct approach.

544
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:51,796
Sometimes waiting doesn't pay off.

545
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,835
With this particular character, the athlete, he's always egging you on. He's the kind of guy

546
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:05,718
who will just dominate a conversation if you let him. And later on he'll just straight up talk

547
00:33:05,938 --> 00:33:11,443
over you without even giving you time to interject. But if you're silent all the time,

548
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:15,567
that's suspicious. He thinks it's weird that you're being so quiet. So in conversations with

549
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:18,589
him, you can't be defensive. You don't want to fly up half cocked. But if you don't say

550
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:22,873
something, you'll never even manage to get an award in edgewise. The player feels like they

551
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:24,875
have to be aggressive while talking with him.

552
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:30,330
However, in other situations, silence can be a meaningful choice too.

553
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:35,171
If you're quiet in a romantic one-on-one conversation, the person you're talking to will acknowledge

554
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:35,371
that.

555
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:38,552
Often it's even treated as a specific statement.

556
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:44,153
Sometimes it conveys uncertainty.

557
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:47,294
Other times it conveys a trust to let the other person take charge.

558
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:52,175
It depends on the context and it depends on when the choices appear at all.

559
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:02,469
Or you can have someone who asks you questions one-on-one all the time and that comes across

560
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:03,550
as being very needy.

561
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,752
Suddenly it's a lot more meaningful if only one person does that.

562
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:11,055
All these different types of interaction pacings tell you different things about the character

563
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:11,856
that you're talking to.

564
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:16,832
The whole reason why you have these rules is to break them.

565
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:20,834
Think of the structures you're creating as a toolbox for evoking emotions.

566
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:23,635
If you set up the player to expect things to go a certain way,

567
00:34:24,015 --> 00:34:25,576
then you undermine that expectation.

568
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:26,497
It'll stand out more.

569
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:27,597
It'll have dramatic effect.

570
00:34:28,077 --> 00:34:29,018
Maybe it can even be funny.

571
00:34:30,578 --> 00:34:32,139
All this applies on a larger scale, too.

572
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,781
We build conversations out of choices, build scenes out of conversations,

573
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,201
and build character arcs out of scenes.

574
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,942
I'm not going to go into detail about this,

575
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:41,724
but everything I've said about pacing applies to these larger units, too.

576
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:44,005
But the base unit is the interaction.

577
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:49,247
That is to say, the story itself is built out of interactions.

578
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:51,727
And everything that you present to the player

579
00:34:51,787 --> 00:34:53,587
is just there to bring them to the next interaction.

580
00:34:54,068 --> 00:34:55,928
By pacing things in an expected way,

581
00:34:55,948 --> 00:34:57,888
they'll anticipate and look forward

582
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,729
to the next time they get to provide input.

583
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:05,050
Let the player feel involved because their anticipation

584
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,810
matches the protagonist's anticipation

585
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,570
of providing input.

586
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:09,811
All those interactions, all those things

587
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,271
that the player anticipates, that's

588
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:12,351
where you put those things that matter.

589
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:14,252
That's how you tell a story using pacing

590
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,192
as your fundamental unit.

591
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:15,852
Thank you.

592
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:31,440
kind of had a feeling that Christine would play around with the format and do fun things.

593
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,423
Please welcome Stone LeBrand.

594
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:46,549
Thank you. I'd like to spend the next five minutes talking to you about heartbeats and

595
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:50,091
games. But I'm not going to be talking about the heartbeat of the person playing the game,

596
00:35:50,411 --> 00:35:54,233
but the game itself. The underlying rhythms that are present in all games.

597
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:02,281
Before I start talking about game rhythms, let me first tell you a brief story about a rhythm

598
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:06,843
game. As you can see by my upgraded controller, I was pretty serious about rock band drumming.

599
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:14,067
At some point I realized I should just learn to play real drums instead of pretending. So I

600
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:18,309
found an instructor and started taking lessons. After teaching me the basics, he assigned me

601
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:22,871
my first full song. Without any prior experience, I thought the notation was difficult to

602
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,773
read, so I decided to fix it in my own way.

603
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:34,675
I recorded a video of the song in Rock Band and ran it through a slit scan. This is a

604
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:38,137
process that grabs a bottom row of pixels from each frame and then stacks them next

605
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:46,502
to each other. It flattened out Rock Band's perspective grid into a top-down view. I cleaned

606
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:50,465
up the raw output and was excited to show my instructor how I had modernized traditional

607
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:56,449
drum notation and made it much easier to read. He just shook his head and said, why are you

608
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:57,529
wasting your time doing this?

609
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:02,027
You could have been spending all that time learning to read real drum notation instead.

610
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,469
So that was kind of sad.

611
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:09,053
But all that time spent analyzing and notating a rock band song made me wonder if I could

612
00:37:09,113 --> 00:37:10,574
use this process on other games.

613
00:37:11,114 --> 00:37:14,738
Could I find a notation system that would allow me to see rhythms in other games in

614
00:37:14,758 --> 00:37:18,481
the same way an EKG allows a doctor to see and visualize heartbeats?

615
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,361
One common timing visualization for games is called the game

616
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:25,344
onion. This is a way of organizing player activities

617
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:29,186
into nested rings based on time periods. This is helpful, but I

618
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:31,868
find the circular shape to be suboptimal since it makes it

619
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:35,110
very difficult to actually measure time. I prefer to

620
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,792
flatten the rings out into horizontal tracks similar to a

621
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:40,774
standard timeline. This lets me zoom in and out at the various

622
00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:43,656
time scales while still keeping the overall sequencing

623
00:37:43,676 --> 00:37:44,757
relationships intact.

624
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:54,156
Here's a real world example. This is the heartbeat of the New England Patriots football team.

625
00:37:54,836 --> 00:37:59,877
The season to season is at the top, week to week for the 2016 season in the middle, and

626
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:03,558
minute to minute at the Super Bowl last month as the ball moved back and forth across the

627
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:07,599
field. I was curious to see the difference in rhythm

628
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,900
of the Super Bowl using the game clock of one hour versus the real time clock of about

629
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,701
four hours. Here you can see the gaps that are created by timeouts, the halftime show,

630
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:17,681
and commercial breaks.

631
00:38:22,237 --> 00:38:26,199
Now let's apply the same technique to the video game Pac-Man. I chose this game because it's

632
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,560
relatively simple and it has a strong rhythmic pattern. I hadn't played it in over 20 years,

633
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:39,684
so I downloaded an emulator and I started recording my games. Here's the second to second

634
00:38:39,724 --> 00:38:43,845
diagram showing one of my early five minute games. Points per second, which is a rough

635
00:38:43,885 --> 00:38:47,386
approximation of the player's excitement level, is along the vertical axis.

636
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:52,512
Notice the peaks. That's when the ghosts turn blue and you can combo them for bonus points.

637
00:38:54,895 --> 00:38:59,860
But Pac-Man isn't about just one game. It's a series of games over time. At the minute to

638
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,004
minute scale you play multiple games while slowly learning the patterns. At the session to

639
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:08,089
session scale it's not about the most points. Achieving higher levels becomes the

640
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:08,929
motivating driver.

641
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:16,980
Let's do a similar analysis of a completely different game, Resident Evil 4. This is a

642
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:22,184
third person horror game that I played obsessively and I analyzed for the ETC's well played

643
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:29,729
journal. The primary mode of the game is the campaign, but I had a lot more fun with the

644
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:34,973
mercenaries mini game. In this mode you try to earn five stars on 20 different challenges

645
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:38,516
using five unique characters on four custom maps.

646
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,891
It usually took me about two hours to beat each challenge with five stars. In the beginning

647
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:51,552
you die quickly, but with practice your score increases. Notice how the scoring system makes

648
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:55,593
it relatively easy to get to four stars, but it takes a lot of extra work to get to five.

649
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:03,154
An individual game might last about five minutes. The blue areas are when you score, or when

650
00:40:03,174 --> 00:40:07,675
you collect a power-up and you multiply your score for a short time. Your score also increases

651
00:40:07,735 --> 00:40:10,496
if you kill enemies quickly and grow your combo multiplier.

652
00:40:15,228 --> 00:40:18,933
Even though Pac-Man and Mercenaries are completely different thematically, it's interesting to

653
00:40:18,993 --> 00:40:23,118
note how they share several common low-level rhythms, the session-to-session growth that's

654
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:26,903
caused by pattern memorization, and the bursts of excitement that occur when you collect

655
00:40:26,943 --> 00:40:27,564
a bonus item.

656
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:34,514
I think this visualization technique is interesting for analyzing existing games, but I'm more

657
00:40:34,554 --> 00:40:38,496
interested in using it for games that are in development by mapping out the timings

658
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:44,200
first and then tuning, using telemetry, the game appropriately to match the desired rhythms.

659
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:46,562
I hope to give another talk about this in the future.

660
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:49,904
So I know that's a lot of information to cram into five minutes.

661
00:40:50,485 --> 00:40:53,867
These slides are all available on my website if you would like to review them at your own

662
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:54,127
rhythm.

663
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:54,868
Thank you.

664
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:08,835
Two totally different approaches to game rhythm and pacing.

665
00:41:08,895 --> 00:41:10,196
I love GDC people.

666
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:13,159
Please welcome Meg Jayanth.

667
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:23,909
So yeah, before I begin, I kind of wanted to say that I feel like my talk is the evil

668
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:26,752
alternate universe version of Darby's talk from earlier.

669
00:41:27,412 --> 00:41:29,094
By which I mean my talk is about goatees.

670
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:30,655
It's not.

671
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:38,869
So John Scalzi once famously called the real world a role-playing game, but earlier this

672
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:44,151
year I realized it's actually a free-to-play nightmare, demanding microtransaction after

673
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:48,193
microtransaction until that final inevitable unscalable paywall.

674
00:41:49,283 --> 00:41:54,126
And I came to that realisation about two weeks and five hours into my needlessly and almost

675
00:41:54,226 --> 00:42:00,110
inexplicably complicated adventure in attempting to renew my Indian passport in India.

676
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,794
I was standing in a queue in front of an office door for the third time in two weeks and I

677
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:05,554
thought to myself...

678
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:07,636
I should have just bribed someone.

679
00:42:07,656 --> 00:42:09,998
It would have made the process much easier.

680
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:12,841
And I had this moment of clarifying rage.

681
00:42:13,061 --> 00:42:15,603
That is exactly the effect they wanted to create.

682
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:17,505
Bureaucracy is grind.

683
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:23,910
What I had seen as inefficiency, a broken or ill-functioning system, was actually working

684
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,331
exactly as intended.

685
00:42:25,832 --> 00:42:28,174
My frustration had been commoditized.

686
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:32,639
They wanted me to question whether it was worth it to tell the truth and pay the price.

687
00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:36,042
To buy back my time and my soul from them in increments.

688
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:40,047
And as a game designer, at least around the edges, that felt so familiar.

689
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:44,609
Many of us in this room have made a game that does this to players, or we know someone that has,

690
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:48,030
or at the very least, we have played a game that does this.

691
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:57,773
It felt so terrifying to realize that the same design techniques that sustain abusively monetized or designed games

692
00:42:58,194 --> 00:43:00,494
sustain institutional corruption.

693
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:03,856
And it was a connection that I just, I couldn't unsee.

694
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:10,882
So, I didn't get my passport that day, but then I did go home and buy a horse in Elder

695
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:11,562
Scrolls Online.

696
00:43:11,942 --> 00:43:12,903
Bear with me, it's relevant.

697
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:18,608
So it would have taken me hours of play to get enough in-game money, so I paid real world

698
00:43:18,668 --> 00:43:19,849
money for my mounch instead.

699
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:25,434
But that didn't trigger the same rage and feeling of being taken advantage of that I felt in that passport office.

700
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:29,137
And that's because the game was entirely playable at my level without a horse.

701
00:43:29,577 --> 00:43:30,998
It was just slightly easier with one.

702
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:35,962
And I was privileged enough to have five pounds but not five hours, so I made that choice.

703
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:41,366
So I want to be clear that I don't think that monetization is in itself a bad thing or always corrupt.

704
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:43,308
Elder Scrolls stayed classy, I thought.

705
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:47,371
So I believe that you can design games ethically and make money,

706
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:50,013
but a clever friend of mine once said,

707
00:43:50,613 --> 00:43:52,535
yes, but maybe not as much money.

708
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:55,077
And I'm not going to stand up here and characterize

709
00:43:55,137 --> 00:43:57,318
wanting to make money as absolutely morally corrupt.

710
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,400
I too like being able to pay my bills.

711
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,262
But I do think it's important to say that many of the designers

712
00:44:02,382 --> 00:44:04,864
making games that do monetization and free-to-play

713
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:07,906
and good design ethically have done so knowing

714
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:11,009
that they could be squeezing more money out of their players,

715
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:12,350
at least for a while.

716
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:14,474
But the thing is they don't.

717
00:44:14,994 --> 00:44:18,254
And that is not an inefficiency or naivete,

718
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:20,475
but a deliberate design choice.

719
00:44:20,835 --> 00:44:23,236
Exploitative design is a choice too.

720
00:44:23,316 --> 00:44:24,456
It isn't inevitable.

721
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:27,617
And we are abdicating our moral responsibility

722
00:44:27,777 --> 00:44:30,897
as artists and human beings if we pretend that it is.

723
00:44:31,277 --> 00:44:33,318
When we use that excuse as designers,

724
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:36,899
we are in some small but real ways training our players

725
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:39,979
to accept broken and disrespectful systems

726
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:41,600
and ideas by normalizing them.

727
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,166
What we train our players to do in games leaks out into the real world.

728
00:44:46,927 --> 00:44:50,312
So there is a porous boundary between games and the world in which we live.

729
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:55,399
Game design and the thinking that comes with it, all of these things, are already influencing

730
00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:55,740
the world.

731
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,022
But unfortunately...

732
00:44:57,022 --> 00:45:02,046
Unfortunately, what is out there is the most banal game design at its most exploitative

733
00:45:02,087 --> 00:45:09,053
and capitalistic, reinforcing the worst practices, all sanctified on the holy altar of optimization.

734
00:45:09,494 --> 00:45:14,399
But I do also genuinely believe that we are at a moment that is full of the possibility

735
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:14,859
of change.

736
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:21,270
A lot of people, so many people that would have not had the vocabulary to talk about

737
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:26,096
systems and institutions actually do these days because they play games.

738
00:45:26,536 --> 00:45:30,941
When we talk about a class being nerfed or overpowered, we're actually just talking about

739
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:31,362
privilege.

740
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:37,025
And so as designers and players, we are in this space of unprecedented literacy

741
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:39,247
about systems thinking and design.

742
00:45:39,647 --> 00:45:44,510
These are the tools that helped me understand my own feelings of anger and helplessness

743
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,211
sitting in that passport office.

744
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:49,413
And these are the tools that I use to take that helplessness

745
00:45:49,854 --> 00:45:54,637
and turn it into a conversation with you in this room and outside of it.

746
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:57,618
Games can help us understand the world and each other.

747
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,341
And as designers of games and narratives and art.

748
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:09,111
We have so many opportunities to completely, radically reimagine how systems could work.

749
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:16,982
Democracies and dictatorships, bureaucracies and social and cultural institutions, these are hard to change.

750
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:21,725
And I'm really not here to suggest that games can change the world all on their own,

751
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:25,428
but they can change how a person feels and thinks.

752
00:46:26,088 --> 00:46:27,629
We wouldn't be here otherwise.

753
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:33,653
And games are a space, a creative, open, and as yet largely undefined space.

754
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:40,498
Where we can experiment with different ways of being, interacting, participating, collaborating and competing.

755
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:50,424
So that when history asks us, what did you do in this moment, at this particular time and place, with all the possibilities available to you?

756
00:46:51,064 --> 00:46:54,506
I don't want my answer to be, I made a slot machine.

757
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:55,767
Thank you.

758
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,353
Thank you very much indeed, Meg.

759
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:16,938
For our penultimate micro-talk of this evening, please welcome Brie Code.

760
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:32,891
So, I find, I love video games, but my friends find video games boring.

761
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:38,115
Cultural reasons aside, I think there's an underlying physiological reason why they find

762
00:47:38,175 --> 00:47:38,776
games boring.

763
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:41,684
I think it has something to do with stress reactions.

764
00:47:44,386 --> 00:47:48,288
When you're playing a video game and lots of things are flashing on screen and there's

765
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:52,131
danger and it's shocking and it's fun, that's a fight or flight reaction.

766
00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:56,875
Your sympathetic nervous system kicks in and adrenaline is released through your system

767
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:57,855
followed by dopamine.

768
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:04,375
And if you enjoy games like this, it's probably because adrenaline and dopamine are really fun.

769
00:48:04,955 --> 00:48:09,038
Adrenaline makes your pupils dilate, your heart beats faster, like mine is right now,

770
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:12,621
your airways open up and you feel exhilarated, you feel alive.

771
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:21,707
But I think my friends find games boring not only because they aren't interested in more stories about white men,

772
00:48:22,147 --> 00:48:24,449
and not only because they don't know how the controls work,

773
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:27,091
but also because they don't get an adrenaline high.

774
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:29,152
They have a different reaction to stress.

775
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:37,037
This is my cousin, Christina. Maybe a couple of you remember her from a thing I wrote earlier

776
00:48:37,137 --> 00:48:41,701
called Video Games are Boring. Christina is one of my friends who finds video games boring.

777
00:48:42,441 --> 00:48:47,986
What she loves instead are contemporary feminist art, vegan food, and longboarding with her

778
00:48:48,066 --> 00:48:53,771
friends. A few years ago, Christina was given a PS3 and I recommended that she play my favorite

779
00:48:53,812 --> 00:48:58,636
game, Skyrim. I didn't hear from her for three weeks, and I thought she didn't play it.

780
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:03,677
Then one evening she called me crying because she had accidentally killed Lydia.

781
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,903
Christina finds video games boring.

782
00:49:08,398 --> 00:49:09,659
But she loved Skyrim.

783
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:15,062
She isn't interested in medieval warfare or swords or dragons whatsoever, and she found

784
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:15,903
the controls hard.

785
00:49:16,503 --> 00:49:18,964
But she loved Skyrim because she loved the characters.

786
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:22,327
Christina doesn't like being shocked, but she loves taking care.

787
00:49:22,867 --> 00:49:26,749
She loved creating her character, doing quests for other characters, joining guilds, and

788
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,530
bringing Lydia along on her adventures.

789
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:32,773
She said to me that it turns out that it wasn't that she didn't like video games.

790
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:35,255
It was that she didn't know what video games could be.

791
00:49:37,453 --> 00:49:41,337
Christina doesn't like adrenaline, but with Skyrim there's something similar that was

792
00:49:41,397 --> 00:49:42,578
probably going on with her.

793
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:44,720
It's called tend and befriend.

794
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:50,405
Like fight or flight, tend and befriend is an automatic physiological reaction to stress.

795
00:49:53,413 --> 00:49:57,459
If you experience tendon bifurcation, your body releases oxytocin or vasopressin when

796
00:49:57,479 --> 00:49:59,262
you are threatened, followed by opioids.

797
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:03,429
This calms your sympathetic nervous system so you don't get the flood of adrenaline.

798
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,736
Instead of wanting to fight or to flee, you stay relatively calm but aware.

799
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:12,981
Your pupils dilate, you become fearless, and you are less sensitive to pain.

800
00:50:13,661 --> 00:50:17,825
You instinctively want to protect your loved ones and to seek out your allies and form

801
00:50:17,865 --> 00:50:18,586
new alliances.

802
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:23,810
Oxytocin intensifies social feelings, and opioids feel really, really good.

803
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:28,934
And the oxytocin opioid thing isn't limited to threatening interactions.

804
00:50:29,615 --> 00:50:34,159
It's also there when you touch or even think about someone you love, when you play fetch

805
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:37,121
with your dog, or even when you exclude someone you don't like.

806
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:43,600
When I read about Tendon Befriend, I was like,

807
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,521
shit, this is how I usually react to stress.

808
00:50:46,482 --> 00:50:47,663
Most of my friends do too.

809
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:50,325
Most women and many men have this reaction,

810
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:51,586
but have you heard of it before?

811
00:50:52,106 --> 00:50:54,208
Maybe not, because it's barely been studied.

812
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:56,049
It's barely been discussed.

813
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,132
It's barely just been identified at UCLA in 2000.

814
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:03,475
Like much other research, most stress research

815
00:51:03,515 --> 00:51:05,737
had been done with men and with male animals.

816
00:51:06,457 --> 00:51:08,659
Researchers traditionally prefer bodies

817
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:09,820
that don't menstruate.

818
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,521
Maybe everything we know about ourselves is wrong.

819
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:17,462
We see these kinds of mistakes also in the design of cities,

820
00:51:17,902 --> 00:51:20,003
the design of airbags, etc.

821
00:51:20,063 --> 00:51:24,044
And a games researcher once told me that his team also doesn't try to study women

822
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:26,584
because, in his words, you can't predict women.

823
00:51:27,725 --> 00:51:30,085
This is really fucking boring.

824
00:51:30,105 --> 00:51:35,327
A woman I very much respect, though, told me that you can't change the world,

825
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:37,207
but you can make your little corner of it better.

826
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,755
I'm bored of patriarchy and its lasting effects on my life,

827
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:44,896
but I'm very interested in looking at the gaps in research and in design and fixing them.

828
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:45,917
Are you?

829
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:48,397
What is game design missing?

830
00:51:48,437 --> 00:51:51,379
I ask this question not just in terms of cultural elements,

831
00:51:51,419 --> 00:51:53,820
such as diverse protagonists, which are very important,

832
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,381
but also in terms of satisfying game mechanics and game systems.

833
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:02,163
I ask in terms of what we take for granted about play styles, player motivation, etc.,

834
00:52:02,183 --> 00:52:07,105
but also about adrenaline, dopamine, oxytocin, opioids, and other reward systems.

835
00:52:07,726 --> 00:52:10,193
about what it takes to induce a flow state in the player.

836
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:11,857
Who designed these rules?

837
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:13,742
What players are we studying?

838
00:52:14,525 --> 00:52:16,029
And who should we be talking to?

839
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:22,895
And I want to be clear that care is not weak or simple or cute and doesn't only belong

840
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:24,196
in simple or cute games.

841
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:28,922
Caring for your chosen loved ones and the formation of new alliances are sophisticated

842
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,304
actions and can be acts of warfare.

843
00:52:31,965 --> 00:52:34,828
Care is stronger and more interesting than brutality or fear.

844
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:36,590
There's a lot to be explored here.

845
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:37,771
I encourage you to question.

846
00:52:38,332 --> 00:52:41,856
What you take for granted about yourself and other people and about games.

847
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:48,402
And if you are underrepresented, look into your heart because maybe everything we know is wrong, but you are right.

848
00:52:50,144 --> 00:52:50,445
Thank you.

849
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:12,425
Uh, Kat, Bree, Christine, do you want to come up here with me? We'll get started on our last

850
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:18,629
micro talk of the day, uh, which was crowdsourced online from among our networks of friends

851
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:24,252
and from you, the micro talks community. We asked for messages of resistance and hope

852
00:53:25,012 --> 00:53:26,433
and here's what people said.

853
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:37,159
In times of great doubt, you might hear again the voices snickering at your heels.

854
00:53:37,779 --> 00:53:39,140
Games are a waste of time.

855
00:53:39,861 --> 00:53:44,884
But now, like every work of art, games allow us to see further and live a thousand lives.

856
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:54,211
Be soft and open to sharing knowledge with those around you, especially the younger folk.

857
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:58,855
Your wisdom will help fortify their success towards progression and excellence in their fields.

858
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:07,822
It is quite possible to create dramatic internal change with language and symbol.

859
00:54:08,263 --> 00:54:12,087
This change then reverberates into the outer world, reshaping and reorganizing it.

860
00:54:12,527 --> 00:54:13,268
You can use this.

861
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:26,081
In good times and in bad, the desire to create and to play unites us as one human family.

862
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:33,310
Every game is political.

863
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:37,734
Keep making them boldly, with your head and your heart.

864
00:54:38,115 --> 00:54:42,639
There is nothing a tyrant hates more than the sounds of laughter and of play.

865
00:54:48,526 --> 00:54:53,451
The more you tighten your grip, the more the stars distance will slip through your fingers.

866
00:55:00,076 --> 00:55:04,401
Kodum says, I went into 2016 being seen as one gender.

867
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:06,984
Now I'm universally known as another.

868
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:10,449
Trans people in games, you've done so much.

869
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:11,250
Thank you.

870
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:19,828
When life is becoming increasingly harder on the outside,

871
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:23,088
don't forget to cherish your inner creamy caramel filling.

872
00:55:23,568 --> 00:55:25,009
Take a break from your work often

873
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:27,029
and spend your time with good people,

874
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:28,569
good food, and warm blankets.

875
00:55:29,169 --> 00:55:32,190
Make your games to show others what the world could be like,

876
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,090
not as it is.

877
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:41,312
In my mind, a lot of the bad things

878
00:55:41,332 --> 00:55:44,032
we currently have in our world don't stand a chance

879
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,613
in light of what we are capable of

880
00:55:45,653 --> 00:55:46,653
when we work together.

881
00:55:47,728 --> 00:55:49,790
We're stewarding so much influence here,

882
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:52,912
and I'm inspired by you all who live out

883
00:55:53,513 --> 00:55:54,453
the fullness of that.

884
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:00,798
Be compassionate.

885
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:04,642
The growing gap between rich and poor is the root problem.

886
00:56:05,302 --> 00:56:08,024
Resist racism, resist anti-immigration,

887
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,786
and fight for everyone's right to work.

888
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,341
Be generous in prosperity and thankful in adversity.

889
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:21,822
Be worthy of the trust of thy neighbor,

890
00:56:22,142 --> 00:56:24,723
and look upon them with a bright and friendly face.

891
00:56:25,303 --> 00:56:28,144
Be a treasure to the poor, an admonisher to the rich,

892
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:30,164
an answer to the cry of the needy.

893
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:33,686
Be as a lamp unto them that walk in darkness,

894
00:56:34,226 --> 00:56:36,987
a joy to the sorrowful, a sea for the thirsty,

895
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:40,468
a haven for the distressed, an upholder and defender

896
00:56:40,808 --> 00:56:41,848
of the victim of oppression.

897
00:56:47,185 --> 00:56:48,406
Never surrender the dream.

898
00:56:55,491 --> 00:56:58,554
These words are in honor of everyone who couldn't be with us

899
00:56:58,834 --> 00:57:01,436
at GDC this year for every kind of reason.

900
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:05,740
Thanks to everyone who sent in their thoughts for us to share here this

901
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,100
evening.

902
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:10,176
Have a wonderful rest of GDC everyone.

903
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:12,281
Take care of yourselves and each other.

904
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:14,285
Thanks again to all of our speakers

905
00:57:14,706 --> 00:57:15,728
and to thank you for coming.

906
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:17,391
Have a wonderful evening.
