1
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,461
Hi folks.

2
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,182
Okay, my name's Stuart McDonald.

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,423
This is my first ever GDC talk.

4
00:00:18,423 --> 00:00:20,604
In fact, it's my third GDC.

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,666
So I make apologies for the Scottish accent.

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:27,988
I'll try and keep it toned down as much as possible.

7
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,129
So building a visual threshold.

8
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,990
We often employ common or visual tropes

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,511
and pop culture elements into our games.

10
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:39,755
But the question is, why do we employ these visual elements?

11
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:41,776
And what useful effect does it,

12
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,058
that they can have on the audience?

13
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:49,142
So this talk is about this considered use of visual trope

14
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:52,725
and how it can help become a useful tool

15
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:55,227
for the art director in several ways.

16
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:58,369
So first I'll go through my bio and where I'm from.

17
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:04,054
The largest part of my career, after I was an architect,

18
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,552
for several years. I taught in architecture school too.

19
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:13,676
So I moved into environment art. I was at Rockstar for

20
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:17,020
nearly nine years and worked on several of the GTA titles.

21
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,845
I was an environment artist responsible for the countryside on San Andreas

22
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:26,849
and then moved on to GTA 4 and finally I was lead environment artist on GTA 5

23
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:29,372
for roughly half of the production.

24
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:35,789
After 8 or 9 years of making GTA, I decided I wanted to try something else.

25
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:41,032
So, after the initial creation of the world for GTA V,

26
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:46,095
my team was responsible for all the landscape outside of the main city.

27
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:48,096
So, it was quite a big project to start with.

28
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:54,099
After that, I decided I wanted to move to somewhere colder and darker than Scotland.

29
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,680
So, I moved to Finland.

30
00:01:56,547 --> 00:02:04,552
where I was with Remedy Entertainment, you know them for Alan Wake and Max Payne.

31
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:08,094
So I worked on Alan Wake's American Nightmare initially,

32
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:12,357
and then we moved on to a new project and a new IP, Quantum Break,

33
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:13,938
where I started work as Art Director.

34
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:16,439
The interesting thing was it was a...

35
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:20,577
promotion for me, so I was a new art director on a new IP,

36
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:23,638
on a new platform, with an engine with new technologies,

37
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:26,079
so it was something of a challenge.

38
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,400
But there was some really interesting visual challenges

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,100
with this project.

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,681
In pre-production we had things like the,

41
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:33,702
how does time look, give it some physicality.

42
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:35,182
And that's something I'll cover later,

43
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:37,623
because this relates back to the use of common visual tropes.

44
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:40,044
And then lastly, with the quantum break completed,

45
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,890
Only one more year to go, I moved on to try some,

46
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,011
I handed some mobile development.

47
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:53,511
Again, it's a new thing for me,

48
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:55,652
and it's new worlds and new IP to develop.

49
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:58,553
So coming from a world building point of view,

50
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,414
it was going to be an interesting challenge.

51
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,154
So I moved to Play Raven.

52
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:02,754
So a visual threshold.

53
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:06,035
What is a visual threshold?

54
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:08,816
As I said, most of my career has been involved

55
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:10,997
with building worlds.

56
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:13,677
And I wanted to talk about something I would consider

57
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,018
when creating these new places.

58
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,693
not only for finding inspiration for the new elements of the design,

59
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:21,874
but also for introducing the world to the audience.

60
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:26,017
It's the point of where they actually get their visual comprehension

61
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:27,538
when they arrive in the world.

62
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:32,121
So it's a collective set of methods and visual guidance

63
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:37,384
designed to assist the effort and investment the audience has to take

64
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,726
when they become oriented and immersed in the world

65
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:43,148
with the visual design rules that you've created.

66
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:51,034
So it's like Alice through the Looking Glass, or Oz when Dorothy steps through that door.

67
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:55,515
The audience has to spend some time working out how the world works.

68
00:03:55,515 --> 00:04:02,597
One caveat I would say though, I've actually been involved mostly with real world projects,

69
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:05,818
which really helps with audience engagement and comprehension.

70
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:11,679
But all of them have required some degree of investment in player immersion and narrative

71
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:12,200
exposition.

72
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:15,607
Remedy in particular strive for narrative,

73
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,008
cinematic, storytelling action games.

74
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,209
So there's always a strong emphasis

75
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,211
on establishing atmosphere and tone,

76
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,933
which you have to spend some time building

77
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,874
before you get into the real meat of the game.

78
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:26,555
But that said, all game worlds require

79
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:27,836
some visual orientation for the player.

80
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:30,699
So when it comes to world building and immersion,

81
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,440
how do we actually construct these accessible

82
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,441
visual thresholds for the audience?

83
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:47,970
One way, with the help of the arrival in your world,

84
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,992
is to employ visual stereotypes or visual tropes.

85
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:54,654
Visual stereotypes are quite powerful if used carefully,

86
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:58,316
as a stereotype is a container for preconception.

87
00:04:58,316 --> 00:05:01,138
And that's not necessarily a bad thing,

88
00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:04,040
because the use of a pop culture or common element

89
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,941
that taps into audiences' preconceptions

90
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:08,263
can actually be leveraged positively,

91
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:10,644
especially for those projects where we hope

92
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,866
to reach out to a large audience, like a AAA title.

93
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,192
For example, this is a 1973 movie, Westworld.

94
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,854
I mean, hopefully a lot of you have seen this.

95
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,657
And the movie is a future resort of sorts,

96
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:30,481
where visitors actually arrive in this mock historical world

97
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:33,223
that's been created for them to live out their fantasies.

98
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,204
I mean, it's basically a simulation.

99
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:35,945
It's a theme park.

100
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:39,347
And the actors are androids and go on to kill everyone.

101
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:40,788
I mean, that's the storyline.

102
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,372
It's a place where visitors step out of the real world

103
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,434
and are presented with familiar visual tropes

104
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:48,835
in order to live out these fantasies.

105
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:51,677
So it's a really good analogy for a video game.

106
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:52,598
I mean, we do the same thing.

107
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:54,980
We create these worlds, we carefully craft them,

108
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,541
and we can use visual tropes

109
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,463
in order to assist the player's expectations

110
00:05:58,463 --> 00:05:59,744
when they arrive in the world.

111
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:02,106
But that said, I'd say a visual stereotype isn't a cliche.

112
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:12,746
And it's not always clear the difference between the two.

113
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,907
I mean, if you look at the description of a cliche,

114
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,149
it's an expression, idea, or element of an artistic work

115
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,251
which has become overused to the point of losing

116
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:21,471
its original meaning or effect.

117
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:24,593
And that would be a visual element

118
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,914
that's taken on a life of its own.

119
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:28,856
And what it would do is it'd actually weaken

120
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,957
the structure of your visual design for your world.

121
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,159
And it's something you have to be careful with,

122
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,120
but it's definitely something that is different

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,441
from the visual stereotype.

124
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:38,322
Visual stereotype is more of a functional trope

125
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:38,982
that we can use.

126
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,952
The simple test really is to keep in mind when adding these elements is to ask yourself,

127
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:51,193
does this support the visual design rule set that you've created for your world?

128
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:56,915
It's a fuzzy and subjected boundary between cliche and visual stereotype,

129
00:06:56,915 --> 00:07:01,477
but we have to rely on our internal compass as artists to see what is supportive or not.

130
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,707
And they can be interchangeable too.

131
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,808
I mean, one pop culture element in one title

132
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:08,469
will help support the game world design,

133
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,829
whereas it might actually hinder

134
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,230
and fight against the design in another title.

135
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,492
So use that question, always check your work.

136
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:18,533
Especially when After Spring

137
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,114
want to bring something new into the world,

138
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:24,056
you need to have a clearly defined visual rule set for them

139
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:25,156
to do this check with.

140
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:35,463
But some gameplay cliches have actually become so ingrained in our culture and our medium

141
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:37,824
that they've become convention.

142
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:42,787
So these things are dangerous and require too much time to challenge within a project.

143
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:46,149
So I mean, it's okay, red barrels explode, health boxes heal you, that's fine.

144
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,010
Move on and leave them alone.

145
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,251
So in games we have a complex world to communicate.

146
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:58,099
And the use of visual stereotype can communicate

147
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,841
the foundations of these settings,

148
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:02,783
and they help free up the audience's time and energy

149
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,485
to focus on the introduction of new elements,

150
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,927
and then your more unique properties of your world.

151
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,148
I mean, this is a loose diagram,

152
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:13,691
but if you imagine all the parts of a game

153
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:16,473
that you need to explain to the player,

154
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:17,974
as buckets that you've got to fill.

155
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:20,756
If you think of the amount of initial exposition

156
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:22,598
available with the audience is limited,

157
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:30,512
Then you have setting player motivations, character introductions, and gameplay mechanics to teach the player.

158
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:37,036
And to get to the point of player comprehension and immersion within the game can be quite difficult with a limited amount of time.

159
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:44,020
You have, you know, well it depends on the game if it's mobile, you've got seconds almost before the players had enough.

160
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:50,044
And then in a AAA game you've got a few minutes really to really start to embed them in.

161
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:54,380
So if you can't really follow those buckets,

162
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,085
then there's going to be a problem with the player understanding some of the elements of the game.

163
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:04,730
In fact, we're not like the real world, so a lot of the time we have to devote

164
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,232
a lot of the player education to gameplay.

165
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,232
I mean, it's something you don't consider in architecture or film.

166
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:13,513
I mean, we don't have to teach somebody moving into a new building

167
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:15,794
how to use the door and work up the stairs,

168
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:17,734
or how someone how to watch a screen for a film.

169
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:21,255
So, education of how to actually function in a world

170
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:22,215
is going to take a lot of the time.

171
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:25,516
So, whatever the distribution of audience focus

172
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:27,437
at the beginning of your game,

173
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:32,458
the use of the visual stereotypes can actually help fill some of these areas

174
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,719
by allowing them to be partially filled by the preconceptions

175
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,059
they bring to the game world.

176
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:39,375
and also that brings anticipation.

177
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,878
It allows you to spend more time and focus

178
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:45,461
on communicating the more unique aspects of your design.

179
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:46,782
For example, if the player orientates themselves

180
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:51,086
to the world and setting in a quick and efficient manner,

181
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:55,390
we can devote more time to the introduction

182
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,454
and build more interactive plot details within our world.

183
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:11,364
With that extra focus and energy, with the audience, we can start to resolve some of the excessive exposition that we can sometimes use in games.

184
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:15,946
For instance, the 1950s B-movies have this particular staged exposition,

185
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:17,227
scenes where...

186
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:22,227
It's set up for the player, it's almost like a stage set

187
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:27,412
where the actors are actually facing the audience

188
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:28,893
and explaining every detail of the world,

189
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:31,596
even though the characters within that world

190
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:33,658
would actually understand all these rules.

191
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:36,941
So it's something we need to try and avoid in games.

192
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:39,363
Cinema and its audience have largely moved on

193
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:42,106
from this technique for exposition.

194
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:46,651
And as our medium matures, we're seeing more improved approaches

195
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:50,014
that take advantage of a game's unique interactive features

196
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:53,077
and methods for interactive storytelling,

197
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:55,839
such as Gone Home or Firewatch.

198
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,304
They've done particularly good jobs of building environmental storytelling in the world.

199
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:06,709
But looking to movies, a great example of this production design ethos

200
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,231
and world storytelling is with Mad Max.

201
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:14,620
There's a much deeper world and culture than is initially explained to the audience.

202
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,221
In fact, if it had been an older film, you would probably imagine a wall of text

203
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:23,183
or some early scene to describe what had happened to the world.

204
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:23,863
But there isn't.

205
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,544
The viewer is presented with visual information

206
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:31,086
and left to deduct the roles and relationships of the various elements.

207
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,287
They make up the world's backstory and current state.

208
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:36,168
Even if the viewer doesn't wish.

209
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:40,785
to invest the time to focus on, understand those rule sets,

210
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:44,167
present it to them, they can still enjoy the story for what it is.

211
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:48,229
And then in a re-watch, they'll gradually build more into that.

212
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,421
As one example, it's a dystopian future,

213
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:54,121
but with the modern cars of the world, it's just collapsed.

214
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:58,022
I mean, you don't see a souped up Prius driving along.

215
00:11:58,022 --> 00:12:00,383
It's obvious there's a clear style choice there,

216
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,483
but the classic car customization imagery employed

217
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:05,164
is a familiar pop culture element

218
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:08,464
that stands for the hands-on personalization

219
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:10,185
and near worship of the classic automobile.

220
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:13,806
So it would stand well with the audience

221
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:14,846
and gives them some grounding.

222
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,682
the audience can understand how vehicles would exist like that in this world.

223
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,884
Movies often employ visual stereotype as convention

224
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:27,686
to support exposition on a broad scale,

225
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:31,588
to settle the audience into a theme or genre.

226
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:34,970
Often referred to as cliché,

227
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,391
but usually that has a negative connotation.

228
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:40,593
I feel it's often a disservice to some of these common visual elements.

229
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:45,344
It helps movies which have a limited time with its audience to efficiently and effectively

230
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:48,205
communicate the setting of place and historical time.

231
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:53,287
Classic example is in westerns with the use of Monument Valley.

232
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,392
It's been popularised by John Ford in over 50 films,

233
00:12:58,392 --> 00:12:59,994
western themed films,

234
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:05,239
have been filmed in a location to the point it's ingrained in cinema

235
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,921
and stands as a symbol of the Wild West.

236
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,364
It's also been used as a classic visual stereotype in modern films

237
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:14,087
attempting to immediately grasp that western theme.

238
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:22,627
So if you were to make a Western game, of course your audience would likely expect to see this setting depicted in your game world.

239
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:28,690
And it also helps to borrow the history of cinema that have used Western genre.

240
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,813
Another example is you wouldn't expect this to be a setting for a romantic comedy.

241
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:40,376
But The Cabin in the Woods is a classic horror visual stereotype.

242
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:41,736
And it's not necessarily a bad thing.

243
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:45,039
as the preconceptions it carries with it

244
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,620
builds audience anticipation

245
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,701
that something terrible will happen.

246
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:52,103
And that anticipation is part of the emotional currency

247
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:55,545
that the genre traditionally uses to trade for scares.

248
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:58,667
I mean, the setting kickstarts the momentum

249
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,289
and sawtooth emotional path

250
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,370
of the ever-increasing tension and release

251
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,391
that the genre employs.

252
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:04,871
Moving on to games.

253
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:15,345
At the extreme end of this pacing issue, a need for rapid visual comprehension and exposition

254
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:16,605
is mobile games.

255
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:23,329
And with the title we've been developing at PlayRaven, it seems that unlike AAA, any

256
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:28,131
investment in visual introduction to your world for more than a handful of seconds could

257
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:32,033
result in players losing interest and potentially abandoning the game altogether and looking

258
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:32,433
elsewhere.

259
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,542
So Play Raven's Winter State is a vehicle combat strategy game

260
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:44,823
and it's set in the US East Coast after a frozen ecological apocalypse.

261
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:50,845
If you can imagine it, I would describe it as Mad Max meets the day after tomorrow.

262
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:56,567
And it's set on the East Coast with a bit of Frontier West vibe thrown in for good measure.

263
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:01,123
So to create this world, we brought in a consultant writer,

264
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:04,343
and together we created a really rich backstory

265
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:06,364
of a new society and culture that has grown

266
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,624
since the elements froze this world.

267
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:13,025
However, there's a problem communicating much of this,

268
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:16,126
as establishing the setting alone needs to be rapid.

269
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:19,507
And as it isn't your typical mobile game,

270
00:15:19,507 --> 00:15:20,647
I knew we would have to rely on

271
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,647
the use of already established imagery.

272
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:26,337
in order to get a quick message across to the player

273
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:28,939
and use those preconceptions and anticipation

274
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:31,061
to get them into the game world.

275
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:35,404
So looking to movie tradition for inspiration and reference,

276
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:39,627
it made sense to echo Hollywood's longstanding obsession

277
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:41,349
with destroying the Statue of Liberty.

278
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:45,071
The statue's been commonly used icon in Hollywood

279
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:48,114
for representing the collapse of the US or the world

280
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,535
in an apocalyptic event.

281
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,899
from Planet of the Apes' famous final scene

282
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,541
to Flying Liberty's head in Cloverfield.

283
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,702
It's a powerful statement of disaster

284
00:15:57,702 --> 00:16:01,385
and something a broad audience will likely have seen

285
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:03,306
and recognized its use in associations.

286
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:04,166
This was great.

287
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:09,630
It gave us place and event in a single recognizable motif

288
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,692
and gave us some storytelling shorthand

289
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:14,773
for a limited attention span audience.

290
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,615
So we started to develop that in early key art concept art.

291
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,011
And then finally, for the loading screen of the game,

292
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:24,332
the first thing the player sees,

293
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:26,834
it immediately sets up that setting in one shot

294
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:27,695
upon loading the app.

295
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,556
So it's an example of employing a film trope

296
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,857
as a visual stereotype.

297
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,339
It's functional, and it helps with a project

298
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,400
on a critically short time for exposition.

299
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,122
Next I'll come to my work on the pre-production

300
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,603
and visual development for Quantum Break.

301
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:48,145
I'm no longer attached to the project,

302
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:50,726
and it launches in three weeks time on April the 5th.

303
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:53,207
Remedy kindly agreed for me to be able to discuss

304
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:56,488
some of the pre-production phase of the project.

305
00:16:56,488 --> 00:17:01,370
So once the premise of the game and theme had been drawn up,

306
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,271
we started rolling into pre-production.

307
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:07,893
And there was a few standout visual design questions

308
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,033
we had to answer to do with the game's theme.

309
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:13,015
Especially as we knew we had the opportunity

310
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,775
to define unique visual elements.

311
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:17,107
For those of you that don't know,

312
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:19,788
it's a third-person action-adventure game,

313
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,929
and its plot is a time-travel story

314
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:23,490
where time is breaking down,

315
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,631
and it's up to you, as Jack Joyce,

316
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:27,391
to try and save the world from ending.

317
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:31,393
So the main premise required us to show

318
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:33,914
both the player's time-based powers

319
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:36,655
and the effects of an ongoing temporal disaster

320
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,036
throughout the game.

321
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:40,457
And that presented us with one of the most

322
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:43,138
difficult challenges, which was to answer the question,

323
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:44,598
what does time look like?

324
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:50,736
I mean, you can't actually see time, you only see its effects.

325
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:55,819
So some of the easy decisions like setting the game in fall, it was an easy visual metaphor

326
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:59,501
which stands for changing time and one obvious example.

327
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:03,243
But for the VFX, we had to work a lot harder.

328
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:08,726
Since we're creating a game about time manipulation, we had to invent a visual and physical presence

329
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:10,247
for time itself within the game.

330
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:16,667
to create something tangible to show that time is clearly breaking or behaving abnormally

331
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,447
at certain points of the game.

332
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:26,831
The first thing we did was to look at how other art forms handle the representations of time.

333
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:31,413
And it's what you'd call casting the net wide, looking beyond your industry for inspiration,

334
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:33,974
especially on such a tricky theme.

335
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:39,416
We gathered reference from other art forms such as sculpture, painting, photography and video art.

336
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:51,932
to pull a set of visual elements that would form the ingredients for our version of time within the game.

337
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:57,996
Of particular interest was futurist painting and sculpture, slit-scan photography, and some video art.

338
00:18:57,996 --> 00:19:03,940
From this research and reference gathering, we found the broken, multi-state imagery the most compelling.

339
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,884
The first element of our ingredients for time we developed was this prismatic fractured look.

340
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:13,515
It would echo, shear and distort the image on screen.

341
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:16,738
Time was breaking and fracturing in the story.

342
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:22,702
The main events for this breakdown manifest itself are what's termed stutters within the world.

343
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:27,285
They were the world events that would freeze, skip and repeat time,

344
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:32,609
with only a few characters able to move and exist within this dangerous and unstable state.

345
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:36,815
So as a visual metaphor for the moments of broken time,

346
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:39,217
the prismatics could distort and break the world view

347
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:41,078
in a disturbing and violent way,

348
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:44,519
and further help emphasize this threat and spectacle.

349
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,500
However, one issue was that if we employed

350
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,021
purely the prismatics in the world,

351
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,103
it would feel exactly the same,

352
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,704
with the image sheared and distorted,

353
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:55,885
and it would confuse the audience.

354
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:58,307
It would at best be confused,

355
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:00,488
and at worst, it would actually think it was a rendering bug.

356
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:05,416
So now the world would freeze when these broken time events or powers would hit.

357
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,398
But unless there was an obvious moving object,

358
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:12,441
it wouldn't make such a difference in the world state.

359
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:13,982
It was hard to communicate that shift.

360
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:18,245
So we needed a clear transition and shift in the visual perception of the time.

361
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:22,608
Only the main character and others could obviously freely exist in this state,

362
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:26,691
but they also had to do something with the shift in players' vision,

363
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:30,254
because their powers allowed them to perceive and live in this state.

364
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,204
So we followed another period of research

365
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:36,706
into the visual reference gathering.

366
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:37,646
We found something that might work.

367
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:41,790
So we used IR photography.

368
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,432
IR photography has this very brittle,

369
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:48,259
very brittle, frozen feel to the world.

370
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:51,782
And it's also a very strong perceptual change.

371
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:53,844
I mean, the sky turns this indigo color,

372
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:55,206
and trees go pink.

373
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:58,309
I mean, it's some really crazy looking photographs

374
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:02,092
and the frozen elements, like people frozen in time,

375
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:07,097
would have this porcelain look to them.

376
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,680
So in order to do this frozen, desaturated world,

377
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,103
we realized we'd have to actually push the lighting,

378
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:16,746
put more color into the actual real world when time's running.

379
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:20,329
So that drove contrast and impact in the shift

380
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:23,592
for a lot of the game by using warmer palettes

381
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:25,213
in the materials and lighting.

382
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:30,458
And then we shifted to the grade for Frozen Time.

383
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,399
I mean, it was a simple color grade shift,

384
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:35,982
but it made the light feel harsher as well,

385
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,384
way up to some of the high-level bloom, so...

386
00:21:39,434 --> 00:21:43,276
It made the world feel slightly overlit, like time had slowed light itself,

387
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:48,699
so it was this heavy, desaturated, overly bright, harsh environment.

388
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:51,561
So we had a clearer state change for time now.

389
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,462
However, there was one more thing.

390
00:21:54,462 --> 00:21:58,525
We had addressed the need for an overall change in the visual state of the world.

391
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:03,127
And we had the prismatics, but it still didn't feel like frozen time.

392
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:07,750
The grade in the prismatic effects still weren't easily comprehensible,

393
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,710
visual tell for time.

394
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:13,565
We needed an additional visual ingredient to add some familiarity to the recipe

395
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:22,051
and help the audience comprehend the altered reality and give them a visual grounding and visual anchor.

396
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:25,653
We needed a visual stereotype, one that the audience would understand as time-related.

397
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:31,637
Again, a period of research and reference gathering.

398
00:22:31,637 --> 00:22:37,782
And one of the commonly seen visuals for slowed or stopped time that we settled on was long exposure photography.

399
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,447
It's a really attractive visual tell,

400
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:42,827
because when capturing bright light

401
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:45,008
and moving light sources like headlights or sparks.

402
00:22:45,008 --> 00:22:47,049
Also the photography for star-streaked night skies

403
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,890
I found particularly compelling.

404
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,571
So we'd found this visual stereotype

405
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:58,433
that we could use to support the recipe for broken time.

406
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:02,174
And I say broken time here because it allowed us freedom

407
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:05,295
for a broader palette of visual reference.

408
00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:07,556
Long exposure photography isn't really frozen time.

409
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:11,020
Except for the act of capturing the actual image, it slowed time.

410
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,543
So being able to pull in various examples of abnormally behaving time was less restricting.

411
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:17,305
Outdoor areas, again with a warmer colour palette and lighting.

412
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:29,017
They were especially effective with this long exposure photography sky,

413
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:32,538
where time is stopped but also blended.

414
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:34,799
We can mix in the long exposure night sky elements,

415
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,519
because even though it's day, when the time breaks down,

416
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,480
we can obviously mix day and night together.

417
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,220
So it gave the world a dramatic and obvious shift in reality.

418
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,821
We added the star streaks into the sky dome.

419
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:48,002
We also used contrails from aircraft,

420
00:23:48,002 --> 00:23:51,863
as well as other light streaks that we would put in later.

421
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,681
We introduced this visual element into the recipe,

422
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:59,182
and it gave the audience the recognizable visual anchor,

423
00:23:59,182 --> 00:24:01,684
but also helped highlight and reinforce

424
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:03,324
the look of the prismatic fracturing.

425
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:07,086
Bullet trails, sparks, and moving light sources

426
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:10,268
all created this linear sculpture in time,

427
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:12,469
and helped give us firefights and the stutters

428
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,551
and time powers a clearly different vibe.

429
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:18,353
This is the example, again, of using the application

430
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:20,374
of a visual stereotype to help reinforce

431
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:22,795
and provide a visual anchor for a new

432
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,536
and unique element in the world.

433
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:33,831
In addition to these elements, the technical art director also devised two further additions

434
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:36,173
into the ingredients for Broken Time.

435
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:42,076
One of them was flakes that evaporate off the surface of the world, and also an audio-driven

436
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:42,756
distortion effect.

437
00:24:42,756 --> 00:24:47,139
These helped add more violence and instability to the scene they gave.

438
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:52,687
Well initially, when we were actually looking into the reference, there was one particular

439
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:58,311
video that I remember being the most compelling for me, which was actually a video of someone

440
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:01,793
filming an oncoming surf wave from above the water surface.

441
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,515
And there was all this noise and violence approaching.

442
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:08,118
And then you get this sudden world shift when the camera's swallowed by the water.

443
00:25:08,118 --> 00:25:12,921
Suddenly the audio scape changes and also the movement becomes much more slowed and

444
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:14,702
has a different feel.

445
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:18,548
So that's how we devised these distortion effects

446
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:19,489
that were audio driven.

447
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:22,069
And these helped to communicate that violence

448
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:23,750
and instability to the scene.

449
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,670
And also this oncoming natural event almost

450
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,611
when they trigger.

451
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:30,952
These brought it all together in a visual ecosystem

452
00:25:30,952 --> 00:25:32,652
for the moments of broken time.

453
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:35,233
And it really helped communicate with the world

454
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,533
freezing, skipping, and repeating.

455
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:39,974
The rendering team and the technical art direction

456
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:41,974
came together to create what is one of the standout

457
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,615
visual elements of the game.

458
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:47,185
And I feel it's a good example of art and tech working together.

459
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:52,388
I mean, it was a technical solution in terms of the rendering,

460
00:25:52,388 --> 00:25:55,309
but it was also something visual that we really wanted to communicate.

461
00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:00,291
The next use for visual stereotype in the game was Palette.

462
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,674
The main antagonist in Quantum Break was Monarch Solutions.

463
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:07,915
It's a corporation with heavy investment in science and research.

464
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:10,696
We wanted them to feel real and familiar,

465
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:13,478
but also give a believable corporate identity to them.

466
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:18,535
Again, through our visual research,

467
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,676
we ended up being really settled in particular

468
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:24,017
with the 1970s NASA brand guidelines.

469
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:28,698
It had this palette that felt like iconic science or sci-fi,

470
00:26:28,698 --> 00:26:31,079
the burnt orange, gray, and white.

471
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,239
With this reference for the palette,

472
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:37,560
the in-game company was aimed at using a similar take

473
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,420
in this classic color palette.

474
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,201
You've seen this palette before,

475
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,721
repeated in sci-fi film from 2001

476
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:45,362
through to the recent The Martian.

477
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,701
We believed that we could still create something

478
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:52,422
with a unique presence in the world,

479
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:54,803
but it would feel more real with a palette

480
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:57,424
that would lay a foundation in the player's mind

481
00:26:57,424 --> 00:26:58,284
of a corporation with its strengths

482
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:58,844
in science and research.

483
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:01,545
With the general palette theme set

484
00:27:01,545 --> 00:27:05,867
and a need for a visual rule set and plausible logo design,

485
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:08,208
I hired a graphic design company

486
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:11,009
who had designed branding for various real world companies.

487
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,480
And together we devised a simple brand guide,

488
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,240
which we could then use as a springboard

489
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,361
to inform the branding of Monarch throughout the game

490
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:20,801
and also the live action.

491
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:23,382
Before passing the design to the graphic designers,

492
00:27:23,382 --> 00:27:26,082
the logo had actually involved in the prismatic motif

493
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:29,603
of the time effects in the game too.

494
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:31,684
You can see the sharp prismatic shape language

495
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:34,524
and a few aspects of the corporation's design philosophy

496
00:27:34,524 --> 00:27:36,865
from the architecture through to the logo design.

497
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,569
The brand guiding guidelines were then used as a foundation

498
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,970
for the team to work on uniform design.

499
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,811
Elements of the logo were used in addition

500
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:49,452
to the color palette and the corporate logo

501
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:52,714
and type style with progression in palette

502
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:55,695
and differing roles and the threat of enemy characters.

503
00:27:55,695 --> 00:28:01,637
Also vehicle livery permutations and prop branding

504
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,918
were also a big part of the application.

505
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:05,479
Much like a real world corporation,

506
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:07,320
the presence was stamped in all their equipment

507
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,561
and props by color or complete branding design.

508
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,733
The colour schemes for Monarch interior design and signage used the palette too,

509
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:19,914
which was reserved for Monarch,

510
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:22,616
so their areas would have a much colder scientific vibe

511
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:25,918
in contrast to the warmer, natural tones of the older buildings

512
00:28:25,918 --> 00:28:27,639
and structures in the city of Riverport.

513
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:32,121
I also have to say a big thank you to the rendering team at Remedy,

514
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:36,784
because they actually rose to the architectural challenge I set

515
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:38,004
for the architecture of Monarch.

516
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,370
It was a clean, modern, angular style.

517
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,392
I actually coined the term prismatic futurism

518
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:45,312
to describe the look.

519
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:48,253
It was something of a challenge for the rendering team,

520
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,754
as it would require an advanced lighting solution.

521
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:53,816
They excelled with the global illumination they created,

522
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,576
with the ambient occlusion and reflection rendering

523
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:57,057
they developed allowed me to build such architecture.

524
00:28:57,057 --> 00:28:58,097
One further advantage of the color scheme

525
00:28:58,097 --> 00:28:58,858
was we could tune the grading.

526
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,452
for broken time, mentioned previously,

527
00:29:08,452 --> 00:29:11,754
to push warmer color tones belonging to the corporation.

528
00:29:11,754 --> 00:29:15,217
That really helped the readability in combat.

529
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,798
So again, it was a case of considering

530
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,440
something of a pop culture

531
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,481
or visually stereotypical element

532
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:23,444
to add familiarity to the overall new creation in the world.

533
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:26,506
And then using external expertise

534
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:28,908
to attempt to create something of a credible entity.

535
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:36,476
It isn't only the visual threshold for the audience we need to concern ourselves with though.

536
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:40,458
We also need to think of how to introduce and communicate the world design vision

537
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,959
to the team internally too.

538
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:46,962
Use of visual stereotype and visual metaphor and distilled visual guidance

539
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:50,163
can also help communicate the visual direction of a project

540
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,305
into something easy to follow and comprehensible by a large team.

541
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:59,540
Using a visual metaphor or visual stereotype internally

542
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,621
helps to simplify the comprehension

543
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:03,701
of complex tasks for the team.

544
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,442
With ball building in particular,

545
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:06,742
we need to often create something

546
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:09,283
that captures the spirit of a place.

547
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:11,964
How we distill down and communicate its essence

548
00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:14,064
to the viewer effectively and efficiently

549
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:17,065
without extra any visual information or detail.

550
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:21,139
For example, cities and urban environments

551
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:22,620
have a lot of visual noise.

552
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,921
And distilling that visual information

553
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:27,021
into the layout for the game

554
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:28,942
can be a daunting task for an art team.

555
00:30:28,942 --> 00:30:33,524
Game worlds usually use far more condensed versions

556
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:34,744
of the real world.

557
00:30:34,744 --> 00:30:36,485
And using a visual metaphor for your team

558
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:38,225
can actually help the approach

559
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:40,426
to the world's location and scale.

560
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:43,127
Trick I've used before for crafting

561
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:44,928
the world reference from the real world

562
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:46,328
is to think of your world interpreted

563
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:47,949
as a souvenir snow globe.

564
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:51,626
What would the distilled version of that snow globe contain?

565
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:54,408
What's important to the character of the place?

566
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:56,669
And how does the scale and relative positioning work?

567
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:59,210
It's basically a visual metaphor for thinking

568
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,250
and seeing like a tourist.

569
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,611
It's a foreign perspective of a place

570
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,172
that can help shape the bigger brushstrokes

571
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:07,773
that define a place without the over familiarity

572
00:31:07,773 --> 00:31:09,954
of the native inhabitant,

573
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:11,895
which in this case is the creating artist.

574
00:31:13,244 --> 00:31:16,245
Similar to a tourist visiting a place for the first time,

575
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:18,986
if you imagine the player as the tourist,

576
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:21,507
your player has initially this foreign view

577
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:22,307
to your game's environments.

578
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:25,548
And if you think of it as a single globe,

579
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:27,929
you have the global landmarks and key areas.

580
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,790
And the scale and position of these landmarks

581
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,831
are quite flexible, if based on a real place.

582
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:34,351
But it's also scalable too.

583
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,470
If the overall city and world is a single globe,

584
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,772
how do you think of the next level of granularity

585
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:40,532
within the world?

586
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:44,075
Each district or area of your map has its own globe too.

587
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:47,357
So with regional landmarks and significant elements

588
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:49,098
of that help orientate the viewer.

589
00:31:49,098 --> 00:31:50,138
And so on down to neighborhoods or even blocks.

590
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:55,001
Of course, that relies on a lot of research

591
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:59,024
and a lot of reference trips to the actual place

592
00:31:59,024 --> 00:32:00,325
if you're setting it in a real world.

593
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:05,636
Visiting the real place gives you a better feel for what's important buildings and structures

594
00:32:05,636 --> 00:32:07,217
to your essence of the place.

595
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:11,139
But the principle can be applied to fictitious places too.

596
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:15,041
For example, Quantum Breaks, city of Riverport, doesn't exist.

597
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:18,763
It's an East Coast US location.

598
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:24,746
So when laying out the world, we created an imaginary history for the area, crafted to

599
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:28,328
create the vibe of an East Coast university town with an industrial heritage.

600
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:32,549
It has no direct analogue, but it has its own snow globe.

601
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:34,309
It's a world that's planned and laid out

602
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:36,750
based on its own pseudo-historical landmarks

603
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,450
and their relative locations.

604
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,611
Of course, laying out the world is more than just this.

605
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:45,192
There's other requirements,

606
00:32:45,192 --> 00:32:47,432
such as for landmarks and orientation,

607
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,893
such as narrative or player progression,

608
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:52,854
fostering a sense of discovery or feeling of wonder,

609
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:54,854
and also hierarchy of routes and travelees.

610
00:32:57,822 --> 00:33:00,623
Oh, and one more thing about the plausibility of a place,

611
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:01,704
it comes to graphic design.

612
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:04,366
When you're designing these urban places,

613
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:08,428
you need to remember that the world is full of hand-painted,

614
00:33:08,428 --> 00:33:11,330
oddly-designed signage, and your world's more richer

615
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,032
for paying attention to how the texture and flavor that adds.

616
00:33:14,032 --> 00:33:16,674
I'm not saying this is necessarily an example,

617
00:33:16,674 --> 00:33:19,055
but the world is full of bad graphic design,

618
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:21,697
and you need to be careful of not losing the feeling

619
00:33:21,697 --> 00:33:24,078
of a place by over-designing the world's graphics.

620
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:33,089
A simple term can also be employed to communicate the visual concept to the team.

621
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:38,495
For Quantum Break, we had this very heavy science feel to the look of technology.

622
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:45,243
And so we captured a lot of imagery of research science and coupled with Monarch's purposeful,

623
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:46,705
aggressive underlying intention.

624
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:48,327
So we termed the

625
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,940
the name, apologies to the company,

626
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,342
but we turned the name Militarized NASA as a term

627
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:56,403
for such a civil company,

628
00:33:56,403 --> 00:34:01,005
but it helped fix this viewpoint in the artist's head

629
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,446
of somewhere that employed science and research

630
00:34:03,446 --> 00:34:05,327
with a purposeful intent.

631
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:08,008
It led the team to gather and use reference

632
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:11,150
of various heavy science projects from around the world

633
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,111
as inspiration for the technology within the game.

634
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,713
It helped guide the visual design and aspire to feel more grounded and real,

635
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:22,835
from props to the more exotic enemy and location designs.

636
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:27,818
We tried to reference and echo how real experimental technology was constructed.

637
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:30,140
Doing this lent a solid, clearly manufactured look,

638
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,082
yet with some of the fragility and complexity of real-world experimental technology.

639
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:35,543
So where this guidance ends up is often in the style guide or art bible.

640
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,911
And one caveat I would have to say is,

641
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:47,513
from my experiences with the style guide,

642
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:51,395
is it can be a real rabbit hole for the art director.

643
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:53,617
It can grow in size and complexity over pre-production

644
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:56,759
to the point you're managing one or several large documents

645
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:57,679
on projects' visuals.

646
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,101
And something I learned was at the end of pre-production,

647
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:04,090
I almost put that to one side.

648
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,331
That's not what I actually showed the team.

649
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:07,892
I created a series of one sheets

650
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:09,313
that was quick to look through

651
00:35:09,313 --> 00:35:12,075
and used carefully chosen visual stereotypes

652
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:15,537
or visual tropes, just one image and one single line

653
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:18,119
that captured that part of the visual design.

654
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,240
It was really easy for the team to read.

655
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,801
The team won't read visual style guides

656
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:23,002
if they're too small or too large.

657
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:25,864
You have to create something really concise for them.

658
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,838
So we've covered the use of visual stereotype

659
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,519
in both world building, key visual element design,

660
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,861
and also internally as a communication tool.

661
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:39,122
The last thing I feel I should cover

662
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:40,523
is the flip side of that.

663
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:42,985
So from the use of using visual,

664
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:45,586
support of visual elements,

665
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:47,448
what are the ones that can potentially inhibit

666
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:49,589
the world design intention?

667
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:51,991
We see the use of archetypal tropes

668
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:54,092
and cliche in our industry often.

669
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,553
but it's worth covering why their use can be detrimental

670
00:35:58,553 --> 00:36:02,376
to the art direction and impact on player experience

671
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:02,916
and crafted game world.

672
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:04,998
For this, the best example is to look at

673
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:08,701
as a contained example of design

674
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:10,542
within a world of characters.

675
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:13,445
A character's an important element

676
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:16,407
in the building and visual storytelling of a world.

677
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,688
For a start, it's interactive.

678
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:22,232
You have a much broader range of expressing your design

679
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:23,113
and narrative.

680
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:25,960
with interaction and animation

681
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,502
than the static game world can lend.

682
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:33,744
So therefore, it's an opportunity you shouldn't waste

683
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:36,866
when trying to tell the visual story of your world

684
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:38,567
and communicate the narrative of your game.

685
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:42,329
Take The Heavy, for instance.

686
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:45,210
The 1987 movie Predator has a lot to answer for.

687
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,812
It's left us with a visual legacy of almost 30 years

688
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:51,554
of one of the most commonly utilized

689
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:52,795
archetypes of game design.

690
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:57,374
Don't get me wrong, this isn't a comment on the use of the archetype per se,

691
00:36:57,374 --> 00:37:01,676
but it's great for adding variety to gameplay.

692
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:06,258
I love, and also love Predator. Jesse Ventura's Blaine is a memorable character.

693
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:13,062
But I feel the character's looks have gone on to burden us with years of repeating 80s action hero visuals in games.

694
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:16,783
Especially those where there's a world and narrative to communicate.

695
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,923
You can see the visual trope employed in part or whole when it comes to the use of gameplay archetype in many games.

696
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:34,829
From the bear sleeves to the chaingun, it's one of these things that you see often.

697
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:43,035
But for projects where you're attempting to create a wholly immersive world with a compelling narrative, the use of such imagery breaks the fourth wall.

698
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:45,917
The characters are reminding your audience you are playing a game.

699
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:53,974
It's comparable to the 80s action movie posters,

700
00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:56,897
where often the actor's name was larger

701
00:37:56,897 --> 00:37:58,278
than the actual movie title itself.

702
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,559
The character's playing is overshadowed

703
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,980
by the actor's own persona,

704
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,902
so the character becomes throwaway,

705
00:38:04,902 --> 00:38:06,824
and the star feels somehow a separate element

706
00:38:06,824 --> 00:38:08,005
to the world they're performing in.

707
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:09,426
And something to consider,

708
00:38:09,426 --> 00:38:13,229
especially with the onset of virtual reality,

709
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:14,470
this is going to be compounded

710
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,991
with the arrival of a truly immersive experience

711
00:38:16,991 --> 00:38:17,952
that VR can offer.

712
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:28,796
That said, I understand the use of visual tropes or archetypes can have its place and use.

713
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:32,177
There are situations when the use of visual cliché is part of the art direction,

714
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:35,619
using the preconceptions of the viewer to the game's advantage.

715
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:41,961
The obvious example, Team Fortress 2, where the visual tropes are a function of expression of character class within the game.

716
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:43,221
And of course, one counter-argument.

717
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,604
is that players need this visual cliché to recognise the archetype and its role within the game.

718
00:38:56,604 --> 00:39:01,667
As I said, the issue fails to express the visual design of the world it lives in,

719
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:06,330
and also wastes potential interactive storytelling opportunities.

720
00:39:07,381 --> 00:39:09,682
But as something of a sweeping analogy,

721
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:12,403
if you imagine car design not having evolved

722
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:14,724
since the 1950s, and any car design,

723
00:39:14,724 --> 00:39:16,825
new car design requiring to have tail fins

724
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:20,447
to be recognizable as a car, it's ridiculous.

725
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:22,288
Cars today have the functionality,

726
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:24,088
have functionally defined.

727
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:30,504
visual foundation, four wheels, lights, grill and so on.

728
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:33,025
I mean, it's not changed in years.

729
00:39:33,025 --> 00:39:35,925
But the design has still evolved.

730
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:38,766
We can still recognize these vehicles today as cars,

731
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:40,266
but even though they lack some of the visual design elements

732
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:41,387
of 60 years ago.

733
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:44,288
Not that I'm saying all parts of this archetype are cliche.

734
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:48,949
I mean, size and scale, and also the setup

735
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:50,889
of introducing the heavy to our world

736
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,250
is something we still need to have.

737
00:39:55,643 --> 00:40:00,946
But again, one thing you could do is to check your visual design against the world's rule set.

738
00:40:00,946 --> 00:40:02,927
Assess the design.

739
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:06,969
Does this support and strengthen the visual design of the world?

740
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:14,213
If you have any doubts, then reassess if you have the best design possible within the restrictions of functionality,

741
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:16,454
technical requirements and production time you have.

742
00:40:16,454 --> 00:40:16,934
If there is an issue...

743
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:29,455
How would you decide how to handle the addition of an element that possibly breaks or challenges

744
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:33,036
the visual model of your world, especially potentially late in production?

745
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:36,677
Should it be dropped to keep the elegance of the world design?

746
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:41,519
There's always a risk of diluting the player immersion if they remain, but that's a really

747
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,180
extreme step and something you might not be in the power to decide.

748
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:51,242
It would depend on your title's aspirations, so a step like that needs discussion and appraisal.

749
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:58,479
Of course, a better solution, since the game development is such a complex, fluid and collaborative process,

750
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:07,384
is to have a robust enough design rule set for your world, and a mythology to support and change, for change and expansion.

751
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:12,688
Because generally, with game development, it pays off to plan change for some extent.

752
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:14,549
It does seem an inevitability sometimes.

753
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:23,169
So if when building a world with a compelling and appealing visual design rule set, what

754
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:25,951
are the good examples?

755
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:30,494
What examples of the heavy archetype do I think have an artistic success story?

756
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:36,998
And does this support and strengthen the visual design rule set of the world test?

757
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:41,160
Well an obvious example that sprung to mind is Bioshock.

758
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:47,824
Art deco styled underwater city of Rapture has become a classic setting and a great example

759
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:48,445
of world building.

760
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:52,469
Of course, it's the Big Daddy.

761
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:55,311
It's an iconic heavy, and it sits well in this underworld city,

762
00:41:55,311 --> 00:42:00,976
and clearly builds a strong foundation on visual references related to its setting.

763
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:06,019
And it isn't overly reliant on game character stereotypes,

764
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:10,163
or recycling the more traditional heavy visual tropes.

765
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:15,787
Another game that strives to have coherent visual design in all its elements,

766
00:42:15,787 --> 00:42:17,948
and a personal favourite, is Dishonored.

767
00:42:19,426 --> 00:42:22,667
The game doesn't necessarily have a heavy in its traditional sense,

768
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:27,309
but the tall boys would probably satisfy that tougher imposing enemy slot.

769
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:32,871
The visual design and expression of verticality, behaviour and gameplay

770
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:36,333
works in unison to create something interesting and different.

771
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:41,155
It's a good example of visual game design and art

772
00:42:41,155 --> 00:42:43,276
working in unison to create something unique.

773
00:42:43,276 --> 00:42:43,496
Of course...

774
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:51,713
Irrational had a knack of creating other interesting heavy class enemies, such as the motorized

775
00:42:51,713 --> 00:42:51,993
patriots.

776
00:42:51,993 --> 00:42:56,414
The classic chain gun is actually there, but it helps reinforce the irony of a George Washington

777
00:42:56,414 --> 00:42:57,335
statue toting such a weapon.

778
00:42:57,335 --> 00:43:00,116
So to summarize, the visual threshold is your audience's gateway into your world and narrative.

779
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:18,286
Crafting an accessible visual threshold to your world

780
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:20,146
requires a few things.

781
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:22,487
And example, potentially leveraging a pop culture

782
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:25,408
visual element to ease the players into your world.

783
00:43:25,408 --> 00:43:27,709
Or even mixing them with a more unique visual elements

784
00:43:27,709 --> 00:43:29,510
to provide visual reference point.

785
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,751
It should be accessible and understandable.

786
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:33,732
That's where careful and considered use

787
00:43:33,732 --> 00:43:35,932
of visual stereotype can be a tool

788
00:43:35,932 --> 00:43:41,275
to help build the visual threshold for the audience

789
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:44,936
and avoid the comprehension or exposition traps that exist.

790
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:49,307
Manage your audience's energies for comprehension

791
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:51,927
towards your new identifiable elements,

792
00:43:51,927 --> 00:43:54,588
and leverage the preconceptions of the audience

793
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:56,428
with visual stereotype.

794
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,849
It all comes in that crucial pre-production stage,

795
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:03,010
where you have a plan to use these visual tropes

796
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,731
strategically to give you the room

797
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:08,612
to explore your more memorable and unique elements.

798
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,032
Thirdly, reassess all additions

799
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:13,673
through the lens of the world design rule set,

800
00:44:13,673 --> 00:44:16,053
as the project evolves and shifts into development.

801
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,701
I feel the most crucial part of world building

802
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,881
is consistency of vision.

803
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:23,262
So when adding new elements,

804
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:25,462
check they belong to this visual rule set

805
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:29,043
and ask that question.

806
00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:30,823
Your world will be always stronger for it.

807
00:44:30,823 --> 00:44:34,864
Hopefully this talk has provided you with some thoughts

808
00:44:34,864 --> 00:44:37,105
on making game art accessible,

809
00:44:37,105 --> 00:44:39,565
but finding ways to add and support

810
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:41,386
the unique flavor they can have too.

811
00:44:42,836 --> 00:44:45,278
If it can help add to the art direction toolset

812
00:44:45,278 --> 00:44:48,021
for world building, or consideration on how to support

813
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:50,323
visual comprehension of your neuro elements,

814
00:44:50,323 --> 00:44:51,884
then that's great, it's helped.

815
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:53,045
Thank you. . . . . . . .

816
00:44:53,045 --> 00:45:04,555
. . . . . . Any questions?

817
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:17,636
Hi, quick question.

818
00:45:17,636 --> 00:45:21,957
As you were talking about the quantum break process,

819
00:45:21,957 --> 00:45:26,119
as you were sort of coming up with these different ideas of ways

820
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:29,240
to represent time, how did that process take place?

821
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,141
Was that a series of meetings that happened in like a month?

822
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:36,462
Or was this you picked a couple things, ran with it for a while,

823
00:45:36,462 --> 00:45:37,502
and then picked another?

824
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:38,943
It actually ran for a month.

825
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:44,673
for months. There was a lot of visual reference gathering, like I said, and we actually wanted,

826
00:45:44,673 --> 00:45:50,735
we deliberately steered clear of previous game visuals. We actually wanted to pursue how other

827
00:45:50,735 --> 00:45:55,636
art forms, I mean other art forms have handled the effects of time like cubism and futurism.

828
00:45:55,636 --> 00:46:00,017
So we knew there was references there that we could actually use

829
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:01,838
and actually bring to into games because

830
00:46:02,986 --> 00:46:04,487
There are things that haven't been seen before.

831
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:06,548
So we wanted to create something unique.

832
00:46:06,548 --> 00:46:08,390
I mean, it's easy if you look at other games,

833
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,391
sometimes it's easy to be influenced by those.

834
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:12,693
And we wanted to try and steer clear of that.

835
00:46:12,693 --> 00:46:14,494
So we created a board, basically,

836
00:46:14,494 --> 00:46:17,436
and a room and gathered reference.

837
00:46:17,436 --> 00:46:19,817
And then eventually we filtered it down

838
00:46:19,817 --> 00:46:21,298
and we created like a,

839
00:46:21,298 --> 00:46:25,001
almost like a memory tree of sections

840
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:27,163
of what the elements of that research was

841
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:29,504
that we wanted to actually combine together.

842
00:46:29,504 --> 00:46:30,685
So yeah, it's a long process.

843
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:32,086
Okay, all right, thank you.

844
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:39,719
So my name's Ryan, I'm from Abertay University, Dundee.

845
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:42,120
Nice to see a familiar voice.

846
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,842
See a familiar voice, hear a familiar voice.

847
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,763
So when you're gonna write this book.

848
00:46:46,878 --> 00:46:52,161
It's a really great topic, and I think it would be really great to have a book on something like this.

849
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:57,563
So, I'm trying to think of questions to ask in place of the students I would have,

850
00:46:57,563 --> 00:47:02,306
and the big one I was really interested in was that visual research process that you go through.

851
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:05,528
I was wondering at what level that happens.

852
00:47:05,528 --> 00:47:11,411
Is it, would it be your whole art team, or just, obviously, maybe just at the lead sort of positions?

853
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,792
The level of visual research.

854
00:47:14,755 --> 00:47:19,417
Well, the whole team, I mean, the thing is with art direction, you don't want to be an auteur as such.

855
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:22,438
You don't go walk yourself in a room and then come out and go,

856
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:25,839
I have a vision, everyone must now follow this.

857
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,380
Well, that would be my dream.

858
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:33,962
Yeah, but I don't think it would really get your team on board as well as in bringing them into the process.

859
00:47:33,962 --> 00:47:37,283
So, like I said, this room, I mean, this is where,

860
00:47:37,283 --> 00:47:41,685
that was actually the room where me and some of the other teams sat, the technical art director as well.

861
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,313
We had this huge board with obviously all the visual research gathered,

862
00:47:45,313 --> 00:47:49,878
but we'd go around and talk to the team and we'd actually have meetings with the team as well

863
00:47:49,878 --> 00:47:53,581
and give them updates on how that's going and they would be involved in it too.

864
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:56,203
They could send visual research that they had found.

865
00:47:56,203 --> 00:47:59,767
If they found a good example, they would send that and we'd discuss it with them on a daily basis.

866
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:03,110
It's an evolving process, really.

867
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,873
But I mean all the team have a stake or investment to some some extent

868
00:48:07,873 --> 00:48:12,637
So it's more of a collaborative method. I think it should be because then

869
00:48:12,637 --> 00:48:19,903
Everyone becomes on gets on board with the visual design of the game and it takes a long time and eventually when you get

870
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:20,183
get that

871
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,163
get that idea and the visual design is fixed in all the artist's heads, then you don't need to

872
00:48:27,163 --> 00:48:31,525
manage them so much. It's more of a case of discussing and guiding them. They can actually

873
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:36,147
go ahead and the environment artists were on the same areas. They had ownership of the same

874
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:41,749
areas a long time and they knew exactly what they were creating. It was ingrained in their brain,

875
00:48:41,749 --> 00:48:46,331
the visual design. So that's the best way to do it, I think. Yeah, great work. Thanks very much.

876
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:46,672
Thank you.

877
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,351
Hi.

878
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:54,472
Hi.

879
00:48:54,472 --> 00:48:57,594
Personally, my experience has been a lot of marketing

880
00:48:57,594 --> 00:49:01,818
in games, which is obviously very closely linked

881
00:49:01,818 --> 00:49:03,559
to the visual design.

882
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:06,641
And my question was specifically about targeting

883
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:11,465
and the target audience and interest-focused targeting.

884
00:49:11,465 --> 00:49:14,427
Does that ever kind of come into play for you

885
00:49:14,427 --> 00:49:18,771
when you consider color palettes and visual styles?

886
00:49:19,951 --> 00:49:23,234
interest, focus on demographics or...

887
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:28,258
Say you're targeting fans of a certain genre or

888
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:33,622
fans who are interested in this type of game or

889
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:37,205
brand or experience in this game. Yeah, I mean, I think that did influence

890
00:49:37,205 --> 00:49:40,608
say the colour palette styling for the corporation

891
00:49:40,608 --> 00:49:45,032
in Quantum Break. I mean, it's a science fiction game, so

892
00:49:45,032 --> 00:49:46,153
it has that.

893
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:51,869
that interest group, I guess, people that were more into the science fiction or action cinema,

894
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:58,374
then they're going to see some recognition there. I think that actually comes more in mobile.

895
00:49:58,374 --> 00:50:06,300
Mobile is so focused on demographics in a way that it seems a bit more aggressive and focused

896
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:11,724
on who you're appealing to and what your target group is. So it does seem to be more designed

897
00:50:11,724 --> 00:50:15,267
that way. With AAA, it seems to be...

898
00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:18,131
it's more of a general plan you have.

899
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:20,733
And you know roughly who you're building the game for,

900
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:22,815
but it's much more complex,

901
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:26,799
so we can't really change a whole visual aspect

902
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:29,502
of the game that much.

903
00:50:29,502 --> 00:50:30,943
It has to be cohesive.

904
00:50:30,943 --> 00:50:31,824
Interesting, thank you.

905
00:50:34,302 --> 00:50:35,763
Hi, my name's Wayne.

906
00:50:35,763 --> 00:50:39,004
What she was talking about did bring up my own question of,

907
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:43,165
when you speak of threshold, how do you know,

908
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,667
this might not exactly be the same definition as yours,

909
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:49,688
but how do you know whether you've crossed a line?

910
00:50:50,198 --> 00:50:57,746
where you might have lost your audience even though you've created something visually amazing.

911
00:50:57,746 --> 00:51:02,211
It's a little hard to explain, it just popped into my head.

912
00:51:02,211 --> 00:51:06,135
Yeah, no, it's how do you know when you've crossed that visual threshold?

913
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:06,496
Well...

914
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:09,497
It is a fuzzy and very subjective line.

915
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:13,539
I mean, some people will become immersed in the game a lot quicker than others.

916
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:17,001
So it's something you get through playtesting, really.

917
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:20,462
I mean, it's something that they do especially in mobile,

918
00:51:20,462 --> 00:51:23,384
but I mean, we do that as well later on in the game.

919
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:25,625
And also, I mean, there's a lot of discussion and...

920
00:51:26,327 --> 00:51:33,535
playing internally as well and covering that with the creative director and the creative

921
00:51:33,535 --> 00:51:37,540
heads of the game will actually get feedback on that so it's a lot of discussion.

922
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:43,267
How many times, well I don't know if you have an example, how many times have you gone back

923
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,308
to a drawing board then?

924
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:54,978
Yeah, it happens a few times. Actually, the idea for the time visuals was actually very early.

925
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:58,641
We seemed to settle down on a look we really wanted to pursue very early.

926
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:03,485
And it took a long time to develop. It would be great to actually have the technical art

927
00:52:03,485 --> 00:52:07,189
director here to explain the details behind it, but I mean there's a lot of new rendering

928
00:52:07,189 --> 00:52:11,793
elements designed into the engine, so it took a long time to develop. But we knew we were going

929
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:12,293
very early.

930
00:52:13,152 --> 00:52:18,213
And like I said, that went on to inform the architecture for the corporations.

931
00:52:18,213 --> 00:52:20,874
They were inspired by the look of broken time.

932
00:52:20,874 --> 00:52:25,416
So, that actually helped to form a visual umbrella over the whole project.

933
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:25,876
Cool, thank you.

934
00:52:32,174 --> 00:52:40,585
Hey, I was just wondering, how do you know when you have a design that just needs a little bit of tweaks?

935
00:52:40,585 --> 00:52:45,190
Or if you're like, oh, I just need to scrap this whole idea.

936
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:50,956
as a whole if you know that makes sense or how do you know when there's a design that needs

937
00:52:50,956 --> 00:52:56,621
some tweaking as opposed to like if you have like an idea and you like the direction it's going but

938
00:52:56,621 --> 00:53:02,027
you're like okay it needs something though but what if you add too much to it

939
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:06,231
and it takes away from the original idea instead of like,

940
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:08,992
oh, I could have just tweaked it a little bit.

941
00:53:08,992 --> 00:53:09,813
Like, how is...

942
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:12,174
I don't know if that even makes any sense, but...

943
00:53:12,174 --> 00:53:14,296
Well, I mean, I used to be an architect,

944
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:16,077
and it's more of, you have to design,

945
00:53:16,077 --> 00:53:18,218
you have to work from a brief, in a way.

946
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:20,860
It should be a design brief.

947
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,441
And that's where your game designers help as well,

948
00:53:23,441 --> 00:53:24,722
because they have an intention.

949
00:53:24,722 --> 00:53:26,083
Like the Heavy, for instance...

950
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:34,646
You don't need someone to tell you he has to have a minigun and huge muscly arms, and you know yeah that

951
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:38,147
What you want is something to see I want him to seem unconcerned

952
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:41,668
and arrogant over the players firepower and

953
00:53:41,668 --> 00:53:48,290
You can give a brief to the to the artist and then that gives you some framework to work with so then you know when

954
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:54,952
You start to extend beyond that so it's all about building like that framework in a direction to go to

955
00:53:54,952 --> 00:53:56,352
Yeah, it's about communication. Yeah, okay

956
00:53:56,352 --> 00:53:56,472
Thanks

957
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,211
Hi, thanks for the great talk.

958
00:54:01,211 --> 00:54:05,372
Right now, I'm dealing with an environment that's

959
00:54:05,372 --> 00:54:08,252
sort of very anchored in cliche.

960
00:54:08,252 --> 00:54:09,933
And first of all, it's a desert, so you

961
00:54:09,933 --> 00:54:12,093
have extremely cliche elements at work,

962
00:54:12,093 --> 00:54:14,614
like pyramids and sphinxes or what have you.

963
00:54:14,614 --> 00:54:17,854
So I guess what I've been dealing with right now

964
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:21,575
is introducing elements that will sort of expand it

965
00:54:21,575 --> 00:54:24,276
into more of an interesting.

966
00:54:24,856 --> 00:54:27,437
it's almost a less cliche thing,

967
00:54:27,437 --> 00:54:30,838
without making it seem visually incongruent.

968
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:32,379
So I guess what I'm asking is,

969
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:34,920
do you have any experiences with that sort of thing

970
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,501
where your cliches and your visual stereotypes

971
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:40,562
that inform the player are covered,

972
00:54:40,562 --> 00:54:43,543
and now you sort of want to diversify it a little bit,

973
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:45,183
and how do you deal with that

974
00:54:45,183 --> 00:54:47,664
without becoming visually incongruent

975
00:54:47,664 --> 00:54:50,925
and sort of confusing and lame?

976
00:54:50,925 --> 00:54:52,206
So when you've got a...

977
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:57,734
an environment steeped in visual stereotype and trope, then how do you introduce unique elements

978
00:54:57,734 --> 00:55:01,360
without disorientating or standing out too much to the player?

979
00:55:02,263 --> 00:55:11,205
It was kind of like a flip side of the time powers that we talked about, where actually it was mostly 90% unique element and 10% visual trope.

980
00:55:11,205 --> 00:55:15,767
You have to try and find something that would...

981
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:21,348
Well, it still needs to sit within that world, so there must be a visual design rule set for that world.

982
00:55:21,348 --> 00:55:24,269
I mean, how do people exist in this world?

983
00:55:24,269 --> 00:55:28,070
There'll be guidelines then for how this world functions.

984
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:30,851
So if you can find a unique visual element that still...

985
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:36,253
It's like the visual stereotype check, does this support and strengthen the visual design

986
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:37,894
rule set of the world?

987
00:55:37,894 --> 00:55:40,354
You need to do that with the unique elements as well.

988
00:55:40,354 --> 00:55:45,496
You need to make sure they're balanced and make some kind of logical sense in terms of

989
00:55:45,496 --> 00:55:48,077
the visual rule set for the world.

990
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:49,358
So obviously you're not going to put like a...

991
00:55:49,678 --> 00:55:54,599
You might not want to put a shiny stainless steel cap on the top of the pyramid because it doesn't look right.

992
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,000
But I mean, it's a unique element, but it's breaking that visual rule set.

993
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,901
So it's research again, referencing research.

994
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,681
It's what the artists always have to do.

995
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:05,502
It's their underlying foundation of their work.

996
00:56:05,502 --> 00:56:09,803
So you need to look at a lot of stuff outside the games.

997
00:56:10,462 --> 00:56:13,484
Okay, and just quickly, I guess part of it also is like,

998
00:56:13,484 --> 00:56:18,548
in a team environment, wanting to give time to ideas,

999
00:56:18,548 --> 00:56:22,351
but some ideas being sort of clearly unfit

1000
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:25,193
or just a little off the wall.

1001
00:56:25,193 --> 00:56:28,956
So I mean, how do you manage in a team environment,

1002
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:31,017
choosing wisely in what you're going to put

1003
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:32,638
more visual research into, I guess?

1004
00:56:32,638 --> 00:56:33,399
How do you know?

1005
00:56:33,399 --> 00:56:34,260
Yeah, yeah, well.

1006
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,781
Is it just an instinct thing for you, or?

1007
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:42,743
It's an instinct and experience to some extent, but there's also a lot of discussion.

1008
00:56:42,743 --> 00:56:50,205
I mean, if everyone is sitting in a meeting and there's a lot of ideas thrown in early on in pre-production,

1009
00:56:50,205 --> 00:56:56,387
then you just have to try and distill down and discuss what works together in combination.

1010
00:56:56,387 --> 00:57:02,428
And again, some concepts might just not gel with the other set that you're starting to build.

1011
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:06,899
Again, it's shining that mirror of world design,

1012
00:57:06,899 --> 00:57:08,820
real set on everything.

1013
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,141
I mean, it's the same thing when you're laying out a world

1014
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:13,442
for GTA or somewhere, you don't want to put in something

1015
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:16,443
just that doesn't belong in the real world,

1016
00:57:16,443 --> 00:57:17,764
it just doesn't work.

1017
00:57:17,764 --> 00:57:19,405
So it's a lot of discussion.

1018
00:57:19,405 --> 00:57:21,626
Okay, thank you very much.

1019
00:57:21,626 --> 00:57:22,166
No problem, thanks.

1020
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:22,826
Last question, I think.

1021
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:39,213
Hi, have you ever been a part of a team that maybe was a little anxious to start production before having all the style guides and visual target?

1022
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:42,587
Well, yeah, that's a team anxious to start

1023
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:45,908
before the style guide and pre-production's completed.

1024
00:57:45,908 --> 00:57:50,090
That's normal, though, because you don't want

1025
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:52,070
all your artists and your team sitting around

1026
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,111
waiting on you.

1027
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:54,111
Again, it's that auteur thing.

1028
00:57:54,111 --> 00:57:55,352
You don't want to come in and go, right,

1029
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:56,192
here's the art bible.

1030
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:59,393
As you're going through pre-production,

1031
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,634
you'll gradually get work that they can start

1032
00:58:02,634 --> 00:58:03,675
to progress with.

1033
00:58:03,675 --> 00:58:05,915
I mean, you don't have to have the entire team

1034
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,576
waiting for this final vision.

1035
00:58:09,457 --> 00:58:15,280
Like in Riverport, for Point of Break, we knew we were going to have docks, say, that are part of industrial heritage,

1036
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,823
so guys can start going and getting visual reference for that, and actually can start building props and some of the other elements that we know.

1037
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:27,385
We know what a barrel looks like, we don't have to wait for the visual design guide on the prop work.

1038
00:58:27,385 --> 00:58:28,886
That's like a movie set prop work.

1039
00:58:28,886 --> 00:58:34,551
You have this store that you have to fill with props really before you start building the rest of the world.

1040
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:42,658
So there's always work that can be done that would contribute to the final production that can be done early.

1041
00:58:42,658 --> 00:58:45,380
It's not like everything waits for that day.

1042
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:48,963
Day one of production, here's the visual style guide. Right, everyone start.

1043
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:54,646
It's a staggered thing and it gradually progressed into production.

1044
00:58:54,646 --> 00:58:55,027
Thank you.

1045
00:58:55,027 --> 00:58:57,511
I think that's Liz.

1046
00:58:57,511 --> 00:58:58,212
Thank you.
