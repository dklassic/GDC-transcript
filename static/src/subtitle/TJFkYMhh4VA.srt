1
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:07,992
My name is Martin Pichlmeier.

2
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:09,112
This is Jessica Hemmer.

3
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:12,473
We've split this talk into two parts,

4
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:14,454
and I'm going to talk about expert feedback,

5
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,915
and Jessica is later going to talk about peer feedback.

6
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:22,576
I was asked to kindly ask you to turn off your mobile phones

7
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:24,596
and any other noise-making devices.

8
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:26,857
And I would also like to ask you

9
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:29,778
to fill out the evaluation after this talk.

10
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:32,298
If it's not in your inbox, it's in your spam folder,

11
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:34,219
and it's a way of criticizing us,

12
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:35,059
which is kind of.

13
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:38,245
making everything into a nice circle.

14
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:43,528
I will spend the next slides introducing myself.

15
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:49,291
I am a person that wears a bit too many hats at times.

16
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:55,014
I am a co-founder of a small indie studio called Broken Rules that has recently made

17
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:56,415
a game called Old Man's Journey.

18
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:58,016
Has anyone heard of Old Man's Journey?

19
00:00:58,776 --> 00:00:58,916
Yes?

20
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:06,424
Actually quite successful game and we're very proud of it, but I wasn't very involved in the development of that game.

21
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:10,867
Because I'm in the moment heading a games program at the IT University in Copenhagen,

22
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:18,332
which is one of the, I think, oldest games programs on the university level in Europe at least.

23
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:24,656
Here on this image you see students working on a game that is actually nominated for,

24
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:29,338
or it's not nominated, it got an honorable mention in the IGF student category, which makes me very proud.

25
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:35,313
And I'm also teaching mostly project-based classes there actually.

26
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,814
So whenever there is a class where students make an actual game,

27
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:43,538
this is what I am teaching and this is also why I came to the university with an industry background.

28
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,420
When I'm not doing that in my abundant spare time,

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,522
I'm actually trying to push games a little bit forward with the Copenhagen Game Collective,

30
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:57,125
where we co-organize events or help events to be more interesting.

31
00:01:58,283 --> 00:02:04,788
Or just weird games projects now and then and try to just break games until we can reassemble

32
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:05,809
them to be something new.

33
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,333
But let's talk about critique in design education.

34
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:17,178
I guess most of you are educators or somehow as educators interested in the critique process.

35
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:22,222
So I'm not going to answer the question why it is important.

36
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,743
You all know why it is important.

37
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:28,459
I'm just going to frame it a little bit with design philosophy and one day I will submit

38
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:32,441
the design philosophy talk to GDC because I think it's actually a super interesting topic.

39
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:37,825
So my understanding of design as a process is that you work on something and while working

40
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:40,986
on it you realize what you're actually working on.

41
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:48,471
This wonderful illustration is based on the PhD dissertation of Henrik Gedenreuth and

42
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:51,653
he bases it on John Dewey's pragmatist philosophers.

43
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:53,233
So, the first thing that you have to do is to create a

44
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,694
design process, and this is a very simple notion of doing for

45
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:56,015
the sake of knowing. So you execute an action in order to

46
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:59,077
learn something about something. And that is, of course, also the

47
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:02,419
problem with design processes. It generates, they generate new

48
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:05,801
problems while you're working on them. And critique is one of

49
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:10,924
the ways to constrain the design space, to help staying focused

50
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:15,947
and to serve many other purposes in the design process.

51
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:23,289
One additional problem with design processes

52
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,290
is that in hindsight, they look very linear,

53
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,951
but they are not while you're in them.

54
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:30,653
So this is the development of the player character

55
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,415
in different stages of the game.

56
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:34,075
And yet it moves.

57
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,197
It was made by Broken Rules, which is actually

58
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,557
an interesting story, because I was

59
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,218
one of the supervisors of the team

60
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:40,399
when they were still students.

61
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,120
And later, I formed a company with them.

62
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:46,683
Or they formed it alone, and then I joined up with them.

63
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:53,536
And it looks like a linear development, but there were so many stages of errors and dead

64
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:58,959
ends until we arrived at this final character that the design process more resembled this

65
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:04,302
image by Dan Cook from Spryfox, who has an interesting article also associated to that

66
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:04,602
image.

67
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:05,942
His blog is anyway fantastic.

68
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:11,585
So in the design process, you actually expand the scope of what you're working on, and

69
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:15,227
then you contract again, and then you expand again, and then you contract again.

70
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:20,427
And the purpose of that is, of course, that you accumulate more and more what he describes

71
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:21,287
here as good stuff.

72
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,849
Now, I've never seen any product that ends up with only good stuff in it.

73
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,051
So it's a bit romantic, maybe, this image.

74
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:31,893
But in general, this is the iterative process you're working in.

75
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:34,734
And critique comes in at several places.

76
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:42,358
So while you are expanding, one of the purposes of critique, of criticizing the designer that

77
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,698
is at work, or the designers.

78
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:49,581
is to give them new perspectives, for example, because you bring an outside view to the table.

79
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:56,146
Then what I do a lot actually, because students are at university and they never get the chance

80
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:59,809
to play in such a safe environment again when they're out there in the real world,

81
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:04,913
they cannot experiment that easily. So I try to push them a little bit at least outside their

82
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:10,997
comfort zone, because I think that is actually very enriching for them and is one of the purposes

83
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:11,658
of education.

84
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:18,859
And of course, by just having more experience than them, I can also contextualize or help

85
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,282
them to contextualize their work and to learn about in what environment they are working.

86
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:32,587
Then while the design process is contracting, you can help with critique to get students

87
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:36,970
into a position where they have an easier time making decisions, design decisions.

88
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:42,646
They learn things like throwing away stuff that they have worked on, which is one of

89
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:47,248
the most important lessons you can learn in design, and you can support that by criticizing

90
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:47,488
them.

91
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:53,390
And of course, scoping and framing, and just generally keeping the direction is a super

92
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:59,733
important aspect of the design process that you can support by criticizing the student.

93
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,931
And finally, of course, you also have to motivate them now and then, because as we all know,

94
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:10,294
projects take a long time and you lose the motivation when you have a week where nothing

95
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:10,674
happens.

96
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:16,938
And then critique can also be something purely positive or mostly positive by just motivating

97
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:17,378
students.

98
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:23,581
And then one of the final purposes of critique is that also it enables students to reflect

99
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:28,584
on their design process and to understand how design processes work in general.

100
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:32,115
For example, design processes are messy, as I said before.

101
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:36,077
You have to throw away things that you have invested time and energy into.

102
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:44,941
You go off on a tangent and then have to return to the main road that you were actually driving

103
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:45,621
on and so on.

104
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:51,044
It is never a very linear or really only in a very boring case is it a very linear process.

105
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:54,045
And that's completely normal and something that students have to learn.

106
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,882
And realizing that leads to a process of reflection that makes them more aware of their own practice,

107
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:04,583
turning them into reflective practitioners, a term that was introduced by Donald Train,

108
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:06,124
by the way, in his fantastic book.

109
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:13,387
And finally, of course, just by presenting their designs over and over again in unfinished

110
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:19,790
states and being aware of in what stage of design they are at any given time, they get

111
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,350
better in their communication.

112
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:28,932
Especially if you consciously disframe how they are presenting their works.

113
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,773
And that is a very important skill to learn.

114
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:39,298
And there are different ways of talking about, of setting up a system of critique.

115
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:44,120
So on one hand you have peer critique, which Jessica is going to talk about in different

116
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,481
forms.

117
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:50,144
Then you have plenary critique, which is a mixture of peer critique and expert feedback.

118
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:55,686
So if a student is presenting to the class and gets feedback from you, maybe the TAs,

119
00:07:56,326 --> 00:08:00,127
and other students, then suddenly you have a mixed mode of critique.

120
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:05,088
And then of course there is just one-on-one or one-on-N supervision.

121
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,230
And there is grading, which is another very distinct case in that it has—well, of course

122
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,591
students can, I guess in your university too, they can file complaints, so it's not like

123
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:17,732
grading is only in one direction, but in 99 percent of the cases it's a one-directional

124
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:18,112
process.

125
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:19,172
And it's a very—

126
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:22,270
The bluntest form of critique I can imagine, actually.

127
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,431
I could give a whole talk about criticizing grading.

128
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:27,692
But it's something we have to do still.

129
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:30,714
And it's still a form of feedback, a form of critique for the student's work.

130
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:38,037
So yes, to summarize, in the beginning you support the student to open up the design

131
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:38,418
space.

132
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:42,099
Then during development you support that it becomes more focused.

133
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:47,162
And after the project you actually support the reflection on the process by the student.

134
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,165
Now in my next slides, I think I'm way too fast.

135
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,150
In my next slides, I will actually.

136
00:08:57,281 --> 00:09:03,243
go through a couple of challenges that we all regularly face in the process of critique

137
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,645
and offer some kinds of solutions to them.

138
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:13,588
But the important thing is while I try to make a mapping between one challenge you face

139
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:18,570
and offer one advice of how to deal with that, in the end, of course, you should follow all

140
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,513
the advices or at least come up with your own reflected process of criticizing students.

141
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,512
because they don't work in isolation and some of them are actually the answer to a couple

142
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:35,375
of challenges and others are actually not just a part of the answer to the challenge

143
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,075
I'm presenting.

144
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:42,098
So it's not as straightforward as it might look on the first glance because slides make

145
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,699
it simpler, make it appear simpler.

146
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:50,743
And I will use some anecdotes from my own practice in order to underline what projects

147
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:51,484
I was facing.

148
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,136
So this is Player Unknown Battlegrounds.

149
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:57,096
I guess a couple of people have played it.

150
00:09:57,116 --> 00:10:00,317
I've heard it's something like 30 million or a crazy number.

151
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:09,519
And it came out about a year after a group of students I was supervising was presenting

152
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:17,161
their idea on how to fix the problem that multiplayer games play very differently depending

153
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:18,781
on the amount of players in a level.

154
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:22,542
And their solution was actually the opposite of Player Unknown Battlegrounds.

155
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:28,259
The solution was to expand the level the more people would join the server.

156
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:33,081
And they would write procedural animation algorithms to actually expand in a useful

157
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:33,301
way.

158
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:39,524
Which is technically a very interesting challenge, but it is just not solving their initial design

159
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:39,984
problem.

160
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:47,067
So their problem of the game not getting, or the game having to adapt to the number

161
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:48,808
of players in order to stay interesting.

162
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,340
was exactly not solved by that approach.

163
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:59,163
And I had somehow completely failed at keeping them focused on the problem they were actually

164
00:10:59,223 --> 00:10:59,924
trying to solve.

165
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:06,427
I was facing challenges, and one of the challenges was they had different goals to me.

166
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:11,890
They actually, I thought, their goal should be to solve the problem of scaling multiplayer

167
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:12,170
games.

168
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:16,913
But they thought they had actually come up with a particular solution for a particular

169
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:18,854
use case, and that has to be great.

170
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,918
It wasn't.

171
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,401
And I would have to criticize myself for that.

172
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:34,565
But it is one case of students that were just not receptive to what I was telling them.

173
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:44,312
But other challenges we are facing are, for example, students that are minimaxing or maximining their efforts.

174
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:49,255
So they try to get the maximum return on their investment, with minimal investment of course.

175
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,252
or they try to just get through with the minimum effort.

176
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:54,134
I guess you all had students like that.

177
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,576
And it's not easy to work with them.

178
00:11:56,976 --> 00:12:00,780
What works for me in any case, but in particular in that case,

179
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,661
is actually getting them truly engaged

180
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:05,564
by asking them questions about what they're working on.

181
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:12,062
In order for them to not be satisfied with just delivering or maybe they are not even

182
00:12:12,262 --> 00:12:14,804
able to find out what they have to deliver to you.

183
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:17,767
So they cannot just sneak through with minimal effort.

184
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:22,490
If you do not give them the opportunity to find out what the bar is, they have to jump

185
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:22,771
over.

186
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:26,614
But instead ask them to get thinking on their own.

187
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,558
Then for students that haven't done anything, the thing there is

188
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:36,635
One thing, of course, as I said before, design processes are messy sometimes, actually,

189
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:40,596
having not done anything has very good reasons. You need a week to just,

190
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:48,158
a week to, where you cannot come up with, now and then have a week where you just cannot

191
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:51,819
come up with any new ideas. It's a very normal thing in a design process.

192
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:59,301
And your criticism of student projects should reflect the fact that sometimes doing nothing

193
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:04,885
is a very productive thing and sometimes not coming up with the correct solution is still

194
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:07,967
a part of a process that can lead to the right outcome.

195
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:12,751
So your critique, your feedback to any work that students do should kind of match the

196
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:17,375
development stage or the design stage that they are in, in any case.

197
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,504
With the students that worked on this anti-player on battlegrounds idea, I think the mistake

198
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:32,588
I made is that we didn't talk about the core of their problem explicitly enough.

199
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:38,691
So just drilling down to what is the problem they are actually trying to solve was just

200
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:43,655
– it did not happen because I was not reflective enough in the process of criticizing them

201
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:46,336
by myself.

202
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:47,917
So I should have actually asked them.

203
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,351
the right questions that would force them to actually confront themselves with what

204
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:54,052
problem they are actually trying to solve.

205
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:56,773
Well, we have evaluation systems.

206
00:13:56,913 --> 00:14:02,616
Denmark is huge in evaluating everything, especially education, and of course students

207
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,757
are allowed to give feedback after the process.

208
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:09,159
So in this case, after they had finished the master thesis, they filled out an evaluation

209
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,200
form and one of the feedbacks I got from them was

210
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,354
that I kept telling them the same thing over and over again.

211
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:18,956
And what I told them was that if they want to solve the problem of an expanding level,

212
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:23,358
what they should do is make a super simple 2D prototype with barely any gameplay,

213
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,719
with just the bare necessities,

214
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,162
and just try out if their solution is actually the solution to their problem.

215
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:35,205
They didn't. Instead, they started with 3D and had all the problems that 3D games bring with them.

216
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:40,027
Despite the fact that there are a lot of well-known, big AAA productions out there.

217
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:45,044
And also a lot of small games that started out as simple 2D prototypes.

218
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,687
So obviously I was not very effective in communicating to those students.

219
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:57,631
One of the things was that it was very obvious that their team leader took any criticism

220
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:05,075
that I presented extremely personal, which maybe I could have mitigated by separating

221
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:06,235
much clearer between

222
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,739
criticizing the product, the process, and the designer.

223
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,662
I do not know if it is even a good idea to ever criticize the designer.

224
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:15,443
They are students.

225
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:20,186
But what I do know is that in that case I should have criticized the process most because

226
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:23,788
the product was something that was so, they had invested so much, it was so dear to them

227
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:26,010
that it was like criticizing the designer.

228
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,273
But the process was something that we actually could have agreed on together and that we

229
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:33,235
could have fixed in order to fix their product also.

230
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:36,056
So I was kind of targeting the wrong...

231
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:39,751
I was just targeting the wrong thing in that case.

232
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:41,693
And that made communication very difficult.

233
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:49,362
Then if students, a lot of students, so we, as I said, my university is in Denmark, we are an English language program.

234
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:52,025
We have students from I don't know how many countries.

235
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:55,669
And most of them are not English native speakers.

236
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:56,710
That's a huge exception.

237
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:02,733
It's somehow, sometimes they are very bad at articulating what they're doing and you

238
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,154
have to have a lot of patience with them.

239
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:08,715
Sometimes I am bad at articulating my critique, but what I have learned is that it is very

240
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:15,577
hard to formulate critiques so that the positive and the negative comes on equal footing because

241
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:19,818
it's not about, not only about what you say, it's more about how it is received actually,

242
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,779
which is a difficult rhetorical exercise.

243
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:30,379
And finally, a very simple trick if students are easily demotivated or also if they're

244
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,843
easily offended is just saying something nice first or maybe even sandwiching the critical

245
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:36,183
part.

246
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:37,324
Those things work.

247
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:43,548
Let's quickly talk about an example where the process of critique was actually more

248
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:43,969
fruitful.

249
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:47,771
And Ed Moffser mentioned it before, the game done by Broken Rules as their first game.

250
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:55,037
Bila was supervising them and later joined them as a partner in the company.

251
00:16:56,028 --> 00:17:00,590
They had one issue where they wanted to make mouse-based, mouse and keyboard controls,

252
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,931
whereas I wanted them to make only keyboard controls.

253
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:07,193
Because they made a platformer, a platformer should be played with a gamepad.

254
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:12,795
The easiest equivalent that you have on a PC is, or the most straightforward equivalent, is the keyboard and not the mouse.

255
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:16,537
Well, in a way I was very right.

256
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:23,060
I was very clear and told them in a very concrete way that they just should.

257
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,892
do that instead of having the mouse because it will be easier for people to play.

258
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:34,318
Funnily, later they reintroduced the mouse controls for when they ported the game to the Wii

259
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:38,461
and suddenly their old control scheme was actually exactly what they needed for that port.

260
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:43,565
But in that case I could convince them because I just demonstrated to them that this is the

261
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,368
established practice for platformers. And they believed me, or they didn't believe me,

262
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,610
they believed the numbers, they believed the experience out there.

263
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,225
A trick that you can always take if you're criticizing students is just taking a step

264
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:07,430
back and kind of aligning yourself with the student on a meta level.

265
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:11,755
I sometimes do that even when I'm grading, that I actually agree if I have very different

266
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:15,119
projects in one class and have to grade them according to the same standards.

267
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:21,463
Then my standards are I agree on individual goals per project with the student in an explicit

268
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:24,023
session, supervision session, where we agree on that.

269
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,384
So aligning goals can be something that is done in a very explicit way.

270
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:32,846
And then finally, should all feedback based on models and guidance be revealed to students

271
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:33,366
in advance?

272
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:39,848
Especially Danish students seem to be very fond of that they like the formal structures

273
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:42,248
of courses to be very clear.

274
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:47,065
At the same time, of course, you lose a bit of flexibility that way.

275
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:55,389
So it's not something I would universally recommend, but in the end, the process that

276
00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:00,011
leads to your, that encompasses your critique should at least be clearly communicated to

277
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:00,531
the student.

278
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:06,294
Well, I already said that I have a very distinct relationship to the game and the other novice

279
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:10,456
because I supervised it and then later I became financially invested in it in a way.

280
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,258
So the fourth challenge in critique is, of course, yourself.

281
00:19:14,263 --> 00:19:19,106
In this case it was so that I actually got involved in that project that it was very

282
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:24,049
clear that criticizing the game was criticizing my own supervision practice, it was criticizing

283
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:29,292
myself, which is something that can happen very easily and the only solution that I actually

284
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:35,196
have is that I'm nowadays very conscious about that and that I'm very actively trying to

285
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:40,680
give students a lot of freedom in order to prevent that I get too attached to any project.

286
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:45,484
Because as a teacher, I think I shouldn't claim too much authorship over it.

287
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:49,526
It bent okay with the moves, but that is, I think, not the normal case.

288
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:54,729
So it's difficult, unless you explicitly set up a project to be a collaboration with students,

289
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:55,129
of course.

290
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:56,530
But that was not the idea back then.

291
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,711
It should have been their game, maybe even more.

292
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:04,553
And finally, I'm standing here telling you how to criticize student projects, and at

293
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:06,775
the same time I have a huge problem with imposter syndrome.

294
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:08,916
I feel like, who am I to tell you anything?

295
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,870
And I don't have a clear solution for that.

296
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,251
I'm pretty sure that there were enough talks about that.

297
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,311
There have been some at GDC.

298
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:24,133
And I did a quick Twitter survey to find out if XKCD on GDC slides is OK.

299
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:30,115
And it was like 84% agreed that it is actually totally fine to have an XKCD joke to end your

300
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:30,415
slides.

301
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:35,136
But there is no solution for imposter syndrome.

302
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:39,677
The only solution is, well, obviously I have been teaching and supervising game projects

303
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:40,017
for a while.

304
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,959
It must be 18 years or something like that.

305
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:45,741
So I guess I have learned something along the way.

306
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:50,603
I just have to trust that, and you have to trust that too.

307
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:51,664
OK.

308
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:58,567
So with this, we have covered at least some aspects of the expert-based critique, and

309
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:01,728
I will hand over to Jessica, who will talk about peer feedback.

310
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:09,552
Hi.

311
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:15,903
I'm Jessica Hammer, and I just want to say that one great approach for dealing with imposter

312
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,724
syndrome around providing feedback to students is not to do it.

313
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:20,364
Make students do it instead.

314
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:25,646
And that's one of the hidden benefits of peer feedback in the game design classroom.

315
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:32,387
Just for context about who I am, I'm an assistant professor, jointly appointed in the Entertainment

316
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:37,049
Technology Center and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute in Carnegie Mellon University.

317
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:38,969
And I'm also a game designer.

318
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:45,600
And what I want to talk about today is these two formats for critique that involve students

319
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:48,783
providing feedback on each other's projects.

320
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:52,807
And I want to start by talking about why peer feedback is valuable.

321
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:58,391
The value of peer feedback is actually different from the value of expert or instructor-led

322
00:21:58,491 --> 00:21:59,052
feedback.

323
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:05,297
And I'll say I'm framing this as student and instructor, but this can also work in peer

324
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:06,899
designer situations.

325
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:14,101
But the student or the peer has actually two roles in a peer feedback situation.

326
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:18,563
They're receiving feedback from peers on their project in their role as a game designer.

327
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:20,584
They're also providing feedback.

328
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:24,705
And of course there's also a third stakeholder who is the instructor, right?

329
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:27,006
You're in the room while students are giving peer feedback.

330
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:33,247
And so feedback receivers, when students are in this role as feedback receivers,

331
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:37,171
peer feedback actually helps students improve their self-assessment skills.

332
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:42,496
Because students are much more likely to be critical of feedback

333
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:47,301
that comes from someone they don't see as, the great expert is giving me feedback.

334
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:49,003
It's, yeah, what do I really think about this?

335
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:53,351
It's easier to understand because there's less of an expertise gap.

336
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:58,815
The peer is more likely to be closer to their level of understanding and use a similar intellectual

337
00:22:58,895 --> 00:22:59,395
framework.

338
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:02,517
And allowing peers to give feedback.

339
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:03,658
There are many peers.

340
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:05,759
There is only one of you.

341
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,043
And so feedback can be diverse and copious and timely as opposed to students sort of

342
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:15,325
waiting in line until you're ready to get to their project.

343
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:23,752
As feedback providers, peer feedback trains students in the norms, values, and practices

344
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:25,193
of your discipline.

345
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:30,617
So it actually helps students recognize high quality work and internalize standards because

346
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:35,882
they have to practice taking on this role of someone who is the evaluator or the feedback

347
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:36,242
provider.

348
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:39,245
They're not just watching you do it, they have to do it themselves.

349
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:47,139
And finally, peer feedback is really valuable for you as an instructor because it exposes

350
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,642
student reasoning, helps you see where students are at in that process of internalizing norms,

351
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:54,423
values, and perspectives.

352
00:23:55,143 --> 00:24:01,085
And it can also help a critique or feedback process scale to larger classrooms, right?

353
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:06,206
So an intimate studio class might be like 12 people with peer feedback.

354
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:10,646
You can actually have seen peer feedback work in classrooms up to 200 students, which is

355
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:13,347
quite a remarkable shift in scale.

356
00:24:14,847 --> 00:24:21,568
But peer feedback also has some challenges around engagement, quality, and reflection.

357
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:28,809
Around engagement, you sometimes see students check out of the peer feedback process.

358
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:34,356
Interestingly, students also...

359
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,354
get over-invested in the peer feedback process.

360
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:40,896
So going to sleep, whatever, I'm just not going to do this peer feedback thing, that's

361
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:43,578
one sort of engagement-related failure state.

362
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:49,282
But students can also get hung up on arguing with each other in the peer feedback scenario

363
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:54,485
rather than paying attention to the thing that they're supposed to be responding to.

364
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:55,085
Right?

365
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:59,348
Oh, I think you should make the character larger.

366
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:01,109
No, I think you should make the character smaller.

367
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:04,591
Boom, the students are off and the designers are not getting useful feedback.

368
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:10,134
Quality of peer feedback is also an issue.

369
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:14,340
And actually, this has less to do with students not being expert game designers

370
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,224
and more with students being very reluctant to be critical.

371
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:21,871
So we've analyzed samples of thousands of peer feedback comments.

372
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,274
And very, very, very few of them are willing to directly criticize the work at hand.

373
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:34,700
Instead, what students will often do is jump directly to advice without providing any justification.

374
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,921
Here's what I think you should do.

375
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:37,302
Why should you do it?

376
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:39,424
Because I feel that way.

377
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,427
And often couched in these ways of like, they won't say anything negative, but they'll

378
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:46,569
give you some advice about how to change your project, but they won't tell you why.

379
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,673
This is actually extremely unhelpful for designers to use to iterate their games.

380
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:56,044
And then finally there are issues with reflection, right?

381
00:25:56,164 --> 00:25:58,965
So when you get a pile of feedback, what do you do with it?

382
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,927
How do you use it to iterate your game?

383
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:05,509
Well, one of the things you need to do is actually think and talk and understand the

384
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:06,730
feedback that you're getting.

385
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,111
And there are some problems in this.

386
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:11,232
This is actually not unique to peer feedback.

387
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:12,933
We see this with expert feedback too.

388
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:17,276
Students will overvalue positive comments and undervalue the few critical comments that

389
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:17,616
they get.

390
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:22,599
They will sometimes use feedback to justify exactly what it is they wanted to do.

391
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,162
Magic, how often feedback lines up with exactly the thing that they were already working on.

392
00:26:29,242 --> 00:26:31,063
Or they'll treat feedback as a checklist.

393
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,284
They won't evaluate it critically.

394
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:37,387
They'll just say, oh, well, okay, I guess, you know, 10 people said we needed to do X,

395
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:38,888
so let's do X, right?

396
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:44,091
So there are a number of failure states around how student teams make use of feedback and

397
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,132
integrate it into the design process.

398
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:54,451
And so one of the things that we work on in my lab are methods for improving peer feedback.

399
00:26:55,191 --> 00:27:00,856
And when I say methods, I actually do mean sort of replicable methods that you can teach

400
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:07,401
or systems that we embody with technology because these students have to do it.

401
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:08,261
You can't do it.

402
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:09,202
They have to do it.

403
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:09,763
Right?

404
00:27:09,783 --> 00:27:15,507
So this has to be a designed approach where you're training students or supporting or

405
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:17,148
scaffolding them in some way.

406
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:21,357
Because it's them, not you.

407
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:28,303
And like Martin, we frame peer feedback as an end-to-end process.

408
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:33,407
So if you think about these formats for critique, right, so we're doing, let's say, a live in-class

409
00:27:33,447 --> 00:27:37,390
play test and providing peer feedback, or we're doing student presentations with a

410
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:43,475
plenary critique, well, there's actually things that happen in the class before peer feedback

411
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:44,335
happens, right?

412
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:44,796
So there's this...

413
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,817
It's preparing for feedback.

414
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:52,181
And there's also things that happen after feedback, like, as I've alluded to, reflecting

415
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:55,123
on that feedback and integrating it into the design process.

416
00:27:55,663 --> 00:28:03,468
So you can really think about these issues of engagement, quality, and reflection as

417
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:07,971
they play out across these three phases of the peer feedback process.

418
00:28:09,012 --> 00:28:12,755
So what I want to talk about today is two sort of contrasting cases.

419
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:18,545
Two different methods that we've developed and have deployed in real classrooms and have

420
00:28:18,585 --> 00:28:24,431
collected data on to understand how they help students become better peer feedback providers

421
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:31,139
and receivers and how it can help instructors in the game design education process.

422
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:38,039
The first of these is something I call the Yoda method, and this is really meant for

423
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:39,980
live in-class playtests.

424
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:44,543
So you can see over here on this diagram, we've got like some faculty and some designers.

425
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:45,643
They're standing off to the side.

426
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:46,604
The designers are silent.

427
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:47,464
They are not allowed to talk.

428
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:48,705
They must listen and take notes.

429
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:52,907
And then you have some playtesters who are peers, right, other students in the class

430
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:53,968
and some observers.

431
00:28:57,497 --> 00:29:04,000
Before this thing, this thing, this playtest, live playtest ever happens, everybody, right,

432
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,222
so feedback designers, feedback receivers, but also the feedback providers, get something

433
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:13,224
that I call norm setting around how peer feedback goes.

434
00:29:14,305 --> 00:29:18,126
One of the ways that I do this is with an exercise that I like to call five spoons.

435
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:21,048
In five spoons, I divide the whole class into groups.

436
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:24,749
Every group gets five spoons, and I give them 15 minutes to make a game.

437
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,250
These games are not very good.

438
00:29:29,055 --> 00:29:34,478
And that is intentional, because making a game that there is no reasonable expectation

439
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,361
could ever have been a successful game, takes their ego out of the process.

440
00:29:40,102 --> 00:29:43,585
All of these games are absolutely ridiculous, right?

441
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:47,388
And the spoons are meant to also help with this.

442
00:29:47,448 --> 00:29:48,169
It's silly.

443
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:52,493
People will balance them on their noses or use them to flick things across the room.

444
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:55,975
And it's meant to help them say, all right, I made a game.

445
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:58,277
There's a ton to criticize about this game.

446
00:29:58,938 --> 00:30:03,221
And I use this then to demonstrate high-quality feedback.

447
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:10,044
low quality feedback, and ask them to participate in a peer feedback process in a situation where their

448
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:18,867
ego is out of play. And this is really successful at norming that getting peer feedback on something in progress is okay.

449
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:24,570
It's okay to show work that's half-finished and kind of crappy, and that if you are getting

450
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:32,813
critical comments that help you improve your game, that is done out of love and to help you learn how to be a better game designer.

451
00:30:33,237 --> 00:30:34,877
Right, so five spoons.

452
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:44,482
During peer feedback, right, so during these live in-class playtests on games to which these students actually do have some attachment,

453
00:30:44,502 --> 00:30:51,045
they'll have been working on them for several weeks, we use EOTA, which is the piece of this that the method is named for,

454
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:55,608
and that stands for Experiences, Observations, Theories, and Advice.

455
00:30:56,228 --> 00:31:02,011
So, basically, we break down what kinds of feedback who is allowed to give and when.

456
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:07,993
First, the players are allowed to give feedback about their experiences, and only their experiences.

457
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:09,093
What did I feel?

458
00:31:09,153 --> 00:31:10,374
What did I experience?

459
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:11,314
What did I do?

460
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:18,256
Next, players and peers are allowed to talk about their observations, and observations

461
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,237
must be concrete.

462
00:31:20,537 --> 00:31:25,179
When this person got the water card, I saw them smile.

463
00:31:27,682 --> 00:31:32,264
Then, and only when we've gotten a whole bunch of observations, are students allowed to create

464
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:32,744
theories.

465
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:35,105
Why do these things happen?

466
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:40,828
And what they can then do is link experiences and observations and provide explanations.

467
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:44,310
Finally, the final phase is advice.

468
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,272
So both playtesters and peers can say, okay, well, based on these theories, here's what

469
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:50,053
I think you should do.

470
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:55,735
Slowing it down and breaking it down like this addresses a number of problems in the

471
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:56,936
peer feedback process.

472
00:31:58,063 --> 00:32:02,605
It diversifies participation and perspectives because people can't just jump to,

473
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:03,986
here's what I think you should do.

474
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:08,810
Slowing it down, everyone has eyes and that gives everybody a chance to say something

475
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,811
or to offer observations, especially in the first parts of the process.

476
00:32:12,912 --> 00:32:17,375
Having people think through sort of some data sources like experiences

477
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:22,899
and observations increases the provision of correct feedback that is justified and critical.

478
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:24,180
And.

479
00:32:24,952 --> 00:32:29,934
It means the teams aren't dependent on, that was some great advice we got.

480
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:36,077
Even if the advice they get is not terrific, they can actually use these lower level experiences,

481
00:32:36,297 --> 00:32:40,479
observations, and theories to make good decisions about their design.

482
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,862
Finally, after feedback, students are required to create a process document.

483
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:51,344
Designers, right, people who've gotten feedback have to create a process document, which can

484
00:32:51,384 --> 00:32:52,805
be worth up to a third of their grade.

485
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:59,458
And that's because when you design a game, the artifact itself, right, it's like you

486
00:32:59,518 --> 00:32:59,919
are here.

487
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:04,722
But it doesn't show the complex path that you took to get there.

488
00:33:05,123 --> 00:33:09,364
And especially it doesn't necessarily illuminate the kinds of critical decisions you made.

489
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:14,026
Your ability to decide what the right thing to do is.

490
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:18,548
Blind alleys that you may have gone down and invested a lot of work into that didn't pan out.

491
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:21,489
A process document is meant to capture all of these things.

492
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:26,891
And part of that includes selecting what feedback you want to include in the document.

493
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:32,580
And reflecting on how that feedback was instantiated in different versions of your game.

494
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:38,249
Right, so writing it, just making students write it down and explain it helps students

495
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,173
reflect and integrate feedback.

496
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:48,203
I want to show you a second system because there are many different ways to try to solve

497
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:53,047
these problems with instructional design and pedagogical techniques.

498
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:57,872
So this second approach is actually a digital system.

499
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:03,677
It's a web-based and you can get it on your phone, your tablet, your browser, and it's

500
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:08,141
led by my PhD student Amy Cook, and we've been working on this in collaboration with

501
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,602
Stephen Dow over at UCSD.

502
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,377
And Peer Presents is designed to be used in a plenary format.

503
00:34:14,997 --> 00:34:18,178
So designers are on stage presenting, peers and

504
00:34:18,238 --> 00:34:19,779
faculty are in the audience and

505
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:22,120
they're providing feedback on the presentation.

506
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,681
And Peer Presents actually lets them go online on their phone or

507
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:29,303
their tablet and provide their feedback live and in real time.

508
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:34,184
Before the feedback, before the presentation,

509
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:36,145
before any feedback happens.

510
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:42,403
The feedback receivers have to go in and write questions so the students, the designers,

511
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:46,866
would actually author the questions that they most want to get feedback on.

512
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:49,767
This gives them a sense of ownership of feedback.

513
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:54,290
You're not just telling me some random things, you're addressing the problems that I personally

514
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,292
identified as things that I care about and I need help with.

515
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:02,805
With some training, students can learn to write questions that elicit higher quality

516
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:08,927
feedback from their peers, and by making them have a team conversation, they all have to

517
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:13,529
agree on what questions they want to put into the system, it makes them reflect on the kind

518
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,169
of feedback that they want to receive.

519
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:22,012
During the feedback process, feedback providers can comment and they can vote, so they can

520
00:35:22,072 --> 00:35:26,294
type in that text box up there and you can see they can agree, or they can mark comments

521
00:35:26,314 --> 00:35:27,614
that they want to come back to later.

522
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:34,923
And during feedback, we've actually seen when we've implemented this in classrooms, these

523
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:39,504
multiple levels of engagement actually keep students engaged in the feedback process for

524
00:35:39,644 --> 00:35:41,964
more of the feedback period, right?

525
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:46,745
So we would go in and we'd see active engagement during like a 20-minute feedback period.

526
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:50,726
We'd see active engagement from students about through about the first five to eight minutes.

527
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:55,127
And using this system, we would see students continue to engage in peer feedback all the

528
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:58,207
way out to the 20-minute mark, which is quite a remarkable change.

529
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,747
instead of checking Facebook or sleeping.

530
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:07,496
What the digital system also does is it captures all the data from the peer feedback and makes

531
00:36:07,516 --> 00:36:12,417
it visible to the instructor, which lets you as an instructor reflect on what's going

532
00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:13,337
on in your classroom.

533
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,358
Who's not participating in feedback?

534
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:20,599
For example, we worked with one instructor who was shocked to realize that in this instructor's

535
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:25,039
previous peer feedback system, only about two-thirds of the students were participating,

536
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,900
which was about the same two-thirds as participated with the digital system.

537
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,661
But in order to find it out using the paper-based peer feedback system...

538
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:37,744
We actually had to go through and count a whole lot of index cards and the system just

539
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:39,545
presented it to them immediately.

540
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:48,171
Finally, after the feedback process, there's a receiver reflection process that's actually

541
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:49,191
built into the system.

542
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:50,812
And it's very simple.

543
00:36:50,992 --> 00:36:57,196
It's a set of filtering and tagging tasks that students walk through in order to start

544
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,738
to make sense of this giant pile of feedback they've just had dropped on them.

545
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:05,282
And so again, we ask teams to do this collaboratively.

546
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:08,963
They actually have to agree on, for example, which comments are helpful and which comments

547
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:09,764
are unhelpful.

548
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:13,606
It helps them evaluate high and low quality feedback.

549
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:20,429
And structuring the reflection process tends to reduce the incidence of some of the sort

550
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:25,071
of failure states that we've seen with open-ended reflection processes.

551
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:30,933
Like for example, ignoring all negative comments or deciding that the feedback means what you

552
00:37:30,973 --> 00:37:31,593
want it to mean.

553
00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:42,308
So we think that there are a lot more techniques to be designed in this space, right?

554
00:37:42,368 --> 00:37:48,550
More non-digital pedagogical methods, more digital systems that can help with improving

555
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:53,692
the peer feedback process for student stakeholders, both in their role as feedback providers and

556
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:56,113
receivers and also for instructors.

557
00:37:56,593 --> 00:37:59,934
So I just want to offer this to you as a way of thinking about the challenges that you

558
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:02,255
face with peer feedback in your own classroom.

559
00:38:03,022 --> 00:38:06,586
Are your biggest challenges around student engagement in the peer feedback process?

560
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:08,068
Will students just not do it?

561
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:10,431
Is it feedback quality?

562
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:15,398
Are students incredibly vague or always really chipper and positive even when it's not appropriate?

563
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:19,803
Or are your problems with how students are actually using the feedback that they get?

564
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:24,013
Then you can think about where you have resources to address it.

565
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:28,134
So the systems that I've described are all end-to-end, but you can think about, let's

566
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:31,616
say, your peer feedback doesn't start happening until the second half of the course.

567
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:36,937
You might have a lot of time to prepare students before peer feedback, before they ever start

568
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:37,117
this.

569
00:38:37,157 --> 00:38:40,918
Maybe that's where you want to design your intervention, or maybe you want to think about

570
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:44,960
end-to-end processes, like the examples that I've shown here.

571
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:54,665
So between us, Martin and I have talked about these four types of feedback and critique,

572
00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:58,747
peer critique, plenary critique, supervision, and grading.

573
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:02,169
I just want to show you we made a couple of slides with some references.

574
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:03,050
Don't read them now.

575
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,571
We'll put up our PDF and you can get them later.

576
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:06,632
But we have them.

577
00:39:07,232 --> 00:39:11,735
And what we're really interested in doing is having a conversation about expert and

578
00:39:11,835 --> 00:39:14,056
peer critique with all of you.

579
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:17,298
And I want to say we're going to open for questions in a minute.

580
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:23,028
But I want to especially point out that if you're interested in Peer Presents,

581
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:28,612
my student Amy Cook is actively recruiting classrooms to work with right now.

582
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:33,915
So I'm putting her email address up there to prototype, to prototype, to reach out.

583
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:40,180
And there's also a couple of sessions on critique on Wednesday and

584
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,101
Thursday led by Jeff Hesser.

585
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:43,562
Can you just raise your hand and wave it around?

586
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,223
Okay, so look over there.

587
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:50,580
I think that's going to be an opportunity to also continue these conversations.

588
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,881
I'm going to leave our email addresses up there.

589
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,561
You're welcome to contact both of us.

590
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:56,942
But as of now, we are open for questions.

591
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:58,042
Thank you very much.

592
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:00,603
APPLAUSE

593
00:40:00,643 --> 00:40:00,703
Hi.

594
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:20,868
I'm not in education, but I try to participate in a lot of local Bay Area, because I live

595
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:29,971
here, local Bay Area sort of design groups, and I have a lot of friends who are working

596
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:34,753
on board games and video games and things that they want to prototype and take to Kickstarter

597
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:35,133
and things.

598
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:42,998
Not to toot my own horn, but I have been trying very hard over the past several years to learn

599
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:45,239
as much about game design as possible.

600
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:55,406
And so sometimes I kind of feel like I know a little bit more and it can be a little awkward

601
00:40:55,826 --> 00:41:01,690
not being in a classroom setting and having like different social situations around.

602
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:07,796
the peer critique process and things have gotten pretty heated sometimes with some friends

603
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:12,841
over certain projects where I see them making certain mistakes and caring more about well

604
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:18,386
is the game balanced right now and really what they need to be focusing on is how hard

605
00:41:18,446 --> 00:41:24,312
is the game to learn right now and what do you folks think about those kinds of things

606
00:41:25,113 --> 00:41:25,813
just in general?

607
00:41:30,481 --> 00:41:31,442
I will repeat the question.

608
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:38,606
So the question is, how do you deal with critique processes outside of a classroom situation

609
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:46,090
where you don't necessarily have the same kind of buy-in to the instructor is an expert,

610
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,671
though I will say not all students think of instructors as experts.

611
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:53,871
And where there may be other kinds of relationships at play.

612
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,292
So how do you do that?

613
00:41:56,413 --> 00:42:01,695
I will say that taking some of these peer feedback techniques out of the classroom can

614
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:02,916
be really, really fruitful.

615
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:10,260
So we have looked at a little bit about how they can be deployed in situations with working

616
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,542
game designers, whether in industry or indie.

617
00:42:14,422 --> 00:42:16,663
One of the things there is that...

618
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:24,899
Peer feedback actually sort of is deliberately designed to flatten some of these power distance

619
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:30,421
hierarchies that it is up to the designers to decide whose feedback is important.

620
00:42:30,721 --> 00:42:34,423
And one of the things that we're actually experimenting with as researchers is whether

621
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:39,505
putting faculty feedback into the same peer feedback system as the student peer feedback

622
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:43,247
helps designers be more critical of faculty feedback.

623
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:44,647
So I would say that...

624
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,025
When everyone involved is voluntarily there and it's a peer-led design situation,

625
00:42:53,006 --> 00:43:00,532
then even if someone has more expertise at game design, but socially your peers, and I would

626
00:43:00,572 --> 00:43:05,136
treat that as a peer feedback situation rather than an expert critique situation. That's how

627
00:43:05,196 --> 00:43:11,901
I would tackle this. And additionally, I think what I said before, making them realize that

628
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:15,604
their problems themselves is always better than telling them.

629
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:22,381
So if you just ask the right questions, you might just get a little bit further than by telling them what you think

630
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:28,922
And feel free to track us down if you want to dig in because sounds interesting

631
00:43:31,103 --> 00:43:33,823
Thank you both awesome talk a

632
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:40,805
Question for Martin so you had a great slide on if someone's easily offended you separate the product in the process, etc

633
00:43:40,825 --> 00:43:42,705
I thought that was a great point

634
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:45,124
I've tried to use that technique in the past.

635
00:43:45,204 --> 00:43:49,768
I can tend to be, I'm looking at my former employee sitting in front of me, very bad

636
00:43:49,808 --> 00:43:51,329
at giving that feedback.

637
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:56,953
So my question is, when you build a culture of accountability, you want someone to own

638
00:43:56,973 --> 00:43:58,874
the product, to process everything together.

639
00:43:59,034 --> 00:44:02,357
But then when you want to give critique, you want to separate it so there isn't that easily

640
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:03,077
offended nature.

641
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:07,080
So I was curious if you could talk about some techniques of how you deliver that communication

642
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,483
to be able to separate the product and the process and the review that's going on.

643
00:44:12,164 --> 00:44:12,224
Oh.

644
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:18,290
Great question, thank you. So the question is how to, in practice, separate between

645
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,973
the design process, criticizing the design process, criticizing the product of design,

646
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:30,339
and criticizing the designer. I think a part of the solution is actually what Jessica was

647
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:35,964
presenting, that you can standardize some processes, and that can help in

648
00:44:36,602 --> 00:44:43,103
Like, you presented the separating the talking about the experience from talking about the

649
00:44:43,543 --> 00:44:46,444
observations from building the theory and so on.

650
00:44:46,844 --> 00:44:48,685
And I think the key is somewhere in there.

651
00:44:48,745 --> 00:44:55,787
So by regulating what you're talking about at what point, you can be more conscious about

652
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:57,187
what you're criticizing.

653
00:44:57,707 --> 00:45:02,648
And I have a hunch that the solution to that problem is in that space, if anything.

654
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:09,491
But of course for all of this you have to be extremely reflected about how what you're

655
00:45:09,611 --> 00:45:12,093
saying arrives at the person.

656
00:45:12,893 --> 00:45:18,597
Yes, and that is just, I mean, psychology is just a very difficult topic and rhetorics

657
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:19,217
is difficult.

658
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:21,839
That is just very, very, very complex.

659
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:23,560
Maybe you have experience.

660
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,121
Yeah.

661
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:24,981
So I actually...

662
00:45:26,383 --> 00:45:31,065
Although I'm talking about peer feedback today, as a researcher, as an instructor, I do have

663
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:34,247
to grapple with exactly the situation that you're describing.

664
00:45:35,327 --> 00:45:41,250
One key technique for me is actually reframing what the designer is attaching their sense

665
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,191
of identity or their sense of value to.

666
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:50,034
So instead of saying, you're a designer who is good at design, right, to shift it to say,

667
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:55,097
one of the things I really value about you is how committed you are to improving and

668
00:45:55,137 --> 00:45:55,677
getting better.

669
00:45:56,117 --> 00:46:01,300
And therefore, I'm on your side with your goals as a human being, so now let's critique

670
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,381
this project together.

671
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:09,286
So find a shared value that puts the critique as something that builds them up rather than

672
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:10,046
tearing them down.

673
00:46:11,187 --> 00:46:11,507
Thank you.

674
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:15,030
I enjoyed your talk.

675
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:15,750
Thank you very much.

676
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,233
These are issues that we all grapple with in one way or another here.

677
00:46:21,454 --> 00:46:24,096
The question I have concerns the extent to which

678
00:46:24,827 --> 00:46:31,090
The peer critique aspect of a course is focused on in the course.

679
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:36,793
So you could have a course that deals specifically with this and how is that related to grading

680
00:46:36,853 --> 00:46:42,436
in terms of, I mean, so what pedagogical role would this have in the course?

681
00:46:42,496 --> 00:46:44,096
What do you want the students to learn?

682
00:46:44,196 --> 00:46:45,997
They could learn the critique or they could

683
00:46:47,082 --> 00:46:49,083
I mean, or is it producing a good product?

684
00:46:49,263 --> 00:46:52,785
So what role does this have in different courses?

685
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:57,047
And how does it contribute to a grade, for example?

686
00:46:57,427 --> 00:47:01,529
So I will say that I think that there's

687
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,950
no single answer to that.

688
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,031
But I can give you sort of the way

689
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:07,312
that many of my courses work, which

690
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:09,874
is for every project that you put together,

691
00:47:10,254 --> 00:47:12,975
there's actually three components

692
00:47:13,015 --> 00:47:15,796
to your grade, which are each worth approximately a third.

693
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:22,443
So one of them is basically like, do you appear to have learned any of the course content?

694
00:47:22,784 --> 00:47:23,004
Right?

695
00:47:23,664 --> 00:47:24,905
So I often will call this theory.

696
00:47:24,945 --> 00:47:28,548
It's like, are you using the readings?

697
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:30,930
Are you using game terminology of game designers?

698
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:31,251
Right?

699
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:32,812
So are you kind of, are you showing up?

700
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:36,935
A third of it is process.

701
00:47:36,975 --> 00:47:39,397
So the process document that I talked about, which includes.

702
00:47:40,114 --> 00:47:44,900
peer critique, it includes play testing, it includes your own critical judgment and

703
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,706
your ability to decide what it is you're going to invest your time in, it includes things

704
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:53,972
like how you manage conflicts within the team, and then third is a product.

705
00:47:54,652 --> 00:47:57,736
And I, which is just like, what did you make?

706
00:47:57,937 --> 00:47:58,357
How good is it?

707
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:03,980
And the reason why I grade like this is because, like Martin, I really want to push students

708
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,104
to be ambitious and experimental while they're in school and can do that.

709
00:48:08,744 --> 00:48:13,609
And so I want the person who tries something really safe to get the same grade as the person

710
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:17,712
who tries something really, really ambitious, crashes and burns, but learns an enormous

711
00:48:17,752 --> 00:48:18,092
amount.

712
00:48:18,753 --> 00:48:24,658
And both of those students, I think, are about as successful in my classes and in the process

713
00:48:24,678 --> 00:48:26,500
of becoming a game designer.

714
00:48:27,116 --> 00:48:31,258
And the student who's going to really succeed and who's going to get the top grade in the class

715
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:36,980
is the person who is both developing a sustainable game design process where they're trying things

716
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,262
and really operating in that zone of proximal development, and they also manage to make it work.

717
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:48,065
I just have an anecdote about that. In the first years I was teaching a class called Game Design.

718
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:54,638
I had a co-teacher who was very much into turning everything into a game.

719
00:48:54,658 --> 00:48:59,479
He was a game designer working in the games industry and just an external lecturer.

720
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:03,440
And he actually turned the grading into a game.

721
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:09,941
So he introduced a system of peer grading that was not really 100% of the grade, but

722
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:12,762
about 50% of the grade was actually decided by peers.

723
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:14,182
And in the end...

724
00:49:15,313 --> 00:49:22,356
Quality is something that is defining, if you just, the grade was purely based on the

725
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:23,376
product in that case.

726
00:49:23,876 --> 00:49:30,479
And actually the games that got graded highly or regarded highly by peers were exactly the

727
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:34,360
games that actually deserved it, except for some exceptions.

728
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,222
So we kind of fixed it a little bit in the end, we could override the grades that the

729
00:49:39,282 --> 00:49:39,902
peers gave.

730
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,421
But in the end, we could have just given the grades that the students gave each other and

731
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:47,241
it would have been fine in a way.

732
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:53,323
But it was a very nice exercise actually and it was packaged in a very nice game.

733
00:49:55,424 --> 00:49:55,724
Thank you.

734
00:49:57,324 --> 00:49:58,005
Hey.

735
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:03,066
So, like with these really structured peer review systems, there's like a lot of fluency

736
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:07,347
the students have to build to sort of get good at them and use them effectively.

737
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:08,828
How...

738
00:50:09,512 --> 00:50:15,095
Have you guys worked with other departments or other instructors in your programs to help

739
00:50:15,355 --> 00:50:16,636
that fluency carry on?

740
00:50:16,696 --> 00:50:20,018
It's not just like I invested so heavily in this technique and walked off.

741
00:50:20,178 --> 00:50:24,080
Could you talk a little bit about what that looks like and how you got buy-in from maybe

742
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,341
people that were a little bit reluctant to do it this way?

743
00:50:27,902 --> 00:50:32,865
I'm just going to repeat the question like I think I forgot to do last time.

744
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:35,046
How do you get buy-in from instructors?

745
00:50:35,186 --> 00:50:39,028
Are these techniques, especially for peer feedback, is it high overhead?

746
00:50:40,149 --> 00:50:44,912
So we've now, my team has now worked with people across multiple departments at multiple

747
00:50:44,972 --> 00:50:46,073
schools actually.

748
00:50:46,153 --> 00:50:51,497
So we've spent a lot of time thinking about how do you onboard people to these processes.

749
00:50:52,077 --> 00:50:55,980
And generally speaking, that if faculty are already bought into the idea of peer feedback

750
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,864
having value, we can generally get them up and running with our processes within one

751
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:03,105
to two hours of their time.

752
00:51:03,205 --> 00:51:05,947
So it's actually compared to what they're already doing.

753
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:09,216
Faculty will actually generally say these things are less work.

754
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:11,197
It saves them time.

755
00:51:11,497 --> 00:51:15,000
Now, of course, convincing them that it will save them time before they do it is its own

756
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,183
tricky scenario, but now we have enough data from instructors saying this is about how

757
00:51:20,223 --> 00:51:21,123
long it will take you.

758
00:51:22,024 --> 00:51:25,726
We typically actually have someone from the research team just come in and do like a 20-minute

759
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:26,987
training for peer presents.

760
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:32,284
For the IOTA method, it's like a one-on-one meeting with the instructor just to walk them

761
00:51:32,324 --> 00:51:35,686
through it and show how they should teach the students.

762
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:36,926
So it's a modeling process.

763
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:41,889
But they can do actually live modeling with one of the games in the class, right?

764
00:51:42,009 --> 00:51:46,691
So these are meant to be things that are pretty lightweight and you can try.

765
00:51:47,632 --> 00:51:53,134
If you're not already using peer feedback in your class, or if it's mostly peer evaluation,

766
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:57,056
so thinking about peers giving grades, then it's a much, much bigger.

767
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,564
And to be honest, we have not worked with instructors who are not involved with peer

768
00:52:02,584 --> 00:52:03,785
feedback in some way.

769
00:52:05,366 --> 00:52:08,929
The research shows that peer feedback is great for students.

770
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:13,913
So one of the things we're hoping to do is to create systems that are so easy to use

771
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:15,834
that you won't mind changing your syllabus.

772
00:52:17,155 --> 00:52:18,076
But we're not there yet.

773
00:52:19,697 --> 00:52:23,780
Actually we have a unit at the university called Learning Support Unit, which is a small

774
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,661
department of just five people or so.

775
00:52:26,129 --> 00:52:31,654
That researchers provide training in tools like you're producing.

776
00:52:32,254 --> 00:52:34,737
And that is how my university solves the problem.

777
00:52:34,897 --> 00:52:37,119
You can just book them to give a workshop.

778
00:52:41,126 --> 00:52:46,269
But funnily actually, my part of these slides was developed in the teacher development program

779
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:47,330
of my university.

780
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:54,855
So where I, and the reason why I even had the idea of talking about critique was because

781
00:52:54,995 --> 00:52:56,956
we have it in so many different disciplines.

782
00:52:56,996 --> 00:53:02,219
You have it in, you have critique sessions, they are called code reviews, in programming

783
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,860
as well as in design.

784
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:10,405
So I think sometimes it's also just translating your tools to their language.

785
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:12,486
that generates their interest.

786
00:53:14,386 --> 00:53:14,707
Thank you.

787
00:53:16,687 --> 00:53:18,628
Hi there. So I'm currently

788
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:20,809
co-instructing a course with this guy

789
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:22,990
over here, over at Purdue University

790
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,731
and one thing we've

791
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:26,132
struggled with a lot is this

792
00:53:26,532 --> 00:53:28,793
peer feedback and just evaluation and critique.

793
00:53:29,713 --> 00:53:30,333
It feels like

794
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:32,534
since we are part of a program

795
00:53:32,554 --> 00:53:34,415
called CGT, which is computer graphics,

796
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,316
we're trying to cram in

797
00:53:36,596 --> 00:53:39,077
the art side and the programming side and the design side.

798
00:53:39,484 --> 00:53:44,926
all within two courses, and so whenever we're spending time on these feedback sessions or

799
00:53:45,006 --> 00:53:49,927
like sharing presentations, the students sort of feel like they're losing that time.

800
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:53,748
You know, and not just the students who say, you know, want to get out of the critique,

801
00:53:53,828 --> 00:53:57,669
but also the ones who are really fired up to keep working on their game.

802
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:01,390
They feel like they just lose a whole day of development time that they're together

803
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,191
cooperating.

804
00:54:03,411 --> 00:54:05,252
And so we've tried a couple different systems.

805
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:08,080
And I do think norm setting is going to help.

806
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,121
I honestly just want to go back home and implement that as soon as I can.

807
00:54:13,602 --> 00:54:20,485
But in the meantime, I was curious about the idea of sort of like remote critique.

808
00:54:20,985 --> 00:54:24,987
So for example, you have everyone sit down at a computer with someone else's game,

809
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:31,050
you play it, it has in-game analytics that are keeping track and say like logging that to a file,

810
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:33,431
and then you step over to the next computer when you're done.

811
00:54:34,878 --> 00:54:38,841
You know, it sounds reasonable from a logistical standpoint,

812
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:45,726
but I'm concerned that it wouldn't have the ethical and empathic response

813
00:54:46,427 --> 00:54:47,948
that the stuff you've described would have.

814
00:54:48,428 --> 00:54:52,351
Do you think a remote method would be in danger of losing the value

815
00:54:52,491 --> 00:54:55,873
because you're not getting that one-on-one or that communication?

816
00:54:57,034 --> 00:54:57,635
Great question.

817
00:54:58,268 --> 00:55:01,049
So I'm going to attempt to summarize it.

818
00:55:01,069 --> 00:55:03,009
A lot of context in your question.

819
00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:12,411
So the question is, if you're in a situation where there's a lot of demands on in-class time,

820
00:55:12,711 --> 00:55:20,013
are there ways that you can do peer feedback that sort of minimize the amount of class time devoted to it,

821
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:21,934
but still get the benefits of peer feedback?

822
00:55:22,434 --> 00:55:22,614
So...

823
00:55:26,217 --> 00:55:32,279
One thing to keep in mind, so I talk about in-class peer feedback because there are systems

824
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:36,561
that actually will let you do asynchronous remote peer feedback on other students' projects

825
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:43,883
and it turns out that there are basically students find them very burdensome and they

826
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:47,465
won't do them and so that's part of the reason why we're looking at in-class.

827
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:50,006
But you can make it more efficient.

828
00:55:50,626 --> 00:55:54,407
And one of the things that we've looked at is breaking students into groups.

829
00:55:55,427 --> 00:56:00,228
So you can actually do the IOTA method in parallel.

830
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:06,670
What I would recommend is having the students go around in groups of three so that they

831
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,790
are actually hearing each other's feedback and each other's comments.

832
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:10,831
That's really important.

833
00:56:12,011 --> 00:56:14,892
But one thing that I'll do is have a designer stationed at each station.

834
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,612
And then have students go around in groups of three.

835
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:21,074
So now you're dividing the right because everything's going on in parallel.

836
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:22,194
I think that could really help you.

837
00:56:22,214 --> 00:56:25,676
I have a write up of how I've done that, which I'm happy to send you.

838
00:56:29,182 --> 00:56:32,343
I have no experience with remote feedback, honestly.

839
00:56:32,883 --> 00:56:36,985
I just can't say anything useful to this question, sorry.

840
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:38,785
Well also you're characterizing it as remote.

841
00:56:38,825 --> 00:56:41,886
I wouldn't call it remote, I'd call it parallel feedback.

842
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:50,949
I'll also say that one area I'm really interested in exploring is actually live streaming for

843
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:51,749
peer feedback.

844
00:56:52,129 --> 00:56:57,250
So if you're interested in prototyping this in your class, let's talk and we've got some

845
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,871
systems that can support you with it.

846
00:56:59,251 --> 00:57:03,712
So, that might help you take it out of class time, but still create that sense of peer

847
00:57:03,732 --> 00:57:07,613
accountability and commitment to each other as human beings as well as designers.

848
00:57:07,853 --> 00:57:08,953
So, we'll talk.

849
00:57:09,273 --> 00:57:09,573
Awesome.

850
00:57:09,974 --> 00:57:14,074
I know another instructor whose research is focused on live stream teaching too.

851
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:16,255
So, I would love to get you to talk about that as well.

852
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:16,495
Okay, great.

853
00:57:16,555 --> 00:57:19,436
Make the connection and we'll, thank you GDC.

854
00:57:19,456 --> 00:57:20,176
This is awesome.

855
00:57:20,476 --> 00:57:20,756
Yeah.

856
00:57:21,076 --> 00:57:21,576
Thank you so much.

857
00:57:22,496 --> 00:57:22,757
Okay.

858
00:57:26,807 --> 00:57:28,568
And I think this is going to have to be our last question.

859
00:57:28,808 --> 00:57:29,789
Sweet.

860
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:34,951
So my question is for Martin about the expert level feedback.

861
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:36,331
And I'll give you some context.

862
00:57:36,531 --> 00:57:39,433
I'm a previous software engineer and we do Agile and sprints.

863
00:57:40,353 --> 00:57:44,575
And at the academy that I teach at, we do two week sprints.

864
00:57:44,735 --> 00:57:46,816
And they last four months.

865
00:57:47,456 --> 00:57:51,038
And every two weeks we get together and then we do feedback with the students.

866
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:55,780
And as an instructor, the problem to be solved is to make sure that the students get feedback.

867
00:57:56,138 --> 00:58:02,402
the most out of it, that they can create, you know, critical analysis and provide useful feedback.

868
00:58:02,442 --> 00:58:10,486
But as a software engineer, the product needs to be good towards the end. So my question would be,

869
00:58:10,506 --> 00:58:15,209
do you find yourself sticking to your guns throughout this entire process,

870
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:20,632
or do you find yourself evolving and making a decision at runtime, I guess,

871
00:58:21,312 --> 00:58:24,975
when you need to kind of step into a more professional type of expert role?

872
00:58:26,376 --> 00:58:34,582
So the question is if I'm sticking to my guns of actually, it's a very good question.

873
00:58:35,802 --> 00:58:44,708
The question is if I kind of overrule my recommendations of forcing them to reflect on the process

874
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:50,592
in favor of actually just giving them expert advice because I am the expert in the room.

875
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:55,876
Wow, this is a great last question that we could talk about for half an hour.

876
00:58:56,261 --> 00:59:02,487
I think actually whenever you design a class or a curriculum or whatever, you always have

877
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:08,273
to make this, you have this slider where you define if your class is supporting students

878
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:16,802
learning about the process or if it is about having an optimal end result as a product.

879
00:59:18,674 --> 00:59:25,018
I usually think that it's so complicated because students get motivated by working on, let's

880
00:59:25,078 --> 00:59:28,300
say, a great game if they're in a game development class.

881
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:33,964
So of course you want to support them making a great game, but at the same time you also

882
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:38,467
want to support them even more to make it to fail spectacularly, as you said before.

883
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:42,890
A great game is easiest made if you make a very safe bet.

884
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:44,953
and you don't want them to bet safely.

885
00:59:45,033 --> 00:59:49,656
Also, you want them to have communication problems in their team

886
00:59:49,736 --> 00:59:53,199
because they have to learn working with different opinions,

887
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:55,980
with different paces of working, with different cultures,

888
00:59:56,581 --> 00:59:58,262
with different backgrounds and so on.

889
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:03,085
So one of the initiatives we have in Denmark is called DadiU

890
01:00:03,945 --> 01:00:05,947
and it's a collaboration of 12 universities

891
01:00:06,027 --> 01:00:09,269
where students make games in teams of 16 people,

892
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:12,010
which is bigger than Supercell has, for example.

893
01:00:13,517 --> 01:00:20,806
With the idea that the teams are so big that they mostly have overhead and hardly any productive work gets done.

894
01:00:21,266 --> 01:00:26,632
Which is an awesome learning experience, but the games they make are, let's say, questionable.

895
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:34,305
I didn't understand why they are doing that for many, many years.

896
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:39,528
And nowadays I actually support that decision because I think it actually leads to the better

897
01:00:39,568 --> 01:00:40,288
learning outcome.

898
01:00:40,788 --> 01:00:48,813
So I try to stick to Megan's actually, and I try to actually support students not having

899
01:00:48,873 --> 01:00:53,415
an optimal product, but actually learning how to make the optimal product for the rest

900
01:00:53,455 --> 01:00:54,076
of their lives.

901
01:00:54,950 --> 01:01:01,131
or making at least a passable product under harsh circumstances, I think there is actually

902
01:01:01,171 --> 01:01:03,852
more learning in that, I think.

903
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:09,173
So I agree with you about the slider, and for me the slider is set different places

904
01:01:09,213 --> 01:01:15,335
and different classes, but even when things are more focused on the product, my goal is

905
01:01:15,575 --> 01:01:20,236
if, it's like, you know, teaching them, giving them a fish versus teaching them to fish,

906
01:01:20,516 --> 01:01:20,716
right?

907
01:01:20,816 --> 01:01:23,637
So if I just tell them the right answer, it's not helpful, that's not learning.

908
01:01:24,297 --> 01:01:24,397
So...

909
01:01:25,091 --> 01:01:27,113
What I will typically do is I will say to them,

910
01:01:27,914 --> 01:01:29,336
you are struggling with this problem.

911
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:34,163
I will now show you three ways, speaking as an expert,

912
01:01:34,183 --> 01:01:35,565
that you can address this problem.

913
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:37,147
These are three examples.

914
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:38,709
They are not the only three ways.

915
01:01:39,082 --> 01:01:43,146
But I want you to use these exemplars to figure out your own solution.

916
01:01:43,726 --> 01:01:50,212
And then I give them three directions, using all of my expertise, and I do three in order

917
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:53,595
to reduce something called sort of functional fixedness, where they'll like, if they just

918
01:01:53,615 --> 01:01:56,597
hear one idea, they'll sort of go, oh, well, I should do that, and it's going to be hard

919
01:01:56,617 --> 01:01:57,538
for them to get away from it.

920
01:01:58,018 --> 01:02:03,003
But when it's more than one idea, they can actually compare and contrast, and that helps

921
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:04,764
them generate new ideas of their own.

922
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:11,850
So that's when I'm more focused on outcome or product, that's how I still sort of thread

923
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:18,075
the needle of if I tell them how to do it and then they make it, that's like, and then

924
01:02:18,115 --> 01:02:21,238
I put my stamp on it saying these students can do this themselves.

925
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:22,459
I don't know that that's true.

926
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:28,324
And so I need to make sure that whatever the product is, I can actually be confident that

927
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,465
those students could do it again.

928
01:02:29,485 --> 01:02:34,309
And that one of those techniques is to say, here are these three options.

929
01:02:34,712 --> 01:02:37,493
Reduce the power distance so that they feel free to choose something else.

930
01:02:38,033 --> 01:02:40,575
And then if they succeed, they succeed, and if they fail, they fail.

931
01:02:41,255 --> 01:02:43,036
I'm sometimes even more nasty.

932
01:02:43,076 --> 01:02:46,878
I actually tell them one solution, and then I tell them they're not allowed to use that

933
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:47,059
one.

934
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:49,600
I'm stealing that.

935
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,140
That's great.

936
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:50,841
I love it.

937
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:52,482
All right.

938
01:02:52,722 --> 01:02:53,022
All right.

939
01:02:53,122 --> 01:02:54,723
So, listen, thank you very much.

940
01:02:54,783 --> 01:02:55,823
Again, our email addresses are up here.

941
01:02:55,843 --> 01:02:56,484
Thank you so much for coming.

942
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:56,844
Thank you.

943
01:02:56,884 --> 01:02:57,204
Thank you.

944
01:02:57,244 --> 01:02:57,444
Thank you.

945
01:02:57,464 --> 01:02:57,684
Thank you.

946
01:02:57,704 --> 01:02:57,885
Thank you.

947
01:02:57,905 --> 01:02:58,085
Thank you.
