1
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:14,366
Hi everyone, thank you so much for coming now I know it is late in the day, the jet

2
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:21,571
lag is hitting me hard, so I'm going to try to stay awake for the next hour, but seriously

3
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:26,175
thank you so much for coming at this time, I don't go to talks at 5 o'clock, that's ridiculous,

4
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:28,676
so you're all amazing people.

5
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,100
So, today's talk.

6
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:36,643
I did a talk yesterday,

7
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,364
I don't know how many of you were at that one,

8
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:40,366
but my talk yesterday,

9
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:43,268
I talked about how badly games are selling on Steam.

10
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:50,422
It's obviously a problem, it's been a problem for a long time,

11
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:53,667
but right now it's especially a problem,

12
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:56,110
and it's a problem that many more people

13
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,895
than ever before are trying to solve themselves.

14
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:10,166
One of the numbers in my talk yesterday was that I worked out that roughly, just less than 10% of people who are actually releasing games on Steam

15
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:21,192
essentially are actually making enough money from even just the first month of sales to even continue comfortably on making games.

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,368
I mean obviously that doesn't count people who are just kind of doing it as a hobby aside a full job etc.

17
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:32,892
But if we're talking about actually being in the business of making games,

18
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:38,018
the vast majority of people aren't able to sustain themselves.

19
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:42,827
But there are ways to get into that top 7.

20
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:50,451
A part of the talk I gave yesterday was me essentially saying that, yeah, games aren't

21
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:55,414
selling so great on Steam, but when people are doing the legwork and they're making a

22
00:01:55,454 --> 00:02:00,777
good game, there are still plenty of people out there who are happy to buy games on Steam.

23
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:04,639
You just need to be putting the right things in place.

24
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:07,061
And I guess by being here at this talk.

25
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:12,938
you are probably one of those people who would like to be one of those top 7%.

26
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:14,399
Good for you!

27
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:15,300
Um...

28
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:17,722
So, I'm Mike.

29
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:19,463
Uh...

30
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:20,644
I have been, um...

31
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,546
working in video games for a long time.

32
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:26,008
I used to write about video games.

33
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:29,490
I actually went to uni doing computer science to make video games,

34
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,832
and it turned out I was really, really bad at it

35
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:33,493
because I just found it boring.

36
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:40,176
So then I decided I'm just going to berate other people who make them and became like a critic.

37
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:45,378
And as part of what I did when I was writing our games, I did a lot.

38
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,779
I started writing for places like Gamasutra.

39
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:54,342
I started to do a lot of talking to developers, working out why their games sold.

40
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:59,644
Then I started to dig into numbers and I found all of this stuff fascinating for some weird reason,

41
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:00,824
because I'm a lunatic.

42
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:07,790
And then that sort of led me on to getting hired by the publisher TinyBuild.

43
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:11,495
We did a bunch of stuff there and had some pretty decent success,

44
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:14,960
which kind of backed up my egotistical theories.

45
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:17,924
And then last year I thought,

46
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:19,806
I can do this myself, it's easy.

47
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,089
Decided to start my own publishing label, No More Robots,

48
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:26,751
and I've gone gray since then.

49
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:34,016
So it's been going okay as No More Robots.

50
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:38,559
I've been using maths, I guess you guys call it math.

51
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,901
to work out how to make games sell.

52
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:47,765
And I released our first game last month

53
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:50,527
called Descenders, a downhill mountain biking game

54
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:54,789
from the beautiful people at Rage Squid, a Dutch studio.

55
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,893
And next week I'm announcing game number two,

56
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,435
which is causing me even more stress, hooray!

57
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:13,521
So here's just some rough idea of why you should remotely care about any of the words I have to say.

58
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:25,844
So Descendants came out on February 9th and since then the game has essentially made more money in its first month than Rage Squid's previous game made in its lifetime.

59
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:38,571
which is fantastic for me because I love the people I work with, I especially love Rage Squid and I wanted to secure their futures

60
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:43,653
and just in the first month of the game we have definitely done that which is absolutely lovely.

61
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:50,517
And a lot of other people have been very interested in the game as well, we've been working with Xbox on special...

62
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:56,624
Behind the scenes things we've been talking to oculus about a vr version because everybody asks for a vr version

63
00:04:56,644 --> 00:05:03,474
Um, I don't think they realize how much they're going to throw up when they actually try to uh to ride a bike in vr

64
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:08,100
Um, we've got this massive discord server around the game who are

65
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,182
feverish about every single little thing we do.

66
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:15,266
And it seems like we're gonna make some decent revenue

67
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:17,868
by the end of the year for the game

68
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,049
across those two platforms.

69
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,050
I mean, the plan then is to bring it to PS4

70
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,432
and Switch and all kinds of things.

71
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:26,154
So it's gone all right,

72
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:29,577
which is like a massive sigh of relief for me.

73
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:31,859
Can you imagine if I just started my own publishing label

74
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,700
and bottled it on the first game?

75
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,541
That would have been really awkward.

76
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:36,342
So,

77
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,438
So, when I was putting this talk together,

78
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:42,258
whenever I put talks together like this,

79
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:47,439
I always try to envision things that you guys

80
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:48,739
are going to want to know.

81
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,200
And I know that a lot of the time,

82
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,100
people want to know about the basics.

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,981
And I've done loads of talks about the basics.

84
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,501
You know, things like is listed here,

85
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,102
just writing press releases.

86
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:02,162
How do I get YouTubers to care about my game?

87
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:05,043
How do I get the press to cover it?

88
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,523
Does press coverage do anything?

89
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:07,843
What can I do with my Steam page?

90
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,525
I decided when putting this talk together that I'm not going to talk about those things

91
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,247
because they've been done to death.

92
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,108
Again, like I say, by me.

93
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:23,372
If you just go on the GDC Vault, which you have access to with your badges, and enter

94
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:26,053
my name, you'll see too many talks from me on these things.

95
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:32,978
So if you want to know about those things, please, a lot of that stuff is still super

96
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:33,378
relevant.

97
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:34,439
You can go look that stuff up.

98
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:37,261
What I really decided I wanted to do was...

99
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:43,510
talk through when I was setting up No More Robots and when I was trying to decide how to make

100
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,156
Descenders sell, the things that were important that I think ended up being massively important

101
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:54,700
to what I did, whether I was purposely doing them at the time or not.

102
00:06:55,931 --> 00:07:00,712
because I think that everything I'm about to talk about is...

103
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:04,053
some of it will be... some of it will end up being a little bit vague,

104
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:08,154
some of it will be, you know, sort of may or may not apply to you,

105
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:12,596
but I think a lot of it is just stuff that when we talk about marketing,

106
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:14,756
we don't really talk about a lot of these things.

107
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:20,918
So anyway, the main... so the main six points I'm going to talk about...

108
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:31,311
The one thing that rides through all of these things is that I absolutely hate it when I see people saying that it's all about luck.

109
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:35,956
And I've seen people say, you just need a bit of magic and all this kind of stuff.

110
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:42,682
When we were going to announce and release Descenders, I knew it was going to sell.

111
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:46,845
That might sound egotistical, it might sound like I'm just bigging myself up.

112
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:52,769
it's because we had done all of the right things and we knew how to position

113
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:58,232
it and we knew what to do with the marketing for the game that at least X

114
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:02,814
number of people were going to buy it. I mean eventually more people bought it

115
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:07,277
than we had hoped for so that was that was nice and you could and of course I'm

116
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:11,879
not gonna say there's zero luck involved of course there's a sprinkle of luck as

117
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,902
well you know some games will absolutely explode while other similar games won't

118
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:17,082
do

119
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:22,066
There's always luck involved in everything, but to say that it's all luck and to say,

120
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:26,050
oh, you know, some of these biggest games, they just, they got lucky and this game just

121
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,593
was unfortunate, I don't believe in that at all.

122
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:35,939
And I think that a lot of it is just negating the need for luck, really.

123
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:41,094
So yeah, these six points here, I'm literally just going to go through these things one by one

124
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:47,980
and explain exactly what I mean by them and why I think they are super important, especially now.

125
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:53,805
So number one, working out what is exciting about your game. So here's the thing,

126
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:57,869
you think that you know what is exciting about your game, but you are wrong.

127
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,272
And that might sound flippant, but I will honestly bet that at least three quarters

128
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:08,713
of the people in this room who think they know what is exciting about their game are

129
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:10,113
wrong about what is exciting.

130
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:14,915
And if I talked to them about their game, I'd say a thing and they'd say, oh, I hadn't

131
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:16,916
really thought about that as being the exciting thing.

132
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:22,798
What a lot of people do, and what I sometimes do as well, and have to talk myself out of doing is

133
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:28,740
you decide on a thing that is exciting about your game, a feature maybe that's exciting about your game

134
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,362
and it is, okay? It is an exciting thing about your game that you think

135
00:09:33,842 --> 00:09:38,624
but it's not forward-facing exciting, it's not like public exciting

136
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:45,186
it's exciting maybe in a technical standpoint, or it's exciting as an additional thing

137
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:52,375
But what you actually need is you need the thing that's exciting and it makes people

138
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,778
actually then want to give a crap about your game.

139
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:02,863
I always need to have stupid terms for everything, so what I like to call this in my head is

140
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,385
the hook and the kicker.

141
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:09,448
The thing that you are thinking in your head is exciting about your game and maybe the

142
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:11,870
way you've been selling it is probably the kicker.

143
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:17,663
The problem with the kicker is that no one will check that out unless you've hooked them first.

144
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:22,167
You need the hook first to actually reel them in.

145
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:24,108
That's a stupid metaphor, isn't it?

146
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:29,313
You need to actually get them and then you hit them with the other thing that sort of seals the deal.

147
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,814
Uh, example.

148
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,996
With Descenders, when we were first talking about how to sell the game,

149
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:38,057
we were constantly talking about the procedural stuff in the game.

150
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:43,219
So the whole point in the game is that every single level you ever play in Descenders

151
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,440
is procedurally generated from a string, like a seed of numbers.

152
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:50,561
And there's hundreds of millions of levels in this game, right?

153
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:56,764
And the technical stuff that has gone into making that is honestly incredible.

154
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:58,104
And the guys at Rage Squid are...

155
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:03,150
just geniuses, but here's the thing,

156
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:09,073
if I describe this to you, I don't think that on the spot,

157
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,533
I would hook you with that.

158
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:13,434
I think you'd be like, oh, that sounds pretty impressive,

159
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:16,855
that sounds kind of cool, but from talking

160
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:19,536
and telling people about this, it was obvious to me

161
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:24,258
that it was cool, but it wasn't actually making them

162
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:26,539
remember the game or want to check more stuff out

163
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,179
about the game.

164
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:30,884
It turned out that when I just straight up told people

165
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:35,307
it's a downhill mountain biking game, as stupid as that sounds, I'm literally just

166
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:40,250
describing what the game is, that was actually way more interesting

167
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,572
to people because they don't know other downhill mountain

168
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:47,875
biking games, there aren't any. And then if I followed that up with, oh

169
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:48,936
and hey it's got procedural...

170
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,416
generated worlds, they'd go,

171
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:52,976
how does that work?

172
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:55,718
How could a bike game have procedural worlds?

173
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:57,378
And then I'd have the conversation.

174
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,540
Or then maybe they'd go and check out some more

175
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,621
information. Without

176
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:02,981
those two things together,

177
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,743
they

178
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:07,523
complement each other, right? If I just told you

179
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,284
it's a downhill mountain biking game, you might be like,

180
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,825
oh, cool. If I just tell you it's procedural generation,

181
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:13,686
lots of games are doing

182
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:15,187
that. The two things together...

183
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:21,242
work such that you actually come out of the conversation maybe wanting to see some more.

184
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:26,577
This is what you need to be trying to find, basically.

185
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:27,418
You need to...

186
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,538
That line you keep saying to everyone, right?

187
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:31,719
That line that every single time someone asks you,

188
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,359
what are you making and what's that game about?

189
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,680
Think about that line that you say to people.

190
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,301
Is it actually interesting?

191
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:39,642
Like, is it an actual interesting line

192
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:42,462
where if someone said that to you in a bar tonight

193
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:45,043
where you're obviously going to go and do that tonight,

194
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:46,984
when someone does that, are they going to go...

195
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:53,325
me and want a card and then or are they gonna be like okay cool do you know if

196
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:58,548
there's anywhere else that has a free bar so this is this is honestly the

197
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:03,350
thing this is and with every game I'm working with I'm tirelessly just trying

198
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:08,033
to work out what is that exciting line that has these two elements in it where

199
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:12,595
I go it's this cool thing and by the way it's this as well and make them want to

200
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:17,738
read more it's it's it's just one of those things where it's

201
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:21,361
I honestly feel like this is such a simple point and yet

202
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:23,443
we just all still get it wrong, right?

203
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:24,524
I still get it wrong.

204
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,025
Even when I was first doing descenders,

205
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:27,106
I was getting this wrong.

206
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:31,990
It's so easy to not get this line in place

207
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,591
in the first place.

208
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:38,687
you need this. And the thing with this as well is that it can actually then end up just helping you

209
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:42,808
through all of the decisions you make, not just on the marketing side, but on the design side as well,

210
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:48,949
right? It can really help to kind of hone in on, all right, well, what is the game? It's this thing.

211
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:52,710
So these features are the most important thing that we need to be talking about.

212
00:13:54,731 --> 00:14:01,593
So yeah, have a real think about this. So once you've got that,

213
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:06,923
Let's say you're at the point where you really want to get people interested in your game.

214
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:11,825
The main problem I think that a lot of people have at this point is,

215
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:18,148
you'll put out a trailer, or you'll put out a website, or anything like that, a press release,

216
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:23,970
and it might do amazingly. I've seen people put out trailers that have got quarter of a million views.

217
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,391
Absolutely fantastic.

218
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,905
The problem a lot of the time is that then people,

219
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:33,128
this quarter of a million people watch the trailer

220
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:34,750
and then they go.

221
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:36,138
I was pretty cool.

222
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,620
And then they just go somewhere else on the internet

223
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,222
and your game is forgotten five minutes later.

224
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:44,084
And especially if you're announcing your game

225
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:46,685
and six months later you're launching,

226
00:14:47,406 --> 00:14:49,527
six months later they're not remembering your trailer.

227
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:51,749
They've seen a million other trailers on YouTube.

228
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:54,410
They've seen trailers as ads on YouTube.

229
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:57,813
They're not gonna remember your trailer from six months ago.

230
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:07,019
So what are you doing to make sure that when they watch that trailer they've actually then got somewhere to go and something...

231
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,104
It's going to be a small number of people, right? Those quarter of a million people aren't going to want to connect with your game.

232
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:22,991
But even if just 1% of those people want to connect with your game, that's a massive number of people who, if you could get them and contain them somewhere...

233
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:26,325
uh... then uh... that would be pretty nice

234
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,688
uh... the answer that i have found

235
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,893
uh... is is as simple as discord

236
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:34,336
uh... i started experimenting with discord

237
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,427
two years ago.

238
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:40,471
Anybody who knows me knows that I always try to

239
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:43,394
stay on top of the things that I think are gonna

240
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:44,535
kind of be the next big thing.

241
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:46,978
And Discord at that point was already massive,

242
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,702
but it was massive mainly for players.

243
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:53,204
There was some developers on there,

244
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:55,487
but it was a great place for,

245
00:15:57,008 --> 00:16:00,249
I mean, just like IRC and not a crap,

246
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,230
it was not a crap Skype basically.

247
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,631
But the thing with Discord is that

248
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:10,152
they have a lot of users, I don't know if you know this.

249
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:12,493
They've got like over 100 million

250
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,694
registered people on Discord now.

251
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,775
And that is a lot of people.

252
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:21,158
And so I decided, after I'd done a bit of experimenting,

253
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,501
I was trying to, when I, at the company I was at before,

254
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:28,063
we were trying to sort of collect people together

255
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:31,145
who were excited about our games into a Discord.

256
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:32,746
And it was fine.

257
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:35,608
We got a few hundred people in it, maybe.

258
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:45,639
But the problem I realized very quickly is that if you don't give people an incentive to join some kind of community like that,

259
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
then they don't.

260
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:56,223
And it's funny actually, I feel like a lot of the time there's so many talks and panels and everything on

261
00:16:57,103 --> 00:17:00,504
how do you look after a community, how do you maintain a community?

262
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:04,605
No one ever does a talk or a panel on how do you start a community?

263
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:06,766
How do I get the people in the first place?

264
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:14,219
And that is the big question and it turns out the answer is give them free stuff

265
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,424
Magic I know so so I decided I would try and do this

266
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:25,908
I would try and give them a bunch of actual reasons to join a discord so when we announced ascenders last year

267
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:32,569
I said, look, if you want to be part of the closed beta for Descenders, you have to join the Discord.

268
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:38,351
I had no idea at that point how I was actually going to get them in the beta, I just wanted them in a Discord.

269
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:48,513
So I did that. What I also did was that I decided that wasn't enough and I needed to build some kind of meta game.

270
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:52,774
I should say, by the way, I've just realized I keep talking about Discord as if you all know what it is.

271
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:55,395
Just in case there's people in the room who aren't aware.

272
00:17:56,435 --> 00:18:03,477
Discord is essentially like another one of those chat programs, right, where

273
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:07,698
people can join servers and they can make channels and they can do voice chat

274
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:13,420
and they can do text chat. It's not that Discord did anything crazy different to

275
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,741
all the others, it's just that they did it in very clever ways and they got a

276
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:22,523
bit lucky as well and they've got lovely people working there as well which

277
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:23,083
always helps.

278
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:27,149
Um, so, uh, okay, we're up to speed on what Discord is now.

279
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:34,602
So, what I decided to try and do was create a game in the Descendants Discord that people

280
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:36,485
would then want to play before...

281
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,151
Descenders came out.

282
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:40,393
So that's what I did.

283
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,736
I made it so that when someone joined the

284
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,698
Descenders Discord, they couldn't see any

285
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,600
channels, except this one channel called

286
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,602
Pick a Side. And in the game, there's

287
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,764
three teams. And I made it so

288
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:52,646
that before they could access

289
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,708
anything in the Discord, they had to pick one of

290
00:18:54,728 --> 00:18:55,989
these three teams out of the game.

291
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,092
and it gave them all the information about these three teams but it told them once you've done it

292
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:06,315
you can't change again and they pick a side and then it would open up the rest of the discord and

293
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:11,977
give them special channels as well and it would also change the color of their name to the color

294
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:16,900
of that team in the game and put them in this like tribe mentality and then we started pitting them

295
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,122
off against each other each week doing community challenges who can do the best fan art who can

296
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:24,363
come up with the best this the best that

297
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,111
And this stuff made people stick around,

298
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:33,394
because even though they had no idea how the game played yet,

299
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:34,975
and they would have for another six months,

300
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:38,897
they desperately wanted to win every week.

301
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,018
And they wanted to.

302
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:44,341
We made it so that they'd get special emotes,

303
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,342
or emojis, I don't know what you call them.

304
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:49,504
You'd get special ones of those each week,

305
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:50,725
depending on which team won.

306
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:56,530
And all of this, I mean it took some work, I'll admit.

307
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:02,033
It was a lot of, and I learned a lot about community management very quickly

308
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:07,256
because about 5,000 people ended up joining in a very short space of time.

309
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:13,260
But here's the thing, when we got to the launch of the game...

310
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:20,128
Those were thousands of people who were super into not just the game, but us as well.

311
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:22,170
Because they had this direct line to us.

312
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,835
And by this point, there was all sorts of memes that they'd made around us, the developers, myself,

313
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:31,478
because they felt like they had this super close connection to us.

314
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:36,982
In fact, when we launched the game, we launched it 20 minutes early and only told the Discord server.

315
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,165
and then I realized the launch discount hadn't been applied.

316
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:42,508
It wasn't going to be applied for another 20 minutes.

317
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:43,609
So I said in Discord,

318
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:46,412
Oh, just wait 20 minutes, the launch discount will happen.

319
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,634
And we sold like a thousand copies of the game

320
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:49,975
just in the first 20 minutes

321
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:52,718
because Discord people were so adamant

322
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,200
they needed the game right now

323
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,502
that they didn't care about the 10% discount.

324
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:58,444
When you have...

325
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:04,537
a community base like that, that is already prepped and ready when the game is going to come out,

326
00:21:05,158 --> 00:21:10,000
that is a useful tool to have. And the cool thing is as well, they're still there now,

327
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,341
and they're causing the long tail of the game.

328
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:18,405
to go on even longer. I've launched many games that I've never seen.

329
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:20,527
Normally it's like, up here for the launch and then...

330
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:27,012
This game has been like this. It's continuing to sell because these people are bringing their friends in.

331
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:32,456
It's honestly been one of the craziest things I have...

332
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:37,860
Out of everything I've put together for making a game, it's one of the things that has worked.

333
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,185
the most well. Apart from having a great day on sales,

334
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:51,198
we've had a lot of situations as well which I hadn't sort of envisioned were going to occur.

335
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:55,279
So for example, all of these people just desperately wanted to give us positive Steam

336
00:21:55,339 --> 00:22:02,621
reviews immediately as well. So within like a day we had like a 94% positive rating on Steam

337
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:06,743
because they'd all plowed it with positive Steam reviews. Whenever someone would leave

338
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:11,284
a negative Steam review, people from the community would comment on it trying to help them.

339
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:15,206
and then end up flipping negative Steam reviews into positive ones.

340
00:22:15,726 --> 00:22:19,408
And I didn't have to do anything to make that happen. These people just did it themselves.

341
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:25,231
And a lot of people, if people had problems, they had bug reports and all this kind of stuff,

342
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:28,492
they came in the Discord. We've got a channel called Bug Reporting that could go in there.

343
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:33,135
All the bug reports are right there. They're not clogging up the Steam forums where it just,

344
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:38,237
you know, obviously normally Steam forums just look like, you know, hell basically.

345
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,523
So it kind of helped clean up that place as well.

346
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:44,526
I don't work for Discord, honestly.

347
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:45,607
I know it looks like I do.

348
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:50,932
I'm just, I honestly, it's honestly one of the most,

349
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:53,394
the most brilliant things that has happened

350
00:22:54,735 --> 00:22:57,477
for people selling games, I think, now that there is now

351
00:22:57,517 --> 00:22:59,019
this centralized place where you can

352
00:22:59,059 --> 00:22:59,940
collect people together.

353
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,021
But like I say, you just gotta make sure

354
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,063
that you actually give them a reason to do that.

355
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:09,751
Now what I want to talk about here was streaming.

356
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:13,214
So I've done many talks about streaming in the past,

357
00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:15,175
and streaming is obviously still an important thing.

358
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:16,996
It's more important than ever maybe.

359
00:23:18,537 --> 00:23:20,799
So here's the thing about streaming.

360
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:23,821
It used to be, you know, like a couple years ago,

361
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:26,683
a few years ago, you'd try and get big streamers

362
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:27,664
to play your game, right?

363
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:30,125
And then someone big will play your game

364
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:31,246
and you get a nice spike.

365
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:32,127
YouTubers as well,

366
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:33,988
we'll talk about YouTubers with this as well.

367
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:40,207
What you need to know now is that that doesn't happen anymore for Descenders.

368
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:44,649
Not even for last year it hasn't been happening and anybody who's launched a game in the last year

369
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:49,011
and maybe has had a big YouTuber or streamer will know that there's just no spike at all anymore.

370
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:56,153
You know, we've had pretty much every single massive streamer play Descenders in the last month.

371
00:23:56,963 --> 00:24:03,087
and we'll have an okay day that day, you know, it might be elevated slightly but there's no spikes

372
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:09,951
at all. People watch streamers and youtubers for the streamers and youtubers now, they don't watch,

373
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:12,913
they don't make purchasing decisions based off

374
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:19,035
I mean it might be that they watch multiple YouTubers or streamers, see your game multiple

375
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:23,856
times and then when it's on a 25% sale go, oh I remember Lyric playing that, maybe I'll

376
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:24,497
pick that up now.

377
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:30,679
That's possible, but you don't get the immediate, Lyric is playing this game, I need to own

378
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:31,859
this game thing anymore.

379
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,779
That doesn't happen.

380
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,101
So if you are trying to base a marketing around that, do not.

381
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,082
I used to suggest that people do...

382
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:49,107
You know sort of do twitch integration and you know chat integration and special like twitch games and all that kind of stuff

383
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:54,371
If you are going to do that stuff don't spend a long time on it. I would honestly suggest

384
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,873
Because I don't think you're going to see much in return

385
00:24:58,673 --> 00:24:59,394
Do it as like a?

386
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:07,139
cool little side thing maybe, but yeah, I honestly don't think it's worth putting the effort anymore.

387
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,684
Now, the reason why I've listed Mixer here, and I'll explain what Mixer is because I'm

388
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:17,807
discovering this week that not as many people have heard of Mixer. So Mixer is

389
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:22,210
another streaming platform, I think it used to be called Beam.

390
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:26,333
and it's owned by Microsoft.

391
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:31,497
And Mixer, Mixer's definitely smaller than Twitch,

392
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:38,622
but Mixer is interesting because it is essentially

393
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:39,543
Twitch.

394
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,800
three or four years ago.

395
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,022
It's kind of, it's growing rapidly

396
00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:47,344
and it's having a lot of resources put into it.

397
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:49,146
And because of that,

398
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:53,930
it's very difficult to get any traction on Twitch anymore

399
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,492
because Twitch is very focused on streamers, right?

400
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:59,234
And now the front page is always these massive streamers

401
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:00,956
and starting off as a new person,

402
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,138
it can be very difficult to get some traction on Twitch.

403
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:06,242
Mixer, it's a lot easier to do that now.

404
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:08,963
And it's especially a lot easier for developers

405
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:13,264
because even though, as far as I can tell,

406
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:15,785
Microsoft aren't screaming so much about this,

407
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,525
they, on the Mixer platform,

408
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:21,426
they're very much supporting developers a lot.

409
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:25,107
I started talking to the team there

410
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:28,968
and they said, I had no idea they were doing this,

411
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:31,868
they said to me, oh yeah, we can give you a developer account on Mixer.

412
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,960
And I was like, okay, yeah, sure you do that.

413
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,842
And I got a little verified tick on there.

414
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,343
And then the next time I streamed,

415
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,804
I went front page on Mixer.

416
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:46,868
And they just feature developers on the front page of Mixer just by you being a developer

417
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:51,630
and you streaming on Mixer because that to them is like you supporting their platform

418
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,790
over the other bigger ones.

419
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:59,873
And I mean in the last, I've been streaming Descenders every single day for the last month

420
00:26:59,913 --> 00:27:05,355
and I've had like over 200, nearly a quarter of a million people watch these streams, which

421
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,817
is bigger numbers than I was even getting on Twitch.

422
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,977
And especially if you've got a game coming out on Xbox as well, it's amazing because

423
00:27:14,977 --> 00:27:18,038
the streams, the front page streams appear on the Xbox dashboard as well.

424
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:23,600
So when I'm on a stream and I say, hey is anyone from Xbox watching, the chat goes crazy.

425
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,302
And we're aiming to have Descenders out in roughly about May.

426
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:30,963
So this has been a massive thing for me.

427
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:40,307
I've got all of these eyeballs from Xbox players where normally it can be quite difficult to specifically get people who play on Xbox, right?

428
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,728
You just hope they read some press or they look at a forum.

429
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:49,370
Now I have a direct line to people who are playing on Xbox and they're watching my game on Xbox.

430
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:52,385
and they're saying, oh this seems really cool, I'll buy it.

431
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:53,946
And I'm saying, yeah, please do.

432
00:27:55,747 --> 00:28:01,128
So if you're releasing a game on Xbox, 100% get on this.

433
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:05,070
If you're not, I would still heavily suggest

434
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,611
that you get in touch with Mixer.

435
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:12,192
They have been, honestly, nothing but amazing, really.

436
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:14,213
All right.

437
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:20,529
So, this one, this one I find massively important, but I'm going to have to explain it very well.

438
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:29,235
I think that the, I think a good number of people don't do a very good job of the way

439
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:34,119
that they actually give off a vibe about their game.

440
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,184
And what I mean about that is that the way that your game is shown in public and the

441
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:43,485
way that people perceive it.

442
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,092
will eventually determine how much value they think...

443
00:28:48,132 --> 00:28:51,414
I know this sounds horrible, I know this is the kind of words you don't want to hear, right?

444
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:52,715
But you've got to think about these things.

445
00:28:53,196 --> 00:28:56,478
Is the way people perceive the actual value of your game,

446
00:28:56,758 --> 00:28:59,040
and when it launches, whether they think,

447
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,223
am I going to buy it in a sale or could I not be bothered?

448
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:03,944
Because we hear this all the time right now,

449
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:06,766
that people don't buy games at launch, they just wait for sales.

450
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:12,335
I think a lot of that has to do with this image you do for your game.

451
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:16,479
So, for example, and I'm going to show you this chart now, right?

452
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,263
This chart here is a thing that is in my head that I'm going to have to explain.

453
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,665
And I have had this in my head for like a year now.

454
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:27,528
And it might make no sense, but it makes perfect sense in my brain.

455
00:29:27,568 --> 00:29:28,829
So I'm going to try to explain it to you.

456
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,551
I think that there are...

457
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:36,133
three different categories of the perception that people have of games in their head.

458
00:29:36,613 --> 00:29:40,695
People, when they look at games, they immediately, just from about a trailer,

459
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:44,117
they watch a trailer and they immediately in their head put it into one of these three things.

460
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:50,480
They either decide that's an indie game or they decide, oh that's, I call it AA, but you know,

461
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:56,382
lots of people have, it's the mid-tier essentially, right? And then they've got, oh that's a AAA game.

462
00:29:57,427 --> 00:30:04,693
And I think it's really important to know not just which one you fall into,

463
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:08,976
but then also to know what that means for your game.

464
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:18,385
I talk to a lot of developers who are either pricing their game wrong or they have what

465
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:24,889
I believe is like a double A game but they're treating it like it's an indie game.

466
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,992
When I was first talking to the RageSquid guys about Descenders, they were showing it

467
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:34,836
to me and they were saying, they were saying, oh we think we can probably charge about $15

468
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,156
for it.

469
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:41,058
and we'll try and get on some of the indie sites

470
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:41,898
and all this kind of stuff.

471
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:46,639
And I thought they were mad

472
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,500
because the thing that I was looking at,

473
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,341
I was looking at this and saying to them,

474
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:53,481
what are you talking about?

475
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:58,203
This is not a perceived indie game that you have here.

476
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:02,784
This is what people would perceive as a AA game.

477
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:04,805
This is the kind of game

478
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:06,365
where people would see a trailer for this

479
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:07,951
and they would think,

480
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:10,471
oh, I'd pay a bit of money for this.

481
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:13,893
And I remember when we launched the original trailer

482
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,873
for the game, there was YouTube comments saying,

483
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:18,254
I'd only pay $40 for this.

484
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:22,035
It's that kind of thing, and they couldn't believe it.

485
00:31:23,176 --> 00:31:26,377
I mean, eventually we've ended up charging $25 for it,

486
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:30,458
and we have had no, like we've had barely any people

487
00:31:30,518 --> 00:31:32,019
saying this game is too expensive.

488
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,960
It's really important to know where you are on this.

489
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,102
If... a lot of the time you'll just know, right?

490
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:45,726
A lot of the time you know with your game whether it is going to be classed as indie in people's eyes.

491
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:48,047
And that's absolutely fine.

492
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:54,190
The next game I'm announcing next week I believe is going to be perceived as indie.

493
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:55,411
But then...

494
00:31:56,908 --> 00:32:00,409
It's when people are in between this indie and AAA one,

495
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:01,869
they're at the top of the indie one,

496
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:04,810
and they could actually move on to the next one

497
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,530
and have this whole new audience.

498
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,831
It's that where you really need to think

499
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:11,391
where exactly you are on these,

500
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,032
because it can make a massive difference for you.

501
00:32:14,072 --> 00:32:15,572
It can make an absolute massive difference.

502
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,693
I think being perceived as a AA game

503
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,714
has helped us in lots of ways with Descenders.

504
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:27,115
and it has directed the way that I sell the game.

505
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:32,157
The next game I'm announcing, which is more of an indie title,

506
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,698
I'm definitely going to be selling it in very different ways

507
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:38,459
the way I've been selling Descenders because of this perception, I think.

508
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,720
So yeah, it might not seem that important to you,

509
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,461
but please have a think about where you fall on this.

510
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:54,316
So I said earlier that I do not like relying on luck.

511
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:58,480
I think that anybody who tells you

512
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,902
everything is luck-based is wrong,

513
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:03,865
and you need to put everything in place

514
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:06,347
to make sure that when your game comes out,

515
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:09,931
you're not just sitting there and hoping.

516
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:14,447
and praying this is going to sell, which I think is what the vast majority of people...

517
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:19,669
I'm sure there's plenty of people in this room who have released games on Steam and have sat

518
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:25,712
on launch day and said like, oh people think it's cool! It's the wrong thing to do. You

519
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:29,313
used to be able to get away with that. You can't anymore. You absolutely can't anymore.

520
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:36,957
So the Discord stuff I was talking about was a perfect example of making sure that you are reducing the risk.

521
00:33:37,578 --> 00:33:42,980
We knew when Descenders launched, we could see the numbers, we could see how many people were active in our Discord.

522
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:51,304
We could see, we could see exactly, well not exactly, but roughly how many people were at least going to buy it in week one.

523
00:33:53,025 --> 00:33:56,328
Things like Steam wishlists.

524
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:59,290
It's kind of a common fact now

525
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,373
that you normally in your first month

526
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:05,195
sell your wishlist kind of convert

527
00:34:05,675 --> 00:34:09,158
somewhere around between 7% and 12%

528
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:10,960
somewhere around that.

529
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,422
So if you are building Steam wishlists

530
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:15,944
and you get to 30,000 wishlists

531
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:26,052
then you know that in the first month you are most likely, unless your game for some reason doesn't match this model at all,

532
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:30,456
which, you know, I guess it can depend on the quality of the game,

533
00:34:30,556 --> 00:34:36,320
but you would hope to at least be converting those into about 3,000 people.

534
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:38,282
It's this kind of thing where it's...

535
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,027
It's horrible, but it's all a numbers game.

536
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:46,748
If you have the numbers when the launch day comes,

537
00:34:47,048 --> 00:34:49,209
and you know that at least X number of these people

538
00:34:49,229 --> 00:34:50,669
are going to buy it, you can then

539
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,310
use that to flow into more people.

540
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,591
If you're completely just relying on,

541
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,592
oh, I hope people see the game on launch day,

542
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:01,853
it's really bad news.

543
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:05,834
The other thing you can do is try

544
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:06,954
to get as many.

545
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:15,607
people involved who are influential and try to get them to put skin in the game.

546
00:35:16,388 --> 00:35:22,490
What I mean by that is that you have to do that horrible thing that no one likes doing

547
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:28,873
where you just start really doing all of those horrible horrible cringy things.

548
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:33,434
I'm pretty sure you know the kind of things that I'm talking about.

549
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:42,338
The things like, for example, just trying to talk to every single person possible.

550
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:52,922
It's funny, whenever I tell somebody, for example, that I have a tweet deck set up that has...

551
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:55,903
multiple columns where I'm tracking,

552
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:58,066
just looking for the word descenders,

553
00:35:58,126 --> 00:35:59,488
looking for the word rage squid,

554
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:00,850
looking for this, looking for that.

555
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,775
And whenever someone tweets, within like five minutes,

556
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:06,257
I'm tweeting back at them.

557
00:36:06,617 --> 00:36:08,720
I'm DMing them, I'm sending them this,

558
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,461
I'm sending them that.

559
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:14,267
People, some people react really badly to that and they say,

560
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:15,589
oh it's a bit much that isn't it?

561
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,231
It's a bit weird that you're doing that.

562
00:36:17,331 --> 00:36:19,974
It's like, it's a bit creepy in a way that you're just sort of,

563
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,537
you're kind of watching over anybody

564
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,979
who ever mentions your game.

565
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:26,963
Doing that sells games.

566
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:28,485
You should do it.

567
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:33,339
even if it makes you feel all weird inside and horrible,

568
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,621
if someone, I cannot tell you the number of times I've seen someone tweet about Descendus saying

569
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:42,402
oh this seems pretty cool, don't know if I'll pick it up though

570
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,782
and I've tweeted back at them just saying something like

571
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:50,103
oh thanks for saying that, that was really nice, it's cool that you considered it.

572
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:53,900
and then they've tweeted a screenshot back at me saying

573
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,662
oh it's really cool you tweeted at me i bought it now

574
00:36:57,102 --> 00:37:00,424
that singular tweet just just made us another 25 dollars

575
00:37:00,864 --> 00:37:04,347
and it it blows my mind how often that happens

576
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:08,109
especially with like streamers i see a streamer saying yo i've seen this

577
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:11,791
descenders games around and i'll immediately just dm them a

578
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:13,733
key i won't even ask i'll just

579
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:18,177
get in their DMs and I will send them a Steam key and then tweet at them saying

580
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:23,843
yo you've got a Steam key in your DMs now and they'll, they'll like, they'll all of a sudden

581
00:37:23,863 --> 00:37:27,586
in the next two minutes I'll see, I can just imagine them at home just like being like

582
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:32,631
what? They just follow me and then they say oh my god thank you so much and that evening

583
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:37,997
they're playing the game. It wasn't that much effort for me to do that.

584
00:37:39,515 --> 00:37:44,901
It helps that I enjoy doing that. I must stress, like, I'm a weirdo and I enjoy doing all of this stuff.

585
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:47,484
I appreciate there'll be lots of people in this room who are just like,

586
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:50,207
I do not have time for that, that sounds so boring.

587
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:59,098
But doing these awful things, I feel like there's a reason why we find them awful.

588
00:38:00,472 --> 00:38:02,775
and sometimes you just gotta grit your teeth.

589
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:07,961
Another one, just emailing people asking for stuff.

590
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:09,863
People hate doing that.

591
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:13,688
Every single deal or anything I have put in place for the senders,

592
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:19,395
I emailed multiple people asking for stuff until they got back to me.

593
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:25,119
Everything with Xbox, I emailed Xbox over and over and over again,

594
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,520
sending them this, sending them that, sending them builds of the game,

595
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:29,221
being like, well, can I meet you?

596
00:38:29,862 --> 00:38:33,964
And setting things up, showing them face to face that I meant business with this thing.

597
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:38,507
And then every single time I see even a minor opportunity, I'm jumping all over it.

598
00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:43,430
And, you know, a year later, now Xbox are like, okay, well,

599
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:48,093
it seems like maybe he's going to be able to make this sell.

600
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:52,395
on Xbox so maybe we should, you know, support him quite well.

601
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:57,958
And this has happened multiple times. We've done stuff with NVIDIA, all the stuff we've been doing

602
00:38:57,978 --> 00:39:05,122
with Discord, obviously I've been then trying to, after I've got into Discord, talk to those guys.

603
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:08,884
Again with Mixer, me just emailing them and saying like,

604
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:13,266
hey is there stuff I can do on Mixer? And then coming back and now just because I asked.

605
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:20,330
I'm getting hundreds of thousands of views on Mixer, and that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't just asked.

606
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,916
Asking is hard, I know, I know it can feel really hard to just...

607
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:28,759
Because a lot of the time it's like imposter syndrome, right?

608
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,483
You feel like, they're not going to care about my game, they don't care about who I am.

609
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:37,780
Don't go into it thinking that, because the thing you're making is super important.

610
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,825
And if you truly feel like it's this massively important thing to you,

611
00:39:43,905 --> 00:39:46,047
go and show other people it's important as well.

612
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:49,090
Go and talk to everybody and ask for things.

613
00:39:50,532 --> 00:39:53,615
The vast majority of the time when I just ask for free stuff.

614
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:58,561
People give me free stuff because I guess people find it hard to say no.

615
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:04,229
So really just honestly do it.

616
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:10,397
You'll be surprised at how far it can get you just emailing people and asking for stuff.

617
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:18,087
The final thing after all of this is to just be realistic.

618
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,930
So again, these are numbers from my talk yesterday.

619
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:24,554
The average game on Steam is making about $30,000

620
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:25,155
in its first year now.

621
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:34,965
So, what you need to be doing is, you need to be imagining, if my game makes $30,000

622
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:40,851
in the first year, which is entirely plausible, what am I going to do about it?

623
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:43,374
Or, what can I do right now?

624
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:47,097
To be able for this to be okay

625
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:48,118
essentially

626
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:57,046
So I mean this it's it's a tricky one right there's no easy answer to this. There's there's plenty of

627
00:40:58,147 --> 00:41:01,049
There's plenty of things you can you can consider

628
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:03,832
You don't want to

629
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:08,796
You know this there's certain things on this list that you don't just want to hobble into your game. You don't just want to

630
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:12,130
go, well, we'll probably run out of money here,

631
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,390
and if we're only gonna make that much money,

632
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,890
let's just do early access.

633
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:17,251
Early access obviously makes sense

634
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,912
for certain types of games and not all the ones.

635
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:26,953
Multiple platforms is a massive thing I keep telling people.

636
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:29,134
Like, a lot of people just don't think

637
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:32,395
that they're gonna be able to get access to Xbox dev kits.

638
00:41:33,677 --> 00:41:37,659
or they're not going to be able to find someone to help them port that kind of stuff.

639
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:40,820
Xbox give away free dev kits.

640
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,541
They literally will send you two free dev kits.

641
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:47,102
All you have to do is just sign up your game with them and they do that.

642
00:41:47,982 --> 00:41:50,943
Or at least they do in Europe.

643
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:53,864
I'm talking as if I know what happens in America,

644
00:41:53,904 --> 00:41:56,805
but if you're in Europe, that's what they do.

645
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:01,734
And there's plenty of people around as well

646
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:05,937
who are throwing funding into this.

647
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:08,539
There's loads of local things.

648
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,842
Again, I'm talking from UK perspective here, unfortunately.

649
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:14,604
But as far as I understand, there's lots over here as well.

650
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:17,346
All that said and done,

651
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:22,269
if $30,000 in the first year

652
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:26,453
isn't going to be enough to support yourself or a team,

653
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:31,612
then you absolutely should have that horrible conversation

654
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:38,177
of is this sustainable for us to be doing this full time?

655
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:44,381
And if it's not, then what do I do, essentially?

656
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:49,185
But it would be, it's just a very bad idea

657
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:50,986
to not consider all this stuff.

658
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:52,647
I know it's grim, and I know it's very,

659
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:55,389
like, ugh, just a horrible way to kind of,

660
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:58,716
get to the end of this thing, but you do need to think about this stuff.

661
00:42:59,637 --> 00:43:04,923
Otherwise, you could just get caught out in just horrible ways.

662
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:08,567
I've seen too many developers put everything into a release,

663
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:12,411
and then it's maybe not gone as well as they're hoping, and then they've realized...

664
00:43:13,063 --> 00:43:18,966
oh god I've got no plan and obviously you get massively depressed whether after a game

665
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:20,587
launch whether it's done well or not.

666
00:43:21,427 --> 00:43:26,170
So you don't particularly want a double whammy of badness.

667
00:43:29,452 --> 00:43:32,594
Right, I'm done, I promise. I know I've talked forever.

668
00:43:34,315 --> 00:43:41,639
This is, if you just want a too long didn't read or if you fell asleep a little bit and checked your phone a little bit during that, I don't blame you.

669
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,021
Here are the important points.

670
00:43:46,122 --> 00:43:52,626
I mean, the main ones, the main things I would honestly say that have worked amazingly for the Descendants launch,

671
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:56,628
the Discord stuff I was talking about, the Mixer stuff I was talking about.

672
00:43:57,129 --> 00:44:06,764
getting all the deals in place with Xbox, even just getting those guys to help us out has been amazing.

673
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:08,507
And then really...

674
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:16,172
just unfortunately just doing the leg work, just gritting your teeth and really doing the stuff.

675
00:44:17,272 --> 00:44:22,695
I appreciate there'll be lots of people in here as well who just don't have the time to do a lot

676
00:44:22,715 --> 00:44:28,679
of this stuff or just don't want to because it's boring. If you are one of those people,

677
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:33,161
that's fair enough. I would suggest then you find someone to do it for you.

678
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:39,447
Put it this way, right? If you work with a publisher or someone like that, yeah, they're going to take a cut of your game.

679
00:44:40,008 --> 00:44:44,432
But what is worse, right?

680
00:44:44,953 --> 00:44:49,537
100% of a small number or 70% of a large number.

681
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:56,184
You really need to weigh up whether or not you need someone involved in doing this stuff because it's so important.

682
00:44:56,324 --> 00:44:57,205
And if you don't do it...

683
00:44:58,001 --> 00:45:01,623
there is a high chance that unfortunately

684
00:45:02,864 --> 00:45:05,725
your game isn't going to do as well as you would have hoped.

685
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,967
I feel like I've ended on a really

686
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:14,129
down tone. I should have prepared a joke for this part, but

687
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,631
whatever, that's all you're getting. Alright, thank you.

688
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:27,546
God, I talked forever, didn't I?

689
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:30,110
I think I have like four minutes left

690
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:32,334
if anybody wants to ask a question.

691
00:45:32,374 --> 00:45:33,857
There's microphones here and here.

692
00:45:33,877 --> 00:45:35,599
I would love questions.

693
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,100
Hello.

694
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,821
Hello.

695
00:45:38,998 --> 00:45:40,639
So first of all, thanks for the talk.

696
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,420
That was awesome.

697
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,163
And your previous one yesterday was also very informative.

698
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:47,946
I was wondering if, so you talked about Steam wish list

699
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:53,271
as a way to use it as a KPI, or a predictive measure.

700
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:56,495
So I was wondering if there's any other KPIs

701
00:45:56,515 --> 00:45:58,717
that you keep your eyes out for,

702
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:00,739
and any other ways of.

703
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:08,494
seeing basically measuring success or predicting a measure of success and whether you've with

704
00:46:09,415 --> 00:46:15,419
your with no more robots whether you've seen a scenario where you have those kpis and a title

705
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:21,203
that's just not meeting them and that you've had to can or change the strategy um

706
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:28,427
So I guess the obvious one, I feel like I keep saying this over and over again, but I feel like a big obvious one for us was the Discord stuff.

707
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:33,568
We could see exactly how many people were in the server, how many people were active in the server,

708
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:39,090
and we could see as well just how many people were feverish in the server as well.

709
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:49,873
So we were pretty confident at the kinds of numbers that we're going to convert from people who were in our Discord to sales there.

710
00:46:50,747 --> 00:46:52,668
And we kind of coupled that with wishlists as well.

711
00:46:54,509 --> 00:47:00,193
But I wish I had started the mix of stuff earlier as well,

712
00:47:00,413 --> 00:47:00,853
to be honest.

713
00:47:00,893 --> 00:47:02,814
I wish that I'd gotten on that, because I

714
00:47:02,874 --> 00:47:05,616
feel like that would have given us a massive bump.

715
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:08,657
A lot of the stuff was just centralized

716
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:09,658
around those places.

717
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,600
There's obviously plenty of other ones,

718
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,862
but these are the ones that I felt like.

719
00:47:17,743 --> 00:47:19,204
I could really core focus on,

720
00:47:20,164 --> 00:47:22,546
and that wouldn't just grind us into the ground.

721
00:47:23,526 --> 00:47:25,608
I, to clarify, I love looking at numbers.

722
00:47:25,848 --> 00:47:27,749
I love like working out all of these things,

723
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:30,851
but I think you just end up,

724
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:34,894
you just end up getting a little too

725
00:47:34,954 --> 00:47:36,055
into these kind of things, don't you?

726
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:40,037
And you start to see numbers in your sleep a little bit

727
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:42,019
if you start to worry too much about this stuff.

728
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,001
So yeah, that was enough for me really.

729
00:47:47,853 --> 00:47:48,714
Hello.

730
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:49,094
Hi.

731
00:47:49,435 --> 00:47:50,735
Thanks again for the pair of talks.

732
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:51,476
No worries.

733
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:52,256
Very, very good stuff.

734
00:47:52,276 --> 00:47:53,457
I hope it wasn't too rambly.

735
00:47:53,677 --> 00:47:55,318
I felt like it was quite rambly but I...

736
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,699
It was the right amount of ramble.

737
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:57,180
So general, I guess.

738
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,480
Don't worry.

739
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,320
I'm sorry.

740
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:58,621
Sorry.

741
00:47:58,861 --> 00:47:59,081
Sorry.

742
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:05,105
So, I have a question about you kind of touched on giving off the right vibe when it came to your game.

743
00:48:05,585 --> 00:48:08,307
And one of the main things that you focused on was a price point.

744
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:08,807
Yeah.

745
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,148
What else goes into that?

746
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:10,208
So...

747
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:17,442
I think that in general people price their games too low.

748
00:48:17,642 --> 00:48:18,983
I've been seeing developers all day

749
00:48:19,023 --> 00:48:21,064
and pretty much every single developer I've talked to today

750
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:23,285
I've told them that their pricing,

751
00:48:23,785 --> 00:48:26,306
you know, like everybody puts in their little kind of debt,

752
00:48:26,326 --> 00:48:26,686
don't they?

753
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:30,148
Like, we reckon that a launch price of $10 or $15.

754
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:32,869
And pretty much every single person I've talked to today

755
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:35,210
I've said, you can charge more than that by the way,

756
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,212
you know, like, and a lot of it comes down to

757
00:48:39,612 --> 00:48:42,354
things like genre and

758
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:47,279
For Descenders, when we announced Descenders,

759
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:49,239
we were hoping that we were giving off the right vibe.

760
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,899
And when it turned out we were,

761
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:53,880
and we started to get comments like,

762
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,420
I wouldn't pay $40 for this.

763
00:48:56,441 --> 00:49:00,442
That was a pretty good, that gave us a good sense, right?

764
00:49:00,662 --> 00:49:02,982
Of what kind of price we could charge.

765
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:06,143
I honestly, looking back, feel like we could have charged

766
00:49:06,183 --> 00:49:07,903
more than $25 for it at this point.

767
00:49:07,923 --> 00:49:09,484
And we maybe could have pushed it to 30, but.

768
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:18,937
But that, I mean, that's by the by, but a lot of the time I would suggest to people

769
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:26,463
when they're trying to decide on the price to take what kind of game they've got, look

770
00:49:26,483 --> 00:49:32,087
at all the other games that are coming out on Steam right now, but specifically look

771
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:35,871
at which ones are doing well with...

772
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:42,509
Not like the massive ones you kind of cut those ones out because they're all you know

773
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:47,491
A kind of miracle workers when you look at sort of the mid-tier games, which are doing pretty well

774
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:50,752
I'm making you know sort of half a mil for themselves in the first month

775
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:56,847
a lot of the time those games will be, will surprise you, they'll be priced a little bit

776
00:49:56,887 --> 00:50:04,877
higher than you think. I saw a strategy game today and the guys making that said they were

777
00:50:05,017 --> 00:50:06,199
thinking they could get $15 for that. I said to them,

778
00:50:09,363 --> 00:50:11,284
I bet you could get $25 for this.

779
00:50:11,964 --> 00:50:14,585
Strategy games on Steam right now sell well.

780
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:16,846
Like a lot of the time, strategy games,

781
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:19,887
because it's very niche and it's very PC gamer.

782
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:23,989
If you look at the prices of those kind of games,

783
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:25,090
they are priced higher.

784
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:28,511
Because people who play those kind of games

785
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:30,712
don't mind paying a little bit more.

786
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:33,874
They are like hardcore PC gamers.

787
00:50:35,914 --> 00:50:41,020
So yeah, it's honestly, it's doing just a lot of research and really asking yourself,

788
00:50:41,861 --> 00:50:47,929
can I ask for a bit more? And remember as well, the people who you've gathered around the game

789
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:48,751
before the launch.

790
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:51,550
they'd honestly pay anything.

791
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,311
Like, and that's not to say, you know,

792
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:56,011
you should exploit them or anything like that,

793
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:58,532
but it's more like you dropping the price,

794
00:50:58,552 --> 00:51:01,454
you going, ooh, I'll drop the price by $5 just in case.

795
00:51:01,894 --> 00:51:02,674
They don't care.

796
00:51:03,054 --> 00:51:03,714
They absolutely don't care.

797
00:51:03,734 --> 00:51:05,995
Like I told you, all these people bought our game

798
00:51:06,255 --> 00:51:08,016
when it didn't even have the launch discount on it.

799
00:51:08,036 --> 00:51:09,156
They just wanna play it.

800
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:12,738
So why discount it by,

801
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,039
if people weren't gonna buy it at launch,

802
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:19,140
that extra $5 off, is it really gonna pull them in?

803
00:51:21,232 --> 00:51:26,994
And yet adding an extra $5 onto your price, it sounds like a tiny amount, but you sell

804
00:51:27,175 --> 00:51:34,258
an extra 10,000 copies of your game, for a lot of people that could be a whole extra

805
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:37,319
year's worth of living.

806
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:42,082
It seems like small numbers, but I think it's honestly really, really important to think

807
00:51:42,122 --> 00:51:42,562
hard about it.

808
00:51:42,862 --> 00:51:44,063
Okay, thank you very much.

809
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:50,701
Hi, thanks for the talk. In regards to developing a community pre-release, do you have any insight

810
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:54,603
as to what's the best time frame for that in terms of not doing it so early that you

811
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:57,625
risk losing interest versus so late that you have no time to grow?

812
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:02,528
I think we announced Descenders too early.

813
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:08,790
We announced it in July last year,

814
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:12,152
and then it came out in February, which is.

815
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:12,732
Seven months.

816
00:52:13,512 --> 00:52:14,693
What is that, like seven months?

817
00:52:14,873 --> 00:52:15,153
Seven months.

818
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,234
Something like that.

819
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:19,636
I think that was too long.

820
00:52:20,056 --> 00:52:22,257
It felt like it dragged a little bit,

821
00:52:22,317 --> 00:52:24,598
and I wonder if we lost some people along the way

822
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:26,759
because it felt like it was too long.

823
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,341
We split that time up a little bit with the community,

824
00:52:30,662 --> 00:52:32,082
you know, the weekly community stuff,

825
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,203
and with We Run Air.

826
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:37,646
a closed beta for the Discord people in October.

827
00:52:39,693 --> 00:52:43,596
But yeah, I would honestly say six months is the longest.

828
00:52:44,076 --> 00:52:46,717
I think that between announcement of a game

829
00:52:46,837 --> 00:52:47,978
and actually launching a game,

830
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,020
the sweet spot is somewhere between three and six months.

831
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,221
Sometimes depending on what your game actually is.

832
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:57,883
I think that's enough, it's a decent amount of time

833
00:52:57,923 --> 00:52:59,524
where you can build up a little community,

834
00:52:59,704 --> 00:53:01,946
but you're always telling them it's coming very soon,

835
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:03,646
I promise, it's coming very soon,

836
00:53:04,527 --> 00:53:06,068
and not have them disappear too quickly.

837
00:53:06,888 --> 00:53:08,349
Okay, all right, thank you, that was very helpful.

838
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:11,342
Hey, thanks for the talk.

839
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:16,984
You touched on YouTubers and Twitch streamers don't really convert well to game sales, they're

840
00:53:17,004 --> 00:53:18,264
mostly there for free entertainment.

841
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:22,586
What is your view on media outlets and previews and reviews?

842
00:53:22,626 --> 00:53:27,007
Do you see a bigger tick from those kind of companies?

843
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,288
No, not for a long time to be honest.

844
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:35,010
I was giving talks about this years ago and I was saying that the press don't really ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

845
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:41,034
do much. For us, just to clarify, it's still well worth getting press to talk about your

846
00:53:41,074 --> 00:53:44,816
game and getting YouTubers and streamers and everybody. Just because they don't do spikes

847
00:53:45,177 --> 00:53:52,742
doesn't mean they aren't causing... I think that Descenders has plateaued at a nice number

848
00:53:52,782 --> 00:53:54,163
of sales per day.

849
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:57,273
thanks to all the coverage.

850
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:59,055
Because now when someone, if someone sees it

851
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:01,178
and they search for the word Descendants,

852
00:54:01,198 --> 00:54:04,262
they see all of these articles talking about it.

853
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,844
They see it on this website, that website.

854
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:10,196
I think that helps to sell it to anybody who's coming along.

855
00:54:10,736 --> 00:54:19,520
But no, not for years to be honest have I seen any sort of spikes out of specific press

856
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,820
talking about my games.

857
00:54:21,221 --> 00:54:21,801
Yes, thanks.

858
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:27,003
An interesting thing actually is that when we announced Ascenders,

859
00:54:28,584 --> 00:54:31,625
we ended up getting about I think like 125,000 views on the trailer like in the first month.

860
00:54:31,645 --> 00:54:31,765
About...

861
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:39,937
40,000 of those came from Games Press.

862
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:45,101
And about 85,000 of those came from Bike Press.

863
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:47,784
And that was about two outlets.

864
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:48,865
Gotcha.

865
00:54:48,905 --> 00:54:50,366
Go for the Bike Press is what you're saying.

866
00:54:50,626 --> 00:54:52,368
So just get in contact with the Bike Press.

867
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:54,830
Confuse them.

868
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,652
I don't know, put a bike in your game.

869
00:54:57,853 --> 00:54:58,453
Worked for us.

870
00:54:58,473 --> 00:54:59,774
Thank you.

871
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:00,715
Hi.

872
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:05,256
Hey there. Um, so earlier in your talk, well, thank you for giving this talk,

873
00:55:05,296 --> 00:55:09,339
by the way. Um, let's see, uh, earlier in your talk, you talked about, uh,

874
00:55:09,379 --> 00:55:09,940
like asking.

875
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:13,181
asking a lot for like partnerships and stuff like that.

876
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:15,843
It seems like you took a pretty fearless approach

877
00:55:16,324 --> 00:55:18,045
and coming from a Northwesterner,

878
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:20,647
the problem that I find in simply just asking for things

879
00:55:20,788 --> 00:55:22,229
is that there's a ton of perception

880
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:23,530
around what the response might be.

881
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:26,192
So then my question to you is,

882
00:55:26,413 --> 00:55:28,875
would you prefer just recklessly asking for things

883
00:55:29,435 --> 00:55:30,917
because you don't know what might happen

884
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:32,798
or would you prefer a more tempered approach

885
00:55:33,259 --> 00:55:34,940
depending on the type of game that you have?

886
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,381
Well, what's the worst thing that could happen

887
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:37,142
if you ask though?

888
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:41,673
Like if you ask someone, if you go to someone and say,

889
00:55:41,693 --> 00:55:45,254
I want this, can we work together on this thing?

890
00:55:45,514 --> 00:55:48,576
The worst that's gonna happen is they're gonna ignore you.

891
00:55:49,356 --> 00:55:51,557
Or you're never gonna burn a bridge or anything

892
00:55:51,597 --> 00:55:53,338
by asking someone for help.

893
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:57,520
The worst that's gonna happen is you'll feel a bit shit

894
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,401
because someone didn't get back to you.

895
00:55:59,781 --> 00:56:01,262
The best that's gonna happen is they're gonna say,

896
00:56:01,282 --> 00:56:04,703
all right, cool, let's jump on a call and I'll suss you out.

897
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,303
And at that point, you've got a window.

898
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:10,728
You're right, I do...

899
00:56:10,748 --> 00:56:15,233
I can be a bit reckless with all this kind of stuff,

900
00:56:15,293 --> 00:56:17,095
but I think it works, to be honest.

901
00:56:17,115 --> 00:56:20,920
I think people actually appreciate

902
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,242
a direct approach sometimes.

903
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,692
I guess reckless was a little bit too reckless.

904
00:56:25,712 --> 00:56:26,292
Yeah.

905
00:56:26,913 --> 00:56:29,514
I would say more courageous, I guess, forward thinking.

906
00:56:29,534 --> 00:56:31,495
I guess I'm struggling for words here.

907
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:36,918
No, it's like I was saying, I honestly, I think...

908
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:45,841
I think it's one of my personality pro points that I feel okay doing this.

909
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:50,304
All the stuff I was talking about, you know, doing the horrible, like, cringey stuff as well,

910
00:56:50,564 --> 00:56:53,987
for some reason, at some point in my life, I decided I didn't care.

911
00:56:55,187 --> 00:57:00,251
I appreciate that a lot of real human beings with actual emotions

912
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:03,613
find this stuff hard and find it hard to just ask.

913
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:09,369
just get over it, just honestly, just ask.

914
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,612
Because like I say, everything that happens,

915
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:13,432
you make happen.

916
00:57:13,492 --> 00:57:14,833
No one has been coming to me,

917
00:57:16,034 --> 00:57:17,695
trying to just being like,

918
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:19,736
hey, can we help you with the success of Descenders?

919
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:21,698
I have asked and asked and asked

920
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:25,080
and made every little thing happen by asking.

921
00:57:27,549 --> 00:57:29,950
So just, just, just do it.

922
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,490
Just try it.

923
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:31,490
Just try it.

924
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,831
Just grit your teeth and try it.

925
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:33,692
Start asking for stuff.

926
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:35,152
If it doesn't work out for you,

927
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,573
ignore me and go back to not asking for stuff.

928
00:57:37,613 --> 00:57:40,275
But just, just for a month, just for a month.

929
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:40,715
Just try it.

930
00:57:40,755 --> 00:57:41,135
What can happen?

931
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:41,555
For a month.

932
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:43,176
Just try asking for things.

933
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:44,097
See how it goes.

934
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:46,198
And if you hate it, fine.

935
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,179
But maybe it'll change your life.

936
00:57:48,419 --> 00:57:50,540
Feel like this is turning into some kind of life seminar.

937
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,941
Don't be human.

938
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:53,221
Yeah.

939
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,442
You can do this.

940
00:57:55,242 --> 00:57:55,482
Yeah.

941
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:56,723
That is what I would say.

942
00:57:57,685 --> 00:57:58,406
Alright, cool.

943
00:57:58,446 --> 00:57:58,806
Do it!

944
00:57:59,386 --> 00:58:02,027
Is what I think Sheila Booth said.

945
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:06,228
I guess before I give the mic over to the next person, you mentioned earlier about getting

946
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:06,789
dev kits.

947
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:13,171
I was going to say can confirm, because I had a pretty epic freakout when I, like the

948
00:58:13,191 --> 00:58:17,913
game that I'm working on managed to somehow become a part of ID at Xbox, and I had a pretty

949
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,533
epic freakout when they showed up at my door.

950
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:20,539
Yeah.

951
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:21,259
Because I thought...

952
00:58:21,279 --> 00:58:25,661
But then there'll be loads of people who don't ask that kind of stuff.

953
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:26,762
Yeah.

954
00:58:27,362 --> 00:58:28,223
And how easy was it?

955
00:58:29,163 --> 00:58:31,124
It was actually pretty easy.

956
00:58:31,464 --> 00:58:34,006
Yeah, I mean you had to fill out a bunch of horrible forms, right?

957
00:58:34,046 --> 00:58:38,608
Because you can't get anything like that without filling out a whole bunch of forms, but you

958
00:58:38,688 --> 00:58:42,510
did the horrible form filling out and then this thing turned up.

959
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:45,052
And then two giant white boxes showed up at my door.

960
00:58:45,465 --> 00:58:46,645
Yeah, they're pretty big.

961
00:58:46,705 --> 00:58:46,885
Cheers.

962
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:47,806
Hello.

963
00:58:48,086 --> 00:58:52,028
Hey, just echoing previous sentiments, I was at the talk yesterday, really enjoyed it,

964
00:58:52,108 --> 00:58:54,289
wasn't planning to be back, but here I am, so thank you very much.

965
00:58:55,349 --> 00:59:00,171
And so you mentioned all the benefits of a Discord community, you sort of sold me on

966
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:05,014
it, but having not seen your previous talks, I still feel sort of unclear on how you got

967
00:59:05,094 --> 00:59:07,355
that initial bunch of people to be there.

968
00:59:08,355 --> 00:59:11,397
What are the steps involved in that, and if it's your previous talks?

969
00:59:11,497 --> 00:59:13,578
Yeah, maybe I didn't explain that well enough.

970
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:17,259
So, what I was trying to say was that

971
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,901
you need to give people a reason to be joining the Discord.

972
00:59:21,382 --> 00:59:25,644
And the way you do that is that you tell them

973
00:59:26,144 --> 00:59:28,685
that to get this free stuff you're going to give them,

974
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:30,266
they have to join the Discord.

975
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:33,047
The free stuff for us was doing a closed beta

976
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:34,768
through the Discord.

977
00:59:35,944 --> 00:59:39,585
we from the moment we announced the game we said we were going to do a closed beta very soon

978
00:59:40,165 --> 00:59:44,526
and we said that the way to do that was to sign up in the discord the the press reported on that

979
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:54,368
and a lot of those people do i have to stop one more question okay cool um and a lot of those

980
00:59:54,388 --> 00:59:59,189
a lot of people then if they read the article on a press website and we're interested in it

981
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,969
then click the link to the discord

982
01:00:01,726 --> 01:00:05,870
people fall away right because most people won't click the link to discord in the first place

983
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:11,155
and then of those people most people don't have discord so you end up only getting a small funnel

984
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:11,615
of people

985
01:00:12,684 --> 01:00:15,445
But even so, a small funnel of people for us was thousands of people.

986
01:00:16,065 --> 01:00:18,466
But you got the word out through traditional press outlets and things like that.

987
01:00:18,546 --> 01:00:19,187
Exactly, yeah.

988
01:00:19,467 --> 01:00:22,008
And then around about the time we were doing the closed beta as well,

989
01:00:22,028 --> 01:00:24,709
you know, in the like couple of weeks we announced the date for the closed beta,

990
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:27,910
we got another surge of like a couple of extra thousand people

991
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,211
back into the Discord again because we said,

992
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,752
this thing's coming out for free in two weeks,

993
01:00:33,052 --> 01:00:33,812
here's how you get it.

994
01:00:34,372 --> 01:00:36,813
And another bunch of people came in.

995
01:00:36,913 --> 01:00:37,113
So...

996
01:00:38,557 --> 01:00:43,941
Yeah, it's surprisingly easy to get people to kind of want to be part of your community

997
01:00:44,161 --> 01:00:45,583
if you're throwing free stuff at them.

998
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:46,663
Thank you very much.

999
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:47,564
Who knew?

1000
01:00:48,985 --> 01:00:51,047
Hi, apparently we only have one more question.

1001
01:00:51,487 --> 01:00:52,328
I'll try and make it a good one.

1002
01:00:52,508 --> 01:00:53,329
It better be great.

1003
01:00:53,889 --> 01:00:54,470
It better be great.

1004
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:59,754
You mentioned finding a publisher or other partner to do the annoying and or cringy work.

1005
01:00:59,974 --> 01:01:00,175
Yeah.

1006
01:01:00,195 --> 01:01:00,915
Yeah.

1007
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:03,650
Do you know anyone who's interested in publishing games?

1008
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:07,214
And if, or more generally, suggestions for finding

1009
01:01:07,254 --> 01:01:08,255
and connecting with those sorts of people?

1010
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:12,579
Yeah, I mean, when it comes to that kind of stuff,

1011
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,642
everybody's looking for different things.

1012
01:01:17,524 --> 01:01:21,808
The main thing that I'd say is,

1013
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,132
if you're working with a publisher.

1014
01:01:26,956 --> 01:01:33,642
make sure that you're getting a good deal, to be honest.

1015
01:01:34,863 --> 01:01:38,526
One of the main reasons why I did set up my own thing,

1016
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:40,988
and in fact, why it's called No More Robots,

1017
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:43,349
is because over and over and over again,

1018
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:46,592
people were telling me when they work with indie publishers

1019
01:01:46,612 --> 01:01:48,874
or whatever you want to call them,

1020
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:52,197
they'd sign up, they'd maybe not sign,

1021
01:01:52,477 --> 01:01:54,178
they'd sign a deal which was maybe not great.

1022
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:58,581
and then they'd never talk to that person ever again who signed them

1023
01:01:58,921 --> 01:02:02,404
because now they were passed along to another part of the company

1024
01:02:02,424 --> 01:02:06,086
and then it was like, okay cool, we'll hear from you in six months then

1025
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:08,708
when you've got the build ready and then we'll push it out.

1026
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:15,833
It's... if you're going to work with a publisher, do some...

1027
01:02:16,938 --> 01:02:21,220
heavy scoping of them basically. Talk to, email every single dev who has worked with them

1028
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:28,102
and say what's it like to work with this person because you don't want to, it can be exciting

1029
01:02:28,142 --> 01:02:31,664
right if someone's showing interest in your work and is saying hey let's work together we'll take

1030
01:02:31,684 --> 01:02:35,925
this this revenue share and then we'll put it and it might sound amazing but then when you sign with

1031
01:02:35,945 --> 01:02:41,507
them you realize oh crap like they're not doing anything and they're the worst. I hear that all

1032
01:02:41,547 --> 01:02:41,867
the time.

1033
01:02:43,955 --> 01:02:50,237
And it can easily be remedied by just making sure

1034
01:02:50,257 --> 01:02:52,758
that you email people who have published with them before

1035
01:02:53,498 --> 01:02:55,779
and saying, are they okay?

1036
01:02:56,059 --> 01:02:56,640
Are they cool?

1037
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,641
And if they say no, then you don't

1038
01:03:00,521 --> 01:03:04,123
because it's never worth selling your soul.

1039
01:03:04,143 --> 01:03:08,004
Did that answer your question?

1040
01:03:08,424 --> 01:03:08,764
Pretty much.

1041
01:03:09,145 --> 01:03:10,465
Okay, good, right.

1042
01:03:11,045 --> 01:03:12,166
Thank you very much everybody.

1043
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:12,626
Thank you.
