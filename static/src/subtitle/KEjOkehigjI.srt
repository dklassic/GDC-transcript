1
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:08,156
Hello, hello, welcome.

2
00:00:08,536 --> 00:00:10,837
And I hope you're having an awesome, awesome GDC.

3
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:11,958
I am Karen Schreier.

4
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:15,719
I am the Director of Games and Emerging Media at Marist College

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,440
and an Assistant Professor there as well.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,301
And I am here to talk about presenting.

7
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:24,963
So as we know, big news flash,

8
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:28,844
game students need a ton of skills.

9
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:31,105
I mean, mad skills, so many things.

10
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:32,146
In the past...

11
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:35,127
We could get away with just teaching them coding.

12
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:37,348
Maybe you could just teach them some art.

13
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,790
In the way, way past, we could probably get away

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,131
with just having passion for games.

15
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:44,331
But now.

16
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:46,905
We got to teach them all this.

17
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:47,765
There's a lot.

18
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:49,386
There's a lot of things there.

19
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:53,067
And in a way, it's kind of like our students

20
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:55,688
have to be unicorns to be able to get a job

21
00:00:55,908 --> 00:01:00,690
and to be able to say, hey, I'm a successful student.

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,953
And if you look at the top must have skills, leadership,

23
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:11,514
teamwork, strong communication skills are leading the way.

24
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:11,574
OK.

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,483
Communication. We need our students to actually be able to talk to each other, right?

26
00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:23,886
We've got to teach them these game designs, specific skills,

27
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:27,389
and oddly though, what might be

28
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:31,412
most important is that they could present and talk and speak to each other

29
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:34,535
and be able to articulate clear ideas and

30
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:39,579
arguments and methods and data and not only that

31
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:42,321
but to be able to listen to each other.

32
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:43,961
and empathize with each other.

33
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:47,222
And in fact, this is kind of what design is, really.

34
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:50,003
I mean, deep down, it's about communicating really well

35
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:50,583
to each other.

36
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:55,384
Yet here we are, leaving communication in the corner.

37
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:59,765
We're not making it, perhaps, as much of a priority

38
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:00,385
as it should be.

39
00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:04,766
So today, I am asking you, please, please, please,

40
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:06,427
please, please don't leave communication

41
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:07,327
in the corner anymore.

42
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:10,344
Make it your top priority.

43
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:17,108
So I'm going to give you my top 10 tips for teaching public presentation to game students,

44
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:23,611
which sometimes seems like an oxymoron, but I'm here to say it actually should be one of your

45
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:26,233
top priorities for teaching game students.

46
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,775
Number one, do it early and often, okay, from day one, even before day one.

47
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:37,099
Make presentation a key component of your classes. This means maybe show and tell of games.

48
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:43,803
It could mean presenting for one minute on the design process. It doesn't have to be a big presentation.

49
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:48,666
It doesn't even have to be the final presentation. It could be every single day they come in your class.

50
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:52,829
They have to stand up, even if it's just at their desk, and talk about what they did in the last,

51
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:56,631
since the last class. Get them used to it. Get them comfortable with it.

52
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:00,336
Create a culture of presenting.

53
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:05,579
This is hard to achieve, but it comes down to valuing presentation.

54
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,103
I mean, making that one of the number one skills to be able to succeed in your program.

55
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:12,584
It could mean that

56
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:18,807
A large proportion of their grade is even presentation skills, not just design skills.

57
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:24,711
Have a formal workshop, bring in some trainers, people who are experts in presentation.

58
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,112
Maybe you're not the expert, that's okay.

59
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:31,815
Have someone come in, give training and tips on how to make a good presentation, how to

60
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:34,636
construct a good argument, how to tell a story.

61
00:03:35,504 --> 00:03:40,131
really well, and then have your students practice the rest of the semester.

62
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:46,199
Do lots and lots of low stakes exercises. Not everything has to be graded, okay? You

63
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:51,146
could just give feedback and have lots of ungraded assignments.

64
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:58,449
Get students used to getting feedback, getting used to being critiqued, critique each other, lots of peer critique.

65
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:06,613
It also means you're giving detailed instruction, not just on game design and development, but on the presentation skills, right?

66
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:13,235
How to build speeches for different audiences, how to deal with different styles, formats, language use.

67
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:19,498
Have students practice in a lot of different places.

68
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:20,779
Have them at their desk.

69
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,539
Have them stand up in front of the class.

70
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,300
Have them do presentations online via Skype.

71
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:28,361
Have them do it in a game, Second Life.

72
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:34,343
Make presentations a normal part of the every day practice.

73
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,324
Present beyond the classroom.

74
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:38,185
Have them stand in front of clients.

75
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:41,126
Have them go and present at a conference.

76
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:48,564
Create a conference at your university where they can present in a public forum.

77
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:51,047
Have them come to GDC and present.

78
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:57,794
Have them at a game jam present at the end of the game jam or a hackathon their ideas,

79
00:04:57,834 --> 00:04:58,955
their works in progress.

80
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:04,564
So really important, make sure your students are comfortable.

81
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,906
Make sure they're supported.

82
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:10,948
Make sure they understand that presenting matters,

83
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,630
but that they also matter and their comfort matters.

84
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,412
Sometimes we think in our head that.

85
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:22,655
Game students are not going to be very good at presenting, so let's just not push them in that way.

86
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:28,440
But I have found that, except for maybe one or two students, most students really want this practice,

87
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,582
and they need this practice to succeed in their futures.

88
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:36,666
But push boundaries. Get them out of their comfort zones, too.

89
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,729
Give them credit for failing, making mistakes.

90
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,054
Okay? Get them to do things that are out of their normal every day.

91
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:53,241
Take risks. Go on job interviews. Go to GDC. Go to places that maybe take them outside of their normal.

92
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:54,002
And...

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:05,944
Make them gain their confidence, because if they gain their confidence, that's going to influence every aspect of their work, their design work, and who they are as people.

94
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:11,946
Iterate, iterate, iterate, just as you would with the game design, the development process.

95
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:17,068
Do the same thing with presentations, make them practice, practice again, and revise and revise.

96
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:21,770
Have them videotape themselves, watch it, and practice and revise it.

97
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,352
Have them peer critique. Have them practice using different language.

98
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:34,175
Have them put on silly costumes. Use crazy props. Use crazy music. Anything that gets

99
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:39,137
them to feel comfortable and want to get up there and keep trying and learning and experimenting.

100
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,550
Be transparent with how you do evaluate them.

101
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:46,133
When you are giving them grades, be really clear

102
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:49,696
about how you're grading them, what matters to you.

103
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:53,580
Give them the rubrics up in front, beforehand.

104
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,703
Have them see the feedback forms that they're going to be using.

105
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:03,848
Focus on logic and story.

106
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:06,690
Okay, so they need to be able to do presentations

107
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,772
that are supported by evidence and data,

108
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:11,034
but also tell a good story, right?

109
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:14,937
You want them to be able to connect with their audience,

110
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,740
to be able to care about their subject,

111
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,803
to talk through their wins and their losses,

112
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:23,504
their successes and their challenges,

113
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:25,966
and to make people remember through story.

114
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:31,739
And oh wait, I said top 10, but I have an 11th.

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,942
There I am making a mistake.

116
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:36,846
Show them that you make mistakes, okay?

117
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:38,998
It's okay to make mistakes.

118
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:42,681
Be the model of someone who can make mistakes

119
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,482
and can grow from it, okay?

120
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:48,946
And number 11 is, even though you may have some standards

121
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,928
and some rubrics and some requirements,

122
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:53,790
you want to value different styles

123
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,972
and different perspectives, okay?

124
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:58,134
There's obviously certain things that you wanna hit,

125
00:07:58,214 --> 00:07:59,655
like good eye contact.

126
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:07,488
Telling stories, making people care, connecting with the audience, clear, articulate ideas,

127
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:10,289
you know, positive attitude and enthusiasm.

128
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:12,010
Yes, you want that, right?

129
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:22,656
But you also want to value different ways of presenting and also be accepting and open

130
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:26,018
because that's going to build trust with your students and that's going

131
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,920
to make them more comfortable and confident to be able to present in front of you.

132
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:37,114
Ultimately it's about building relationships, not only with your audience, but also with

133
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:37,815
your students.

134
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:44,379
Having a culture of presenting is going to have your students feel more part of your

135
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,319
program, right?

136
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:48,081
It's going to serve them on their own teams.

137
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,463
It's going to serve them at college and beyond college.

138
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:54,489
Want to hear more?

139
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,990
I hope so.

140
00:08:56,471 --> 00:09:02,175
Email me for rubrics, exercises, tools, anything to get your students excited and enthusiastic

141
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:03,136
about presentation.

142
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:04,097
I hope that you will.

143
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:04,577
Thanks.

144
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:18,028
I'm glad you put cat memes in because I was scared that I didn't have any, so.

145
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,331
Hi there!

146
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,517
My name is Christopher Totten.

147
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:25,978
I teach here.

148
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,681
I'm an indie game developer and a game community advocate.

149
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:35,204
I've published books about game making, including

150
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,526
An Architectural Approach to Level Design,

151
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:40,688
and the recently released edited volume, Level Design

152
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,209
Processes and Experiences.

153
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:48,218
And I'm one of the lead organizers of the Smithsonian American Art Museum Arcade.

154
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,162
But today, I'm here to ask, has this ever happened to you?

155
00:09:54,823 --> 00:10:00,808
A colleague comes to you offering a collaboration, but really, they mean you'll be illustrating

156
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:03,911
their research article or report.

157
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:08,294
Has a game art student skilled with software ever asked you to look at their work?

158
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:14,788
only for you to find an abject horror that could have been prevented if only they'd taken

159
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:22,497
an intro drawing class, then you may be a victim of Game Academia's art problem.

160
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:28,387
So what do I mean by game academia has an art problem?

161
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:31,969
I'm going to define it as the way our field

162
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:34,450
de-emphasizes game-making disciplines

163
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,951
descended from the arts in favor of others.

164
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:40,353
Now, to be clear, I'm not talking about games

165
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:42,774
that use the affordances of contemporary art

166
00:10:43,554 --> 00:10:44,675
to design interactivity,

167
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:48,057
but rather acknowledging the lineage

168
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:50,578
between game asset creation specialties

169
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:53,159
and the historic fields they're descended from.

170
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,285
So what are some of these disciplines?

171
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,346
Looking through the keywords used

172
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:02,127
in the Degra Online Library shows the dominance

173
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:05,848
of serious games, learning, and game interactivity design

174
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:06,888
as research topics.

175
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:10,449
Likewise, there are large numbers of keywords

176
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:12,910
derived from terms in the social sciences,

177
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,791
cognitive development, and behavior studies.

178
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,272
What you don't see are the same number of topics

179
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,073
in areas like spatial design in games,

180
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,792
sound design, visual arts, and even music.

181
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:33,273
So the first part of our problem is

182
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,094
there's a distinct preference towards serious games,

183
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:40,276
social science research, and others that favor mechanics,

184
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,736
but away from deeper understandings

185
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,617
of the aesthetic qualities of games.

186
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:51,556
The second part comes when you look at industry conferences like here at GDC, at the East

187
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:56,719
Coast Game Conference, or any other professional conference with a game art or visual arts

188
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,643
track. Talks at these conferences seem more related to graphics development than the visual

189
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:10,487
arts. Sessions at GDC 2016 in the visual arts track, for example, had titles like HDR rendering

190
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:11,268
and Lumberyard.

191
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:18,137
Shaders 101, foundational shader concepts for technical artists and every MFA's favorite

192
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:26,543
photogrammetry and Star Wars battlefront. Of the 77 scheduled sessions at GDC 2016 in

193
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:33,108
the visual arts track, only eight cited techniques or concepts explicitly from the fine arts

194
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:38,251
such as color theory or composition. So who cares? Why is this a problem?

195
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:48,167
Many of these attitudes trickle down into academic game programs, appearing in class design, research questions, and the structure of development teams in these environments.

196
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:56,174
In many programs, there's a bias towards software usage and technical art pipelines, and away from studying fine art principles.

197
00:12:57,517 --> 00:13:01,799
The dominant subjects in games research focus on the work of game mechanic designers, while

198
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,984
putting artists, composers, and sound designers in utilitarian roles that de-incentivize them

199
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,125
from being researchers in their own right.

200
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:15,969
The underlying issue for all of these is that we view games as monolithic objects, rather

201
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:19,011
than collections of works by collaborating professionals.

202
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:23,534
And instead of evolving from this monolith, we keep banging our heads against it.

203
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:27,783
So what can be some practical solutions to this?

204
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:33,487
Well, there are many, many, many works, all very good.

205
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:34,527
I love these books.

206
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:38,150
Studying game mechanics or meditations

207
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,111
on the nature of play,

208
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:42,253
there are few academic investigations

209
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,654
of things like art production or sound design.

210
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:50,792
Given that many of these understudied disciplines are descended from established fields, there

211
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:56,558
are chances for true impact if you can discover what lies in the mysterious region between

212
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:57,479
games and the arts.

213
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:04,046
While the use of techniques or references from the broader arts or media history is

214
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:07,669
common in other fields, it's not commonplace in games quite yet.

215
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:13,410
So remember the 2013 Deagra theme of defragging game studies?

216
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,453
I challenge you to do the opposite.

217
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:19,698
Frag games with a BFG, pick a favorite chunk,

218
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:21,541
and milk it for all it's worth.

219
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,458
If you're making games as part of your research,

220
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:31,342
there's also benefits to including research agenda items

221
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:32,022
from the arts.

222
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,546
Games that emphasize fine art processes

223
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:38,429
in their asset creation have both creative novelty

224
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,012
and can get your game displayed in museums

225
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:42,354
and other institutions.

226
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:48,631
Art-inspired games have and can, or can and have,

227
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,731
provided meaningful collaborations,

228
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:54,433
allowing art professionals a real seat at the table

229
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,554
and mechanic designers to discover

230
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,074
new methods of interactivity.

231
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,496
Arts professionals can also be your subject matter experts

232
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:06,118
on fundable projects that use games in art education

233
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:07,758
or teach art principles.

234
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:11,906
As for teaching, software is necessary,

235
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,947
but we should blend the fine arts

236
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,308
into the core of teaching it.

237
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,989
Use software as a tool for practicing the arts

238
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,750
and teach your students to do the same.

239
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,131
We can do this by designing projects

240
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:24,852
that challenge students to answer theoretical questions

241
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:25,633
with software.

242
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,074
Teach the visual history of games

243
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:30,775
by having them make retro games

244
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:32,396
in graphic scale and construct.

245
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:35,517
Teach architectural space organization

246
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:36,598
in the Unreal Engine.

247
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,208
Reinforce things like proportion and composition

248
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,228
in Photoshop concept art courses.

249
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:47,530
So already, these opportunities can lead us down

250
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,911
a variety of paths of looking more deeply into games,

251
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:52,132
past their mechanics.

252
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:56,993
Because as many practicing game developers will tell you,

253
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,915
games are not self-contained productions

254
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,835
that consist only of interactivity.

255
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,102
Anyone who's ever gone from consumer to creator

256
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:09,465
will tell you that when they've tried to make even simple games,

257
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:13,448
elements that they took for granted suddenly seemed very big and impressive.

258
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,552
Sure, interactivity is one of the things that make games unique, but

259
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:23,577
if fans can understand that games have component parts worthy of study and

260
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:24,317
celebration,

261
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,280
why can't we who study games professionally?

262
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:34,070
I know that for me, some of my colleagues, and many of my students, the artistic aspects

263
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,092
of games are what excited us, stuck with us over the years, and inspired us to make games

264
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:39,872
our careers.

265
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:45,515
And if given the chance, I think that meaningful collaboration with the arts may be the next

266
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:47,356
great way to make and study games.

267
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:48,336
Thank you.

268
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,669
Great segue, I work at an art school.

269
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,396
So, hi, my name is Emma Westacott.

270
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:10,349
I am an associate professor at OCAD University, which is an art and design school in Toronto.

271
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:26,040
I wanted to, well first of all I just want to, my pronouns are she and her, and I'm going to talk really briefly about some pedagogic approaches from feminism for the classroom.

272
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,443
So, as a middle-aged white feminist academic, I have significant privilege and

273
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,585
I'll argue that we all have lots of privilege, even being here in this room.

274
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:44,749
So one of the challenges for me as an educator is to think about ways in which I can engage my privilege

275
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:49,631
for my students and for the communities that I work with and for.

276
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:55,774
I'm also here representing a Canadian network called Reefig,

277
00:17:56,014 --> 00:18:02,558
which is funded by the SSHRC and is invested in building diversity in game culture.

278
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:05,213
education and the industry.

279
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:10,919
So a lot of the work, I'm sort of standing on the shoulders of others, and actually there

280
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:14,483
are colleagues who are also part of the network here in the room, so I'm sort of speaking

281
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:17,206
on behalf of significant others.

282
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:17,266
So

283
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,501
Where I wanted to start was describing the work that's necessary as a sort of ecosystem.

284
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:33,289
I think it's impossible to look at your classroom in an isolated sense.

285
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:42,171
One of the things that we can do is look at common functions

286
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,152
that can be shared across a range of different

287
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:44,893
sort of like contexts.

288
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,894
An example of that is an inclusivity statement.

289
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:49,256
So in the same way that we can see the inclusivity statement

290
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,298
as we walk into the sort of main hall of GDC,

291
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:55,120
we can sort of issue and publish inclusivity statements.

292
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,725
in our programs, in our classrooms and in our institutions.

293
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:04,111
And what that does is it sets up a sort of contract or a set of expectations for students

294
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:08,135
when they come into the classroom about what is and what isn't acceptable behavior.

295
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:12,721
So the inclusivity statement we have at our institution.

296
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:18,187
is developed with thanks to the Different Games Collective who generously developed

297
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:22,750
and published their inclusivity statement as an open source resource.

298
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,652
So it's available on Different Games for those of you who wish to use it in your classrooms

299
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:33,395
and I'd strongly urge you to take advantage of all the work by the collective in doing

300
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:34,095
so and using it.

301
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:39,065
So the ecosystem that I'm going to talk about starts from the classroom really, but it sort

302
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:44,647
of moves out and beyond because I don't think, as I said before, that you can isolate activity

303
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,227
purely to sort of classrooms.

304
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:52,710
So we inhabit the ecosystems that go beyond the walls of our institutions.

305
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,292
I'm particularly lucky where I teach, being based in Toronto, because we have a really

306
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:04,234
healthy local indie scene, AAA developers, and a much sort of like wider context of sort

307
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:04,814
of production.

308
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,929
But I wanted to start just really talking about some fairly basic practices that you can use in your classroom.

309
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:19,255
So regardless of your course material, I would argue that you could use feminist approaches.

310
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:22,920
So your content doesn't have to be explicitly feminist.

311
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,763
Your class will benefit from engaging with some of these.

312
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:28,084
So, I'm going to go through some sort of techniques, if you like.

313
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:30,205
So, use non-gendered or female pronouns.

314
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:37,467
I always name the player as she, and you'll notice that I use the word player, not gamer.

315
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,628
Now, there's a very particular reason for that.

316
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:44,650
I use player, not gamer, because of how the gamer identity is being tarnished by online violence,

317
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,570
and I explain that to my students.

318
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,732
I use she because I'm a female gamer, and we often don't hear that.

319
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:51,352
So...

320
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:58,732
The second part of thinking about how you place yourself in the classroom is to pick

321
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:04,135
women, pick minority voices. Women tend to be written out of histories. I'm old enough

322
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:09,417
to remember the strong, powerful female designers that were around in the 90s. I've read enough

323
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:14,340
history to understand about Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper. And so, you know, we do have

324
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,802
female role models in our histories and it behoves us as sort of educators to make sure

325
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:21,943
that they're taught. So we need to be aware of our histories.

326
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:27,997
And that's not just historical figures, but it's current makers.

327
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:34,644
So there's a rich history of both female and feminist makers, academics, critics, and players.

328
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,447
So make sure that you use them in the materials.

329
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:39,810
And I teach both game design and game studies.

330
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:46,016
So I have access to a rich range of resources across both sort of areas and it's always

331
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:50,939
worth spending some time looking at the resources that you're using, whether it's in a sort

332
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:56,081
of a liberal studies class or an applied design class, in terms of enriching the resources

333
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:57,462
that you're offering to your students.

334
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:07,203
So encourage critical readings as well. It's an old feminist technique to read against the dominant narrative of a particular text.

335
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:13,006
Encourage your students to play against the rhetoric of a particular game to try and find the edges and the holes.

336
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:19,490
And it's something that players do anyway, right? So there's no reason why you can't explicitly centre on that.

337
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,812
with in-class playings, out-of-class exercises.

338
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:27,975
And that's part of how you start to build up a notion of sort of

339
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,797
criticality amongst your students.

340
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:33,499
I had a student about three years ago who just said,

341
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,100
well that's just the way games are.

342
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,182
And it's like, really? They're 30 years old.

343
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:41,284
You know, they're not like anything for any particular...

344
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:43,867
You know, they're not set in stone.

345
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,449
They're amorphous and they evolve.

346
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:49,931
They come from a particular sort of technological and commercial background,

347
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:52,213
but there's no reason why we shouldn't be pushing

348
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,655
for new, more open, more diverse futures.

349
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:57,818
And I think that that's something which sort of starts in the classroom.

350
00:22:58,218 --> 00:23:02,161
So to backtrack, encourage critical readings or playings of the games.

351
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:03,842
Talk to your students about...

352
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:14,571
And the sort of second point of this really is that there is, okay, so there's no such

353
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:17,152
thing as a mutual design decision.

354
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:22,614
Decisions are made by people in places and time, and often there's very particular reasons

355
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:23,854
for those design decisions.

356
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:32,617
But spread that context and don't let your students assume that decisions have been made

357
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:33,857
in the ether, right?

358
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:41,237
So another methodology or technique or approach I use a lot in classrooms is to try and find

359
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:46,220
ways of shifting out of the teacher-student hierarchy, which is so problematic in terms

360
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,981
of setting up hierarchies in classrooms.

361
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:56,744
And there's many fashionable terms for how you can shift around with that power dynamic,

362
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:58,865
but encourage different forms.

363
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:04,188
In some ways, I'm standing here talking to you, reproducing that power dynamic, but it's

364
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:10,150
really much richer in the classroom to think about splitting groups, letting people speak

365
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:15,452
about and talk about an area or a game they have a deep passion about and present that

366
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:18,872
knowledge and that expertise in a much more sort of flattened hierarchy.

367
00:24:19,873 --> 00:24:24,874
The other thing which I think is really important is there's no one right way of making games.

368
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:28,735
There's no one accepted language of game design.

369
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:33,853
And talking about that and allowing and celebrating different types of starting points, both to

370
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:38,334
game making and game criticism, is really important as a way of including and opening

371
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,835
up to different types of voices.

372
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:47,298
So to repeat, shift out of the expert-student hierarchy, acknowledge a multitude of approaches,

373
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:52,480
and insist on notions of authorship, games are made by people in places and times.

374
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,402
So these techniques are applicable in every classroom, not just the feminist classroom.

375
00:25:00,718 --> 00:25:08,742
Moving out the ecosystem a little bit, I wanted to just talk a little about how us academics

376
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:11,643
can shift our institutional sort of politics.

377
00:25:12,064 --> 00:25:17,887
So one of the key issues of building inclusive spaces is asking yourself how open your culture

378
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:19,047
is to marginalized folk.

379
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,008
So in some ways...

380
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:24,935
Think about how you can recruit a more diverse faculty.

381
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:29,057
My institution, for example, has job openings that are specifically targeted at people of

382
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:31,277
color and indigenous faculty members.

383
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:35,839
And that's really to address some of the gaps that we have between a sort of student body

384
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,401
that's sort of 60% racialized and a faculty group, which unfortunately, like me, is largely

385
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:40,761
white.

386
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:46,123
So we're really interested in trying to sort of push back against that type of sort of

387
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:48,243
like dominance and against that norm.

388
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:52,766
Think about, and this is something I heard in the presentation earlier today, think about

389
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:53,347
scholarships.

390
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:57,310
You know, how can you explicitly reach out to the minorities you want to attract to your

391
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,372
classrooms, but it's not sufficient to just attract them.

392
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,974
You have to think about the environment and the setting within which they're welcome.

393
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:08,639
So a diverse cohort of students helps create a more inclusive learning environment.

394
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:13,663
So when you're looking at applications, look beyond the standard requirements for entry

395
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:14,003
level.

396
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,805
It might be somebody who's interested in coming to your course who has a…

397
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:25,648
a life experience that will enrich the cohort. So try to recruit a diverse student body in

398
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:32,314
the same way as you would aim to recruit a diverse faculty group.

399
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:41,142
Then thinking further up the hierarchy we have how we engage with our institutions.

400
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:48,638
Be very vocal, if you have the privilege I have, in faculty meetings about things that

401
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:51,461
are acceptable and unacceptable across your institution.

402
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:57,168
We have the agency to create the environment within which we want to work, and it's our

403
00:26:57,208 --> 00:27:00,472
responsibility as faculty to create that context.

404
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,874
Now, it's not that they're...

405
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,633
It's not that this is ever an end, a sort of a finished game.

406
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:10,056
It's important for me to sort of recognize

407
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,239
that all of this is a process.

408
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:16,982
So if you're having challenges within your faculty group,

409
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,123
within your institution,

410
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:20,926
opening up to more diverse approaches,

411
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,128
then think about providing learning opportunities

412
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,491
for your colleagues to engage with more feminist approaches.

413
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:28,853
Make sure that you review progress.

414
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:33,958
and measure yourself and your institution against your own targets to see how you're

415
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:36,981
succeeding and where you're failing and then focus your attention on that.

416
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:41,886
So we have responsibility to our students, but we also have responsibility to our institutions

417
00:27:41,946 --> 00:27:43,868
to make them safer spaces.

418
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,372
There's no such thing as a safe space, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't push towards

419
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,173
safer spaces.

420
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:52,778
So reach beyond institutional walls to build partnerships outside the institution.

421
00:27:53,163 --> 00:27:58,527
As somebody who's worked in industry and is also an academic, I would suggest that our

422
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:06,672
student experience is enriched by that feedback in and out of our institutions.

423
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:12,716
So volunteer, engage in community work, whether it's offering free workshops, event support,

424
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:16,198
access to equipment or expertise, I have the privilege of equipment.

425
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:21,101
As much as I can, I try and open up the doors to my research lab to community members to

426
00:28:21,141 --> 00:28:22,242
come and use the equipment.

427
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:24,228
free and

428
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:26,255
in an accessible manner as possible.

429
00:28:26,696 --> 00:28:28,977
Now that's something which benefits local community.

430
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:31,279
Benefiting the local community benefits my students.

431
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,683
So think about opening and partnering with local schools

432
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:38,985
to offer sort of free workshops and educational initiatives

433
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:41,087
into your sort of school settings.

434
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:42,908
And that's something which works towards

435
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:44,229
opening up the pipeline,

436
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,411
so that you have a more diverse entry point.

437
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:48,512
Think about how you can engage students

438
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:50,454
in said community initiatives.

439
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:52,475
And in some ways that sort of brings us back

440
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:54,176
to the classroom, which is.

441
00:28:55,685 --> 00:29:00,910
Invite local developers, specifically indie developers and artists, to teach in your program

442
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,412
and importantly pay them.

443
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:10,459
It helps them survive to continue doing the wonderful work that we all celebrate here

444
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:16,624
at events like this, but it also ensures that there's up-to-date expertise with your student

445
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:17,485
group and student body.

446
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:24,736
I hope that what I've done with this diagram, and I have many fewer slides and many less

447
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,739
art skills than some of my sort of colleagues here, has shown how...

448
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:35,496
how we're attempting to sort of build an ecosystem that sort of feeds into a more inclusive sort

449
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:36,436
of classroom space.

450
00:29:36,756 --> 00:29:39,798
So I'd suggest that this can be seen as a diversity ecosystem.

451
00:29:40,418 --> 00:29:46,121
And just as I finish, I would just like to remind us all to use your privilege.

452
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:47,081
We all have it.

453
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:48,522
We're all privileged enough to be here.

454
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:49,802
Think about how you can use it.

455
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:50,403
Thank you.

456
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:06,243
Hi, I am Bonnie Rueberg.

457
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:11,065
I am a postdoc at USC and assistant professor at UC Irvine.

458
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:14,888
This talk is called Teaching Students to Make Socially Aware Games.

459
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:19,831
And a heads up, it's going to involve a lot of me talking quickly, involves photos of

460
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:21,792
animals, and it involves feelings.

461
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:23,313
So let's do this.

462
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:26,965
First, a shout out to my colleague Jeff Watson.

463
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:30,586
We proposed this talk together and I'm going to try and do my best to channel my inner

464
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,026
Jeff.

465
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:34,767
It used to be that GDC soapbox talks were called rants.

466
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:38,368
Soapbox sounds friendlier and less angry, right?

467
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:42,429
Look here are some adorable Victorian children standing on soapboxes.

468
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:44,249
That one has a kitten.

469
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,090
Screw that kitten.

470
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,170
This is a rant.

471
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,272
I am angry and you should be too.

472
00:30:56,292 --> 00:31:01,174
By the way, when you Google image search angry people, you get women hitting men with frying

473
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:01,655
pans.

474
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,556
That's some gender nonsense.

475
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:05,176
Here is the Queen of England.

476
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,877
Apparently people think she looks angry.

477
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:08,038
Good for her.

478
00:31:09,592 --> 00:31:11,272
So, why am I angry?

479
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:13,473
The world is in flames.

480
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:17,574
Higher education, the arts, and knowledge itself are all under attack.

481
00:31:18,074 --> 00:31:23,236
This country and many around the world are rapidly becoming drastically less safe for

482
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:24,356
people who are different.

483
00:31:24,837 --> 00:31:29,198
Women, LGBT people, people of color, immigrants, and people of different religions.

484
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:31,959
If that fills you with rage, good.

485
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:34,380
Rage is how the body resists.

486
00:31:35,384 --> 00:31:37,906
Here's a quote from black feminist activist Audrey Lorde.

487
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:41,268
She was writing in 1981, but this totally applies today.

488
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:44,331
A well-stocked arsenal of anger is a useful tool

489
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:47,113
against those oppressions, personal and institutional,

490
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,374
which brought that anger into being.

491
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:52,877
Okay, so the world's on fire and we're angry.

492
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:54,538
Let's talk about games education.

493
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:58,077
Games education is in a period of rapid growth, right?

494
00:31:58,117 --> 00:31:58,737
We know that.

495
00:31:59,158 --> 00:32:00,759
Established programs are getting bigger,

496
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,881
new game programs are starting all the time.

497
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,624
This is the key moment for laying the groundwork

498
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:08,585
that will shape what games education looks like

499
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:09,686
for decades to come.

500
00:32:10,146 --> 00:32:11,448
Here's where the ranting starts.

501
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:17,479
So I told you this was called Teaching Students to Make Socially Aware Games, but a more fitting

502
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:23,004
title might be something like, Video Games are Expressions of Culture, God Damn It, and

503
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:28,730
it's ethically irresponsible of us, as educators and human beings, especially given the garbage

504
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:34,495
fire that is politics today, to send our students out into the world without teaching them to

505
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:35,336
think about the fact.

506
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:39,177
that the work they produce exists in a broader social context,

507
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,858
like, to seriously think about that and actually care.

508
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:50,360
Applause

509
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,861
Or, if you want a snappier title, let's just go with

510
00:32:52,981 --> 00:32:55,142
Teaching Students to Make Games Under Fascism.

511
00:32:57,222 --> 00:33:00,623
So, even with all the wonderful things that we're accomplishing

512
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:04,325
in games education today, I want to tell you that it is not enough.

513
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,271
It's not enough to produce great developers with top technical skills.

514
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,832
It's not enough to graduate students with polished portfolios who land industry jobs.

515
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:16,092
It's not enough to teach students to make games.

516
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:18,373
They need to know that games have meaning.

517
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:24,534
They need to learn to make games that don't just replicate all the things that are already wrong with video games, right?

518
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:28,414
All those implicit and explicit biases that we see all around us.

519
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:30,795
Whether our students like it or not,

520
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:34,315
the games they make influence and are influenced by culture.

521
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,034
And they need to know that.

522
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:42,095
A lot of them have grown up in these online games cultures that perpetuate this really

523
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:47,856
profound misconception that because video games are fun, that means they're just for

524
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:48,176
fun.

525
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:53,418
And they think that games exist in this apolitical vacuum and that when we think about them as

526
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:57,659
expressions of culture, that's just for so-called social justice warriors.

527
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:01,019
But we in this room, we know better than that.

528
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,841
We know that the games that we make and our students make, it represents something that

529
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:07,061
really matters in the world.

530
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:12,542
And in my experience, once students enter the classroom, some of them can be shaken

531
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,023
of this misconception quickly.

532
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:18,184
Usually these are students who are women or queer people or people of color or people

533
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,065
with disabilities.

534
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:22,946
They're the students who don't have the privilege of pretending, like they don't

535
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:24,646
see the discrimination in games.

536
00:34:25,247 --> 00:34:30,488
And they don't see how these larger forces of society and power can be a force of change,

537
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,348
right, through games.

538
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,150
And these are just some of my amazing USC students being amazing.

539
00:34:36,192 --> 00:34:40,916
But there are other students who respond to this idea that games and game design have social meaning with indignation.

540
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:46,800
So I recently gave a talk to a class of first-years that included a discussion of colonialist themes in No Man's Sky.

541
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:51,084
Two students stood up and stormed out.

542
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:54,747
The remaining 48 engaged in a lively debate.

543
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:57,769
So I say let those two walk out.

544
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:04,354
Let them see that no amount of arm-crossing and dramatic groaning can bully us into sanitizing their games education.

545
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:10,691
We have an ethical imperative to shape our students into creators who are, at the very

546
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:14,773
least, aware of how social issues intersect with their games.

547
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:20,156
And I'm not arguing that our students should only be making serious games or games for

548
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:20,636
change.

549
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:25,798
I mean, by all means, have them make cute games or strange games or even violent games.

550
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:27,279
And this, by the way, is...

551
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:32,179
This is a permanent exercise we did in class the day after the election, where we were

552
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:36,562
working on self-care by making these strange, silly little sticky note comics.

553
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:42,025
But even when students make games like that, these silly games or violent games, they need

554
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,006
to be asking themselves the right questions.

555
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:48,208
They need to ask themselves questions like, who am I representing in my game?

556
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,630
What values does this game communicate?

557
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:52,424
So here's an example.

558
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:57,470
Three different undergraduate teams in three different programs made three different 2D

559
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,693
side-scrollers and they were all in some way about gender.

560
00:36:01,414 --> 00:36:02,475
Which sounds great, right?

561
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:07,640
So the first one is a game about navigating childhood social situations as a non-binary

562
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,040
person.

563
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:13,826
The second one is about gay men at a sit-in in 1960s Los Angeles and they're fighting

564
00:36:13,886 --> 00:36:15,108
off the police by kissing.

565
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:20,197
And the third one, which I'm not going to show you a screenshot of, is about shooting

566
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:24,263
women in bikinis who happen to have the faces of famous feminist authors.

567
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,688
Which one of these games is not like the others?

568
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,470
It's this one.

569
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:31,022
Sorry, Corgis.

570
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:35,904
The students who made this feminist in bikinis game, they weren't trying to be misogynistic.

571
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:37,064
They were trying to be funny.

572
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:40,125
In fact, on paper, they did a good job.

573
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,807
And they successfully demonstrated technical skills and teamwork.

574
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:48,568
And now, on their portfolios, when they show them to potential employers, they have a game

575
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:50,929
that is well-developed and tone deaf as hell.

576
00:36:52,114 --> 00:36:56,457
These students needed someone to step in and say, hey, this is why this is not going to

577
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:56,837
fly.

578
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,820
They needed more courses that explicitly linked games and society.

579
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,742
They needed more opportunities to practice analyzing games, not because they're going

580
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:09,605
to go off and become scholars per se, but because they need to be better critical thinkers.

581
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:14,969
They need to understand why they're making what they're making and what messages it sends.

582
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,932
And then, if they still want to be dicks, they can be dicks on purpose.

583
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:25,183
This is not a one-time issue or an unlikely edge case, right?

584
00:37:25,463 --> 00:37:29,284
Socially unaware games are being made in our games programs every day.

585
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:30,704
So what can we do about it?

586
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:33,005
First, we lead by example.

587
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:36,005
We accept that video games are political,

588
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:38,966
that the way that we make video games is political,

589
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:43,447
and that the way that we teach students to make video games is political.

590
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:46,408
That's true regardless of our personal politics

591
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:48,228
or the personal politics of our students.

592
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:49,788
That is just true.

593
00:37:51,106 --> 00:37:55,890
We speak candidly about the social and ethical challenges that we face in our own creative

594
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,491
practices.

595
00:37:56,891 --> 00:38:00,654
We participate in the cultures of our departments and build constructive dialogue.

596
00:38:00,994 --> 00:38:05,158
We become active advocates and not just well-intentioned allies.

597
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:11,463
So I know lots of wonderful games faculty, people who I really admire, who say, I don't

598
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,345
bring politics into my classroom.

599
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:14,766
Guess what?

600
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,992
Politics are already in your classroom.

601
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:23,457
Identity and culture and the risk of reinforcing oppression and the power to do social good,

602
00:38:23,857 --> 00:38:25,679
those are already in your classroom.

603
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,483
They're in the transgender student who is too distracted to pay attention to your lesson

604
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:31,444
on level design.

605
00:38:31,864 --> 00:38:35,966
Because they're frantically searching for information about how to get their gender legally changed

606
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:39,567
before new anti-LGBT legislation sets in, right?

607
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:44,489
They're the Muslim students who can't travel with your team, with their team to show off their game

608
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,310
because they're afraid of being harassed by the TSA.

609
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,650
Or they're in these subtler moments, right?

610
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,052
Like maybe a student who's on the autism spectrum who's uncomfortable speaking out in large groups

611
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,893
and can't figure out how to make themselves heard in a room full of outspoken...

612
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:03,419
Pedagogy is one thing we can do, and it's something we can all do right now.

613
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,643
We can give readings like Values at Play in digital games.

614
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:10,387
We can assign videos from the advocacy track in the GDC vault.

615
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:14,792
One of my students' favorites is Todd Harper's portrayals and pitfalls of fatness in games,

616
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:17,035
to name just a few examples.

617
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:22,817
We can share articles about how playing Pokemon Go can put black men's lives in danger, or

618
00:39:22,857 --> 00:39:28,878
about how using mental illness as a game mechanic can make for good design, but socially irresponsible

619
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:29,598
game making.

620
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:34,899
We can have our students play games like LIM or Assassin's Creed, which are games that

621
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,660
use design to explore racial or gender passing.

622
00:39:38,597 --> 00:39:41,137
And we need to do these things like was already set up here,

623
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,538
early and often.

624
00:39:43,158 --> 00:39:45,098
Teaching students to make socially aware games

625
00:39:45,238 --> 00:39:47,339
isn't a challenge that's solvable with just one

626
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:48,739
lecture or just one course.

627
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,920
The design and development of games

628
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,021
can't be separated from culture, and students

629
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:55,081
need to learn that from the very beginning.

630
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:58,822
I know that revamping a games program or even a single course

631
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:01,083
is difficult. I'm part of the team at UCI

632
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:03,223
that is revamping the games major as we speak.

633
00:40:03,663 --> 00:40:06,084
And I totally recognize that sometimes we

634
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:07,945
have to prioritize what's mission critical.

635
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:10,675
This is mission critical.

636
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,076
Our students need this.

637
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:15,857
Socially aware students make better games.

638
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:19,939
They make this work that they can be proud to share throughout their career because it's

639
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:21,319
thoughtful and well informed.

640
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,420
The games industry needs this.

641
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,341
Our students are the next generation of developers.

642
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:30,242
They're the ones who can bring change to video games and make them more inclusive.

643
00:40:31,418 --> 00:40:32,779
And you know what? We need this.

644
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,542
There's never been a more crucial moment to train our students to be politically engaged citizens.

645
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:43,044
They're struggling with their place in the world today, and we are struggling too.

646
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:49,128
This is not the time to pretend like the craft of game making stands separate from those struggles.

647
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:52,009
This is a time to get angry.

648
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:57,852
A time to challenge our students, to empower them, and to teach them to design hope.

649
00:40:59,013 --> 00:40:59,213
Thank you.

650
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,750
Well, that was awesome. Thanks, Bonnie.

651
00:41:18,636 --> 00:41:19,337
Excuse me.

652
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:29,532
Hi, my name is Marcelo Viana.

653
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,634
I am originally from Brazil,

654
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:34,436
but I've been in California since 2002.

655
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:38,399
Currently, I work at UC Santa Cruz

656
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,641
and in the Santa Cruz County area teaching.

657
00:41:42,403 --> 00:41:43,804
And I want to talk to you today

658
00:41:43,864 --> 00:41:45,765
about why student autonomy matters.

659
00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:50,009
I want to start with a pretty basic question,

660
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,230
so indulge me for a second.

661
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:54,152
What is the purpose of education?

662
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,801
We don't usually spend much time thinking about this question.

663
00:41:57,922 --> 00:42:01,504
It seems sort of broad and basic, almost silly to even consider.

664
00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:06,868
But to better address my topic, I'll need to take a step back first before we can move forward.

665
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:11,411
To American philosopher and educator John Dewey,

666
00:42:11,611 --> 00:42:14,413
the goal of education is the creation of power of self-control.

667
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:18,656
But by self-control, Dewey meant the ability to free oneself from external

668
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:24,539
and more importantly internal control, the kind that our own habits of thought impose upon us.

669
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:29,573
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speaking in 1947 said,

670
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:31,634
the function of education is to teach one

671
00:42:31,694 --> 00:42:33,876
to think intensively and to think critically,

672
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:36,958
which is a widely accepted view of education.

673
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:43,112
Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, perhaps the most influential thinker on the topic

674
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:48,076
in the late 20th century, argued for a democratic practice of education that liberates the individual

675
00:42:48,096 --> 00:42:53,842
from all forms of domination, a process of self-actualization that empowers them to act

676
00:42:53,922 --> 00:42:55,344
upon and change the world.

677
00:42:56,698 --> 00:43:02,523
To author and educator Bell Hooks, education should develop an engaged and critical consciousness.

678
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:08,226
To her, the role of teachers is not to merely share information, but to share in the intellectual

679
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:09,928
and spiritual growth of our students.

680
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:15,672
The common thread between these examples is a focus on education as a process that nurtures

681
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:19,835
critical thinking, allowing us to better understand the world and our place in it.

682
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:25,410
But today to say that education must foster critical thinking is a cliche.

683
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,692
It is repeated so often as to be completely erased of meaning.

684
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:33,697
It's, and when we do, it's a truism, and we take it for granted

685
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:35,658
as if it's a self-evident truth.

686
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:39,802
But when we do that, it loses its original power.

687
00:43:40,382 --> 00:43:44,906
To remain true, it must be constantly renewed and made integral part of our practices day

688
00:43:44,946 --> 00:43:46,307
after day, year after year.

689
00:43:47,962 --> 00:43:50,863
When we teach games, especially at high school and undergraduate levels,

690
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,203
we tend to fall into this trap.

691
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,504
I think we make one of two assumptions.

692
00:43:55,904 --> 00:43:58,825
One, it's not our job to worry about critical thinking.

693
00:43:59,265 --> 00:44:00,065
We just teach games.

694
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:04,007
Or that by learning how to make games and think about games,

695
00:44:04,047 --> 00:44:06,428
our students will be able to, in the words of Dr. King,

696
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:09,989
think intensively and think critically about the world and their place in it.

697
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:12,870
But it might be useful to look at what he said next.

698
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,602
The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically,

699
00:44:18,702 --> 00:44:23,605
but education which stops at efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society.

700
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:28,187
The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reasons but no morals.

701
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:30,588
We must remember that intelligence is not enough.

702
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,731
Intelligence plus character, that is the goal of true education.

703
00:44:35,893 --> 00:44:40,437
I wanted to revisit these ideas today because for many of us, and especially for our students,

704
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,979
this is a time of crisis, of definition.

705
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,602
If you teach mostly marginalized students, you know this all too well.

706
00:44:47,202 --> 00:44:50,965
This is a good time to renew our commitments and reexamine our practices.

707
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:56,009
Instead of finding a way forward in education, our students are now stuck with a system that

708
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:02,054
seems entirely uninterested in the formation of what Dr. King called character, what we

709
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:03,035
might call citizenship.

710
00:45:03,675 --> 00:45:06,237
and treats education simply as a path to employment.

711
00:45:06,697 --> 00:45:08,858
Nothing more, everything else is a distraction.

712
00:45:09,598 --> 00:45:11,679
Career development is fine, people need to eat,

713
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,682
but I think when we see our work in those limited terms,

714
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:18,103
we tacitly accept an impoverished role

715
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:19,904
and limit our students' imagination

716
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:21,605
and constrain their possibilities.

717
00:45:22,765 --> 00:45:26,848
So if we accept a broader definition of education that includes critical thinking,

718
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:31,130
how do we reconcile it with teaching an ever-evolving array of game-making skills,

719
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:33,892
a job that is daunting enough by itself?

720
00:45:35,353 --> 00:45:39,636
To do so, I believe that we must not only look at the content of our courses, but

721
00:45:39,676 --> 00:45:42,978
also incorporate a serious discussion of the way that we practice teaching.

722
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:48,412
In other words, we have to look at not only what we teach, but how we teach.

723
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:54,256
In my view, student autonomy is an essential component to a critical education experience.

724
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:59,341
My favorite definition of autonomy is the inner endorsement of one's actions.

725
00:45:59,861 --> 00:46:04,064
In an autonomous classroom, the teacher treats students as equals, listens to them, learns

726
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:08,388
from them, and adapts the curriculum to their backgrounds and interests instead of delivering

727
00:46:08,448 --> 00:46:09,449
a static curriculum.

728
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:15,412
to an obedient classroom, treating students as empty vessels to be filled with knowledge.

729
00:46:16,032 --> 00:46:21,395
This is not an indictment of lectures, I'm giving one right now, but they have their

730
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:21,755
purpose.

731
00:46:22,175 --> 00:46:26,377
But it's also not a manifesto for a kinder, gentler form of education.

732
00:46:26,737 --> 00:46:30,319
Kindness and respect are essential, they're not enough.

733
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:36,582
I'm talking about a deeper, more fundamental reimagining of our roles and changing the

734
00:46:36,642 --> 00:46:38,343
structure that we create in our classrooms.

735
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,712
the form of power that we exert.

736
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:44,796
Here's a simplified comparison of the autonomous

737
00:46:44,816 --> 00:46:45,757
and the traditional model.

738
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:48,059
In an autonomous classroom, students

739
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:50,541
are self-motivated as opposed to externally motivated.

740
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:52,543
They're engaged, not obedient.

741
00:46:53,064 --> 00:46:54,886
They feel challenged, not directed.

742
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:57,388
Their interests are integrated into the curriculum

743
00:46:57,528 --> 00:46:58,309
and not ignored.

744
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,251
They make choices.

745
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:02,813
They don't only obediently respond to requests.

746
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:08,926
There are a variety of approaches to an autonomy fostering education, and how you implement

747
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:11,788
it will depend on your specific context.

748
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:14,951
These are some general principles that I use in my classroom.

749
00:47:16,372 --> 00:47:21,016
Encourage your students to question the curriculum, adapt it to their interests and background,

750
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:26,041
help them teach each other, and provide a rationale for your assignments, listen to

751
00:47:26,081 --> 00:47:27,242
them, learn from them.

752
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:30,445
This is probably the most important part of this model.

753
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:35,427
I often teach after-school courses for at-risk teenagers.

754
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:39,670
I get them when they're tired, hungry, and have just spent their entire day in the most

755
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,352
soul-deadening environment they know, school.

756
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:49,797
In fact, when I ask them to design games based on school, the most common theme they come

757
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:50,738
up with is prison.

758
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:55,994
And yet, when I teach with these principals, I don't have to offer incentives or school

759
00:47:56,034 --> 00:47:57,496
them to show up and do the work.

760
00:47:57,676 --> 00:47:58,197
They just do.

761
00:47:58,857 --> 00:48:04,183
When they slack off or look bored, I read it as a flaw in my teaching, and I break down

762
00:48:04,223 --> 00:48:04,824
in process.

763
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:08,387
The tendency for us in these situations is to tighten our grip.

764
00:48:09,188 --> 00:48:09,949
That's a mistake.

765
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,173
Excessive control may be causing the issue in the first place.

766
00:48:14,803 --> 00:48:17,906
We have to remember that compliance is not the same as engagement.

767
00:48:18,686 --> 00:48:23,270
A quiet, obedient classroom may be doing the work, but it does not mean that learning is

768
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:23,851
taking place.

769
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:26,894
A loud, messy classroom is nothing to be scared of.

770
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:28,555
What I'm scared of is boredom.

771
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,400
Implementing this approach will also benefit their careers.

772
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,441
I don't think that we necessarily have to justify

773
00:48:37,201 --> 00:48:39,082
this methodology with these metrics,

774
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:41,422
but research does show that this model

775
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:42,783
is significantly more effective

776
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:44,543
in developing non-cognitive skills,

777
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:47,404
such as self-initiative, grit, self-control, et cetera,

778
00:48:47,784 --> 00:48:49,424
when compared to the traditional model.

779
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,365
These skills will serve them

780
00:48:51,505 --> 00:48:53,225
whether they go into the AAA world,

781
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:55,006
decide to go the indie route,

782
00:48:55,186 --> 00:48:56,546
or choose to do something else entirely.

783
00:48:57,366 --> 00:49:00,027
But this work has other important consequences as well.

784
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,269
If students spend month after month, year after year,

785
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:06,790
in environments that teach obedience and passivity

786
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,911
and punish them when they question authority,

787
00:49:09,372 --> 00:49:12,413
we are implicitly teaching them to value assimilation

788
00:49:12,473 --> 00:49:14,694
over difference, to be afraid of dissent,

789
00:49:15,214 --> 00:49:16,915
and to look for safety and conformity.

790
00:49:17,856 --> 00:49:19,877
Or they will look at us as role models

791
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:21,738
and seek to emulate our authority

792
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:23,939
over mutual understanding,

793
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,780
believing that control is what guarantees success.

794
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:29,937
Content is key, but so is practice.

795
00:49:30,597 --> 00:49:32,538
Teach an inclusive and diverse curriculum,

796
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,858
but do so in a controlling, coercive way,

797
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,579
and your students will feel it.

798
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:38,519
And they will show it by rebelling

799
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:40,239
with the only tools available to them,

800
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:43,960
inattentiveness, disruptive behavior, boredom, et cetera.

801
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,961
Like James Baldwin once said,

802
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:48,281
I can't believe what you say because I see what you do.

803
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:53,122
This is especially more relevant for students

804
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:55,203
from traditionally marginalized backgrounds.

805
00:49:56,163 --> 00:50:00,766
In an industry that is three-quarters white and still, despite recent progress, overwhelmingly

806
00:50:00,826 --> 00:50:05,549
male, asking our students to conform and learn how to play the game, to learn how to better

807
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:09,932
address the needs of employers who are, again, overwhelmingly straight, white, and male,

808
00:50:10,372 --> 00:50:14,695
is to ask them to conform to habits and norms that were not created for them or by people

809
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:16,356
who look and think like them.

810
00:50:16,996 --> 00:50:21,239
We are unwillingly asking our marginalized students to abandon who they are and assimilate.

811
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,520
Culture and background matter.

812
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,302
Instead, we have to support them to arrive

813
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:28,623
at their game-making practice

814
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:30,504
from their own particular starting points,

815
00:50:31,024 --> 00:50:33,666
much like the pioneers of this industry did decades ago

816
00:50:34,006 --> 00:50:35,747
and many independent developers are doing today.

817
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:37,528
By acting with autonomy,

818
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:39,249
they're creating a culture from the ground up.

819
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,305
We must create the space for them to write the rules of the game,

820
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:45,885
not just learn how to play it.

821
00:50:46,686 --> 00:50:50,207
And it begins with abandoning the idea that our only job as educators

822
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,848
is to turn students into more employable, better-disciplined people.

823
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,828
Education is not job training.

824
00:50:57,209 --> 00:50:58,649
Education is much more.

825
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,886
Games are not just an industry.

826
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,786
Games are much, much more.

827
00:51:04,486 --> 00:51:07,147
Games and education are incredibly powerful forces

828
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:07,747
in society.

829
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,067
We shape culture, and we can change minds.

830
00:51:10,727 --> 00:51:14,268
The only question is whether we'll just obediently

831
00:51:14,348 --> 00:51:17,168
replicate dominant ideologies or challenge them.

832
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:21,089
It's hard work, but I'd argue that a truly democratic

833
00:51:21,149 --> 00:51:22,950
education is necessary, especially

834
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:25,470
in the strange and dangerous world we live in today.

835
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:26,890
Thank you.

836
00:51:34,022 --> 00:51:37,622
So I think we have a few minutes for a couple of questions if anybody wants to direct a

837
00:51:37,682 --> 00:51:39,242
question at any one of the speakers.

838
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:42,223
Just step up to the mic if you have a question.

839
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:49,804
Or maybe you're just stunned and taken aback by all the wisdom that was spouted here.

840
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:57,025
Well if you are, I want to encourage you to do something which is submit to this venue.

841
00:51:57,706 --> 00:52:01,726
There were a lot of people who raised their hands this morning that this was their first

842
00:52:01,766 --> 00:52:02,886
game education summit.

843
00:52:03,668 --> 00:52:08,651
We are the people who create this summit, so if you have a burning passion you want to talk about next year,

844
00:52:09,112 --> 00:52:13,075
you can choose Soapbox as a category of submission, so just know that.

845
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:16,117
You can come up here next year and get something off your chest as well.

846
00:52:16,257 --> 00:52:17,077
Here comes the question.

847
00:52:18,158 --> 00:52:20,540
So it's more of an additional thought than a question.

848
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:26,904
So to the presenter who was talking about using the bad games,

849
00:52:26,924 --> 00:52:31,308
the, and bad with a capital B, not a lousy game, but a bad game.

850
00:52:33,226 --> 00:52:39,648
I found that one way in through the ethics for kids who don't actually have that in them to begin

851
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:48,831
with is also about commerce and business. I had a student who pitched a game because he

852
00:52:48,851 --> 00:52:53,272
thought it would be cool called Babymancer which was about a game where you had a

853
00:52:53,812 --> 00:52:57,635
I'm an evil magician who is animating dead babies.

854
00:52:57,755 --> 00:53:01,137
So I open up the classes.

855
00:53:01,818 --> 00:53:03,379
What publisher will publish this game?

856
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,623
So it turned into Fluffymancer where they were animating stuffed animals.

857
00:53:10,624 --> 00:53:14,606
It's an open doorway sometimes, especially for people who are concerned that they might...

858
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,065
be bringing politics into the classroom, and though I agree that yes, every classroom is political,

859
00:53:21,225 --> 00:53:24,428
and every game is political, and everything we do is political.

860
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:30,094
But, for people who are nervous, especially in this fabulous moment in time,

861
00:53:30,934 --> 00:53:34,638
by back-dooring it through things that will still reach them,

862
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:37,721
and then going, well, why wouldn't a publisher do that?

863
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:43,025
It's kind of a safety net for those of you who are not gray

864
00:53:43,065 --> 00:53:45,467
bearded old balding full professors who want to be able

865
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:48,169
to do this stuff with a safety net. So I just throw that out

866
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:48,369
there.

867
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:57,956
Hello. Thank you all for the talks. I as a former USC

868
00:53:58,036 --> 00:54:03,200
student I had a question about the feminist shooting game just

869
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,641
because I'm so curious.

870
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:13,105
What I wanted to know was what did it, from your perspective, what did it feel like they

871
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,185
were reacting to?

872
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:20,967
Were they reacting to a moment at the university, a moment in the classroom, a moment in gamer

873
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:23,908
culture or question mark?

874
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,409
What was, were they doing it for the lols?

875
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:31,030
What was motivating this, I don't know, just ridiculous thing?

876
00:54:32,113 --> 00:54:36,555
Yeah, so I should say that I've taught game design in a few different places now and that

877
00:54:36,595 --> 00:54:38,435
game doesn't come out of USC.

878
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:44,298
In a very dorky way, I'm in love with my USC students and they did not produce that game.

879
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:44,798
I think...

880
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:56,813
I think there was a little bit of reactionary pushback to general gender issues in games.

881
00:54:56,833 --> 00:55:01,777
I think there was kind of a sense of, so you want us to include women in games?

882
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:03,899
Well here are some women in our game.

883
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,301
So you think we should be engaged with feminism?

884
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:09,284
Here's some feminism in our games.

885
00:55:09,744 --> 00:55:11,926
But again, it was kind of tongue in cheek, right?

886
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:14,488
It was definitely an all-male team, an all-cis team.

887
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,963
It's, you know, like there's the thought of a, the start of a thought process in there.

888
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:25,507
It just didn't, it needed a lot more guidance to go in a constructive direction.

889
00:55:25,527 --> 00:55:30,530
Got it. Okay. Thank you. And thank you all for the talks. That was just a really interesting one.

890
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:36,194
Yeah, I think I just echo what my peer colleague said.

891
00:55:36,214 --> 00:55:40,558
A really interesting talk and all the subjects that you touched on are fascinating

892
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:43,139
and I will be trying to implement them and take them forward.

893
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:49,381
On my way here to the conference today, I was listening to a podcast and they were talking about something known as sensitivity readers.

894
00:55:49,401 --> 00:55:53,962
I don't know if you've heard that term where you read a book or an upcoming book to see if there's any

895
00:55:54,462 --> 00:55:59,363
insensitivities in there that can be addressed. And as the podcast progressed, they actually,

896
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:04,604
they had an opposing view to this idea of sensitivity readers where they were talking about, okay, well, when does it become censorship?

897
00:56:04,825 --> 00:56:05,065
All right.

898
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:10,649
So I just wanted to get your view on, you know, because that's a great example you give with the bikini game.

899
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:15,693
But one perhaps could argue like, is it segwaying to censorship or how do you play that?

900
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:23,920
I wonder, do you have thoughts on this too? Because this is a question that comes up a lot with feminist pedagogies, just in general.

901
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:30,905
I think there's always an issue of sort of dominance of voice.

902
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:34,789
I think that part of...

903
00:56:37,184 --> 00:56:40,085
It's part of the argument for greater diversity.

904
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:46,467
I think if one particular group made a game like that amidst a wide range of different types of games,

905
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:51,909
there would be a dialogue in the classroom and amongst the different types of games that were made there.

906
00:56:52,169 --> 00:56:56,130
The problem is, is often that type of game is made and sits in isolation.

907
00:56:58,186 --> 00:57:04,089
And what I find is that type of, I haven't had that experience where that type of game

908
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:09,051
has come out, but if it had been proposed in a classroom, it would have made many of

909
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:11,212
my other students feel at risk and uncomfortable.

910
00:57:11,752 --> 00:57:15,614
And it's my classroom, so I have a responsibility.

911
00:57:16,034 --> 00:57:23,677
So I mean, I would tend to err on discussing it and trying to push towards a diversity

912
00:57:23,697 --> 00:57:24,418
of different types of experience.

913
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:24,478
So.

914
00:57:24,498 --> 00:57:25,258
I'm going to go ahead and get started.

915
00:57:25,278 --> 00:57:25,318
So.

916
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:26,538
I'm going to go ahead and get started.

917
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:35,107
The other thing, another way of putting it is if something is violent and abusive then

918
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:37,529
is there a problem of censorship?

919
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,431
You know, do you see what I mean?

920
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:45,095
So it is a delicate issue but part of me would just say I don't want that type of thing

921
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:49,519
in my classroom and I'm not going to accept it in my classroom and that may be well seen

922
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:50,760
as censorship and so be it.

923
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:55,122
Yeah, thank you. I know there are others. So thank you very much for your answers. I give way.

924
00:57:55,302 --> 00:57:59,643
I wanted to just chip in on that and say sometimes bringing up who's your audience is helpful.

925
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:04,925
Like if the audience is the community in the classroom, then that can change how someone thinks about what they're doing.

926
00:58:05,465 --> 00:58:10,506
Yeah, and I think the quick answer I would give to you is setting aside censorship.

927
00:58:10,526 --> 00:58:13,387
That I want my students to make that decision consciously.

928
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:17,708
Like if they want to make that game, I want them to know all the things that it implies.

929
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:26,462
I just want to say thank you. It's lovely to see a discussion of feminist pedagogy and

930
00:58:26,482 --> 00:58:31,405
to see names like Audre Lorde and Bell Hooks and Paula Freire up on the projector here.

931
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:36,849
That's really wonderful and comforting and welcoming. I wanted to ask about, there's

932
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:42,332
a lot of discussion about sort of approaching these things from both kind of the micro and

933
00:58:42,372 --> 00:58:48,717
macro level and how you, you know, might think about ways in which inclusivity or, you know,

934
00:58:48,837 --> 00:58:53,398
You know, creating an atmosphere of inclusion operates in your classroom and at an institutional level.

935
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:58,459
And I wanted to ask everyone here, you know, we all have different levels of privilege within our institution.

936
00:58:58,819 --> 00:59:04,520
And I think a lot of times, you know, women and people of color and queer folks in an institutional context, you know,

937
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:08,321
there's a lot of coercive pressure to sort of toe the line.

938
00:59:08,341 --> 00:59:15,782
And, you know, there also is kind of a danger of, you know, of you're already in a certain amount of, you know,

939
00:59:16,562 --> 00:59:23,345
You're already vulnerable in certain ways, right, as an outlier, and your politics can be something that make you more of a target, right?

940
00:59:23,705 --> 00:59:34,309
So how do people here negotiate, you know, maybe working within an institution that, you know, they want to change, but they also want to keep their job in?

941
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:44,473
I think for me, if I can answer, I am privileged. I have tenure. So it behoves me to try and think about ways I can ally.

942
00:59:45,054 --> 00:59:49,657
with people to be able to, I mean, it's the whole thing of saying, use your privilege.

943
00:59:50,098 --> 00:59:55,422
I spend a lot of time, not necessarily very sort of successfully, trying to think about

944
00:59:55,482 --> 01:00:01,868
ways that I can do that. So I don't think that marginalized folk have to take on all that labor.

945
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:05,711
I think it behoves us as allies to take that labor on ourselves.

946
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:11,043
and to use our privilege to focus on other groups to try and make a better environment

947
01:00:11,063 --> 01:00:11,563
for everybody.

948
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:16,446
So I would say, as somebody who's relatively junior, it's not your job to do that.

949
01:00:16,566 --> 01:00:20,729
As somebody who has tenure, it's my job to think about how I can do that.

950
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:24,131
And so that's one of the ways that I sort of like navigate that particular...

951
01:00:24,592 --> 01:00:33,255
It's sort of like dynamic and that's why I emphasize the ecosystem and the fact that it's how we build and support different types of networks using.

952
01:00:33,575 --> 01:00:46,781
And just thank you for all of your work, right? So one of the things for folk who are in here who don't know sort of Sarah's work and different games work, my institution benefits from your work, you know, so I think that that's something.

953
01:00:46,801 --> 01:00:50,282
So I just want to take the opportunity to thank you publicly for all of your work. It's amazing.

954
01:00:51,703 --> 01:00:51,943
I think.

955
01:00:53,259 --> 01:01:17,440
My answer is I don't know how to do that as junior faculty, but I know that I see my own students, like, there are privileges I lack as junior faculty, I'm not tenured, but I see that my own students, and especially my undergrads, don't have the privilege that I have, right? And I know that I feel like just ethically I can't stand by and watch that responsibility fall on their shoulders. You know, my 18-year-olds who are just

956
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:22,152
Figuring out college, they're people of color, they're queer people, and I don't know.

957
01:01:22,172 --> 01:01:27,813
I might be putting my foot in my mouth or whatever, but I can't let it rest on them.

958
01:01:30,294 --> 01:01:35,135
Unfortunately, we're at 630, but luckily it's the end of the day and the speakers, I'm sure,

959
01:01:35,155 --> 01:01:39,697
are going to migrate for a little while into the speaker area or who knows, perhaps off

960
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:40,897
to dinner or whatever.

961
01:01:40,937 --> 01:01:43,218
But I want to thank everybody for being here.

962
01:01:43,438 --> 01:01:47,559
And again, please submit to the Game Education Summit and have a great rest of the week.

963
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:50,171
Well...
