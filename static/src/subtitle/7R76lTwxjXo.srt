00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:07,310
Hi everyone, welcome today to the GDC Twitch channel. My name is Brian Francis. I am the invisible voice inside your head

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,071
I am here today

3
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:15,593
Joined as always by some of the wonderful folks who make the games that you get to play in your spare time

4
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:18,513
But in the lower left hand corner of the screen, I am joined by Albert

5
00:00:18,513 --> 00:00:25,755
She who is the lead designer on the game. We are checking out today, which is super liminal Albert. How are you doing?

6
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:27,556
Good. Yeah. Hello everyone

7
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:31,284
Yeah, thanks for inviting me to do this.

8
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:31,885
Right on.

9
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:37,167
If you are not familiar with Superliminal, you are probably looking at the screen right

10
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:41,409
now and wondering just exactly what's happening, why am I picking up this cheese.

11
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:46,091
I'm picking up this cheese because I'm going to turn this cheese into the ramp just by

12
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,672
turning around.

13
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:53,734
Superliminal is a puzzle game currently out on the Epic Games Store where it uses your

14
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:56,175
force perspective to change the size of objects or...

15
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:58,877
sometimes the

16
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:04,843
Nature of objects as you can see this cheese has gone from being the size of a hand to the size of a ramp

17
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:11,889
Albert how long have you all been working on this game? And I guess when did you sort of first come up with the idea for it?

18
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:18,375
Yeah, so it's been a while. I think right now it kind of tallies around like six years or so, of course

19
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,157
You know, I haven't been working on it

20
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:27,562
you know full-time the entire time but it began when I was a student and I needed like

21
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:35,066
a student project to do you know for the end of the year um so I just made this like tiny little demo

22
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:40,808
uh you know with just with one mechanic and like three puzzles and and you know a couple years

23
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:45,831
after that we found more people and then more people and finally you know we have a team of six

24
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:50,133
six or seven people uh when we ship the game so yeah

25
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:58,161
Right on. Just for a quick housekeeping check in with chat, we have folks like Christopher Lloyd watching. Thank you for joining us, Chris.

26
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:08,786
We will be taking your questions if you have them for Albert. I guess the first question worth asking is, so how does this perspective mechanic actually work?

27
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:12,809
And how are we able to build it out to fill out all these puzzles?

28
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:17,351
Yeah, so the general idea of, you know, when I explain it is...

29
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:25,510
things are the same size on your screen but in space it actually kind of adapts

30
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,074
to what you know how large it seems to be right and it's all based off the idea of like

31
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:37,460
oh if you pretend to you know pinch the tower of pisa uh it looks like it looks like it should be

32
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,965
you know a certain size and so in this game we just try to fulfill that you know illusion

33
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,073
In-game however how it actually works to keep you consistent is the object that you're grabbing will be as

34
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:54,895
Large as possible and as far as possible as it can always be

35
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:58,017
So it's always you know

36
00:02:58,017 --> 00:03:00,218
It's projected kind of like as far

37
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:04,720
To the distance so if there's a wall behind it

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,883
We'll try to find the point on the wall that you know it will be before it kind of collides with anything

39
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,818
And then just do that mechanic, then people can use that to solve puzzles.

40
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:20,340
And what was the second part to your question?

41
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,821
Oh, I guess.

42
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:23,683
How did you start building out puzzles around this mechanic?

43
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:25,264
Oh, yeah. So that, you know,

44
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:29,288
the kind of history of this project has been a long one.

45
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:33,411
So there was a long process, you know, to get there.

46
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:37,174
But it started out like.

47
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:42,691
there were different phases right like it wasn't um we just started out and

48
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,332
and just kind of went full throttle and just

49
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:49,995
uh did a bunch of stuff i think one of the first big kind of

50
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:54,918
milestones was you know i knew that like this thing called

51
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,019
the sense of wonder night it's like

52
00:03:57,526 --> 00:04:01,447
It's basically similar to the Experimental Gameplay Showcase,

53
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:02,627
but it's at the Tokyo Game Show.

54
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:03,607
I knew that was coming up.

55
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:05,347
I was like, great.

56
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:08,848
What if I try to flesh out this mechanic that

57
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,049
has two puzzles?

58
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:16,850
And so from there, I just tried to think of the wackiest ideas

59
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,950
I could use it for and just made one puzzle each.

60
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,731
And that became a series of things

61
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,452
that then slowly grew and grew.

62
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:33,380
Right on. What was kind of building on that question? What do you think makes a good puzzle?

63
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,102
Like this is such a this is such a mechanic that defies how people think, although it sort of

64
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:43,064
naturally fits into it also naturally fits into how people think, like perceiving the object to

65
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:48,806
be the size it is, as opposed to understanding it's not that size. How did you what was your

66
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:52,468
philosophy for coming up with puzzles? And what do you think makes it interesting to solve puzzles

67
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:53,188
with this mechanic? Yeah, so

68
00:04:56,737 --> 00:05:01,820
I think a lot of that is kind of like based on people's personal taste.

69
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,181
There's a lot of different types of puzzle games.

70
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:11,446
The ones that I found the most interesting was kind of like anti-chamber, you know, puzzle games that were more about

71
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:15,448
seeing something new and trying to think outside the box

72
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:21,331
as opposed to, you know, something, you know, like a sudoku puzzle, right? Which is

73
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:24,033
you know all the mechanics, you know all the elements, but it's more about

74
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:32,709
about mastery, it's more about like a series of steps. So I definitely try to try to focus on

75
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:41,430
finding ways that would give players, you know, different types of epiphanies in that sense.

76
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,531
And that's why, you know, if some people play this game they might say like, oh hey, you know,

77
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:51,632
it's not necessarily like scratching like the mastery itch, but there's like a lot of really

78
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:53,513
cool and interesting stuff in it. So

79
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:57,416
Yeah, that's an interesting response.

80
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,537
The epiphany angle kind of reminds me of Portal 2,

81
00:06:00,537 --> 00:06:02,338
about how you'd sort of be shooting portals at things

82
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:02,878
for a while.

83
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:03,538
Yeah.

84
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:05,319
And I really like, I should have disclosed,

85
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,319
the video we're watching today,

86
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,860
what we're looking at today is not entirely,

87
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,540
it's not live.

88
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,701
I had to pre-record this footage

89
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:13,221
so that we could make this stream happen.

90
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:15,442
But you're gonna get, I like it,

91
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,763
because then we get to watch all the little epiphanies

92
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:19,483
that me yesterday had, like right there,

93
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:22,164
where I discovered that I could actually pick up the sign.

94
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,384
Yeah.

95
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:26,995
Speaking of yeah speaking of portal

96
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:32,560
I think like one of the most interesting parts of portal one that you know I was like wow this is really cool

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,422
Is when you realize momentum works through portals, right?

98
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:42,767
Yeah, so like that's the kind of thing that we're like, you know, can can we repeat this? Is it even possible to do?

99
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:46,150
and and that's what we try to shoot for so

100
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:47,999
Yeah, it's kind of the same thing here, right?

101
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,279
Like instead of momentum, it's size.

102
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,919
It's instead of momentum, it's size.

103
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,420
Like you, like I can take this little sign

104
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,701
and I can make it big and I can make it small.

105
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,421
And that's what lets me solve the puzzle

106
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,761
we're looking at right here.

107
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:06,682
Moving on and just also give me a quick shout out

108
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:09,183
to Yessiman, thanks for dropping by.

109
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:11,003
We'd love to, ooh.

110
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:12,443
Oh, we briefly lost you there, Albert.

111
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:13,103
Are you back?

112
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,776
I was getting some strange noises from Skype, that's fine.

113
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:24,058
Um, uh, uh, Albert, we're gonna see this, we're gonna see this game sort of sca- we're

114
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:28,179
actually approaching an interesting point in the game, which is where the puzzles stop

115
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:31,981
being just sort of test chambers like Portal, and you start to do that Portal-esque thing

116
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:36,022
where you go outside the test chambers and outside the simulated environments and start

117
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,182
solving puzzles in a way that...

118
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:42,305
sort of feel like you're breaking the game, you're quote unquote breaking the game,

119
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:45,688
even though you're not, you know, you're just solving the puzzle, the puzzle is just now

120
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:50,251
outside the narrative space a bit. How do you, did you notice anything while designing these

121
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:55,014
particular puzzles about how players approach them and if they struggled in any specific way

122
00:07:55,014 --> 00:08:01,658
with when the puzzles began sort of to not be, I guess, presented in the same kind of structure?

123
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:03,819
Yeah, I think it's definitely,

124
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:12,418
I think it helps with this game because there's so many weird things we try to do even early on.

125
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:15,880
So and also I think there's part of kind of the shared language, right?

126
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,642
Like people have played Portal and other weird games like this.

127
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:27,387
So when usually they see this, they're not like, oh, this is like, I'm totally confused. They're more like, oh,

128
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:31,429
yeah, I knew something was coming, you know.

129
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,811
But I think in general in games as long as you kind of set up

130
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:36,830
uh...

131
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,012
expectation you can get away with anything

132
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:41,594
uh... you know some people say in puzzle games like

133
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:46,277
a lot of people talk about like oh how difficult should a

134
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:49,740
puzzle game be but i really think it depends on kind of

135
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,521
what expectations you set right like

136
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:56,365
in dark souls is a very difficult game but if you know that going in and if

137
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:57,706
everything about the game tells you that

138
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:02,130
this is going to be a hard game then you get used to that and and you're not

139
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:09,721
you don't feel that sense of like unfairness right so i think similarly with any type of puzzle game

140
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:14,347
as long as you set the expectations correctly and you say things are going to be weird or like oh

141
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:18,152
you have to you know think outside the box a lot then uh

142
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,068
It won't seem as jarring when you do weird things.

143
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:23,489
If that makes sense.

144
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:29,933
It's kind of the difference between an epiphany-driven game like this and a, you mentioned a Sudoku

145
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:34,917
puzzle game, like if you imagine an app for Sudoku games or like even a match-three puzzler,

146
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:41,522
those are sort of in very constrained environments where you're trying to use the tools you have

147
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,544
to solve a new kind of a puzzle you already know.

148
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:44,444
But in this game...

149
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:49,546
The environments are not constrained. They aren't just like they're set pieces, but they're not

150
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:52,747
You're sort of not

151
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:56,568
Always told that there's just one way out I guess right which is what yeah

152
00:09:56,568 --> 00:10:02,670
What makes easy for players like me here to start solving problems based on that yeah, so to camp for a walk

153
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:09,771
Yeah, one of the things we try to encourage is we want kind of like the space to be interest interesting enough that people

154
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:12,053
we'll want to look around and be like,

155
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:13,153
oh, what is this?

156
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:13,673
What is this?

157
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,595
Is this, you know, part of the puzzle?

158
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:16,615
Is this something, you know?

159
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,277
Because then that, it makes the space feel a lot more,

160
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:21,858
more alive as opposed to just like,

161
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,599
I'm going from point A to point B.

162
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:26,801
I don't need to care about anything between, you know?

163
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:28,562
Like, you're playing around with things here.

164
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,903
You're looking around at different kinds of things.

165
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:33,564
That's why we try to add little surprises

166
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:36,426
or little things that you could discover

167
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:38,707
if you go out of, you know, off the beaten path.

168
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:40,677
Mm-hmm. God these moments really

169
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:47,939
Be right here cuz they're not puzzle moments these minutes. Yes optical illusions. Yeah, how do you how do you even implement this?

170
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:54,080
How do you like use unity and go? Okay. I need this to look real over here, but I need to look really fake over here

171
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,381
Yeah, so it's it's you know, some of this surprisingly simple and some of the hard parts are like

172
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:04,782
surprisingly hard the easy part is if you're just trying to do like a

173
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:08,843
Simple projection that looks like something else you just have a camera

174
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:13,366
stacked on a projector, right? The camera takes the image and the projector spits out the image.

175
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:21,613
The hard part is actually where, you know, like depth is involved. Because the projectors in

176
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:28,338
Unity don't have depth. So we actually have a graphics programmer called Phil who's like

177
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:35,764
really good at this kind of stuff. He basically hacks some kind of light related system that uses

178
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:37,786
shadow maps and whatever.

179
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:44,160
that ends up, you know, taking into account for death and all that.

180
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,865
But that, like, extra step turned out to be much harder than just kind of the original

181
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,226
prototypes we were doing.

182
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:51,707
Yeah.

183
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:53,468
How does the resizing work while I'm at it?

184
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:58,372
I guess, like, what's the, what kind of game logic are you using to make the resizing possible?

185
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:01,695
Yeah, so, so, again, it's like...

186
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:05,793
The easy part seemed hard and the hard part seemed easy.

187
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,494
Uh, the easy part is actually like,

188
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,255
how do things look exactly the same?

189
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:13,516
The rules is surprisingly simple, it's like,

190
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:16,437
if something is twice as far away, it gets twice as big,

191
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:20,318
and then vice versa. And that just, for some reason,

192
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:22,299
you know, with computer and it's like,

193
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:24,200
you know, it's very, uh,

194
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,181
specific math, it just works.

195
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,001
Uh, so...

196
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:33,895
And it's weird, it works in like different FOVs, whatever.

197
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:36,076
I don't know why, but it just does.

198
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:38,478
The hard part is actually finding

199
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:40,339
how far the object should go.

200
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,161
Because if you imagine like you have a very weirdly shaped

201
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:47,183
object, like let's say you have a sponge, right?

202
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,084
And it has tons of holes in it, and maybe you

203
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:51,486
have a background that's really complicated.

204
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,567
And you want to make sure it doesn't kind of clip

205
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:54,768
into any of the background.

206
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:57,990
So we just, it's, we did a lot of trial and error,

207
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,931
and it's just like a very dense.

208
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:06,330
uh layer of raycast that we're doing to more or less estimate where it should land and even if

209
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,714
it's like a little bit off it's a little bit uh closer than it should be it's it's fine but as

210
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:14,076
long as long as it doesn't feel uh unfair

211
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:15,492
Right on.

212
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:17,434
This is a really interesting puzzle right here,

213
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:18,795
and I'm going to be stuck here for a while.

214
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:22,558
But the reason I'm not skipping over this video

215
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:24,820
is the problem-solving process has sort of illuminated

216
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,841
for what I was trying to do.

217
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,443
What's interesting is going on right now

218
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:32,246
is I assumed that there was just an angle I needed

219
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,247
to view the cube at, like the last time I did.

220
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:34,968
But I wasn't.

221
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:37,450
And I thought, I looked up there, and I can see, OK,

222
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,812
one lamp is styled like the box.

223
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:40,593
That must be part of it.

224
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:43,115
And that strange gap over there must be another lamp.

225
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,095
That's all I thought was.

226
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:44,576
Ha ha ha.

227
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:47,957
I wasn't paying attention to how I can see it now. It's clear as day. The lamps are clearly

228
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:48,057
um

229
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:52,978
On the the raised out parts of the walls. I just did not see that when I was playing

230
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:59,299
Um, it's gonna take me a minute for the past me to catch up. But in the meantime, I guess um

231
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,779
Uh, oh god. I just walked right by the solution

232
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,160
Um, I guess in the meantime, um

233
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,381
What happened what in play testing i'm sure moments like this happen on every puzzle

234
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:14,181
Um, what was kind of your approach for and here I am just trying to use the last flute puzzle solution to get through this one

235
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:21,683
What was your response when players would enter moments like this, where they just miss the thing?

236
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:26,686
They make an assumption and they miss something, even though they should not be making that assumption.

237
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:32,309
Yeah, usually I'm actually a little bit happy when players miss the most obvious things.

238
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,610
Because I think that's a good case.

239
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:40,274
Because a player like you, even if you miss it, eventually you'll look around enough that you'll find it, right?

240
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:44,056
I think the opposite case actually is that...

241
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:52,475
when players go in and the room and they immediately figure it out and that is I feel like there's less of a

242
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:57,198
Moment of epiphany there some I'm actually totally happy that like you're you're you know

243
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:03,301
Trying to figure this out and you're taking time even though at the moment. I'm sure

244
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:09,604
You must be to some extent frustrated that you're like why isn't this doing the thing right and a lot of people are like oh

245
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:14,547
You know, is there a bug here or you know, is that supposed to look like like look like that or?

246
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,033
or something that's not supposed to be blocking and actually blocking it.

247
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:24,795
Real quick before I keep going, I'm just going to remind some folks in chat, we'd love to

248
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:26,276
hear your questions for Albert.

249
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:30,758
If you were making puzzle games or if you're making games like this, we want to know what

250
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:35,380
you think, what you're working on, what puzzle challenges you're trying to solve in making

251
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,581
them.

252
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:39,462
Sorry, what were you going to say?

253
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:43,368
Yeah, I'm sorry to like kind of expand on that answer a bit more.

254
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:47,052
I think there are certain things that, you know, we're happy with

255
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:51,997
if the players are kind of exploring as long as it doesn't

256
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:55,900
it doesn't become frustrating to some extent. Right.

257
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,165
And and those things are typically things that seem like they could work,

258
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:01,826
but they don't actually work.

259
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:02,487
So, for example.

260
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,139
if you took that first box and you went to the wall and you tried to get up

261
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:10,020
and if you did that like 40 times because you're like I just need to be a

262
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,383
little bit larger and it almost works like that feels really frustrating but

263
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:19,265
I'm you know I'm glad in this playthrough you took took that single

264
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:21,327
box put it over and you're like I'm not

265
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,668
going to make this jump so I don't even need to think about that

266
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:25,769
yeah and that's the best case scenario you can just

267
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:27,726
start crossing things off your list.

268
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:31,728
Yeah, and it sounds like you learned a lot from your playtesting about

269
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:36,051
like what are acceptable, like failed behaviors I guess.

270
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:44,035
Uh, yeah, um, and it's always kind of fun to see what people get stuck with because sometimes

271
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:47,737
you know you play with a lot and you're like, oh yeah this mechanic totally makes sense but some

272
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:53,480
people you know don't realize you can grab things from afar, that you can project things from afar

273
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,561
and you can

274
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,482
end up realizing that everybody will come with different expectations, so you need some

275
00:17:00,482 --> 00:17:06,345
kind of like, getting process to make sure by a certain point, everybody understands

276
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,645
the basic mechanics.

277
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:12,908
Here's an interesting thought I had while trying to solve this puzzle, is there's a

278
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:16,409
little bit of a clambering mechanic, like I just triggered it there, but it only seems

279
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:21,431
to, after I solved this puzzle, I realized it only seems to be functioning when the game

280
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,992
is trying to like, you know, like...

281
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:27,813
To quote another interview I did like when it's trying to make sure I'm solving the right puzzle, right?

282
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,214
Like it's in a jumping puzzle game. You're not trying to time your jumps

283
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:33,134
The game is just trying to be nice to you when it knows you've done all the work

284
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:38,135
But and here I was trying to abuse the clamber mechanic to get up inside

285
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:46,977
How did you time that out and keep like like your your your your helpful mechanics from interfering with your core gameplay?

286
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:48,078
Yeah, so

287
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:51,598
The way we do is really simple. We have a ruler and

288
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:56,026
in our game engine that we can just pull out and it basically says

289
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,607
You know, this is this is how high your first jump is

290
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:04,048
This is how high your first jump plus like what we call like the mantling mechanic gives you

291
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:08,589
And this is how high like two jumps give you so we know

292
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:14,231
That if there's a ledge that requires, you know, at least two jumps it's high enough that you can't

293
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,646
get up with just one object.

294
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:18,768
And that's mostly like,

295
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:20,609
you know, from our designer, Logan,

296
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:23,952
who kind of implemented that stuff and made sure that

297
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:25,313
we were adhering

298
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,295
to it, you know, pretty carefully.

299
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:29,016
Because, right, because like,

300
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:30,678
you could easily, if it wasn't there, you could easily

301
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,319
like get up there.

302
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,062
The other thing about the mantling system

303
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:36,322
is that

304
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:38,524
I didn't realize it was, you know,

305
00:18:38,524 --> 00:18:40,726
a thing that was required before, but because

306
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:46,201
So usually in puzzle games you want really discrete states, right?

307
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:51,966
And and what that means like you want people to know exactly when you've kind of achieved or failed to state

308
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:59,472
You don't want to keep it ambiguous. So if they get it, they immediately get it. Um, and if they don't they know they're not there

309
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,194
um, what's difficult about

310
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:03,536
a game where you can resize

311
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:07,559
stuff and and then this is something i've also discussed with um,

312
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,121
steve swing because you know

313
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:14,629
he's working on scale, is that it makes, for example,

314
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:16,830
jumping on things much more difficult.

315
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,151
So like in Portal, it's very easy to take one block

316
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:22,572
and know that gives you a certain amount of height, right?

317
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:26,513
But in this game, because scaling is on,

318
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:32,495
and I don't know what you call it, it's on a range.

319
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:35,076
So it means that, you know,

320
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:37,736
your jumping can also feel,

321
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:44,639
uncertain at times, like there's jumps without the mantling, there's jumps that you think you can make but you actually can't.

322
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:50,181
And that just feels bad, right? So that's why in the end we decided that adding this mantling thing

323
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:57,183
would help kind of make the game feel a lot more discreet, help make it more easily understandable

324
00:19:57,183 --> 00:19:58,724
when you solve the puzzle.

325
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:00,092
Yeah.

326
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:01,733
Um, man, there's, I just can't wait.

327
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,153
Now that I'm so happy, I'm so happy we're past that.

328
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:08,775
Cause there's some real puzzles, uh, that I get to, um, uh, show off to the audience.

329
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:13,417
Um, that's really cool that you, uh, are going to talk to Steve Swank about this.

330
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,937
I saw scale at Indiecade a while back.

331
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:17,478
I know he's still working on it.

332
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:18,818
Um, so we're, we're gonna.

333
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,500
Um, how does it, I guess, how is it, what is it like when, um, this is not design related,

334
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,741
I'm sorry, but what is it like to like get to like have someone out there be working on a similar mechanic as you,

335
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:31,362
um, and getting to share notes like that?

336
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:37,504
Yeah, I, I think it's, I think it's really cool and I think it's like, you know, a healthy process and um,

337
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,243
Because a lot of times you're not just dealing with similar kind of design problems like,

338
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:50,246
oh, you know, you're talking about, you know, how to design puzzles.

339
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:52,147
Some other times you're also talking about just like,

340
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:56,029
you know, what kind of art do you want to put in? What kind of story do you want to put in?

341
00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:00,812
How do you make things cohesive? And it does help to have

342
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:06,855
someone to bounce off ideas with that kind of exists in the same space.

343
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:09,297
So like, you know, Steve likes to talk about like,

344
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:16,305
know practices that help you kind of work better you know just in terms of

345
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:21,511
you know he talks about like deliberate practice and stuff like that and which

346
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:22,391
is really interesting so.

347
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:23,181
Man.

348
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:23,361
Yeah.

349
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:23,561
Yeah.

350
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:25,803
This puzzle is also another.

351
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:28,846
It stumps me for a moment, but then it gets super interesting.

352
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:31,648
This puzzle was just so interesting.

353
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:33,490
Especially I'm going to point out there's a red,

354
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,713
there's a window up to the top left that I looked at briefly.

355
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,715
I don't, I later figured out I could make a thing, a platform

356
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,936
to go up there, but I didn't.

357
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:42,518
And I just proceeded onward.

358
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:44,460
And I'm still wondering what's up by that red window.

359
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,084
Because I didn't get to explore it when I was doing this puzzle

360
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:50,425
myself.

361
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:58,891
diving into my question ball pit. First-person games like this, on the one hand, first-person

362
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:03,073
games have been super iterated on. We know a lot of things about making first-person games that we

363
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:10,338
didn't know in 1992, for instance. One of them, which is a big deal for VR, is motion sickness.

364
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:15,542
And I have to confess, I felt a little bit motion sick playing this game. And I think that had to

365
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,904
do with just, you know, the human brain is very dumb.

366
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:23,065
And when things change on us that aren't supposed to change,

367
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:24,565
they start getting weird.

368
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:25,846
What did you all learn about

369
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,626
designing around motion sickness?

370
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:30,106
And did that come up early, later, play testing?

371
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,367
Was it a bigger problem than you expected?

372
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:33,367
I'm just curious about that

373
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,468
just because I got a little bit motion sick.

374
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:39,949
Yeah, I think this is always an interesting question.

375
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:41,749
And then I think one of the big ones

376
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:43,049
that we're actually trying,

377
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:45,010
that we've implemented

378
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,510
that will probably be out in our next patch is...

379
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:52,014
an FOV slider, right? Because a lot of times, you know,

380
00:22:52,014 --> 00:22:56,375
most people's motion sickness also depends on kind of how far

381
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:03,117
they are from the screen and what the FOV is and whether that matches kind of their natural FOV.

382
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:08,539
Besides that, we've tried different things like, because we've also wondered if it's like, oh,

383
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:16,502
there's something related to this game, right? Is it because you're grabbing this item and it's hard to identify whether

384
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:17,502
whether it's

385
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,452
far or close and if that's kind of messing up your brain.

386
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:24,755
One thing we realized that is that adding like a cursor in the middle

387
00:23:24,755 --> 00:23:28,458
actually does help because it helps keep people focused on kind of one point.

388
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,861
At least that's one thing and then the FLV slider as well.

389
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:36,985
Yeah besides that you know we're still kind of trying to

390
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:40,688
figure out what works and what doesn't work. I

391
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:45,471
you know I used to have pretty bad motion sickness but also just like

392
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,233
because I needed to work on this game so much.

393
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:50,211
I kind of like lost a lot of that.

394
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:52,913
So for example, when I play Portal,

395
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:56,396
I would have to stop after every hour or so,

396
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:57,717
take a nap and then go back.

397
00:23:57,717 --> 00:24:03,383
But so part of it I think is somehow like repeat exposure.

398
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:06,385
So I feel like people who haven't played video games

399
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:10,309
also tend to have that to a larger extent

400
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:12,211
or somebody who's like washing over your shoulder.

401
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,687
Man, I love the solution to this puzzle.

402
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:21,148
Because it reminds me of the end of Portal 2.

403
00:24:21,148 --> 00:24:26,310
That's an interesting answer. Let me see.

404
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,151
I'm going to ask about...

405
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:35,013
What have you learned about teaching players? This is an interesting moment because teaching players what can and can't be grabbed.

406
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:37,234
Teaching players what can expand and what can't.

407
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:42,175
You're going to see some interesting variances on this in the next 30 minutes or so.

408
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:46,338
What did you learn about sort of like

409
00:24:46,338 --> 00:24:51,962
About about that teaching process and about helping players like understand the new things they can do with this scaling power

410
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:54,564
Yeah, so there's a and that's a good question

411
00:24:54,564 --> 00:24:59,447
that's actually a kind of design problem that we struggle struggle a lot with right because

412
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:05,111
It's it's in this game in particular that is and this game in a big part is about

413
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:08,693
Thinking outside the box and giving you those kind of unexpected

414
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,314
surprises

415
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:16,397
When you see things, so we try, we also can't do, you know, very obvious things, right?

416
00:25:16,397 --> 00:25:22,459
So, for example, if every gravel item had, you know, a shimmer to it, you know, that would call it out,

417
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:26,580
then that also kind of destroys part of the surprise when you're playing the game.

418
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,922
So, you know, this is the thing we've talked about internally, but in the end, we've tried basically

419
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:39,983
two basic things that together, they kind of help make the problem a little bit better.

420
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:47,596
one of them is is through color right. So there's things in the world that pop

421
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:53,137
out a little bit more, there's things that don't and generally we want people

422
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:58,778
to be able to be like oh that's the thing that's interesting I should be

423
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:02,639
able to interact with it and you know theoretically they should right. So if

424
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:07,100
they see like oh there's a vending machine like we see this a lot it's like

425
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,221
oh there's a vending machine that's really interesting people

426
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:17,037
walk up to the one like press the button so we do let them do that and we've realized that it doesn't really

427
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:19,077
need to be

428
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:25,139
Every item that looks interesting you can grab and resize it just needs to be some like something happens, right?

429
00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:28,640
and if that happens then people are

430
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,700
Satisfied and they know that they've done a thing and kind of reacted to it

431
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:37,222
And then they can move on as opposed to they try it and and then you know, they're a little bit disappointed

432
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,882
the other thing that we're trying to do is

433
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:46,429
is kind of, you know, play with size a little bit, right? So, you know, we've talked about like color

434
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:53,912
and trying to like blend things in, things that don't really look grabbable probably aren't. And

435
00:26:53,912 --> 00:27:00,534
same with size. Smaller things that look like you can grab your hand generally are grabbable. Of

436
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:07,217
course, there's, you know, a couple places that we try to break this rule so our puzzles don't,

437
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:09,578
you know, get destroyed. But

438
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:15,997
We try to kind of abide that by that as well. So it feels kind of a little bit more intuitive

439
00:27:15,997 --> 00:27:19,360
Yeah, this is a really interesting moment where like like

440
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,081
You're just getting all this

441
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:22,663
Messaging about perception is reality all of a sudden

442
00:27:22,663 --> 00:27:23,824
Then you walk in the office

443
00:27:23,824 --> 00:27:27,547
You're looking for something to grab and you turn around and the thing was right by the door when you grab which is like the

444
00:27:27,547 --> 00:27:28,308
least

445
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:30,630
Puzzly thing but it's strangely

446
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,013
Uh, like you can't unless you know, it's there. You can't go grab it. Um, yeah

447
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:38,376
This level. Yeah, this level is fun because this level is kind of like

448
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:42,079
really fun

449
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,300
Kind of twist on the on the other levels

450
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:51,303
Because one kind of one thing that we're playing along with it's like the idea that you know in a sense. We are

451
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:56,645
Are are trolling the player but in like a very tongue-in-cheek way, right?

452
00:27:56,645 --> 00:28:01,508
It's like if you see none of the puzzles in this particular level are super super difficult

453
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:08,371
But they're more like things are you expect things to look totally normal and then then they're not and that's kind of just the general theme

454
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:08,771
in this level

455
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:13,759
Right on. We're coming up on the half hour mark for our conversation.

456
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,040
I sound like a ruck-a-nucker, but I genuinely do.

457
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,921
We love hearing the thoughts of our developer audience.

458
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:23,882
This is when I started to get screwed up, when I grabbed that die right there.

459
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:27,844
And I was like, wait a minute.

460
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:32,565
So we'd love to hear your thoughts, your questions for Albert.

461
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:36,749
I am going to slightly tweak my line of questioning for the moment.

462
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:42,635
Albert, so you took a mechanic that started as a student game, and then you and a bunch

463
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:47,120
of friends got together, you got a team together and you said, okay we want to make this a

464
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,041
shipped commercial product.

465
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:52,445
A lot of developers get to do that, it's a really cool thing about this industry.

466
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:55,288
I don't know why, I just wanted to play around with this so I can.

467
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,454
What was it like and what steps did you take did you think made your transition successful?

468
00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:05,277
Because there's a lot of devs who transition like their thesis games in the commercial projects

469
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:08,220
And it just doesn't work out or they have to go take a day job or something

470
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,002
How did you sort of make it all happen?

471
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:16,207
Yeah, I mean a big a big factor of that is time and of course

472
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:23,153
I don't think I don't think I did the process perfectly. I think one is time. That's why the game took no

473
00:29:23,668 --> 00:29:26,670
you know, six years from beginning to end is because there was a lot of iteration.

474
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,613
There was a lot of, you know, there's a point where I got some contract work in

475
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:32,374
in order to make things work.

476
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:39,719
Um, it was then, you know, of course, I'm saying like, if we just sat down and we

477
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:43,341
were totally funded and we had a full team, you know, we could have made this

478
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:48,684
game a lot faster, but because of those basic kind of like, kind of transition

479
00:29:48,684 --> 00:29:49,725
moments, uh,

480
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:54,139
Indie games in general, I feel like, end up taking a little bit longer.

481
00:29:54,139 --> 00:30:00,943
The other thing though is just remembering the initial wave of people who were interested

482
00:30:00,943 --> 00:30:02,784
in this game.

483
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:09,827
And so, I was worried actually, maybe like the first year or year and a half working

484
00:30:09,827 --> 00:30:13,909
on the game that if I didn't get the game out soon that people would just forget about

485
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:14,009
it.

486
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:18,371
And then somebody told me that people are interested in something.

487
00:30:19,497 --> 00:30:26,981
Once they will be interested in it and in it again, you know after it comes out or after the full thing

488
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:30,243
is revealed so I was kind of like

489
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:36,706
Hoping that you know, I hope that's correct. I don't know but you know, we'll test it out and see

490
00:30:36,706 --> 00:30:39,267
so a lot of it is that confidence that

491
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:44,770
this mechanic in this game would would be interesting enough that people would kind of

492
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,831
Be attached to it again

493
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,241
if the full thing ever came out, right?

494
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:51,803
And that confidence, I think, especially when you're making

495
00:30:51,803 --> 00:30:57,667
an indie game, does help a lot, because any amount of certainty

496
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:01,189
kind of makes things easier, in a sense, right?

497
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:05,432
Because when you're doing it as an indie or on your own,

498
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:10,055
there's so many things that you're trying to tackle with,

499
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:12,997
or there's so many kind of doubts in your mind, right?

500
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,919
Whether you'll ship the game and whether.

501
00:31:16,677 --> 00:31:18,822
you know, the game will even do well and stuff like that.

502
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:21,508
So the more amount of certainties you can grab,

503
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:23,533
kind of, I feel like the easier that process is.

504
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:33,472
So you're saying the certainty you're able to hold on to was like we have a mechanic that works, people are interested in it, and that will work for us tomorrow the same as it works today.

505
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:39,014
Yes, yeah. Even if I showed somebody who had never seen it before, they'd be like, oh wow, this is really cool.

506
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:41,794
Which I admit, that was me.

507
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:50,577
I think I got confused with scale when I first saw it because there's a house puzzle later on that is sort of similar to what's going on with scale.

508
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:56,580
Yeah, moving on from that, I guess as an indie, how did you manage your sort of quality of

509
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,000
life in that time?

510
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,702
Because, you know, six years is a long time to work on a game.

511
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:05,103
I hope it wasn't six years of long hours on one game because that would have been very

512
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:06,264
hard.

513
00:32:06,264 --> 00:32:13,327
Yeah, I don't think I'm the best person to talk about this because I've been horrible

514
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:16,848
at kind of keeping a good work-life balance.

515
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:20,228
And to me, because there's different types of people, right?

516
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:25,772
And some indies can just, you know, roll out of bed in the morning and get to work

517
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:28,434
and just have a very productive day.

518
00:32:28,434 --> 00:32:34,038
I have personally like, I have more trouble just like having a super productive day.

519
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:36,680
So that's what I always try to shoot for.

520
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,043
And when you're at, as in, you know, doing this as an indie or by your own,

521
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,385
it's always hard to say like...

522
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:51,866
I need to wake up at this exact time and I need to do these things and then after this,

523
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:56,148
then I can take a break and forget about everything.

524
00:32:56,148 --> 00:33:02,110
What I realized at least for me is that having a team of people around me, people at our

525
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,793
co-working space that I need to get up to bed to meet and to talk with.

526
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:14,883
really actually helps me in my process right. Some people need that, some people

527
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:19,227
don't. I think having other people kind of on your team, having other people that

528
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:25,292
you know will be blocked by stuff if you're not there. You know people that

529
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:30,156
rely on you and people you can rely on is part of the process as well.

530
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:37,384
Right on. Man, solving this puzzle was very strange for me because I just sort of accidentally walked into it.

531
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:37,584
Yeah.

532
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:46,027
Working with your team, I guess like, let's celebrate your coworkers for a minute because there's six, you know, the team is six.

533
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:46,167
Yeah.

534
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:53,930
You weren't the only person making this happen. What are some of the interesting work they did that you think is worth calling out?

535
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,711
Yeah, so, okay, so there's, I mean, it's like, where do I start, right?

536
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:58,831
Yeah.

537
00:33:58,831 --> 00:33:59,171
Yeah, so...

538
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:03,807
First of all, there's Logan, who's our level designer.

539
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:06,748
He worked on a game right before this that was called

540
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:09,349
Four-Sided Fantasy, which is also a Puzzle game.

541
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:14,171
But he also worked on this DigiPen game

542
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:20,773
called Perspective, which is this 2D platformer slash 3D

543
00:34:20,773 --> 00:34:22,473
first-person game.

544
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:26,955
If that sounds interesting, you should go check it out.

545
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:27,875
It's on Steam right now.

546
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:35,170
But so he was like the perfect candidate to be, you know, a level designer on this game.

547
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:35,730
Mm-hmm.

548
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,092
You know, couldn't have picked anyone better.

549
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:47,756
Other people like, we have two artists on team, Ryan and Steve.

550
00:34:47,756 --> 00:34:52,698
They both come from kind of more of a triploid background, but of course they've done some

551
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:57,160
indie stuff, but they've had like tons of experience under their belt.

552
00:34:57,532 --> 00:35:05,574
know, World of Warcraft and Mortal Kombat and stuff like that and you know, far more

553
00:35:05,574 --> 00:35:06,874
experienced than I am.

554
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:13,796
There's Phil who's our graphics programmer, you know, he's working on his own cool little

555
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:16,717
game that is called Snell Trick.

556
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:19,238
Sorry, there's two games.

557
00:35:19,238 --> 00:35:24,619
There's Snell Trick which he's released but there's also Cascadia Quest or Cascade Quest

558
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:26,900
or the name was changed at some point.

559
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:27,666
Sorry Phil

560
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:28,306
That

561
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:33,209
Has a tons of cool stuff in it, too

562
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:40,933
And he has tons of experience, you know, he worked at Microsoft for a while

563
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:47,817
But now he's like doing really cool graphics stuff for a game. There's you know, Chris Chris Floyd who you know

564
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:51,499
Used to work for mega booth

565
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:51,819
and

566
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:56,361
You know done tons of cool stuff there. He's also doing some stuff for oculus

567
00:35:57,028 --> 00:36:02,371
And there's Alex who's also a programmer.

568
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:06,453
He's, you know, I think a theme here is that

569
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:10,615
because we're in kind of this co-working space,

570
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:13,917
we can find interesting people that we know

571
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:15,798
to help us along with the project.

572
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,239
It's like Alex is somebody we brought on,

573
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:20,581
you know, a little bit late in the game,

574
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:22,562
but he's kind of provided a lot of that

575
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:24,543
kind of finishing touches in terms of the programming.

576
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:30,834
like the UI and the controller and all that stuff that we really didn't have

577
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:36,778
kind of a lot of time to tackle at the end. So you know it's always nice to have like

578
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:42,542
that kind of emergency kind of like programming you know muscle cord to pull I guess.

579
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:48,186
So that's where, wait a minute, of course there's and last of all there's like Matt Christensen who's

580
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:54,731
doing the music for the game and he's like this Fmod guru who also teaches.

581
00:36:55,193 --> 00:37:00,959
know jazz on the side so you know that's why you know we brought him in because a

582
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:09,589
lot of the music in this game is based off of like very cool piano jazz you

583
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,753
know mm-hmm and that was the kind of interesting atmosphere we were trying to

584
00:37:12,753 --> 00:37:15,957
build so hopefully I didn't forget anyone

585
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:24,440
Um, uh, yeah, um, uh, as I limit my past self for not being able to solve this puzzle.

586
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,741
Um, I guess I can move on to my next question, which is, um, uh, it is one

587
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:31,002
thing always, you know, to ask, uh, talented, smart people to come

588
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:31,883
up with interesting games.

589
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:39,967
But it is another thing to then take people who are skilled at one aspect of making a game,

590
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:43,329
like in your case you made the demo, and then to ask them to also lead a team.

591
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:49,092
Is there anything that you particularly thought of, or in the last six years,

592
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:52,114
is there anything notable about leadership and working with other people

593
00:37:52,114 --> 00:37:54,195
that you've learned that you think other devs should know about?

594
00:37:55,342 --> 00:38:03,867
Yeah, I mean the past six years for me at least is just a very long learning process and I'm still trying to

595
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,489
learn and trying to figure, you know, trying to figure things out.

596
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:11,332
Among them like one of the big ones is

597
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:18,857
at the beginning, maybe let's do this way, like at the beginning I had a couple of assumptions that

598
00:38:18,857 --> 00:38:21,478
you know, turned out to be more nuanced than I thought. So for example,

599
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:27,360
Coming in, you know, maybe in my student years, I would have said, you know, what's our goal?

600
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,602
It's just to make a really really good game

601
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:34,626
So I'm sure you know all of us will be able to make great decisions and saying what's good game

602
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,648
What's not just heading in the right direction, right?

603
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:42,432
of course that sounds like it if that sounds like a recipe for disaster that is it's because

604
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,694
Everybody

605
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:49,097
Defines things a little bit differently, right? If you say if you ask somebody what a good game is

606
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:54,152
they have different ideas and that doesn't necessarily mean anyone's wrong, it just means

607
00:38:54,152 --> 00:38:56,853
there's different ways of seeing it, right?

608
00:38:56,853 --> 00:39:01,554
There's so many different types of games, so there's so many different types of ways

609
00:39:01,554 --> 00:39:04,234
where things can become good, if that makes sense.

610
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:09,935
And that, a lot of times that requires emphasis on different aspects.

611
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:12,256
So an artist might say...

612
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:16,141
hey, to make this part good, we need high fidelity,

613
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:22,085
or we need some really cool, interesting, one-off art piece

614
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:22,985
here.

615
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:27,488
But to the designer, they might say, you know what?

616
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,069
Art's not super important to me.

617
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:31,431
I just want something that's easily manageable.

618
00:39:31,431 --> 00:39:34,953
I want to build out levels quickly.

619
00:39:34,953 --> 00:39:36,915
So everybody has different expectations.

620
00:39:36,915 --> 00:39:38,696
And if you're leading the team.

621
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:41,569
The thing you're supposed to do, apparently,

622
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:44,712
is to try to get everybody on the same page of what's

623
00:39:44,712 --> 00:39:46,933
important and what's not important.

624
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:50,736
And that's a process in itself.

625
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:55,079
And for that, it's difficult because then you

626
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:59,162
need to know or you have to have a good idea.

627
00:39:59,162 --> 00:40:02,945
And a lot of people end up needing to like,

628
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:07,908
I can't really explain this perfectly, but based on my gut,

629
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:09,269
we should probably go in this direction.

630
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:14,916
And a lot of it ends up being that way.

631
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:18,199
So that's why I think part of this process is so hard.

632
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:24,084
The other thing though is also realizing that you're working with people who are really

633
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:29,589
smart so generally they'll make the right decisions but that doesn't also because people

634
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:32,432
have different tastes that doesn't mean that, you know.

635
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:38,924
people will make the right decision really quickly. So what do you mean, what can you do to kind of like

636
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:44,587
help move that process along, right? I used to maybe go like, hey, I would keep it open. I was

637
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:49,711
like, hey, just, you know, do something cool that you really like for this area. But now I try to go,

638
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:55,375
well, I'm trying to do this, you know, here's an example of this, can improve on it. That's cool.

639
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:59,397
But, you know, if not, maybe we should do something, you know, simpler for this area.

640
00:40:59,397 --> 00:41:01,839
You know, something on those lines.

641
00:41:02,122 --> 00:41:04,143
That was really thoughtful, yeah.

642
00:41:04,143 --> 00:41:09,187
I love how really serial killer this section is.

643
00:41:09,187 --> 00:41:10,488
Yeah, that's all Logan.

644
00:41:10,488 --> 00:41:13,531
Nice. Nice job, Logan. I hope you're watching.

645
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:16,793
I hope you got to hear that compliment, in a way.

646
00:41:16,793 --> 00:41:26,541
Right on. I guess something that can get overlooked, you mentioned having two talented artists on this game.

647
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:55,208
What kind of art style did you sort of realize you needed in order to make sure that this puzzle game could be both like easy to read and also something you could fill out with like the sense of space and narrative which I don't even think we're gonna have time to talk about the narrative today but like there is kind of a there's kind of an or there's kind of a something like it's not you're not just dealing with puzzles in an abstract space this whole wandering through a dream facility thing is really seems to be well intentioned. Is there anything you figured out as working with your artists that you really needed that in this process?

648
00:41:56,083 --> 00:42:01,006
Yeah, so we took a look at a lot of indie games.

649
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:03,827
Like, let's say starting with Antechamber,

650
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:06,529
we're like, we don't want to do something completely,

651
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:08,590
purely abstract, even though that makes things read

652
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,890
a lot easier, right?

653
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,951
And part of that reason is that when you're

654
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:14,053
in the actual mundane space, it's just,

655
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:16,814
things are so much funnier if you make them,

656
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:18,755
if you make things surreal.

657
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:22,057
And like, if you move, you know,

658
00:42:22,057 --> 00:42:23,537
make a can of soda really large,

659
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:25,718
like that's a kind of funny moment that you can't have.

660
00:42:26,236 --> 00:42:27,497
in a purely abstract space.

661
00:42:27,497 --> 00:42:32,360
On the flip side, we also didn't want a very busy-looking space, right?

662
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,742
Because as you mentioned, yeah, that just ends up distracting, and especially in a puzzle

663
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:44,967
game, that draws you to a lot of false clues that aren't exactly there.

664
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:51,291
So in the end, we kind of went for this art style that, you know, one of our reference

665
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,353
points was Wes Anderson.

666
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:57,398
things are kind of clean and clear, but there's still this

667
00:42:57,398 --> 00:43:00,720
interesting surreal tone going on. It's almost like a heightened

668
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,802
reality, right? Like you wouldn't necessarily see these

669
00:43:03,802 --> 00:43:07,424
colors in real life, but they could exist. So there's that, it

670
00:43:07,424 --> 00:43:14,489
kind of lies on that kind of line between surreal, you know,

671
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:19,612
something that's possible, but also a little bit magical. And,

672
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:23,815
and, you know, similar with with the mechanic as well. And, and

673
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,601
you know, the items in the game and the puzzles,

674
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:31,162
that's kind of the line we're trying to hit.

675
00:43:31,162 --> 00:43:35,123
And I think that feels a lot more funnier

676
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:38,624
and more surreal than the extreme, right?

677
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:42,586
The other extreme you could go to that we didn't go to

678
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:46,287
is if we made things very fantastical.

679
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:47,988
You know, that would be like,

680
00:43:47,988 --> 00:43:50,388
you know, if you're in some kind of fantasy world

681
00:43:50,388 --> 00:43:52,069
and you have this mechanic

682
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:54,210
because you have like a special, you know.

683
00:43:55,207 --> 00:44:00,789
magical ancient magnifying glass or something, you know, I don't know but

684
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:01,930
it's just

685
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,731
a lot of it kind of just kind of depends on

686
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:06,091
what

687
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:10,713
Kind of game or tone you're trying to shoot for

688
00:44:10,713 --> 00:44:14,034
Yeah, so yeah for the looks, you know

689
00:44:14,034 --> 00:44:20,196
We were referencing Wes Anderson. We were referencing, you know, things like James Turrell

690
00:44:20,196 --> 00:44:22,897
Which used a lot of kind of pastel colors

691
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:27,734
There's this great kind of subreddit called

692
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:30,977
Accidental West Anderson. It's where people

693
00:44:30,977 --> 00:44:35,020
take photographs that look like Wes Anderson stuff and then

694
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,443
you know, they just post it and share.

695
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:40,504
And

696
00:44:40,504 --> 00:44:46,069
basically, we kind of like took a lot of those elements and we try to analyze

697
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:52,213
how those elements worked, right? And a lot of it is about the color and about the level of detail.

698
00:44:53,184 --> 00:45:00,035
Um, yeah, and I'm, I'm really glad that, you know, it came out in a style that we,

699
00:45:00,035 --> 00:45:02,820
we could work with design, but it's also interesting to look like, look at.

700
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:10,157
Right on. This is where, unfortunately, a poor old past me started getting a little confused about what was going on.

701
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:16,723
Lastly, I guess we can, as we head into our last part of our chat, we can talk about the Epic Games Store a little bit.

702
00:45:16,723 --> 00:45:23,489
This is a big new store. Developers are still trying to figure out why they should be shipping on it, if they should be shipping on it exclusively.

703
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,571
Some developers are trying to figure out how their player bases, potential player bases will react.

704
00:45:28,571 --> 00:45:34,672
Can you walk us through your process about shipping Superliminal on the store?

705
00:45:34,672 --> 00:45:39,053
And if there's anything in particular you think other developers need to know?

706
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:44,814
Yeah, I don't think there was too many things that we ran into.

707
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:51,376
Of course there's a couple of kind of features that aren't...

708
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,202
there yet and that's both the blessing and the curse, right?

709
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:58,986
So for example, for a ship, we didn't need to put in achievements.

710
00:45:58,986 --> 00:46:01,488
And that's great because that would have like, you know,

711
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:04,570
took us another, you know, week or two

712
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,012
to kind of like put everything in a tester thing.

713
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:09,034
Besides that, I think

714
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:14,578
I think the the kind of general process is streamlined enough that

715
00:46:14,578 --> 00:46:18,481
nothing in particular was like incredibly different.

716
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:21,123
And I'm glad that's the case that, you know.

717
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:30,362
we have different PC platforms that don't feel like you're porting to a completely different

718
00:46:30,362 --> 00:46:35,964
console or anything, right? Like there's no super long process that you need to go through.

719
00:46:35,964 --> 00:46:44,988
It's basically similar to, more or less similar to, how you would put a game on Steam. So, yeah.

720
00:46:44,988 --> 00:46:49,690
What other experiences did you have putting a game on Steam, if you don't mind me asking,

721
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,030
like how you're able to compare it against?

722
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:57,653
Yeah, so basically, well, before we got on the F-Game store,

723
00:46:57,653 --> 00:47:01,715
we were on Steam for a little while.

724
00:47:01,715 --> 00:47:03,776
And that was a way that we could get

725
00:47:03,776 --> 00:47:08,718
the game kind of tested and playable in an easy format.

726
00:47:08,718 --> 00:47:13,380
So we were actually using Steam for a little bit of time

727
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,061
before we did that.

728
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:19,603
And each storefront will have their own process, right?

729
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,103
But it's more like.

730
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:25,750
You need to go in and figure it out, but after you do, generally, it's relatively straightforward.

731
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,618
Mm-hmm. Yeah, this- you know what's not straightforward? This puzzle.

732
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:37,421
As you can see I'm desperately trying to click my way. This is one of those interesting cases where

733
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:41,943
where I could tell I was just trying to brute force it, but I didn't know what the elegant what the

734
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:44,523
elegant solution was

735
00:47:44,523 --> 00:47:47,604
So we will see me in a minute here. I think this was me like I just gone on

736
00:47:47,604 --> 00:47:48,925
I watched a youtuber try to solve it. Oh

737
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:53,666
And I think he'd come up he'd actually managed to get this this sort of solution to work

738
00:47:53,666 --> 00:48:00,188
He managed to click it up the hill. Although once yes. Yeah, I've seen people do things that were not intended

739
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:05,252
But are very interesting, like, okay, that's actually something I need to fix.

740
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:07,694
But some of them, you know, are just cool.

741
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:08,875
When do you draw that line?

742
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:13,738
When do you fix something that you didn't intend as a puzzle and when do you just let it be?

743
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:17,061
Yeah, I think that really comes down to the player experience.

744
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:24,926
If it's a thing that, you know, leads them to be more frustrated, generally we will try to fix it.

745
00:48:24,926 --> 00:48:29,470
But if it's like a cool thing, for example, a lot of people like taking items and try to...

746
00:48:30,428 --> 00:48:36,392
like find really weird kind of nook and crannies in the game that they weren't supposed to be and

747
00:48:36,392 --> 00:48:41,496
for that we do want to encourage so we will be kind of patching the game and adding more easter

748
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:47,841
eggs and things you can discover that you know encourage that sort of behavior right because

749
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:52,325
basically when players do that you know i feel like

750
00:48:52,732 --> 00:49:02,880
They're putting extra effort into the game and it'd be nice if, as a player, it'd be nice if I was rewarded if I did this crazy thing that wasn't supposed to happen.

751
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,864
And I got somewhere that I wasn't supposed to go and if there's a sign over there that says, like,

752
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:14,049
you know, why did you do that? That's kind of like an acknowledgement that it happened.

753
00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:16,230
We try to kind of encourage that kind of stuff.

754
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:19,213
God, I'm so close. I'm just watching my past self and I'm just like...

755
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:21,459
All you need to do is take a step back.

756
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,120
Take a step back.

757
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,800
There you go.

758
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,043
Man, that's the problem with doing

759
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:27,625
some of these like record exchanges.

760
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:28,805
You just look back at what you're doing

761
00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:29,786
and you're like, I get it now.

762
00:49:29,786 --> 00:49:32,649
You just think about what it was like when you didn't get it.

763
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:40,351
Um, well, uh, with that in mind, um, I believe I am running out of questions for the moment.

764
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,233
Um, I guess I will end on one final- oh, there's one.

765
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:44,154
There you go.

766
00:49:44,154 --> 00:49:44,414
Oh, yeah.

767
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:50,439
Um, uh, Albert, I guess, is there any particular lesson, um, you know, this, this is Game

768
00:49:50,439 --> 00:49:54,002
Developers Conference, um, we, we do things with the game developers in mind.

769
00:49:54,002 --> 00:49:58,265
Is there anything you'd like other game developers to know before you wrap up today?

770
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:01,708
Yeah, there's me getting more frustrated.

771
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,169
Haha, um, I mean.

772
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:07,491
Not that much, but I think if anything I just want to talk about kind of like

773
00:50:07,491 --> 00:50:10,792
you know the pre-production process and I think that

774
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:18,595
It's actually kind of a very hard thing to figure out. I think I think kind of games in general

775
00:50:18,595 --> 00:50:21,676
aren't super good at that because

776
00:50:21,676 --> 00:50:27,298
Just because of how games are like you kind of need to make something in order to figure it out

777
00:50:27,298 --> 00:50:33,000
if it works, but I feel like if you can grab on something early on like, you know

778
00:50:33,586 --> 00:50:41,368
even in a very broken state, you know, of this game, there was something there that we could point to and say,

779
00:50:41,368 --> 00:50:44,388
you know, that's something people will be interested in even,

780
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:49,629
I don't know, like four or five years later when the game is complete.

781
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:54,430
Having that and having something like that and having the confidence kind of does help you along the way.

782
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,351
Um,

783
00:50:56,351 --> 00:50:59,391
and yeah, and just like try to

784
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:02,632
try different things during pre-production. It's not necessarily just

785
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:06,556
keep on building the game, sometimes it's taking a step back.

786
00:51:06,556 --> 00:51:11,460
Sometimes it's building a different kind of prototype, or in a different medium,

787
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:17,183
you know, going to paper or something else where we're talking to people,

788
00:51:17,183 --> 00:51:22,287
in order to kind of get to where you need to be, in order to really start production.

789
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:28,371
So, yeah, I'm just saying that because we kind of went between pre-production and production a couple of times

790
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:31,753
before realizing where that line was at.

791
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:32,233
I'm sure.

792
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:40,105
No. A lot of people have been in similar situations.

793
00:51:48,057 --> 00:51:50,598
Here we go, Natal420 has jumped in with a question.

794
00:51:50,598 --> 00:51:53,299
And I think we've sort of covered this, but I can ask it

795
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:56,540
and we can sort of revisit the topic for a moment.

796
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:02,342
Was this game designed to have only one answer per puzzle,

797
00:52:02,342 --> 00:52:04,683
or did you ever want people to solve the puzzle

798
00:52:04,683 --> 00:52:06,104
through multiple means?

799
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:10,125
They comment that they were thinking about Zelda shrines

800
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,406
in Breath of the Wild.

801
00:52:11,406 --> 00:52:13,346
They're not called Zelda shrines,

802
00:52:13,346 --> 00:52:14,327
they're just called shrines.

803
00:52:14,327 --> 00:52:16,968
They're shrines in Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

804
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:19,649
and how they've seen multiple solutions to each shrine.

805
00:52:19,649 --> 00:52:24,010
I'm going to layer on that question by pointing out that sometimes in those shrines

806
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:30,191
the multiple solutions are often people like gaming the wild physics mechanics of that game.

807
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:34,773
And this game is different. It doesn't have wild physics mechanics.

808
00:52:34,773 --> 00:52:36,013
But yeah, I guess what was your...

809
00:52:36,013 --> 00:52:39,494
I've noticed that there seems to be only one solution per puzzle.

810
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:42,035
But what was your thought process behind making that decision?

811
00:52:42,757 --> 00:52:45,518
Yeah, we were also at some point trying to figure that out, right?

812
00:52:45,518 --> 00:52:49,921
Do we want this to be more of, you know, a straight up puzzle game?

813
00:52:49,921 --> 00:52:57,745
Or do we want it to have, you know, more freedom and more sense of creativity

814
00:52:57,745 --> 00:52:59,046
and more toy like?

815
00:52:59,046 --> 00:53:01,567
And then we said, no, no creativity for you.

816
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,510
But I think the real answer is it depends on kind of.

817
00:53:07,105 --> 00:53:11,829
what you really care about and for our game we really cared about giving people

818
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:17,013
kind of moments of epiphany and that's harder to do if you have multiple solutions right

819
00:53:17,013 --> 00:53:22,777
because what you end up doing is maybe you you know have a different epiphany and you skip this

820
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:29,162
moment you skip this thing that we're trying to tell you and in the next puzzle you get stuck right

821
00:53:29,162 --> 00:53:36,148
so uh for us at least we've kind of chosen the one solution per puzzle

822
00:53:37,074 --> 00:53:42,798
away, but if people do, you know, similar to the Zelda shrines, if people do find like a crazy solution,

823
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:47,902
um that they're just ahead of the curve, we don't, we try not to penalize them for that, so.

824
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:52,205
This is one of my favorite puzzles actually, this house. Awesome, yeah thanks. I love going,

825
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:58,749
I love reshaping the sizes of things and going inside them, like taking the small thing and

826
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:03,853
making it big, taking the small door and making it big. Yeah. It's very Alice in Wonderland.

827
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:08,215
Exactly. Yeah, normally I would not use that as a compliment, but here it's a compliment.

828
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:13,319
Um with that I'm going to start wrapping things up. Thank you everyone for watching the GDC twitch channel today

829
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:17,642
If you uh didn't catch the whole stream, don't worry. It's going to be archived

830
00:54:17,642 --> 00:54:23,707
Um, see look at this look at this tiny door. I have to figure out how to get into um, uh, um

831
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:25,108
uh this um

832
00:54:25,108 --> 00:54:32,133
Uh, this has been our chat with albert. She of the pillow castle games, uh for work, uh, the game super liminal

833
00:54:32,514 --> 00:54:35,716
You can check it out on the Epic Games Store if you want to play it for yourself.

834
00:54:35,716 --> 00:54:42,142
For our part, GDC is coming up in March from the 16th to the 20th to be precise.

835
00:54:42,142 --> 00:54:47,647
You might have noticed that if you looked at the screen for two seconds.

836
00:54:47,647 --> 00:54:52,331
We would like to invite you to join us at GDC in part because, you know, we...

837
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:58,235
We cater to game developers, we cater to people, students, professionals, indie developers.

838
00:54:58,235 --> 00:55:02,318
We like having you all at the show because it's a lot of knowledge sharing, it's a lot

839
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,661
of networking, and it's a lot of stuff, it's a lot of places, it's a place where you can

840
00:55:06,661 --> 00:55:10,724
have a lot of conversations like this conversation where you just try to learn from the people

841
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,645
making great work in your field.

842
00:55:12,665 --> 00:55:17,749

843
00:55:17,749 --> 00:55:20,571

846
00:55:30,377 --> 00:55:32,239
going to be talking to this month and next year.

847
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:35,901
This month, I can promise you, if you stick around, you're going to be hearing from the

00:55:35,901 --> 00:55:38,423
developers behind the new MechWarrior game, which is out.

849
00:55:38,923 --> 00:55:44,224
out later this month. We're also going to be talking to the folks behind Age of Empires 2 Remastered

850
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:47,445
Definitive Edition, not remastered, Definitive Edition.

851
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:53,806

00:55:53,806 --> 00:55:59,047
Albert, thank you so much. It's been a lot of fun. Superliminals, cool game. I hope you have a lovely day.

853
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:00,247
Thanks so much for having me.
