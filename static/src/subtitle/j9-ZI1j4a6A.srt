1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,201
Now that we got that out of the way, let's get going.

2
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:10,441
Hello everyone, I'm Grant Schonkweiler.

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:12,622
I'm your moderator and your first speaker today.

4
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:14,023
I'm a producer at Epic Games.

5
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:16,904
And, but before I start with my first chapter,

6
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:19,245
I wanted to talk a bit about what we're talking about today.

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,205
Production at the heart of the team

8
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:22,366
is the title of our talk.

9
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:26,837
panel. It's actually one talk with each of us sharing a

10
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:29,680
chapter. We're going to interweave and it will be a

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,424
little weird. You'll like it, I think. Each of us has our own

12
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:38,068
chapter written mostly in our own words. We are sharing stories

13
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:40,990
from each other and people who aren't on this stage. So when

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,153
one of us tells a story, it may or may not be something that

15
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:46,616
actually happened to one of us. The names and places have been

16
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:48,577
changed to protect the innocent, so to speak.

17
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:54,622
As you may have figured out or read in the guide, our talk is about the field portion of being a producer.

18
00:00:54,622 --> 00:01:00,707
We believe in order to maintain the health of a project, producers must constantly be iterating on team dynamics.

19
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:06,051
Once processes are in place, the producer must have their finger firmly placed on the pulse of the team

20
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:11,255
and be able to diagnose, and that situations often call for drastically different solutions.

21
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:13,777
We're going to go over some of the situations and solutions today.

22
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,973
But we are producers, so we must have an agenda for everything

23
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,354
we do.

24
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:22,054
So let me go through the agenda for our meeting,

25
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:23,615
I mean session today.

26
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:25,996
I'll start out, and I'll talk about what is a team

27
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,416
and how to get one started.

28
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:30,057
And then Matt will go over what you do

29
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,778
when everything goes sideways.

30
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:33,859
Michelle will then talk about some

31
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:35,039
of the tools for surviving.

32
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,400
And Greg will end it up with how to get yourself

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,160
ready to thrive.

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,001
Then we'll do some Q&A if we don't talk way too long.

35
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:46,043
Alright, so time for my chapter. This is the part where I reintroduce myself. My name is Graham

36
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:51,244
Schonkweiler. I've been in the industry for about 8 years, 5 of that as a producer. I've worked on

37
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:55,645
small and big teams making small and big games. I've worked at MegaTouch, id Software and I'm

38
00:01:55,645 --> 00:02:00,046
currently at Epic Games working on a game called Fortnite. Before I did games I ran

39
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:04,346
entertainment show production teams. So I have about 15 years experience running

40
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:07,987
entertainment teams. To start us off on our journey I felt like we should talk about that

41
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:10,848
word team. So what is a team? Is this a team?

42
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:15,274
Yeah. How about this? Is this a team? I'm in a bright yellow

43
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:16,198
shirt if you're looking for me.

44
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:20,870
Yeah, this is also a team, this is Media Molecule.

45
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,370
And this is ID Software, and they were a great team as well.

46
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,851
This is also a team, it's a little bit different

47
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:27,111
than what we're talking about today,

48
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,751
but I thought it was important to keep in mind.

49
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:32,272
The dictionary defines a work team as a group of people

50
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:33,972
with a full set of complementary skills

51
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:36,473
required to complete a task, job, or project.

52
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:37,853
All right, definition's done.

53
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:40,133
Now, it's time for a story.

54
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,274
Now imagine if you will, you're a producer

55
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:43,794
that was brought onto a new team.

56
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:44,374
What do you do?

57
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,596
Let me share one of our stories, which I'll tell from the producer's perspective.

58
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:51,898
I was asked to form a new strike team to take on an overwhelming task.

59
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:55,441
I was told who I could have and what the work was that needed to be accomplished.

60
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:59,083
During the first meeting on the team, some of whom had never worked together before,

61
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:03,225
I saw that camps were forming and there would be problems moving forward.

62
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,547
But I didn't head it off at the start.

63
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:08,749
As days went on, I tried to work with individuals to resolve the problems,

64
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:12,431
but it was clear that divisions had formed and it was hurting both the team and their output.

65
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:15,916
I knew something extra would be needed to bring them together.

66
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,676
Remember this slide from earlier?

67
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:19,877
The reason I love this definition of a team

68
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,777
is because it clearly shows how a team must work together.

69
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:26,038
If that big guy on the left stops walking or tries

70
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,259
to go to the right, then the other fellow

71
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:29,579
will go the wrong way or stop.

72
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,420
Just like the team in the story, without unity

73
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,340
they can't move forward.

74
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,800
So what did the producer do?

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,441
They got the team together and had everyone

76
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:39,601
do a presentation on themselves to get them

77
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,862
to connect on a human level.

78
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,072
and it worked. People on the team started to learn lots of

79
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:47,055
things they had in common. Like being born in another country,

80
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:50,938
having a father in the military, or a crazy raver past. I use

81
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:54,121
this with my teams as well. It's an idea I got from the amazing

82
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:56,523
Scott Crabtree. If you've never heard him speak I highly

83
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:58,765
recommend it. His website is there. He has some amazing

84
00:03:58,765 --> 00:03:58,965
talks.

85
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:02,880
It is a take on the petra kucha talks but instead of 20 slides

86
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,943
20 seconds each we do 10 slides 10 seconds each and no talking

87
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:09,224
about your career other than what inspired you to get into

88
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:12,286
games. I'm going to go through mine a little bit quickly as an

89
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:16,409
example. I was born just outside of Cincinnati Ohio that's right

90
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:19,051
there. Yes I'm a Reds fan. It was in that area I applied my

91
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,292
trade as a child and youth. I was always an avid gamer and

92
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,394
sports fanatic but it wasn't until I messed up my buddy's

93
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:25,755
Pokemon Red that I thought about making games.

94
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:29,196
I was so infuriated by both my mistake and the lack of ability

95
00:04:29,196 --> 00:04:31,757
to fix it in the game that I sat down with my friend

96
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,557
to write our own game, because we could do that.

97
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,498
We worked for hours on a design doc

98
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:38,819
that would eventually turn into Pokemon Killer, an arcade

99
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,139
shooter where you killed every Pokemon.

100
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:40,859
That's not our art.

101
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:41,760
We weren't that talented.

102
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,680
After working on it for a few weeks,

103
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,041
we sent the doc to Sony, because they're not Nintendo.

104
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,001
And they responded, which was amazing.

105
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:48,841
Thanks.

106
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:51,222
We don't want to be sued, so no thanks.

107
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:55,620
With our dream smashed we moved on to other things. I started

108
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,743
modding and making levels for Warcraft 2 and Tribes 2. And I

109
00:04:57,743 --> 00:05:00,729
loved adding my own story. People liked my levels but what

110
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:04,014
they didn't like was in the loading screen I had to ramble

111
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:06,358
through my whole story and explain to them what was

112
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:06,739
happening.

113
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:10,475
Around that same time as well, I started working in the music industry.

114
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,296
Yes, if you're doing math, that's child labor.

115
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:14,819
I've worked with hundreds of bands you have never heard of,

116
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,320
and maybe two or three you have.

117
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,802
But I learned a lot in that profession and did a lot of random jobs.

118
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:22,346
During that time, I also played sports until I discovered my one true love.

119
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:26,660
oh, wrong way. Rugby. That's actually from my first game.

120
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,380
It's also a picture of Braveheart. Which has

121
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,961
dominated my life ever since. I realized at one point I

122
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:35,042
didn't want to do the music industry thing for a career.

123
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,043
And it is then I realized, hey, this game dev thing I've

124
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:39,003
been doing as a hobby, I guess that could be a career.

125
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:42,910
And I remembered reading about full sale for music while I was

126
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,231
doing that and they had a game program and I was like that

127
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:48,634
could be interesting. Turns out it was. Outside of work I spend

128
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:51,035
as much time as I can with this wild bunch. My nieces and

129
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:54,778
nephew. They are crazy. I also like to read, travel, bike and

130
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:57,300
watch films. If you're looking for me outside of work I'll

131
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,641
probably be doing one of those things.

132
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:03,383
Now, that was just an example for you all, but it also worked in my favor, right?

133
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:08,004
From that example, you found something to have in common with me, or we have in common,

134
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:12,146
and now we're relating on a more human level. It's obvious once you've studied the science

135
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:16,668
why this works so well. Hive hypothesis states, humans are conditional hive creatures. We have

136
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,629
the ability under special circumstances to transcend self-interest and lose ourselves

137
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:24,291
temporarily and ecstatically in something larger than ourselves, the hive switch.

138
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,789
We are all searching for a calling

139
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,030
that we can only find as part of a larger group.

140
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,630
The hive switch is a slider.

141
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,951
You increase the feeling of a family.

142
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,731
Don't bring focus on differences.

143
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:38,452
Focus on similarities, shared values, and common identity.

144
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:40,512
People are warmer to people more like them,

145
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:42,533
so do things that help them find similarities.

146
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,713
It's important for you and your team

147
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:46,894
to realize they are a group of human beings

148
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,374
with different backgrounds coming together

149
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,375
to accomplish something great, but also

150
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,415
that more than likely, they have something in common.

151
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:58,989
The most important thing you can do when building a new team is to help them build an emotional

152
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:02,453
connection and bond with you and each other.

153
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:04,895
So what other things have we done to help build these bonds?

154
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,717
A few years ago we took Fortnite on a roadshow.

155
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:10,340
We went to cities all over the world and showed off the game.

156
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,961
We had people play the game and give us feedback.

157
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:14,323
We would send the fewest amount of people to each show,

158
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:18,385
you know, to cut costs and also make sure that people were still making the game.

159
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:21,026
But we quickly realized something after the first event.

160
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:24,227
It's hard to stay on point and excited for eight plus hours straight.

161
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:27,109
So one of our programmers got the idea to do a sports-style pump-up.

162
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:28,570
I have a video of it here.

163
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,030
Yeah. Video games.

164
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,272
Okay, so that's not us, but we thought we were like that.

165
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:37,574
And it worked. We did it at the start of each day moving forward.

166
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:40,035
It brought the team together, built a bond, and got us excited.

167
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:40,976
This is actually us.

168
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:48,195
We weren't quite as in sync as we thought we were.

169
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:52,957
In his book, The Righteous Mind, Jonathan Haidt talks about the science behind this a bit

170
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:53,838
and has a great quote.

171
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:56,239
People who move together feel more together.

172
00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:00,682
If you ask people to sing or tap out some beats together, it makes people more willing to help each other out.

173
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:03,903
If you've seen Wolf of Wall Street, you also understand what this means.

174
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:09,046
If you have ever been at a sporting event or church or sang together, it's kind of like that.

175
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:12,713
So what we're saying is have more dance parties,

176
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:14,934
do karaoke, synchronicity builds trust.

177
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:18,054
Another thing you can do is to create a healthy competition

178
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:20,535
between groups, but not between individuals.

179
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:21,955
As game development studios, this

180
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:23,636
may be the easiest one for us.

181
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,396
Play games.

182
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:27,436
Have your teams take breaks and play PVP games or board games

183
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:29,777
against each other, or even set up a competition

184
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:30,937
surrounding your own game.

185
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:34,278
But remember to frame these competitions around fun

186
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:36,278
and not around a bonus of some kind,

187
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:37,838
because then you change the incentives.

188
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,735
When we started doing company playtests of Paragon,

189
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:43,842
we saw that teams were forming a lot stronger together.

190
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:46,448
In fact, our animation team walks around as a gang now.

191
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:47,410
It's kind of terrifying.

192
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,800
One thing that will not only help to build the trust on a new team,

193
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,241
but will prepare you for a high-pressure situation,

194
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,542
is to put the team into a fabricated high-pressure situation.

195
00:08:56,542 --> 00:09:01,245
Escape rooms are pretty much the 21st century version of the trust fall or the ropes course.

196
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:04,186
I don't know if any of you have ever done one of those, but they work really well.

197
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:08,228
They put you into a high-pressure situation where you're forced to work together as a team.

198
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,628
We've also used a variation on the game jam idea.

199
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:14,549
Basically, we worked really hard for a week

200
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,330
to bring our bug counts down.

201
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,470
And then we told the team, hey, you

202
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,771
have a week to add anything that you guys think

203
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,071
will make the game better in your area.

204
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:23,832
Both of these manufacture both external and then

205
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:25,373
internal pressures to be great as a team.

206
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,994
There are of course obvious team building ideas like throwing

207
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,618
parties, going out for drinks, going to shows, movies,

208
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:34,382
concerts, sporting events, playing sports together and of

209
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:37,266
course celebrating each other's successes in life. Hopefully

210
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:40,511
with wild abandon like my dear friend Kermit there. As well as

211
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:42,493
many more that you've tried and I would love to hear about.

212
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:47,595
Remember that you as a producer can be the single biggest change transformer on a team's

213
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:49,755
collective happiness and excitement.

214
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,576
You can lead the team to greatness.

215
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:54,196
Kaiser, Hogan, and Craig have this to say about leadership.

216
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:58,877
Transformational leadership changes the way followers see themselves, from isolated individuals

217
00:09:58,877 --> 00:10:00,638
to members of a larger group.

218
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:05,959
Transformational leaders do this by modeling collective commitment through self-sacrifice

219
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:11,240
in the use of we instead of I, emphasizing the similarities of group members and reinforcing

220
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,581
collective goals, shared values, and common interest.

221
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,591
Because I love rugby, I must talk about this man.

222
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:19,811
The great coach, Eddie Jones, had an amazing year last year.

223
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:23,052
His team from Japan went into the Rugby World Cup ranked

224
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,352
16th, with only one top-tiered professional player

225
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:26,292
on their entire squad.

226
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,313
But they went on to have three major wins,

227
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,613
including the greatest upset in the history of the sport

228
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:31,213
against South Africa.

229
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,634
Basically, if you imagine the New York Yankees losing

230
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,834
to the UCLA baseball team, it was kind of like that.

231
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:39,595
After the World Cup was over, he said,

232
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,995
the team is the sum of the whole and not an individual.

233
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:43,895
And it was made a whole by the support staff.

234
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:47,306
To summarize, teams come in all shapes and sizes

235
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:49,488
and are made up of diverse groups of people.

236
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:51,550
Similarities build unity.

237
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,691
Synchronicity builds trust.

238
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:55,213
Competition builds strength.

239
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:58,696
External and internal pressures build cooperation,

240
00:10:58,696 --> 00:10:59,437
and producers build teams.

241
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:00,177
Thank you.

242
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:00,558
Thank you.

243
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:00,918
Thank you.

244
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:10,838
Okay. So this being one talk, it also means that this is an

245
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,380
interactive talk because I like this. Now if you're willing and

246
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,123
able I would ask that you all stand up and turn to the nearest

247
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:19,507
person near you and take the next minute to talk about

248
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:21,729
takeaways that you could have from this talk.

249
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:29,277
All right everybody.

250
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:35,209
It's time. Stop talking. I know this is really exciting. Don't

251
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:39,971
worry. You'll get to do this again at the end of each of our

252
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:43,912
segments. Now you have a friend in the audience. Hopefully you

253
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,833
know each other a little bit. But Matt is going to go ahead

254
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,354
and go through his part now.

255
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:59,097
All right. Thank you very much, Grant.

256
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,278
This is so appropriate for my talk.

257
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:02,498
Yeah.

258
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:02,779
Yeah.

259
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:02,859
Yeah.

260
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:03,399
Yeah.

261
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:03,620
Yeah.

262
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,040
Right?

263
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,123
That's pretty great.

264
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:07,704
We planned that.

265
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:10,407
So hi, everyone.

266
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:12,329
My name is Matt Charles, and I'm here

267
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,851
to talk about what you can do when things fail because

268
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:16,393
something inevitably will.

269
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,315
So I'd like to share some tips on diagnosing

270
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:22,079
some common situations and some different solutions.

271
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,400
Grant, you broke it again.

272
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,021
There we go.

273
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:26,839
So, real quick, before I jump into that,

274
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,742
I'm a senior producer over at Gearbox Software.

275
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:30,464
I've been there for about eight years now,

276
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:33,408
ten in the industry, and I love everybody I've worked with a lot at Gearbox.

277
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,530
I've been a producer or a senior producer

278
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,352
on the Borderlands franchise for a while.

279
00:12:37,894 --> 00:12:44,881
And I'm currently working on an unannounced title, and I promise it's not what you think, based on the titles up there.

280
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:50,487
I also was a soccer referee for quite a few years, which gave me great experience at being wrong all the time, and being told that.

281
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,610
So that was very useful.

282
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,235
So before I can talk about problems you might encounter on a team, we need to first understand what the ideal scenario actually is.

283
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:02,798
So the ideal scenario, of course, is one where, on the team, you have perfect communication,

284
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:06,660
everybody's best friends, cooler heads always prevail during disagreements,

285
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,481
and the team is in control of their own fate.

286
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:13,283
Well, as many of you know, the producer is the captain of the project,

287
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:15,244
and you're responsible for all of these things.

288
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:17,445
And a lot of what I'm about to say will be obvious to you,

289
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:20,327
especially if you've been doing this a long time.

290
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:24,069
But greatness takes discipline and constant reinforcement.

291
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,090
So there was a time looking back a couple of years ago where I...

292
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,845
thought that when I first started being a producer,

293
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:32,186
I was actually better than, you know,

294
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,587
four or five years in,

295
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,868
because I hadn't yet developed any bad habits.

296
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:38,049
So, I've tried to fix all those,

297
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:41,170
but that takes reinforcement and daily discipline.

298
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,511
Regardless, as a producer,

299
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:44,932
it's still better to be Captain Obvious

300
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:46,993
than Captain Hindsight.

301
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,694
So, when something goes wrong,

302
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,235
here are the three things you must do.

303
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:52,276
Well, okay, the first thing you might do

304
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:54,057
is panic a little bit.

305
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:58,914
And it's okay to panic a little bit, but if you're going to panic, try to do it internally.

306
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:03,997
Because remember that the team looks to you for emotional cues about how to react to a situation.

307
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:09,561
Regardless of if you panic, the next thing you have to do is figure out what actually happened.

308
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:15,705
Somebody may come into your room screaming about smoke, but is it a fire or just somebody using an e-cig?

309
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:20,848
With regards to diagnosis, I find this trick very important, very helpful.

310
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:22,409
Ask why, and then just keep asking why.

311
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:25,272
Be a curious five-year-old, essentially,

312
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:27,813
and then you'll get to the root of the problem pretty quickly.

313
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:30,674
Toyota actually developed a five-wise technique,

314
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,515
which is employed exactly like you'd expect.

315
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:35,596
And that's traditionally very effective at getting

316
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:36,697
to the root cause of the problem.

317
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:36,997
Last but not least.

318
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:44,537
Do take time to communicate to others about what is going on,

319
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:46,978
how you're handling it, and what you plan to do.

320
00:14:46,978 --> 00:14:49,658
Get in front of the issue as much as possible.

321
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:50,779
Otherwise, the rumor mill is going

322
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:51,859
to do what it's going to do, and you

323
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:54,159
may end up with an even bigger problem on your hands.

324
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,759
So now I'll cover five pretty common issues

325
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,700
that I hear about, or I've seen, or hear about frequently.

326
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,101
And I'll suggest some responses and ways

327
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:06,101
you can deal with these things, keeping in mind the three

328
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:07,382
things I just mentioned.

329
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:11,146
So the first one, probably the most common,

330
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:13,608
is just simple miscommunications.

331
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,709
So these questions are telltale signs

332
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:16,670
that a miscommunication has occurred.

333
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,231
And you've probably heard something like this.

334
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:18,731
You've probably.

335
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:20,908
hear something like this weekly or at least monthly, right?

336
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:23,669
And the key in managing this type of problem

337
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:26,651
is actually embedded in the question that comes up here.

338
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:28,452
It's the phrase, I don't understand.

339
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:31,533
So when you hear somebody say, I don't understand,

340
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,774
listen for that and address that first.

341
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:36,215
Especially since you might be in the same position.

342
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:37,816
This might be the first time you're hearing

343
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:39,697
about something as a producer.

344
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:42,458
You might not also understand why somebody did something.

345
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,399
So then you can immediately empathize with that person.

346
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,216
So a good way to handle miscommunication, of course,

347
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:51,917
is with a response such as, you know, I don't know either.

348
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,358
Maybe he didn't know his change would affect you.

349
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:55,758
I can think of some other reasons

350
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:57,379
why this might have happened,

351
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,419
but why don't we go talk to him and find out?

352
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:01,580
If this happens consistently,

353
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,680
you might wanna skip to the abbreviated version

354
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,161
and just say, you know, I don't know, have you asked him?

355
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:07,681
So the person can, you know, take the hint

356
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:09,242
that they need to be proactive

357
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:11,422
in solving communication issues.

358
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:14,163
But the lesson here is that I don't know is a fine answer,

359
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:15,843
but do communicate what you're gonna do about it.

360
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,950
Another common issue is with personality conflicts.

361
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,092
Turns out not everybody just gets along naturally

362
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:23,854
to each other, with each other.

363
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:26,317
You don't need everybody to be best friends, of course,

364
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,859
but you should be aware of any signs

365
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:30,622
that things might be headed in a potentially bad direction.

366
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:35,066
So first diagnose what you're actually dealing with.

367
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,908
Some obvious signs are eye rolling

368
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,091
or people being curt to one another consistently.

369
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:42,007
And the response here is pretty straightforward.

370
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,288
First, remind people to be professional.

371
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:46,310
We're not in high school anymore.

372
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,992
Then the next thing you need to do after you've addressed that,

373
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,814
and hopefully that goes away, is still

374
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:57,257
understand that there could be some underlying cause.

375
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,559
That's a symptom, not the root of the problem

376
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,160
that you need to seek out and resolve.

377
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,141
Some subtle signs of personality conflicts

378
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:04,282
or people not getting along.

379
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:09,409
are ascribing negative motivations to somebody's behavior,

380
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,150
so-called like casting somebody as the devil,

381
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,812
assuming the worst about why somebody did something.

382
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:17,595
Constantly, somebody constantly disagreeing

383
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:20,217
with somebody else, maybe outside their typical roles

384
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:23,280
or responsibilities, and some subtle campaigning as well.

385
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,301
This unfortunately happens on some teams.

386
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:27,143
It's a real thing you have to deal with.

387
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:29,445
These are much harder to spot, unfortunately,

388
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:30,826
and oftentimes people aren't even aware

389
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:32,647
that they're doing these things,

390
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:33,848
so that makes it even more difficult.

391
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:36,150
You have to approach these with a bit of caution.

392
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,874
Because these can be more difficult to deal with,

393
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:42,777
usually, actually, counterintuitively,

394
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:45,820
the best fix is to get those people to spend more time

395
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,444
with each other so that they can better understand each other's

396
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,905
goals and motivations.

397
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:53,087
They might not come out of that agreeing

398
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:55,590
on a mutual direction to head, but at least then

399
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,932
you understand, OK, everything's out in the open.

400
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,102
we're not agreeing on this point.

401
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:02,343
Now we can solve for that, rather than people just

402
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:06,485
avoiding each other, or not making eye contact,

403
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,066
or any of the other personality conflict symptoms

404
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:10,887
I mentioned.

405
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:12,347
I've tried both paths.

406
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:16,429
And more often than not, putting people together more frequently

407
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,852
to resolve this resolves the root conflicts way more often

408
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:25,514
than separation, which tends to actually entrench people

409
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:26,534
and make things even worse.

410
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:29,197
So this one's fun.

411
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:33,740
Another issue I see is when a team loses control

412
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,281
of their own destiny, or their own fate,

413
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,022
or of some major aspect of the project.

414
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:40,144
It's when some outside force creates a change

415
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:43,566
in circumstance for the team, such as the dreaded mandate

416
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:46,107
from above.

417
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:49,790
So obviously, we won't name any products or any games.

418
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,351
But twice in the past couple of years,

419
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:54,452
I have seen in the industry significant changes

420
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:55,973
made to the product requirements.

421
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,741
For example, adding an entire gameplay mode,

422
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:00,964
like multiplayer, campaign, or whatever,

423
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:02,746
to the game with less than a year to ship.

424
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:08,073
So this is pretty, yeah, this is pretty,

425
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:10,076
I'm seeing some nods from everywhere.

426
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:12,039
So yeah, it happens, right?

427
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:18,538
So how do you respond with this? As the team lead, but not necessarily the company lead,

428
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:23,662
you're in a difficult position. Well, first, remind people that owning a company means that

429
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,546
as an owner, they do actually get to make calls about the nature of the product. So first of all,

430
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:33,191
that is entirely within their purview. Second, challenge people to come to a different solution

431
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:38,816
given the same information. These proposed big changes almost never happen on a whim.

432
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:42,039
They're probably, they're almost always necessary

433
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,741
in response to something that you or the team

434
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:46,162
just simply aren't aware of yet.

435
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:48,324
So when that information is laid out,

436
00:19:48,324 --> 00:19:50,205
everybody can understand why a change

437
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,907
or a decision is being made,

438
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:55,349
and then you've resolved or helped to mitigate that conflict.

439
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:57,411
If it's an isolated incident,

440
00:19:57,411 --> 00:19:59,392
things will probably blow over.

441
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:00,753
If a pattern is developing,

442
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:03,456
that's probably a sign that you should have a chat with

443
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:05,337
whoever's making these mandates from above

444
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,278
or whatever the case is.

445
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:12,987
and let them know that that can have a real impact on the team and the productivity of the team.

446
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:19,889
In the two cases I mentioned, one, hard to say, the other one actually worked out for the best.

447
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:25,371
So it's also not always the case that the mandates from above lead to negative results.

448
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:29,033
Just like any other change, you know, they have mixed results.

449
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,918
Now on to outbursts.

450
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:32,522
Yay.

451
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,527
An outburst is a sudden release of emotion,

452
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,673
perhaps caused by some of the issues I mentioned earlier.

453
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:39,586
These also usually don't happen for no reason whatsoever.

454
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:42,589
And the way you deal with this is to remind the person

455
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,650
that their emotion can come across

456
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,512
as bullying to other people.

457
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,553
And it'll shut them down.

458
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:49,995
So that person needs to work with others way more

459
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:52,497
constructively than they have been.

460
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:56,000
For example, you can say, you might be right,

461
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,081
but the way you're presenting your message

462
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:01,444
is really getting in the way of the message.

463
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,326
Try to get them to refocus on the issue at hand

464
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,828
and think about solutions rather than emotions

465
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:06,788
or emotional posturing.

466
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:12,364
A preventative measure that might be the most brilliant thing I've ever seen done in any

467
00:21:12,364 --> 00:21:16,708
meeting to make sure a meeting and future meetings didn't get too heated was when an

468
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,970
art director brought a shake weight to the art critiques.

469
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,491
Yeah, that thing.

470
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:26,057
Turns out it's actually impossible for tensions to rise when somebody's using that in a room.

471
00:21:26,057 --> 00:21:28,599
It's just impossible.

472
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,580
And the point was obvious.

473
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,063
It's actually okay to have a laugh during even serious and important discussions.

474
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:37,425
Sometimes, unfortunately, outbursts or other conflicts

475
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:40,785
can build into loathing, or somebody writing somebody off

476
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:41,365
completely.

477
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:44,166
This is very unfortunate, but it does happen.

478
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,846
And of course, as a producer, what you want

479
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,807
is to try to turn this into this.

480
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:50,247
So what's a dead to me situation?

481
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:51,268
What do I mean?

482
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,108
Well, they're kind of obvious.

483
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:57,989
It's when something like this is said, like, oh, F that guy,

484
00:21:57,989 --> 00:21:58,369
right?

485
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:00,570
Hopefully nobody's had to deal with this situation,

486
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,270
but again, it does happen.

487
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,970
It's also important to understand.

488
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:06,814
how it happens, and this is the worst,

489
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:09,176
because it's the most damaging to the team,

490
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:11,679
and yet it can happen so, so easily.

491
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,182
At first, people are all on the same team,

492
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:17,264
and then something will happen that might prompt someone

493
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:18,645
to think that there are multiple teams,

494
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:21,727
or competing interests, or multiple silos, or groups.

495
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:25,411
And once anybody starts to believe the team is fractured,

496
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,191
bad stuff happens.

497
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:31,616
As an example of how easy it is to get into this state,

498
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:31,977
look at this.

499
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:40,668
It's so true.

500
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:44,409
Thanks to Zach at Extra Fabulous Comics for that.

501
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:46,250
That's so perfect.

502
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,131
So how you deal with this is to first recognize

503
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:48,811
where it's coming from.

504
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:51,752
Was there a single blow up that people harbor resentment over?

505
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:55,394
Has it been a series of miscommunication issues?

506
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:57,655
Is one or more people actually incompetent?

507
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:59,876
Remember the Steve Jobs quote, B players

508
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:00,836
discourage the A players.

509
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:03,157
And it's a real phenomenon that can

510
00:23:03,157 --> 00:23:04,838
breed resentment in your team.

511
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,600
Communicate the stakes to those involved.

512
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,021
As I mentioned, the team can't function divided,

513
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:14,962
and everybody needs to be reminded of that.

514
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:17,042
So challenge the people involved to find some common ground

515
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:17,522
for the good of the project.

516
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:20,623
So to recap, quickly identify if you're

517
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:23,264
dealing with a small issue or a big issue.

518
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:24,184
Ask why.

519
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:25,544
Emulate a five-year-old.

520
00:23:25,544 --> 00:23:27,945
Don't be afraid to communicate and respond appropriately.

521
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:30,826
And try to remain calm and be the best producer you can be.

522
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,066
That's me.

523
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:42,046
All right. It's time again for you all to stand up and talk to

524
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,387
each other about what you learned from Matt's brilliant

525
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:52,909
talk. I know this is really exciting and we learned a lot,

526
00:23:52,909 --> 00:24:00,471
but sadly we do have to eat lunch at some point. So please

527
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:05,892
sit down. Stop talking. Thank you. Thank you. All right.

528
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:06,432
Michelle's up.

529
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:14,766
Hello.

530
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:15,426
Hello.

531
00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:15,846
Hello.

532
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:16,086
Hello.

533
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:16,426
Hello.

534
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:16,686
Hello.

535
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:16,907
Hello.

536
00:24:16,907 --> 00:24:17,167
Hello.

537
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:17,987
Hi, I'm Michelle.

538
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:19,208
I'm a producer at Media Molecule.

539
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,589
And I'm going to talk you through three tools

540
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:26,071
that I use day to day, week to week,

541
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:28,532
that I feel kind of help me as my anchors, basically.

542
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:30,773
The things that I go to whenever I kind of come up

543
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,294
against any problem, I usually basically just

544
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:34,495
like revert back to one of these before I kind of feel

545
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:36,075
like I'm totally freaking out.

546
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:41,181
So, the first one is the overview tracker, the second one is creating a weekly rhythm,

547
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:47,785
and the third one is talking. I like talking. But first I'm going to give you a really quick

548
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:54,428
summary of my background. So, I've been working at the studio for eight years. I joined back

549
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:59,191
in March 2008, but before I joined MM, I studied literature, animation, I worked in the film

550
00:24:59,191 --> 00:24:59,731
industry.

551
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:04,177
For six years as a casting associate with a casting director,

552
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:09,719
I did a bit of promo for new bands on small record labels.

553
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:14,341
And basically from there I kind of went into games.

554
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:19,263
But the skills I developed over the years working on projects here

555
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:21,524
and also my own projects transferred really well into

556
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:23,965
games production. But working in the

557
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:27,747
film industry didn't fully prepare me for working with creatives and programmers

558
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:28,587
in the games industry.

559
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:33,521
I felt like I had a lot to learn really, really fast, but I managed to adapt really well.

560
00:25:33,521 --> 00:25:38,404
I was really hungry to learn and challenge myself and really push myself in areas that

561
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,246
I just wasn't familiar with.

562
00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:45,990
There was a lot for me to figure out and I felt like I adapted really well and learnt

563
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,972
new terminology and processes pretty well too.

564
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,136
And our directors were amazing.

565
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:54,296
They basically trusted me and let me really run with things.

566
00:25:54,296 --> 00:25:56,857
And I was given the room to kind of feel it all out,

567
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,297
make mistakes, and basically get better.

568
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:00,957
In all the years that I've been a producer,

569
00:26:00,957 --> 00:26:05,118
I feel like I've been able to develop those skills

570
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:07,839
and understand, basically, the tools

571
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,280
that I feel that I'm going to talk to you about today.

572
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,200
But basically, I'm continuing to optimize my workflow

573
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,401
and use the tools that I've used on these projects.

574
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:25,126
and they work. They usually help me from, save me from spiralling out of control in

575
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:29,288
the sometimes chaotic environment that I work in. Not always, but sometimes.

576
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:36,372
So the first tool is the overview tracker, and basically what is that? That is the big

577
00:26:36,372 --> 00:26:43,756
picture of the project. It's the project overview. So that basically has information like having

578
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:45,136
key milestone dates in there.

579
00:26:45,277 --> 00:26:50,681
We have the high-level schedule in there, broken out person by person, area by area.

580
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:58,287
There's demos, milestone builds, team holidays, public holidays, basically all the information

581
00:26:58,287 --> 00:27:01,490
that is important information that we just need to be aware of when we're looking at

582
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,453
what we're going to need to do to ship and what we need to manoeuvre around.

583
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:10,014
So I create a simple timeline in Excel.

584
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:12,916
I say it's simple, but to me it's really simple.

585
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:16,579
Basically, it helps me understand how much time

586
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:18,000
we have in the week.

587
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,721
I usually create a sheet that covers the whole year.

588
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:23,403
And that way I can look at it and I can freak out

589
00:27:23,403 --> 00:27:27,226
by just the fact that we don't have a lot of time in a year.

590
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:29,387
And I note down all those key events.

591
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:30,448
It's all presented back in here.

592
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:40,598
And it's usually based around the beats and kind of like the flow of like what we're trying to aim to work towards as a team on the projects that we're working on.

593
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:50,949
Because there are only 52 weeks in the year, 52 cells, when I look at the work that people have to do and they've said that they need to do to ship, it basically looks terrifying.

594
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:56,348
All of that information is basically gathered, like the team information is gathered from

595
00:27:56,348 --> 00:28:01,530
doing one-to-one catch-ups with people, and I'll go over how we do that in a moment, but

596
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,951
it's like gathering all that information and presenting it back in a really high-level

597
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,192
way.

598
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:14,224
There are also different ways that I present back that information in a more granular way.

599
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:21,467
Some people have completely different working styles and they want to see what their work looks like in different ways.

600
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:29,271
I use various different tools presented here to present that back to people, to the producers as well.

601
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:34,297
So in summary, basically this is what the project picture looks like.

602
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:39,863
As a producer, I need to be able to make big, broad decisions based off of what's going on.

603
00:28:39,863 --> 00:28:41,744
I need to be able to discuss them.

604
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:43,866
Having the project view helps me do that.

605
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:46,729
It enables me to make strategic, broad decisions.

606
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:51,453
And it helps the producers and the team basically understand what the birds-eye view of the project is

607
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:54,416
and helps us analyze what's going on week to week.

608
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:58,138
So my other tool that I use is creating a weekly rhythm

609
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:59,760
and flow with the team.

610
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,441
So it's the picture of the week.

611
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:04,004
It's the realistic view of what is happening day

612
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:07,788
to day, week to week, or more like day to day.

613
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:11,933
So the structure of it is that we have from Monday to Friday,

614
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:11,993
we

615
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:18,016
basically have days where we go and we collect information from people, so we check in,

616
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:23,339
like we go and sit down with somebody and do one-to-one catch-ups between Monday and Wednesday.

617
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:28,743
Before we do that, though, we have a studio meeting, and basically we kind of set out, like,

618
00:29:28,743 --> 00:29:32,345
what is the plan for the week, what are the goals, get everybody together and just run through that.

619
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:36,506
After that we kind of like break out, like we catch up with people, we do the big important

620
00:29:36,506 --> 00:29:41,387
meetings that might need to happen, but basically we're just like, we're gathering information,

621
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:46,048
we're taking information from people, we're catching up with them, updating their schedules

622
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:49,309
one to one, and we're finding ways to kind of present that back, that all goes back into

623
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:50,310
the big overview tracker.

624
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:55,937
But basically having a weekly rhythm helps set an expectation for the team, they understand

625
00:29:55,937 --> 00:30:01,005
what's going to happen day to day and there's like a little bit of structure there for them

626
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:04,690
to basically, for us to fall back on but also for them to fall back on as well.

627
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:09,834
So Monday to Wednesday is basically collecting information.

628
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:13,697
Thursday and Friday, this is just an example of how we work.

629
00:30:13,697 --> 00:30:17,340
And those two days are basically set aside

630
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,020
for production days.

631
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,862
We take all that information, put it back into our reports.

632
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,824
Our reports are really useful because they're actually

633
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:26,646
presenting back everything that we've taken on

634
00:30:26,646 --> 00:30:29,988
throughout the week and basically presenting that back

635
00:30:29,988 --> 00:30:32,590
to our directors and to Sony, our publisher.

636
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:43,603
So having that weekly rhythm and flow, actually it can break down sometimes, like we're all

637
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:49,185
humans, something might crop up, something might kind of make that just not work out,

638
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:52,006
we might not be able to do a studio meeting at the beginning of the week, or we might

639
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:53,746
not be able to do those one-to-one catch-ups with people.

640
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:59,309
The weekly rhythm isn't rigid, but it's a really good backbone for us to have, and to

641
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:02,011
pull back on if things get a little bit messy.

642
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:06,673
Okay, it's like my third tool, which is talking.

643
00:31:06,673 --> 00:31:08,774
I like talking.

644
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:12,276
I feel like I've got a really good rapport with people on the team.

645
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:13,156
I love talking to them.

646
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:15,177
I love helping them.

647
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:22,761
It's basically like one of the things that just helps me get through day to day.

648
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:28,935
So the first thing that I'm going to talk about is basically being the person that your team members can come to.

649
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:36,481
So letting them know that if they have a problem, if they have an issue, whether it's work-related or not, they can just come to me.

650
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:41,625
They can say, oh, I just need to kind of take your side and just basically air out concerns that they have or issues that they have.

651
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:46,790
So, making yourself available to be that person, or I make myself available to be that person,

652
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,295
so I say, okay, if I'm looking like I'm really busy, it's okay, just come over and say you

653
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:55,379
need some time, and then we can sit down and just talk through whatever problem that you

654
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,201
might be having.

655
00:31:57,201 --> 00:32:01,565
So, during the week, basically, like, gather all that information, like, from people's

656
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:03,988
schedules, from what's going on day to day with them.

657
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:09,384
maybe it's work-related, maybe it's not, but basically we're just taking all of that in.

658
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:18,269
Whatever we take in will have to, in some way, or it will impact what is happening in the

659
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,573
overview tracker. So basically, it does all come back to what does the project look like,

660
00:32:23,573 --> 00:32:28,436
what's the health of the team, but also of the project, because whatever comes out of that

661
00:32:28,436 --> 00:32:32,018
must lead to change. There will be something that might impact it in some way.

662
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:41,750
Processing all of that information will have a price emotionally for me, for our other producers.

663
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:50,037
Finding the right people to go to, to help us zoom out and actually just kind of get a little bit of perspective on what's happening is really important.

664
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:52,639
It's really important not to go down the train if you've got like...

665
00:32:52,915 --> 00:32:57,317
big things that you want to talk about that actually need maybe a little bit more experienced

666
00:32:57,317 --> 00:33:01,319
people to kind of help you take that step back and zoom out. It's not cool to offload

667
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:06,242
on somebody who might take things the wrong way and basically overwhelm themselves and

668
00:33:06,242 --> 00:33:10,384
get themselves in a bit of a spin because you've basically just pushed that emotion

669
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:10,704
and that...

670
00:33:11,544 --> 00:33:14,765
back onto them and they might not be able to handle it, so don't do that.

671
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:20,467
I usually go to one of our directors for support, depending on what I need to talk through.

672
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:23,508
So if it's like a technical issue, I'll go to our technical director

673
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:26,670
if I'm freaking out a little bit about our code schedule

674
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,371
and I need to take a bit of a step back and figure out how to problem solve there.

675
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,912
But basically it just really helps to get perspective and zoom out.

676
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:38,614
So talking through issues with somebody who can help do that is really important.

677
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:44,464
Or just being able to find people that, and this is team members, that anybody in your

678
00:33:44,464 --> 00:33:49,053
team that you've got like a really good relationship maybe, who you can just sit with, that can

679
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:49,795
just hear you out.

680
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:55,729
and so finding people to just sit and listen, someone that you can talk to, our programmers

681
00:33:55,729 --> 00:34:00,711
call it rubber ducking, I've never heard of that before but that's their term, we're using

682
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:05,592
that. It's really handy to hear yourself say the words out loud, for me personally it helps

683
00:34:05,592 --> 00:34:09,273
me problem solve if I'm actually just saying what the problem is and I'm trying to like

684
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:12,955
figure out like how I'm going to solve it but I usually

685
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:18,546
can get to the bottom of things just by saying those words.

686
00:34:18,546 --> 00:34:21,907
And it helps me move forward, basically, if I'm stuck on something.

687
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:23,928
And that person might actually just say,

688
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,009
oh, hey, why don't you do this?

689
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:27,569
I'm like, yes, maybe I can do that.

690
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:29,410
But yes, saying things out loud is good.

691
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,331
I'm a really emotional person.

692
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:33,332
I have got feelings.

693
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:36,313
I hold all of this information of like project information,

694
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:39,634
but also team, like the team kind of coming up to me,

695
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:41,675
telling me what their problems are as well.

696
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:44,976
I love doing it, but it can be really overwhelming,

697
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:47,597
and sometimes I can feel really, really stretched,

698
00:34:47,597 --> 00:34:50,798
and like I'm just gonna completely melt.

699
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,679
I find that I actually need to find ways

700
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,420
that I can offload as well, so breathing, hugs,

701
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,021
playing my ukulele, reading, going for a walk.

702
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:02,342
Things can feel really frustrating at times,

703
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,523
but it's really important as a producer

704
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:06,523
to kind of regain perspective,

705
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,924
so taking a break is good, just putting things down.

706
00:35:09,304 --> 00:35:13,848
stepping away and maybe coming back to whatever the problem is later.

707
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:16,690
But sometimes, actually, like I just want to scream

708
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,234
and finding a room in the studio to scream

709
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:23,857
is really handy. And actually I recommend

710
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:27,360
audio rooms, they're soundproof, but just don't do it if

711
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,342
any of your audio team are in those rooms because you'll freak them out.

712
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:34,386
But I've totally done that and walked out

713
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,728
okay afterwards, but yeah, it's useful.

714
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:44,198
So basically, being the person that's just exposed to all of that information can be an emotional burden.

715
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:49,560
And so, actually, one of the most important things is if you need help, ask for it.

716
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,440
We're all human.

717
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,141
We will break down at some point, I'm sure.

718
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:57,783
So these tools are really useful for me.

719
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:02,545
It's going from basically the big picture to the granular and then coming back out to the big picture again.

720
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:04,746
They all work really well as a trio.

721
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,107
We use them all the time in our projects.

722
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:11,431
If any one of these tools is missing, it breaks down.

723
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:13,693
Basically, they're my anchors.

724
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:16,435
The process helps bind the team.

725
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:19,096
We're a very people-focused studio.

726
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:21,858
We care about what is happening with people in work,

727
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:22,319
out of work.

728
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:23,239
We're here to help.

729
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:26,361
We can accommodate for anything.

730
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:27,582
We're very flexible.

731
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:31,225
Everyone is really amazing at what they do at the studio.

732
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:32,906
We make amazing games together.

733
00:36:32,906 --> 00:36:34,687
I really love the projects that we work on

734
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:37,449
and that we continue to work on together as a team.

735
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:39,890
These tools are really important because they

736
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,352
help with the choreography of the week,

737
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:43,492
with the expectation as well.

738
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,194
People know what they're doing.

739
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:46,054
People know what to expect.

740
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:48,836
Like when things are going to kind of,

741
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:52,378
if a random thing is thrown in, we basically

742
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,719
have something to fall back on.

743
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,440
The projects.

744
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:01,702
the projects that we work on can be really tough, but you know, we're problem solvers,

745
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:05,583
we're making amazing games, these tools really help us to basically ship them.

746
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:10,704
Here's some reference material, like these books are amazing, they're my production bibles,

747
00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:16,866
I really recommend them, Siobhan recommended a couple to me as well, she's amazing.

748
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:21,187
I hope it was helpful, thank you very much for listening.

749
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,141
All right, now before we do this break,

750
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:31,422
everybody go ahead and stand up.

751
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:32,463
But before you start talking,

752
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:34,645
I wanna go through something that Michelle talked about.

753
00:37:34,645 --> 00:37:39,189
So each of us has a burden that probably impacts us at work

754
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:40,651
and we're probably frustrated about.

755
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:42,172
So I want you to think about that thing.

756
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:44,014
And then on the count of three,

757
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,856
I want you all to scream, okay?

758
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,577
And we're just gonna get it out there

759
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:48,718
and then we're gonna talk about it.

760
00:37:48,718 --> 00:37:49,099
Okay, ready?

761
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,561
One, two, three.

762
00:37:54,677 --> 00:37:58,800
All right. I feel better. Okay. Now take 30 seconds each and

763
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:07,285
talk to your neighbor again about what you can take away

764
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:12,869
from Michelle. All right. All right. All right. All right.

765
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:17,572
All right. Or as Matthew McConaughey says, all right,

766
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:20,854
all right, all right. Sit down. Nate, stop talking. Sit down,

767
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:23,095
Nate. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Greg,

768
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:23,555
bring us home.

769
00:38:23,555 --> 00:38:24,096
You're tall.

770
00:38:28,745 --> 00:38:29,205
Thank you.

771
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:32,348
All right, well, hi, my name is Greg Stone.

772
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:34,469
I've been in game development for 14 years

773
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:36,491
and a producer for eight years.

774
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:39,334
I work at Backflip Studios as the senior producer

775
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:41,575
over Dragonvale World.

776
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:43,197
I live in beautiful Boulder, Colorado

777
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:46,459
with my beautiful daughter, Allison, and my wife, Benita.

778
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:50,802
As producers, we often talk about the best practices

779
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:52,683
for managing projects, but we seldom

780
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:54,304
talk about the preparation required

781
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:56,625
to manage the pressure of producing a game.

782
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,946
I want to share with you guys my story and attempt

783
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:01,147
to open up a dialogue on this subject.

784
00:39:01,147 --> 00:39:04,448
When I was promoted to the position of production director

785
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,329
at a previous studio, I inherited

786
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:07,690
a number of problems.

787
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,771
We were trying to find a success that had been eluding us,

788
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:11,591
and pressure was mounting.

789
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:13,732
I spent most of my waking hours in the studio

790
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:16,113
listening to people's feedback and trying to react.

791
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:17,394
I took every comment to heart.

792
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:19,816
and cared deeply about solving the problems.

793
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:23,438
The more I listened, the more problems were dropped at my feet.

794
00:39:23,438 --> 00:39:24,880
I internalized the stress in an attempt

795
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,981
to keep it from projecting onto the team.

796
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:28,562
As I became overwhelmed, I didn't

797
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:30,904
have the coping mechanisms in place

798
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:32,646
to properly handle the burden.

799
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:34,847
My anxiety continued to build up.

800
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:38,170
The stress manifested itself into a number of ailments.

801
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,492
I had panic attacks, hypertension,

802
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:42,653
heart palpitations, high blood pressure, shingles,

803
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:43,994
and weight gain.

804
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:46,476
Stubborn and a little dumb, I pushed forward.

805
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:49,115
One night when I was driving home from work,

806
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:50,656
I started losing control of my body.

807
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:52,196
The stress had built up to the point

808
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:54,377
where my body was attempting to shut down.

809
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:57,157
I pulled off to the side of the road

810
00:39:57,157 --> 00:39:58,938
and slowly drifted out of consciousness.

811
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,439
That's the wrong way.

812
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:02,719
Sorry, unhealthy, overweight,

813
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:05,560
and stress beyond my body's capacity to handle it,

814
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,900
I decided drastic changes were necessary.

815
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,921
This became the catalyst for what has become

816
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:13,462
a fascination with self-optimization.

817
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:15,142
I began to modify my behaviors

818
00:40:15,142 --> 00:40:16,743
to improve my reaction to stress.

819
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,922
I read everything I could on the subject of stress management.

820
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:22,804
Tried various workout routines.

821
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,307
Practiced intermittent fasting.

822
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:29,390
Dabbled in neurotropics to improve brain performance.

823
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,952
Put my body into ketosis.

824
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:33,694
For months, I experimented with eating only meat, beans,

825
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,596
and spinach at every meal.

826
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:37,117
I do not recommend this, just for the record.

827
00:40:37,117 --> 00:40:39,219
I got really sick.

828
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:41,722
Played with caffeine intake and sources

829
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:43,343
to optimize mental alertness.

830
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,131
tried every major form of meditation,

831
00:40:46,131 --> 00:40:49,751
and measured every body metric I could reasonably gain access to.

832
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:52,412
Three years later, I have drastically

833
00:40:52,412 --> 00:40:55,593
improved my response to stress to the point

834
00:40:55,593 --> 00:40:58,113
where it no longer plays a factor in my health and well-being.

835
00:40:58,113 --> 00:41:01,454
More importantly, it has allowed me to thrive in the fast-paced,

836
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:03,234
high-pressure world of game development.

837
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:06,015
I want to share with you guys my practices

838
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:08,435
I found to make any producer better and more effective

839
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:09,255
underneath stress.

840
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,311
I call this HOPES.

841
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:14,253
HOPES is the acronym for a routine that is tailored

842
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:17,415
to bring a better version of ourselves in time of stress.

843
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:20,297
While this may sound like an infomercial,

844
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:22,438
I promise you guys this is entirely based in science.

845
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,539
First, a huge disclaimer.

846
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:26,200
I am not a doctor or psychologist.

847
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,181
I'm just a guy with obsessive tendencies

848
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,742
I've channeled into self-experimentation.

849
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:31,943
Please check with your physician

850
00:41:31,943 --> 00:41:33,845
before doing anything that could impact

851
00:41:33,845 --> 00:41:35,165
your mental or physical health.

852
00:41:35,165 --> 00:41:37,027
Now let's dive down the rabbit hole.

853
00:41:38,173 --> 00:41:41,497
So how do we prepare ourselves for the long hours,

854
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:42,958
constant demands, and mental challenges

855
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,200
that come with being a producer?

856
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:46,567
The first step is a healthy diet.

857
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:47,888
We literally are what we eat.

858
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:50,170
This rabbit hole goes so deep

859
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,012
that I could talk about this subject for hours.

860
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,094
What you really need to know is that

861
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,515
our diet's tied to our energy levels,

862
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,877
our outlook, cognitive ability,

863
00:41:57,877 --> 00:41:58,998
and capacity to manage stress.

864
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:01,701
The abilities are critical to being an effective producer,

865
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:03,442
but we often sacrifice our diets

866
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:05,204
due to our busy lifestyles.

867
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:06,365
Don't fall victim to this trap.

868
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:07,186
Adopt a healthy diet,

869
00:42:07,186 --> 00:42:09,908
and make your meals at the beginning of the week

870
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:11,910
to ensure you have enough when you need it.

871
00:42:13,307 --> 00:42:15,408
I recommend the slow carb diet,

872
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:18,231
which is detailed in the 4-Hour Body and the 4-Hour Chef.

873
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:19,792
If you're more adventurous,

874
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,814
I would look into the ketogenic diet,

875
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:24,155
which is detailed in the Bulletproof Diet.

876
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:28,059
Exercise has been improved to increase energy,

877
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:30,441
reduce stress, improve sleep,

878
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:32,242
boost brain power, enhance immunity,

879
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:35,004
ramp up productivity, increase self-esteem, and more.

880
00:42:35,004 --> 00:42:37,286
Like diet, it is a linchpin to our success

881
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:39,228
in maintaining control of ourselves when pressures mount.

882
00:42:40,672 --> 00:42:42,792
To get the full benefits of exercise,

883
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:44,073
try to get at least three hours

884
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:46,153
of moderate physical activity every week.

885
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:48,194
Spread this across five days

886
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:50,354
and don't sacrifice the habit when we get busy.

887
00:42:50,354 --> 00:42:53,575
The busier we are, the more critical exercise

888
00:42:53,575 --> 00:42:55,996
becomes to helping us maintain our effectiveness.

889
00:42:55,996 --> 00:42:58,017
Do whatever exercise you enjoy,

890
00:42:58,017 --> 00:43:01,198
but if you're relatively new and looking for something,

891
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:03,799
I recommend looking into the book,

892
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:05,199
Bigger, Leaner, and Stronger for Men

893
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:07,460
and Thinner, Leaner, and Stronger for Women.

894
00:43:09,399 --> 00:43:11,780
Have you ever been around someone with unshakable optimism?

895
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,160
Their attitude is infectious.

896
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,701
Optimistic people make great leaders

897
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:17,762
because everyone wants to follow someone

898
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,423
who believes that any obstacle can be overcome.

899
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:23,004
Cultivating optimism isn't just an innate ability

900
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:24,264
some people have.

901
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:25,765
Like any skill, it can be mastered

902
00:43:25,765 --> 00:43:26,465
with the right techniques.

903
00:43:26,465 --> 00:43:27,225
To make ourselves more optimistic,

904
00:43:30,783 --> 00:43:32,946
we can employ the power of positive thinking.

905
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:35,509
Creating a positive mindset is as simple

906
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:37,071
as thinking positive thoughts.

907
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:39,515
A good practice is to think about three things

908
00:43:39,515 --> 00:43:40,977
you are grateful for every morning.

909
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:46,429
Write them down in a journal and truly think about how grateful you are for those people,

910
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:48,030
places, and things.

911
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:51,893
Take the time to appreciate how amazing the world you live in is and how fortunate you

912
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:52,754
are.

913
00:43:52,754 --> 00:43:57,478
Even now, in this room, most of us are alive, healthy, have access to the world's information

914
00:43:57,478 --> 00:44:00,200
at our fingertips, are fed, sheltered, and clothed.

915
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:00,961
Life is good.

916
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:04,844
Keep this perspective and you will maintain your optimism.

917
00:44:04,844 --> 00:44:08,327
Your team will come to depend on that optimism when they need someone to reassure them that

918
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:09,168
everything will be okay.

919
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:13,163
I use the five minute journal as a really quick way

920
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:15,024
to reinforce the habit of positive thinking.

921
00:44:15,024 --> 00:44:16,664
It can be purchased online.

922
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:18,725
It was an app and it'll soon be an app again.

923
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:21,506
They're making a new one.

924
00:44:21,506 --> 00:44:23,986
A patient producer is the rock that teams lean on.

925
00:44:23,986 --> 00:44:26,467
They take the time to listen to their team members

926
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:28,948
when they need to talk and remain calm.

927
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:30,969
They know the pressures of today are temporary

928
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,769
and will eventually be a memory.

929
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:34,030
Keep a level head.

930
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:39,092
Keeping a level head rather and remaining patient is also a skill that can be cultivated.

931
00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:42,797
To do this, we must train our minds to be less reactive and center on whatever needs

932
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:44,379
our attention now.

933
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:48,645
Meditation is the most effective way to train your brain to be patient and calm.

934
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:51,969
Meditating every day will train your brain to be less reactive, allowing you to stay

935
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:52,750
cool under pressure.

936
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:57,322
My recommendations for meditation would be the APCOM.

937
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:58,824
In the book, Creative Visualization

938
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:00,607
to start you on your mindfulness journey.

939
00:45:00,607 --> 00:45:01,688
If you're rolling the splurge,

940
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:03,371
you can pair this with a Muse headset

941
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:05,714
to ensure you're getting to a really deep meditative state.

942
00:45:05,714 --> 00:45:08,538
Try to meditate for at least 10 minutes every day.

943
00:45:10,494 --> 00:45:13,717
All right, when pressures mount and stress rises,

944
00:45:13,717 --> 00:45:15,279
our bodies release three chemicals

945
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,941
to respond to the perceived threat.

946
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:19,643
These chemicals are adrenaline, norepinephrine,

947
00:45:19,643 --> 00:45:20,925
and cortisol.

948
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:23,567
Adrenaline and norepinephrine are released first.

949
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:27,952
These two chemicals narrow our decision-making ability

950
00:45:27,952 --> 00:45:30,474
to get us to make one of two choices, fight or flight.

951
00:45:30,474 --> 00:45:32,537
This limits our ability to think rationally.

952
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:34,939
Cortisol is even more dangerous.

953
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:37,021
Cortisol is the response the body produces

954
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:39,023
when the perceived threat lingers.

955
00:45:39,023 --> 00:45:41,765
Lingering threats happen all the time in game development

956
00:45:41,765 --> 00:45:44,148
because our problems take time to resolve.

957
00:45:44,148 --> 00:45:45,889
And cortisol elevates blood pressure

958
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:47,511
and depletes blood sugar levels.

959
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,173
Over time, this leads to high blood pressure,

960
00:45:50,173 --> 00:45:51,935
hypertension, and even weight gain.

961
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,240
As producers, we need to keep our wits about us to make effective decisions.

962
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,785
So our focus must be placed on returning ourselves to a state of calm.

963
00:45:59,785 --> 00:46:04,150
To return to calm quickly, our brains need a set of operations during stressful situations.

964
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,312
When stress is triggered first...

965
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,084
Breathe deeply to regulate your anxiety, rather.

966
00:46:12,084 --> 00:46:13,947
Seven seconds in through your nose,

967
00:46:13,947 --> 00:46:16,451
seven seconds out through your nose.

968
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:18,073
Count the seconds in your head,

969
00:46:18,073 --> 00:46:20,036
but if you're in front of other people,

970
00:46:20,036 --> 00:46:20,858
don't make it weird.

971
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:23,021
You should be able to do this without other people noticing.

972
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:27,024
Next, take inventory of yourself.

973
00:46:27,024 --> 00:46:28,245
Look inside.

974
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:30,405
Are all your primary needs being met?

975
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:33,326
If yes, you have everything you need to solve the problem.

976
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:34,966
There is nothing to run from.

977
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:36,567
This will help you stay calm

978
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:39,207
and lower the amount of cortisol and norepinephrine

979
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:40,848
that are being released in your body.

980
00:46:40,848 --> 00:46:41,308
Gain perspective.

981
00:46:41,308 --> 00:46:42,448
Five years from now,

982
00:46:42,448 --> 00:46:46,089
you probably won't remember why you're stressed.

983
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:48,970
Maintaining perspective will help you stay focused.

984
00:46:50,943 --> 00:46:53,245
Focus on problems you can only solve now.

985
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:56,286
Nothing spikes cortisol levels like dwelling on problems

986
00:46:56,286 --> 00:46:59,507
that are too big to tackle all at once.

987
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:01,868
Only spend your time on the problems that you can solve.

988
00:47:01,868 --> 00:47:05,490
You are in control of your own mind, nobody else.

989
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,251
Ignore items outside of your control

990
00:47:07,251 --> 00:47:09,592
and don't get worked up about the what ifs.

991
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:11,133
If you run this set of operations

992
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:13,554
every time you are presented with a stressful situation,

993
00:47:13,554 --> 00:47:15,014
you will significantly limit

994
00:47:15,014 --> 00:47:16,815
your body's natural response to stress.

995
00:47:18,224 --> 00:47:22,487
I recommend the book Crucial Conversations for advice on discussing difficult subjects

996
00:47:22,487 --> 00:47:23,528
with difficult people.

997
00:47:23,528 --> 00:47:28,251
The obstacle is the way for an intro into stoic philosophy and mindset for improving

998
00:47:28,251 --> 00:47:30,092
your internal dialogue and governing beliefs.

999
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:34,795
To master all of these skills, practice and time is necessary, but how you implement is

1000
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:37,977
just as important as what you implement.

1001
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:42,369
My wife hates that I weigh myself every morning.

1002
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:44,251
She thinks I'm obsessed with my weight.

1003
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:46,173
The truth is I weigh myself as,

1004
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:48,756
weighing myself is my keystone habit.

1005
00:47:48,756 --> 00:47:50,537
A keystone habit is one habit

1006
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:53,260
that all other habits are built off of.

1007
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,042
Weighing myself in the morning when I first wake up

1008
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,583
gives me the motivation to stay on track

1009
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,864
with my health goals.

1010
00:47:57,864 --> 00:47:59,026
I don't want to wake up tomorrow

1011
00:47:59,026 --> 00:48:00,447
and see my progress evaporate

1012
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:02,809
and that motivates me to go to the gym and eat healthy.

1013
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,571
Eating healthy and going to the gym keeps me disciplined,

1014
00:48:06,571 --> 00:48:09,012
and that discipline spreads through the rest of my day.

1015
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:12,634
My weight is also a metric by which I can gauge progress.

1016
00:48:12,634 --> 00:48:14,835
When I first started working on improving my habits,

1017
00:48:14,835 --> 00:48:18,216
I eliminated soda from my diet.

1018
00:48:18,216 --> 00:48:20,317
When I succeeded at this, I got overly excited

1019
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:23,678
and tried to implement multiple habits at once.

1020
00:48:23,678 --> 00:48:25,859
It was too much for me, and I failed miserably.

1021
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,240
So I went back to trying to implement one habit at a time.

1022
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,941
This allowed me to focus on making new habits stick.

1023
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,182
I have noticed that there is no easy way to predict

1024
00:48:34,182 --> 00:48:36,083
how much time it takes to reinforce a habit.

1025
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,264
Some habits will take hold immediately

1026
00:48:38,264 --> 00:48:40,105
and others will take a long time.

1027
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:43,367
Give your new habit time to take hold in your life

1028
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:45,067
before moving on to the next one.

1029
00:48:45,067 --> 00:48:47,749
Be aware of how you're reacting to a new habit.

1030
00:48:47,749 --> 00:48:50,150
If you dread performing that habit every day,

1031
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,331
try something different to achieve the same effect.

1032
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:56,627
Build your habits into routine by doing the habits every day.

1033
00:48:56,627 --> 00:48:58,127
When something becomes a routine,

1034
00:48:58,127 --> 00:49:00,748
it takes very little willpower to maintain.

1035
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:03,088
This will come in handy during prolonged times of stress,

1036
00:49:03,088 --> 00:49:03,869
like crunch.

1037
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:06,289
If you build a hopes routine, you

1038
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:07,909
will come to rely on its power in your daily life.

1039
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:11,110
While most days will be easy to maintain,

1040
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,910
some days will be more trying than others.

1041
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,551
Fight the urge to give up the routine,

1042
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,491
because when it starts to erode, it's hard to get back on track.

1043
00:49:17,491 --> 00:49:20,452
Routines thrive on momentum, so don't let

1044
00:49:20,452 --> 00:49:21,592
anything disrupt your rhythm.

1045
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:25,511
I recommend the book, The Power of Habits,

1046
00:49:25,511 --> 00:49:27,112
for more on how to make habits stick

1047
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:28,692
and the app momentum to help you

1048
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:30,052
build your habits into routines.

1049
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:30,913
Thanks for listening.

1050
00:49:30,913 --> 00:49:32,913
I'm always looking for people to talk to you

1051
00:49:32,913 --> 00:49:34,334
in like-minded individuals.

1052
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:34,614
Oops.

1053
00:49:34,614 --> 00:49:36,154
Feel free to contact me.

1054
00:49:36,154 --> 00:49:36,654
All right.

1055
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:36,934
Thank you.

1056
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:37,335
Thank you.

1057
00:49:37,335 --> 00:49:37,775
Thank you.

1058
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:38,095
Thank you.

1059
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:38,935
Thank you.

1060
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:39,175
Thank you.

1061
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:39,555
Thank you.

1062
00:49:39,555 --> 00:49:39,915
Thank you.

1063
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:40,175
Thank you.

1064
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:40,415
Thank you.

1065
00:49:40,415 --> 00:49:40,636
Thank you.

1066
00:49:40,636 --> 00:49:45,937
Thank you.

1067
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:46,337
Thank you.

1068
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:48,855
It's break time again.

1069
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:51,518
All right, everybody stand up.

1070
00:49:51,518 --> 00:49:52,779
Talk to each other for a few minutes.

1071
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:53,780
And then if you have a question,

1072
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,882
we'll have a little bit of time for Q&A.

1073
00:49:54,882 --> 00:50:02,910
All right.

1074
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,553
I hope from our talk,

1075
00:50:05,553 --> 00:50:07,034
you have realized that as a producer,

1076
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:09,016
we work at the hearts of the team,

1077
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:10,318
not just at the heart of the team.

1078
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:12,795
Now we don't have a ton of time for questions.

1079
00:50:12,795 --> 00:50:13,895
We have about five minutes.

1080
00:50:13,895 --> 00:50:15,596
But we will take a few.

1081
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,037
And then as soon as we're out of time,

1082
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:19,257
we'll step out into the hallway.

1083
00:50:19,257 --> 00:50:20,877
So if you have any questions, feel

1084
00:50:20,877 --> 00:50:24,258
free to come up to the microphone and ask them.

1085
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:27,279
If not, we'll all sit and stand here awkwardly

1086
00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:27,839
for the next few minutes.

1087
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,180
There's a microphone back there and over there.

1088
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,320
Go ahead.

1089
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:31,440
Hey.

1090
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,061
I'm wondering about the synchronized movement

1091
00:50:34,061 --> 00:50:36,802
you were talking about and what to do with team members that

1092
00:50:36,802 --> 00:50:39,983
are shy or not comfortable doing anything like that.

1093
00:50:40,423 --> 00:50:44,665
Yeah, most people are really uncomfortable doing it the first time, right?

1094
00:50:44,665 --> 00:50:49,508
So what I found is I'm just like really goofy about it and really kind of act like an idiot.

1095
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:51,489
And I'm like, hey guys, check this out.

1096
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:54,830
And then like you start doing it and then people kind of will get into it.

1097
00:50:54,830 --> 00:51:00,993
So it's more of kind of putting yourself out there and being like, hey, just try this once with me.

1098
00:51:00,993 --> 00:51:02,854
And then people will kind of start to get into it.

1099
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:05,575
Karaoke is like really the most extreme case, right?

1100
00:51:05,575 --> 00:51:08,276
Especially for someone shy, that is like a nightmare as much as.

1101
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:11,259
it was for the four of us to get up here and open ourselves up.

1102
00:51:11,259 --> 00:51:15,564
So I would start with just very simple movement things and stuff like that.

1103
00:51:15,564 --> 00:51:16,325
Okay, thank you.

1104
00:51:16,325 --> 00:51:16,605
Thank you.

1105
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:19,248
I have a hypothetical for you. Are you ready?

1106
00:51:19,248 --> 00:51:19,588
Yeah.

1107
00:51:19,588 --> 00:51:25,755
Alright, everything you've just talked about, but your entire team is spread all over the planet

1108
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:29,178
and very rarely gets to see each other in person. What do you do?

1109
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:31,100
Anybody have any thoughts on that?

1110
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:38,468
Basically he was asking how do you do this if you have a team all over the world.

1111
00:51:38,468 --> 00:51:45,532
So I've done this a bit. The first thing I did was I went to basically everybody.

1112
00:51:45,532 --> 00:51:49,654
So I flew out to other countries and got to know people.

1113
00:51:49,654 --> 00:51:53,956
I basically spent a week with the team and just sat in a room and they came and talked to me.

1114
00:51:53,956 --> 00:51:55,417
Kind of like what Michelle was talking about.

1115
00:51:56,438 --> 00:52:01,239
having synchronized meetings, one or two a week is really

1116
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:05,301
good. And having that time be a sharing time, not just we're

1117
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:07,001
going to talk about what work we're doing but we're going to

1118
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:11,943
share a little bit about ourselves. When I originally

1119
00:52:11,943 --> 00:52:16,684
talked about the pedicure stuff, I've talked to a few studios

1120
00:52:16,684 --> 00:52:19,445
where every meeting, team meeting they have, they do one

1121
00:52:19,445 --> 00:52:22,466
or two people and go through that way. So that could be part

1122
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:23,086
of how you do that.

1123
00:52:23,086 --> 00:52:24,166
Is this the microphone? Okay, cool.

1124
00:52:25,607 --> 00:52:36,129
So for Tearaway Unfolded, half of our team were based in Sweden, half were at MM, so we worked with another studio, all on the same code base.

1125
00:52:36,129 --> 00:52:43,691
So in order to keep our weekly rhythm, communication was the biggest thing, because there was only a one hour time difference,

1126
00:52:43,691 --> 00:52:50,472
but we tried to find tools that would actually help us get together and make it feel like we're all in the same room.

1127
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:57,616
So we used Skype. Skype was actually awesome because we could do like screen sharing, group chats.

1128
00:52:57,616 --> 00:53:03,359
Basically, we just did things like we had like an iPad that was in the room with like one of our guys who's based in

1129
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,922
Paris, like one of our level designers at MM is based in Paris, so we always have him like

1130
00:53:07,922 --> 00:53:13,705
connected in some way. And then for the team that were in Sweden, like we always had them on Skype in some way.

1131
00:53:13,705 --> 00:53:14,546
And it's really hard.

1132
00:53:15,146 --> 00:53:24,530
did break down at times, but it's basically really important to try and keep that moving and keep the visibility.

1133
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:30,892
Email as well, but email can be really distracting when people just use it as a way to have conversations and go off on tangents.

1134
00:53:30,892 --> 00:53:37,475
So just bringing that back and as a producer, trying to make sure that everybody has the right information,

1135
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:39,535
so presenting it back to them and keeping...

1136
00:53:39,535 --> 00:53:43,917
Well, I'm just going to use our weekly rhythm and flow because actually it really, really worked with...

1137
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:48,424
making sure people knew what to expect and what was happening.

1138
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,984
But yeah, it's just something to work out.

1139
00:53:50,984 --> 00:53:51,204
Cool.

1140
00:53:51,204 --> 00:53:52,585
All right, over here.

1141
00:53:52,585 --> 00:53:54,325
Hi, I'm Caroline.

1142
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:55,645
Thanks all for all your talks.

1143
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:56,425
They were really good.

1144
00:53:56,425 --> 00:53:56,906
Thank you.

1145
00:53:56,906 --> 00:53:57,506
Thanks again.

1146
00:53:57,506 --> 00:54:01,346
I've got a bit of a personal question for Greg

1147
00:54:01,346 --> 00:54:03,247
about what you just presented.

1148
00:54:03,247 --> 00:54:04,167
That must have been scary.

1149
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:07,508
How did you deal with it to your team?

1150
00:54:07,508 --> 00:54:09,668
How did you communicate it to your colleagues?

1151
00:54:09,668 --> 00:54:10,948
Did you keep it for yourself?

1152
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,448
Or were you just openly about it?

1153
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:15,409
And how long did that take for you to get back on your feet?

1154
00:54:16,377 --> 00:54:18,219
Well, I guess Grant could probably

1155
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:20,682
answer that as good as I could, because we were working

1156
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:21,883
together at the time.

1157
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,727
But I'm pretty sure I kept most of that to myself.

1158
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:26,769
I don't think most of that was aware.

1159
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,851
Most people were aware of that.

1160
00:54:28,851 --> 00:54:32,095
And it really came down to trying

1161
00:54:32,095 --> 00:54:35,839
to make sure that I wasn't panicking the team.

1162
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:36,500
OK, thank you.

1163
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,161
No problem.

1164
00:54:39,295 --> 00:54:42,417
Sorry the world isn't made for adults that are five feet tall.

1165
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:46,720
I, so I have a question.

1166
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,283
I think it may be mostly directed towards Michelle, just because you sort of spoke to it.

1167
00:54:52,283 --> 00:54:54,364
So I'm a huge, huge, huge advocate about

1168
00:54:54,364 --> 00:54:56,886
just really being in touch with your team

1169
00:54:56,886 --> 00:55:00,368
in terms of like how they're feeling and things like that because you have a way

1170
00:55:00,368 --> 00:55:03,430
better sense of what they'll be able to accomplish in the timeline that you have

1171
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,870
based on.

1172
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,651
like interpersonal and all that kind of stuff.

1173
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:09,412
And like I am that person that they can come to.

1174
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:12,793
So sort of a little bit of advice in terms of like

1175
00:55:12,793 --> 00:55:15,094
if they come to me and they have a problem

1176
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:17,515
like it will personally affect me and all that kind of stuff.

1177
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:20,636
But it's like working and then being sort of

1178
00:55:20,636 --> 00:55:22,616
interrupted to talk to them, which I'm fine to do.

1179
00:55:22,616 --> 00:55:24,697
But sometimes when I sit back down, I have a hard time

1180
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:26,638
like getting back into what I was doing.

1181
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:29,921
Do you guys have any advice for just getting right back into it?

1182
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:36,069
Because often my thoughts will just linger a bit and sometimes it distracts me when I'm getting pulled away so often.

1183
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:39,292
Do you mean breaking your flow?

1184
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:39,653
Yeah.

1185
00:55:39,653 --> 00:55:40,053
Okay.

1186
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:44,238
I, personally, I find writing a list for myself every single morning is really, really useful.

1187
00:55:45,299 --> 00:55:49,361
I basically used to keep notebooks that I would just keep writing everything down in

1188
00:55:49,361 --> 00:55:52,622
and then I've managed to kind of reduce that down to having a page a day diary

1189
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:55,043
and it's just really handy.

1190
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:58,585
Beginning of the day, as soon as I get in, get my coffee, I sit down,

1191
00:55:58,585 --> 00:56:01,326
I go through my list or I rewrite my list.

00:56:01,326 --> 00:56:05,208
I'm constantly rewriting my list, crossing stuff out.

1193
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:11,071
If anything kind of crops up, like I've always got that, that's like my one thing that I go to.

1194
00:56:11,887 --> 00:56:16,991
All right, so we're actually out of time. But we will be out in the hallway talking. First off I

1195
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:20,974
want to thank all of you for coming. I want to thank a few people for the help they gave us.

1196
00:56:20,974 --> 00:56:25,957
Siobhan Reddy, Garth DeAngelis, Kim Swift and everyone else who listened and gave us feedback.

1197
00:56:25,957 --> 00:56:30,721
I also want to thank the awesome CAs who worked today's session, Cody, Josh, Renee and Keith.

1198
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:34,664
And of course the amazing AV team. Thanks again and we'll be out in the hallway if you have any

1199
00:56:34,664 --> 00:56:35,165
questions.
