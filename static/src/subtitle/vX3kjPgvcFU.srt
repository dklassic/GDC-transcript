1
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:04,507
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:04,987 --> 00:00:06,008
Happy to see so many people.

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,331
How many of you in here are game developers?

4
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:13,873
A majority?

5
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:15,094
How many are press?

6
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:18,576
And others?

7
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:21,898
OK, cool.

8
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:25,320
How many of the game developers are more than 20 people?

9
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:29,963
OK, cool.

10
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:36,967
When I'm not on stage here at GDC, my everyday job is to lead a company called Paradox Interactive,

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,569
which I've been doing for close to 11 years.

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,252
Actually, exactly 11 years now, August 15.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,954
So it's some sort of celebration.

14
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,242
Today I was going to talk about the impact of cloning of games

15
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:52,844
and how to stand out.

16
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:55,146
And the more I dug into this presentation,

17
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:58,029
the more I figured out that from a management

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,512
and conceptual perspective, standing out

19
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:02,454
is a very, very interesting issue.

20
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:05,757
And everyone who knows me, everyone who worked with me,

21
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,160
knows that I'm not a programmer.

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,923
I'm a crappy game designer, and I'm an even worse artist.

23
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:19,689
So if you take that as a statement, because it is a statement, it's actually true, then

24
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,810
you can listen to this from a management perspective.

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,154
I'm specializing in business development, in contracts, and in everything that impacts

26
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:31,217
your company and your games, except for maybe the game itself.

27
00:01:31,898 --> 00:01:34,799
I've worked with acquisition of games for seven years.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,961
I've worked with contracts and business for 11 years.

29
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,862
So I see a lot of gaming concepts.

30
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:42,143
I think I know what I like.

31
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:43,924
I play a lot of games.

32
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:47,226
I have over 1,000 hours logged into League of Legends.

33
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:50,968
So I'm an avid gamer, but everything else is business.

34
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:56,290
And standing out in the market today, if you take

35
00:01:57,802 --> 00:02:00,663
10 years ago, everything was very, very,

36
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:03,324
there were bottlenecks in the market everywhere.

37
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,045
So on the consoles, not even we at Paradox

38
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:08,666
could publish a console game because it was too expensive.

39
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:11,027
There were too many green light committees

40
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:13,369
and Microsoft and Sony, and everything

41
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:15,850
was just high budget and really high to get into.

42
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,731
Steam used to have their green light up until half a year,

43
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:19,651
a year ago or something.

44
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:23,646
So when mobile came and took the market by storm,

45
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:25,528
everyone started opening up.

46
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:28,511
It started with Steam, who accepted more and more games.

47
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:31,774
And when they let go of Greenlight,

48
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:35,298
there were 75 PC games released the same day,

49
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,440
which must be some sort of new world record.

50
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,301
The same goes for consoles.

51
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:42,942
Even Microsoft and Sony are now saying

52
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:46,384
that we want to support indies, which essentially means

53
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:49,425
we want to have more games on our platforms, which

54
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,566
in itself means that competition is

55
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:52,867
going to be even more fierce.

56
00:02:54,987 --> 00:03:00,850
And I'm going to talk from all these successes

57
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,431
and all the failures that we've had at Paradox as well.

58
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:06,353
So I'm going to share some anecdotes and some stories

59
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:08,293
on my 11 years of running this company.

60
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,685
So like I said about me, I'm the CEO and principal owner

61
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:16,165
of Paradox.

62
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:20,869
I have shipped over 70 games in the last 10 years.

63
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,893
And five of those franchises eventually

64
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:27,154
became million sellers.

65
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,177
And my specialization here today is mostly business development.

66
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,119
So I'm going to talk about this subject

67
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,241
in a very conceptual way.

68
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:38,143
And you'll have, hopefully, at least 10 minutes in the end

69
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:40,725
to ask me questions about how I see the market

70
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,007
and where we're going.

71
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:46,773
And Paradox Interactive as a company,

72
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,455
I'm not sure if everyone is familiar with us,

73
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:52,059
but we're a fast-growing, hardcore publisher of games.

74
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,102
We've been growing with 36% a year since 2008.

75
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:59,726
On the PC platform, which makes it a bit less sexy

76
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:02,129
because the focus on the market in the last five, six years

77
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,191
has been mobile growth, where a lot of company

78
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:05,953
has made some really great successes.

79
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,439
So we took advantage of the Steam system,

80
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,204
of digital download on PC, and grew really quickly

81
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:14,769
with our current franchises and built some new franchises

82
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:15,430
on that as well.

83
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:17,494
Today we're over 150 people.

84
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:24,435
across three offices and our headquarter is in Stockholm, Sweden. We have four internal

85
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:29,996
studios working on seven different games at the moment. And we have another ten studios

86
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,617
that are working for us on contract, meaning another 200 people who are making games for

87
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:40,079
us on a daily basis. These studios are based in UK, Brazil, Finland, the United States,

88
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:48,121
basically all over the Western world. So we're really used to working internationally.

89
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:48,521
If you take

90
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:54,589
Cloning of games. I mean everyone is borrowing from everyone in this industry. We know that we do that at times

91
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:58,530
Sometimes we'll look at things once I was in a meeting with a guy who said

92
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:06,171
You know what the diplomacy system is this game in this game is taken from a game called Europa Universalis

93
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:07,192
Do you know that game?

94
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:12,553
So I looked at him and then he looked at me and I looked back and he looked at me and said oh, yeah

95
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:13,273
You made that game

96
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:15,564
That's how it goes, right?

97
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:17,186
So everyone is borrowing from everyone.

98
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:21,592
So I looked into the history, like, for how long have people been stealing games from

99
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:22,013
each other?

100
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,074
Because it's really interesting.

101
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:31,004
The first game that was actually accused of stealing was no other than Atari's game Pong.

102
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:34,995
Many people think that Pong was the first game actually in history,

103
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:40,038
but it turns out that a console called the Magnavox Odyssey

104
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:43,520
released a game called Tennis two years before Pong.

105
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,542
So they threatened to sue Atari and take them to court,

106
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:50,484
and Atari settled outside court, licensed the game,

107
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:52,586
and released Pong, and the rest is history.

108
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:59,212
So it starts in 1972, actually, and then it just falls in a line with more or less successful

109
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:00,113
clones of other games.

110
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:03,115
If you take games like Space Invaders, there are 20 differentâ€¦

111
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:10,534
Clones of that, you have Asteroids that were early in the market, we talk early arcade days.

112
00:06:11,394 --> 00:06:16,517
But other games that spawned not only clones, but entire genres are

113
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:21,961
Defense of the Ancients, as you know, DOTA, which was a Warcraft 3 mod to begin with,

114
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:27,244
Super Mario Bros, Guitar Freaks that turned into a whole music genre as well,

115
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,485
with rock band, guitar hero, whatnot.

116
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:31,346
And, of course, numerous...

117
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:38,494
mobile games as well. In mobile you don't only borrow the game concept but you also steal the name.

118
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:47,641
There are 20 different temple runs, temple jump, temple hide, just to try to fool the iTunes system of searching.

119
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:55,547
Same goes for a Flappy Bird, which is not really my type of game, but I found on my iPad when I

120
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:59,070
lent it to one of my kids, I found a game called Splashy Fish.

121
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,179
So I thought, wow, this is really terrible.

122
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,880
It's like taking terrible to a new level.

123
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,961
So I actually played some Splashy Fish as well.

124
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:07,861
I got to level 63.

125
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:15,304
Is this, then, is this necessarily something bad?

126
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:18,225
Is it bad to borrow other people's ideas,

127
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:20,766
being inspired by what other people are doing?

128
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,069
I would say that, no, it's not really.

129
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,530
It's actually helping our business going forward.

130
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,011
Newton said that, when you're standing

131
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:30,272
on the shoulder of giants,

132
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,573
it's much easier to make new inventions.

133
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,814
So his idea that other people invented things first

134
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,795
and then you refine them throughout history.

135
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:39,736
And the same goes actually for games,

136
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:40,876
at least if you ask me.

137
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:51,289
In brief, you can say that if you borrow something,

138
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,893
it's a shortcut to approved gameplay, approved market,

139
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:56,875
maybe even a proven business model

140
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:58,897
that you see that works for other people,

141
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:02,001
and therefore you want to emulate it and be inspired by it.

142
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:09,642
But there are also different ways of actually going into a market if you want to borrow a concept from someone.

143
00:08:09,662 --> 00:08:16,086
You can do like the guy who was in a meeting with me and said they took the whole diplomacy system from Europa Universalis.

144
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:18,468
Now, that is just taking one of the features.

145
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,709
If you do a direct copy of the game...

146
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:25,836
It's typically to ride on a genre that is very popular at the moment.

147
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:30,458
You see the MOBA genre that most of the games look and feel almost the same.

148
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,361
And they're trying to spin off on the same that people already know the gameplay,

149
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:36,222
they already know how to pay for the games,

150
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:41,605
they already know how the whole system of eSports work within that genre.

151
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,226
So it's a smart way to do it.

152
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:45,607
But there are also some challenges and...

153
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:48,944
and some advantages in doing that.

154
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:50,244
I'll get back to that later.

155
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,446
Inspired by is a good way to say that you take inspiration

156
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:56,146
from other people.

157
00:08:56,906 --> 00:09:00,047
It's typically a homage to another title,

158
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:02,488
something that plays a bit with the original.

159
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:06,550
And in all other aspects, it's a game totally on itself.

160
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:12,729
And a spiritual successor is actually a good way to go into this market,

161
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,172
because a spiritual successor typically aims at an abandoned genre,

162
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:22,415
with abandoned games, where people are dreaming of the old glory days of gaming.

163
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:24,916
And when you bring back a game in that genre,

164
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:29,498
people are going to hail you as a savior who's doing something not entirely new,

165
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:34,321
but at least something that adds to an underserved audience and an underserved niche.

166
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:41,127
So if you're going into, we're in these situations daily,

167
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,769
you look at your game concept and say,

168
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,992
okay, so what am I gonna do with my game?

169
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:47,635
How much can I be inspired by other people?

170
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:52,641
How do I need to work to make my game stand out?

171
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:54,443
No matter the.

172
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:59,405
actual gameplay value and the actual things you do in the game.

173
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:03,706
And that's where I come in typically because we work a lot of paradox with

174
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:08,769
taking the game aside saying how do we make the game stand out

175
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:16,432
communication wise from a company standpoint and in all other aspects that are not typically gameplay related.

176
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:27,863
Basically, making sure that you communicate the personality of the game instead of what you're actually doing.

177
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:38,257
So if you walk into the pros and cons when you go into this market inspired by market

178
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:43,804
Why people do this is that they know what the market size roughly is.

179
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:49,629
When you hear that Candy Crush Saga has over 100 million daily or monthly users,

180
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,512
it's very tempting to go into that area.

181
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,033
It's a known market size.

182
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:59,638
The market size for that type of game is at least 100 million players if you hit the right mark.

183
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:06,648
It also has a proven game design, which means that people know what they're supposed to do in the game.

184
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:12,093
So Candy Crash is in many ways borrowed from many other games.

185
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:17,258
Like, Match 3 is something that I think Bejeweled did at least 20 years ago.

186
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,884
But refining it, making it new, repackaging it, making it a bit more fun for people to play,

187
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:28,148
makes it a 100 million monthly user game.

188
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:32,842
Hmm.

189
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:34,516
Let's see.

190
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:50,979
The quality benchmark, obviously, you can look at what other people have done and say

191
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:55,664
this is the actual quality that they have, this is what we're striving for as well.

192
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:58,808
And you can also use this to remove things from the game.

193
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,493
And I'm going to get back to some examples of that later on as well.

194
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,352
There are also, of course, backsides.

195
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:12,094
When you get inspired by a game, when you walk into a new area

196
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:14,876
and you see that you take certain gameplay

197
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:17,497
elements from other people, what are going to happen?

198
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:21,399
First of all, journalists and gamers,

199
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,181
they always say that they want new things.

200
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,402
They want new concepts.

201
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:28,623
They want something that stands out in the gameplay itself.

202
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:29,464
Well.

203
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:33,222
To be honest, this industry is a bit conservative.

204
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,163
It's to be so young.

205
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:36,783
It's very conservative, and people

206
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,584
will be very entitled about what you guys are doing as soon

207
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:41,845
as you walk into this territory.

208
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:44,065
So the first thing that is going to happen

209
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:47,566
if you walk into the territory of borrowing a bit

210
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:50,167
or inspired by is the PR challenge.

211
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,848
Because journalists are going to ask you, like, so,

212
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:54,208
what game is this?

213
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:56,229
Compare this to another game.

214
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,571
Because you never get away with saying,

215
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:00,993
well, this is a game that is totally unique

216
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,175
and stands on its own feet.

217
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,297
A paradox will always get that question.

218
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,620
So, what other game is this game like?

219
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,783
There are a few ways to get out of that question.

220
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:12,045
And there are a few methods.

221
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,227
So I'm going to come to the method chapter later on.

222
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:16,129
But that's the first question that comes up.

223
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,751
And that's something you have to be prepared for.

224
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:21,030
Because the press say they want new things.

225
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:24,433
Truth is, they actually are pretty nostalgic.

226
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:29,117
There is a reason why there are so many retro gaming shows

227
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:32,520
and why there are so many people talking about the best

228
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,741
games from the 90s and everything like that.

229
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:38,544
You can also, if you go into this,

230
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,987
you can inherit a very demanding target audience.

231
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,905
So people see that you're doing something that they recognize,

232
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,427
and they want to be a part of that.

233
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:51,489
Because they say, I played the game

234
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,991
that you're basing your game on for 10 years.

235
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,712
And I played 2,000 hours.

236
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,735
So I can probably design this game better than you can.

237
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:02,638
So that is also a challenge, the demanding target audience.

238
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:05,380
They're your best friends in some ways.

239
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,362
And in some ways, they're very, very challenging to handle.

240
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:09,623
I have one example of that.

241
00:14:10,842 --> 00:14:12,463
We actually bought an IP.

242
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:20,508
It was not even an inspired buy, or a clone, or something that was actually taken from someone else.

243
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:23,911
We bought an IP, it was Majesty, the Fantasy Kingdom sim.

244
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:25,052
Did anyone play that?

245
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:28,034
Yeah?

246
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:30,415
We made Majesty 2, did anyone play that as well?

247
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,577
Yeah, cool, good to hear.

248
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:38,274
And the first thing that happened was that we got approached by a lot of fans, saying like,

249
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:42,896
you have to do this, you have to do that, you have to do this. And this is like seven years ago,

250
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:48,079
I think. And we said, you know what, we're great game designers, we can do whatever we want to do,

251
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,482
so shut up and stay on the forums. And we did not communicate that well with the audience.

252
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:57,481
So what happened was that, first of all, they made up a lot of conspiracy theories

253
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,142
about what we were actually going to destroy in this game,

254
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:04,525
because our intention, obviously, was to destroy the franchise when we bought it.

255
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:07,147
Right? That's why you buy a franchise.

256
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,447
It's to completely destroy it.

257
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,849
Same thing happened with Star Wars and Disney, actually, when they're out like,

258
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,430
oh, now they're going to destroy it.

259
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,352
Yeah. If you put $7 billion into something,

260
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:19,194
your first idea is obviously to flush it down the toilet.

261
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:19,634
Right?

262
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:25,550
The problem with that is that if you don't communicate with people like we did not do

263
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,492
about that, they're going to be very conspirational.

264
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:34,934
So they're going to come up with shit that you think is the JFK murder again.

265
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:39,616
So what happened was that we released the game, the target audience was really pissed

266
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:44,298
off because they said all the terrible things we just couldn't imagine how terrible they

267
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:44,558
were.

268
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:45,878
You actually implemented it.

269
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,020
But it wasn't actually true because they thought a lot worse than that.

270
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:56,019
But even worse was that every time a positive gamer came into our forums and said,

271
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,080
you know what, I really like this game, but I got stuck at level 8.

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,301
He was jumped by this crowd who just tore him apart and said,

273
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:05,422
how can you like this game? It's shit!

274
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:08,723
There you go. That's your demanding audience.

275
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:15,626
Same thing is going to happen if you move into something that is, say, dungeon-keeper-esque.

276
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:18,467
You just inherit the audience. Right?

277
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,860
Now Dungeon Keeper is a bad example and you all know why.

278
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:27,384
On the other hand, you can get away with cloning as well.

279
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:34,790
Because the negative perception is much less in certain areas and we've seen this as well.

280
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,892
First of all, low engagement target audiences.

281
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:38,853
We're talking mobile.

282
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:42,155
There's a reason why it works to steal other people's...

283
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,555
names and steal other people's gaming concepts on mobile.

284
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:47,936
Splashy Fish, for example.

285
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:51,038
It's because people are not that engaged.

286
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,420
There is no diehard fan of Flappy Birds.

287
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,663
Who's going to write like 10 pages on a forum

288
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,643
about Flappy Birds?

289
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:01,606
Maybe a Flappy Birds convention, though.

290
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:02,967
On the other hand, you never know.

291
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:05,969
But when it comes to, for example, Minecraft,

292
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,310
it's a totally different story.

293
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,793
There's also something called underserved niches.

294
00:17:12,193 --> 00:17:12,994
Is this mic turned off?

295
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:16,206
Nowadays, yeah, cool.

296
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,790
And these are niches where people still

297
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,431
are craving a lot of content.

298
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:26,615
There are like, you can take for example,

299
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:29,337
city building is a good example right now.

300
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:32,259
Because you all know what happened to SimCity 5.

301
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,402
If that had been a huge success, the market

302
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,244
would have been totally taken by EA.

303
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:40,246
Now the market is totally open.

304
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,848
And we're getting back to SimCity 5 as well.

305
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:49,535
I think another underserved niche are simulators in general.

306
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:54,378
I would say that flight simulator is another niche that probably could be filled by this.

307
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:59,340
It's a bit of a stretch budget-wise to make a flight simulator, but for anyone who could,

308
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,822
you'll inherit a lot of bonus fans and you'll be alone in the market.

309
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:13,060
My own guess is that space is the new thing.

310
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,721
So if you want to release a space game,

311
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:17,622
I think you should do it before 2016.

312
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:21,064
Because I think the space is what people are doing right now.

313
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:24,946
You know, black holes, and wormholes in space, and all that.

314
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:25,706
Quack.

315
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:39,074
I was talking about target audience and how to work with the target audience.

316
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:45,221
The target audience that you inherit, I now assume that you make something that at least

317
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:49,065
can be seen as something that is similar to something else.

318
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:55,812
They will have very specific ideas of what you can do with your game.

319
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:57,944
We know that at Paradox.

320
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:00,585
When we started making Hearts of Iron 4,

321
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,147
a lot of people, or if it was Hearts of Iron 3,

322
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:05,128
I have one of the Hearts of Iron 4 developers here,

323
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:06,849
so I'm not sure which game it actually was.

324
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:08,169
It was in the Hearts of Iron series.

325
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,310
We presented a new screenshot,

326
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:13,232
and first comment was this, this is not Hearts of Iron.

327
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,673
This is not hard to find.

328
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,834
Like, make it the real game.

329
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:19,095
Like, make it the game we actually own.

330
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:23,377
So our fans have a very specific feeling

331
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,119
that they own our franchises, which is a good thing.

332
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,260
It makes them loyal, but it also puts a lot of pressure

333
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,422
on us both to deliver and to communicate.

334
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,591
They will have ideas about your game design.

335
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:39,992
They will have ideas about how you conduct your business.

336
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:44,133
They will have ideas about the price point, the DLC plan,

337
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:47,534
how you patch the game, essentially everything.

338
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:52,716
So how do you put all of this together,

339
00:19:53,116 --> 00:19:55,397
get the customers on your side, and work

340
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:58,478
in a methodological way to actually stand out

341
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:01,638
in the market, given the assumptions that we have here?

342
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,621
First of all, I was not gonna touch that much

343
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:13,624
on game design, but I'm gonna at least mention it

344
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:15,146
because it's an important way.

345
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:18,148
I'm gonna mention it from a methodological standpoint.

346
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,543
Standing out basically is making people believe

347
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:27,786
that you do things that no one has ever done before.

348
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:31,128
And it can be done in a few different ways.

349
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,711
This is actually how we do things at Paradox.

350
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:37,494
We try to imagine what people are doing

351
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:39,335
when they're not playing the game,

352
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:41,077
just imagining the game.

353
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:43,499
So of course, in game design,

354
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,360
you can make your character stand out.

355
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,062
We try to do that for every game.

356
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:49,023
How many in here played Magicka?

357
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:53,380
Quite a few.

358
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,822
And how many would recognize a Magicka wizard if you saw one on the street?

359
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,583
That's even more people.

360
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:02,664
That's a good job from our marketing department.

361
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:04,525
That kind of proves my point.

362
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:11,868
If you see someone cosplaying as your game, what do they dress in then?

363
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:16,050
My absolute favorite cosplay for me would be Super Meat Boy.

364
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,112
I would love that costume, the full Super Meat Boy costume.

365
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:24,377
I'm not going for the t-shirt here, because that's beautiful too, but the full Super Meat Boy outfit.

366
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:26,658
That is really interesting.

367
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:32,200
So the characters in your game, how do they stand out and how are they a character in

368
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,620
itself?

369
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,782
So when they walk on the street, people will recognize and say, wow, Magicka, or who?

370
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:38,842
That's Gears of War.

371
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:40,323
Very important.

372
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:43,464
Same goes for art and level design.

373
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:46,965
You should almost see on the colors that it's your game, obviously.

374
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:50,937
On the marketing side, we released,

375
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:55,099
that is also interesting to see that we invent characters

376
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,440
not only in our games, but also in everything else we do,

377
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,101
in the communication, in the trailers that we do,

378
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,402
in everything that has to do with the game.

379
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:08,243
How many saw the trailer for our game Leviathan Warships?

380
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:09,624
Anyone?

381
00:22:09,924 --> 00:22:10,944
Yeah, quite a few.

382
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:15,806
So that game, we invented a character called Jazz Boatman.

383
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:21,810
This all goes back to that we had no really good budget to make a cool trailer,

384
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,112
because it's a game about boats and explosions.

385
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:29,936
So this guy talks in a smooth voice that sounds like Barry White,

386
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:34,239
and he goes on for one and a half minutes explaining boats and making boat jokes,

387
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,100
like ship just got real.

388
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:38,542
So that trailer cost us, I think, $500 to make.

389
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,933
And it got close to a million views now on YouTube.

390
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,456
It's our most viewed trailer up to date.

391
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,655
still our cheapest trailer as well,

392
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:50,595
is because the groundwork that we did,

393
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,736
like what is the character going to be,

394
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:54,876
how is he going to be perceived by the market,

395
00:22:55,356 --> 00:22:57,317
what is the actual things we want to say

396
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,737
only from this character, never mind the game.

397
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:01,117
This is just the character.

398
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:02,758
If he wants to describe this game,

399
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:05,638
how would he do it from his couch position

400
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:08,699
where he is Jassy Boatman playing the game

401
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:11,500
but not being in the game, right?

402
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,100
And these are the things that we look at on the side here.

403
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:18,969
Play it, obviously the game in itself, when you play the game.

404
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:19,530
What do you do?

405
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,610
Read it.

406
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,232
If your game was a book, what would the book be about?

407
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,794
Would it be a funny book?

408
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:28,354
Would it be sad?

409
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:30,336
Would it be ironic?

410
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:32,797
What would be the actual feeling?

411
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:35,078
When you read this book and you're finished with the book,

412
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,680
what does the reader take with them to the next book,

413
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,061
to the sequel of this book?

414
00:23:41,895 --> 00:23:44,077
Wear it, like I was mentioning before.

415
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:49,924
If you cosplay your game, what are you cosplaying the game like?

416
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,550
I mentioned the Magicka Wizards, which is obviously for Magicka.

417
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:56,532
For our historical games...

418
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:58,560
It's much harder to say.

419
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,101
Hearts of Iron is World War II, which is more generic.

420
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:05,104
But instead, in Hearts of Iron, it's a very deep strategy game.

421
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:08,126
And so you can't use Churchill, and you

422
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,627
can't use these big leaders.

423
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:13,469
So we use Douglas MacArthur as our main character.

424
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,450
Very characteristic character.

425
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,472
So if you want to cosplay Hearts of Iron,

426
00:24:18,072 --> 00:24:20,513
you'll probably go as Douglas MacArthur.

427
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:24,014
Watch it.

428
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,156
Same thing if your game was a movie.

429
00:24:26,456 --> 00:24:27,557
What would the movie be about?

430
00:24:27,877 --> 00:24:30,619
Who would be the lead actors in your movie?

431
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:39,226
We think that Magicka would probably be Eddie Murphy playing the lead Red Wizard.

432
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:41,307
Maybe not.

433
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:42,148
We'll see.

434
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:43,089
We'll see about that.

435
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:44,530
Will Ferrell, maybe?

436
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:46,171
We don't know.

437
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:49,929
That is very interesting to say because once you sit down

438
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:52,790
and you compare like, okay, so we're making a magic movie.

439
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,990
Who's making the voices?

440
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,191
Because you can't see the faces of the wizards.

441
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:57,192
It's only the voices.

442
00:24:58,312 --> 00:24:58,932
Who's playing that?

443
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,273
What personality does that give your game

444
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:02,934
when you talk in between each other?

445
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:07,666
So build it, how do you include your target audience?

446
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,007
Modding is a big part of our community, for example,

447
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:11,687
but it can be other things as well.

448
00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:14,648
If you welcome fan art, for example, for your project,

449
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
what is that fan art going to be?

450
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,609
How do you inspire people to make things for your game

451
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:22,809
that people just feel that creativity flows through them?

452
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,390
And preach it.

453
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:29,060
Very important.

454
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:32,363
What does other people say about your game

455
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:34,004
when they talk to their friends?

456
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:38,368
I know that we marketed our Europa Universalis series

457
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:39,930
when we released the third one.

458
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,590
Just a second.

459
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:46,516
As we said to people like this,

460
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:50,900
maybe this game is a little bit too hard for you.

461
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:52,581
So people were like, what?

462
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,031
Yeah, we said this game might be a bit too hard.

463
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,513
It's a very, very advanced strategy.

464
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:00,674
Yeah, OK, I have to check that out.

465
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,115
So it was a form of anti-marketing.

466
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,717
So we were not pushing things in people's faces.

467
00:26:06,337 --> 00:26:10,539
But we said, when you tell your friends about Europa

468
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,020
Universalis, it's going to be, you know what?

469
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,181
I'm playing this awesome game.

470
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:16,703
But you probably don't understand how to play it,

471
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:17,743
because it's very advanced.

472
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,365
So that's how we spread the word on our strategy games.

473
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:24,338
from a communication standpoint when it comes to peer-to-peer.

474
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:29,800
And this one, this sounds almost like we're being a sect here,

475
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,942
which is kind of awesome in itself, but live it.

476
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:39,804
When this game embraces your entire life,

477
00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:42,906
and you do nothing else than live

478
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:47,048
within this gaming community, gaming franchise,

479
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:49,789
what does your everyday life look like?

480
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:51,870
You just try to imagine.

481
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:57,512
I have to get back to Super Meat Boy and do all of this, I feel that.

482
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:03,114
So this is how we do things in Paradox, when we try to think outside the game, seeing like,

483
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:08,896
okay, we have the game, but everything else around that, how are we going to make it stand

484
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:13,777
out so that everyone, when they see it, like, bam, there it is, that's the game.

485
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,098
Giving it personality.

486
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:27,872
Standing out as well is obviously, like I said,

487
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,053
not only the games in itself,

488
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:30,455
but also the business that you do.

489
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,839
How do you update what you're doing?

490
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,063
What is your DLC policy like?

491
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:39,025
What is your patching policy?

492
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:43,002
And what is your consumer promise, as we call it?

493
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,204
What do you say to customers?

494
00:27:45,425 --> 00:27:46,386
How do you say to customers, like,

495
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,107
this is what we're gonna deliver,

496
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:50,570
this is how we're gonna support the game

497
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:52,612
over this period of time.

498
00:27:52,953 --> 00:27:55,255
So basically, this is what you can expect from us

499
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:56,517
when we release this game.

500
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:05,649
The most expensive part, but the part that people use the most to stand out, is technology.

501
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,953
The problem with using technology, explosions, lightning effects, and all of that, is that

502
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:13,894
the big studios will always win that race.

503
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:20,419
The bigger the studio, the more things they can do to make the game stand out from a technological

504
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:20,919
standpoint.

505
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:26,863
And you know that studios has very little to show in terms of standing out, when fish

506
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:28,884
AI is one of the selling points.

507
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:30,918
Right?

508
00:28:30,998 --> 00:28:34,921
Then you haven't really done your read it, wear it, watch it, live it.

509
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:36,662
Fish AI, people.

510
00:28:44,448 --> 00:28:47,910
But let's see here, if I took...

511
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:57,877
Another thing here, I have to take a story here.

512
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:02,122
One part of the consumer promise is support, obviously.

513
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:05,723
And we are trying to teach our developers

514
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:06,843
to be good at support.

515
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:08,804
We're trying to teach each other every day

516
00:29:08,844 --> 00:29:09,464
to be good at support.

517
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:13,585
When I get an angry email, when I get an abusive email,

518
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:16,806
like, I hope you die and I hope your company goes bankrupt,

519
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:19,206
these emails come in every now and then.

520
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:24,507
Then I write the most abusive reply you can ever think of,

521
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:26,408
like this long.

522
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:30,128
open in the evening, I have a beer and I write an abusive reply.

523
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,690
And I take a walk in my apartment, I walk around a bit,

524
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,353
and then I come back to my computer, and I say

525
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:38,254
in your face! And then I delete the mail.

526
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:41,977
But I have to get it out of the system.

527
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:43,558
But you can never treat customers like that.

528
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:46,701
We had a developer who replied on the forums.

529
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:48,663
Someone said like this,

530
00:29:49,143 --> 00:29:51,805
our game does not start with this type of video card.

531
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:53,286
And the developer replies.

532
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,811
It's not a problem because it's only 2% of the computers.

533
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:03,333
Imagining walking into the doctor's office,

534
00:30:03,993 --> 00:30:06,714
walk into the doctor's office and you say, hey, I have cancer.

535
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:08,234
And the doctor says, you know what?

536
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:10,755
It's not really a problem because only 2% of my patients

537
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:12,376
even have cancer.

538
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:14,757
That's not the reply you're looking for, right?

539
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:17,057
Because you have a problem, and the problem

540
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:18,678
you want someone to sort it out for you.

541
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:20,739
At least, if you can't do anything else,

542
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:23,540
tell them we're working on it, even

543
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,620
if you're not working on it.

544
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:25,700
Right?

545
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:30,479
If you can't say anything, say that you have nothing to say, or say at least like,

546
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,547
we're so sorry, we screwed this up totally, here's your money back,

547
00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:37,292
and I hope that we'll fix it sometime in the future.

548
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:41,960
The problem is not normally communicating,

549
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,602
if you're not super bad at communicating or super abusive,

550
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:47,403
it's the lack of communication.

551
00:30:47,483 --> 00:30:50,325
If you take, again, we take SimCity 5 as an example

552
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:54,068
and compare that to when Blizzard released Diablo 3.

553
00:30:54,528 --> 00:30:57,850
Releases were similar because you couldn't play the game.

554
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,173
And they were both demanded online play,

555
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,213
and you couldn't connect.

556
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:05,460
EA was silent for two weeks.

557
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:06,502
They didn't say a thing.

558
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:07,803
And the first thing they released

559
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:10,327
was a sponsored gas station for Sims 35.

560
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:14,732
While they had hourly updates from Blizzard

561
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,014
on the Diablo III situation.

562
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:23,705
So, in the end there, Blizzard will never be remembered for that release of Diablo 3.

563
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:25,625
Maybe a bit though, because it was kind of bad.

564
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:30,067
But SimCity 5 still has scars from that release.

565
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:33,347
And that's the first thing people mention when there's an article about the game.

566
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:36,428
Which is sad, because in itself the game is not bad.

567
00:31:37,168 --> 00:31:37,948
It's a fairly good game.

568
00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:48,638
More methods on making your game stand out.

569
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,620
I was mentioning how we look at things around the game,

570
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,741
how we're trying to give the game a personality,

571
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:55,142
and how we work without a paradox.

572
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:58,825
But you can also look at what your competitors are doing.

573
00:31:58,845 --> 00:32:01,887
So benchmarking is a very good tool to use.

574
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:04,148
You can just have comparison charts saying,

575
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:09,632
what types of features,

576
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:11,813
what type of features does my competitor have?

577
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:13,715
Because you probably have a competitor in the market.

578
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:16,579
and what feature set do I have?

579
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,119
And then you compare them and say,

580
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:22,420
okay, can we see what features are actually

581
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,981
the most important to keep in the game?

582
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:27,601
Because a lot of game developers tend to think

583
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:30,682
that a lot of features is better than fewer features.

584
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:32,422
But there is an example to that as well.

585
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:34,403
Two free-to-play games,

586
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:37,303
Battlefield Heroes and World of Tanks.

587
00:32:37,963 --> 00:32:39,504
They're not exactly similar though,

588
00:32:39,844 --> 00:32:40,004
but

589
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,429
They're like shooting games, multiplayer games online.

590
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,573
Battlefield Heroes was released many years before World of Tanks.

591
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:50,557
They had infantry, they had tanks, they had planes, they had everything.

592
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:53,160
World of Tanks, they only have tanks.

593
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:54,702
Tanks is what they do.

594
00:32:55,142 --> 00:33:00,868
Tanks, if you cosplay World of Tanks, you come as a tank, probably.

595
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:02,931
Or as a turret, maybe, I don't know.

596
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:07,062
They even have their own personality.

597
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:09,983
One of my kids said, I said,

598
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:12,064
do you play World of Tanks?

599
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,925
And she said, no, no, I've heard about it in school.

600
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:19,346
Isn't that the game Counter-Strike for retired people?

601
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:25,428
And I'm like, yeah, that's a great tagline.

602
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,308
I'm like, wow, I would use that.

603
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:29,729
If I was Victor Kisly at Wargaming,

604
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:30,649
I would totally use that.

605
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,910
Counter-Strike for retired people.

606
00:33:33,832 --> 00:33:36,333
I'm one of them because I'm a bit too slow to play Counter-Strike.

607
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:43,135
But it's funny because World of Tanks has a very specific personality, and that is one

608
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:45,296
of the things that helped the game become great.

609
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:49,618
Battlefield heroes did not at the same... they were trying to be everything for everyone,

610
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:54,420
but the feature set and the feature list was just too long for anyone to digest.

611
00:33:56,056 --> 00:33:58,537
When you do that benchmarking, you quickly come up with

612
00:33:58,717 --> 00:34:00,878
what is your competitive edge as a company?

613
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:03,239
Like, what do you do better than your competitors?

614
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,200
What can you over-deliver on that your competitors cannot?

615
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:11,422
And how can you implement that satisfactory

616
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:12,243
to the customers?

617
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:15,264
You can also do a market analysis.

618
00:34:16,912 --> 00:34:21,693
Ten years ago, you had to subscribe to NPD to get data for America, all the sales data.

619
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:22,393
We did that.

620
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:26,815
We spent like $40,000 a year, and we were a small company back then.

621
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:32,336
But it was only to get the sales data in retail that you needed just to check that all your

622
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:37,598
reports were correct from your distributor and to check how much did our competitors

623
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:38,338
actually sell.

624
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:41,579
Is there other genres that are just as interesting as ours?

625
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:44,674
But today, you can just Google it.

626
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:48,197
Everything is one Googling away, like iTunes, Android,

627
00:34:48,457 --> 00:34:48,797
everything.

628
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:50,358
All these numbers are fairly open.

629
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:53,660
Even analytics firms are fairly accurate

630
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,221
with their Steam numbers.

631
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,723
I mean, we compare some Steam numbers

632
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,123
to some analytics figures.

633
00:35:00,404 --> 00:35:02,225
It's in the same ballpark, definitely.

634
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:05,407
So what you can do easily now is just Google,

635
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:06,828
what numbers are you looking for?

636
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:10,070
Because finding them is super easy.

637
00:35:12,538 --> 00:35:13,979
Another thing here on the benchmarking

638
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:17,120
that I forgot to mention is that you

639
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,882
need to find in here some sort of key performance indicators,

640
00:35:21,062 --> 00:35:23,523
key numbers, what you follow up on.

641
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:25,544
It's not only regarding the game,

642
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,065
but also regarding how the customer behaves.

643
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,446
It could be on the customer side,

644
00:35:29,486 --> 00:35:31,287
like number of support tickets.

645
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:34,088
It could be how quickly you respond,

646
00:35:34,628 --> 00:35:37,450
how many negative reviews you get on Steam

647
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,191
if you release a game on a PC, or your overall review

648
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:41,572
numbers on mobile, for example.

649
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:43,852
On a...

650
00:35:46,095 --> 00:35:47,076
Let's see, it's...

651
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:58,929
Also trying to identify how individuals...

652
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:06,378
behave within a certain game, and something that is very useful there is the use of achievements in a game.

653
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:10,643
Some people use achievements solely for a marketing purpose,

654
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:13,205
but you can also use it to measure

655
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:18,771
exactly what people are doing in the game and trying to give people more of that same experience.

656
00:36:19,112 --> 00:36:20,653
So if a hundred percent of the people

657
00:36:21,692 --> 00:36:25,194
got one achievement. Maybe that was opening the game, so that was too easy.

658
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:30,377
But the rest of the achievements that are not super easy or super hard,

659
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:35,339
how many of them did people actually fulfill? And how do we give them more content that is

660
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:41,203
actually like that? Not all companies can measure exact customer activity. It might be that

661
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,950
the Steam interface doesn't let you do that,

662
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:46,012
it might be that the mobile interface

663
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:46,852
doesn't let you do that,

664
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,794
it's only probably the people who have direct connection

665
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:51,195
with their customers who can measure it,

666
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:53,136
but there are also workaround,

667
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:55,918
like how do you measure achievements, for example.

668
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:57,619
So the more achievements you have,

669
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:00,100
you can do that with the Steam trading cards as well.

670
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:08,265
So once you're...

671
00:37:09,124 --> 00:37:10,144
you're done on the market.

672
00:37:10,364 --> 00:37:12,645
You need to be brutally honest with yourself.

673
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:17,966
So just as much work needs to be spent internally

674
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:20,246
as you do externally when you develop a game.

675
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,007
Depending on if you're up to five people,

676
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,768
everyone can communicate with everyone on a daily basis.

677
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:28,008
You just need to like stretch over and say, hey,

678
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:28,628
what's going on?

679
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:31,729
And then everyone knows what's going on in the entire company.

680
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:36,550
But being brutally honest to yourself is very hard.

681
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,490
It's a.

682
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:41,033
maybe you should have someone coming in from the outside,

683
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:42,714
helping you to be brutally honest.

684
00:37:43,275 --> 00:37:44,636
In the Paradox management team,

685
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:47,759
we sit down once a year

686
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,041
and we give brutally honest feedback.

687
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:52,763
So you have to say two positive things

688
00:37:53,223 --> 00:37:56,826
and one negative thing about every member of the team.

689
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,288
And the negative thing can never be,

690
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:02,191
oh, sometimes you work too much,

691
00:38:02,331 --> 00:38:04,052
because that's just a bullshit excuse

692
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:05,013
for not being like.

693
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:11,800
able to give feedback. You have to say like, you know what really annoys me? It's that you don't

694
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:17,644
report properly on your sales stuff, for example. It's good, brings the company forward.

695
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:23,308
This builds up to, once you're done with that, it builds up to your organizational strength.

696
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:28,431
When you know what every individual can deliver in a team, and when you know what you personally

697
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:32,394
can deliver, you have your organizational strengths just lined up for you.

698
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:42,968
And if the previous slide defined a bit of customer needs, you can see here what can

699
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:44,969
our organization actually deliver.

700
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:50,292
Once we're through with what we can do, how we stand out against our competitors, strength,

701
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:57,137
weaknesses, opportunities, threats, compared to what we think our competitors can do, and

702
00:38:57,197 --> 00:39:02,960
how do we bridge the gap in between this and the customer needs that we saw on the previous

703
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,100
slide.

704
00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:04,844
Okay.

705
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:09,188
This all boils down to the studio USP.

706
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:11,070
So the day that you're gonna tell everyone

707
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,712
how great your studio is,

708
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:14,774
these are the things that you're gonna use.

709
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:15,794
It's gonna be the...

710
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:19,743
Five things that you're best at.

711
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:23,725
And typically, it doesn't do anyone anything good

712
00:39:23,745 --> 00:39:25,967
to be working on what you're weak at.

713
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:28,748
Just trying to balance up your weak spots

714
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:30,429
is not going to make you a better company.

715
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,931
Focus much more on what you're already good at,

716
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:37,033
and be the best in the world at that specific topic

717
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:38,113
on what you're actually doing.

718
00:39:40,415 --> 00:39:41,375
Again, tanks.

719
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:44,617
If you do tanks really well, you can sell a lot of units.

720
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:54,567
One mistake that I see developers do every now and then as well, in this case, is not to follow their passion.

721
00:39:54,907 --> 00:40:02,009
They're trying to fill a gap in the market that they see, but they're not really passionate about the game that they're actually making.

722
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:07,551
So, the questions you're going to be asking both yourselves and your team members is,

723
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:11,053
Do I think about this game all the time?

724
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:12,573
Do I bring my...

725
00:40:14,182 --> 00:40:20,523
like ideas back to home and annoy my spouse with it during dinner conversation.

726
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:25,265
Do I play this game in alpha in the evenings when I get back from work?

727
00:40:26,225 --> 00:40:30,506
And if you don't, you're working on the wrong game and you have to think again

728
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:33,247
and make something that you're actually passionate about,

729
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:35,127
because you're definitely doing the wrong thing.

730
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:41,222
Using yourself as benchmark, as I say,

731
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:43,883
is super underestimated in this industry.

732
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:44,583
People are trying.

733
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:46,764
You could use all the market analysis in the world.

734
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:48,224
You can use a lot of different things

735
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:50,425
that you know about, all the numbers and everything.

736
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:53,145
But if you think something is really good,

737
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:55,926
if you laugh at something, if you have fun with something,

738
00:40:56,126 --> 00:40:59,587
I bet you'll be able to sell that product much better

739
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:04,048
than if you don't, even if the game that you're making

740
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,108
is technically perfect.

741
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:12,145
So getting started on this, how much time do I have?

742
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:13,206
Anyone has the time?

743
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:16,188
16 minutes.

744
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:17,890
Huh?

745
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,230
16 minutes.

746
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,131
16, okay, I'll speed this up.

747
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:20,512
Getting started.

748
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:23,274
The most important thing that we said,

749
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,835
I was touching on this a bit,

750
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:27,097
with read it, play it, watch it, wear it, et cetera,

751
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,619
is setting the product vision.

752
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,401
And why do you set a product vision?

753
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:37,069
It's to get all the major influencers in the company looking at the same target goal.

754
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:44,773
It's also a good way to communicate externally what you're trying to achieve with the game.

755
00:41:45,914 --> 00:41:50,316
An example of...

756
00:41:50,396 --> 00:41:56,260
There are no examples of games being shipped that are not teamwork in this industry.

757
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,822
With one example, and that's Minecraft, which is probably one man's work.

758
00:42:04,204 --> 00:42:11,189
A good vision can summarize the feeling when you play the game and make everyone understand

759
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:12,050
what you're trying to achieve.

760
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:17,154
A good vision you can look at every day and say, my daily work is being done.

761
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:22,481
And I'm following the vision that is our overall goal with this product.

762
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:26,162
One such example is actually SimCity, which is saying,

763
00:42:26,222 --> 00:42:27,563
build the city of your dreams.

764
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:28,883
That's a really good vision.

765
00:42:29,243 --> 00:42:32,344
It's really simple to understand, good tagline.

766
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:36,606
For Europa Universalis, we've used, be a Renaissance emperor.

767
00:42:37,747 --> 00:42:38,727
Very easy to understand.

768
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,207
What kind of decisions are you making?

769
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,168
How do you play the game?

770
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:42,688
How do you feel when you play the game?

771
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:50,032
Gears of War allegedly, I'm not sure if this is true, but if I understand correctly,

772
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:54,736
they used an even more down-to-earth vision when they created their game.

773
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:58,079
They said Marcus Fenix is a total badass.

774
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,321
And how is that a vision?

775
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:03,284
Well, everything he does is badass.

776
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:05,786
He doesn't open doors, right?

777
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,487
He kicks doors in.

778
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:08,909
That's badass.

779
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:10,930
You don't open the door like this, you just BAM!

780
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:16,234
So if you're a designer and you see that vision, Marcus Phoenix is a badass.

781
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:17,495
How does he behave?

782
00:43:17,735 --> 00:43:19,295
How does that affect the gameplay?

783
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:21,496
How does that affect marketing in the game?

784
00:43:22,356 --> 00:43:28,777
Examples of really bad visions is, we're going to make the best strategy game in the world.

785
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:31,558
And why is that a bad vision?

786
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:34,718
Because best is a very subjective matter.

787
00:43:36,122 --> 00:43:42,103
No one can look at that and say, okay, so, hmm, is this real-time or turn-based?

788
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:43,824
It doesn't make sense at all.

789
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,464
So the vision should be simple for everyone on the team to understand.

790
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:51,265
I said use yourself as benchmark.

791
00:43:51,365 --> 00:43:59,266
And the be crazy part I just added because as I say, what you like and you're trying

792
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:04,127
to sell, if you twist it around a bit, other people are going to like that too because

793
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,127
that's how the market works.

794
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:16,854
You take the vision, you boil it down, you sell the idea internally when all the stakeholders are on board with this vision.

795
00:44:17,314 --> 00:44:22,737
Typically, you have to sit down in a locked room until you come up with your product vision.

796
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:29,821
There are many ways to do this. I could have one session only on how to set the product vision,

797
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:32,462
because that takes probably a few hours to explain.

798
00:44:32,942 --> 00:44:35,463
But lock people in a room, maybe a few beers.

799
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:42,467
and then you don't walk out until all the major stakeholders are on board on the same page.

800
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:48,071
You can then take the vision and say, okay, you're in charge of programming.

801
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:54,697
What do you do to fulfill the vision in your daily work? Five tasks in your daily work.

802
00:44:55,557 --> 00:45:00,922
You're the lead artist. How do you make sure that this vision is followed on a daily basis?

803
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:02,183
These five

804
00:45:03,092 --> 00:45:04,773
bullet points or three bullet points,

805
00:45:05,073 --> 00:45:07,094
you can take back to your team and say,

806
00:45:07,735 --> 00:45:09,876
this is how we work to fulfill our mission.

807
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:11,336
This is the grand vision.

808
00:45:11,697 --> 00:45:14,818
This is what we do to fulfill our part of this grand vision.

809
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,000
Makes it so much easier for people to understand

810
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,801
both internally and externally.

811
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:26,978
It's super good for communication as well because it sets the whole pace for trailers that you're making,

812
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:28,839
for communications that you're making.

813
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,580
Magicka is a perfect example of everything.

814
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,522
Everything in Magicka, every single line that someone says is a reference to popular culture.

815
00:45:39,082 --> 00:45:39,863
Everything in the game.

816
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:45,385
That includes all the trailers, it includes all the achievements, it includes everything.

817
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:53,127
I only get about 33% of that, but when I sometimes get it, I really find it, I really love.

818
00:45:53,147 --> 00:45:55,930
I was standing next to this...

819
00:45:57,983 --> 00:46:03,347
building called Graham's Workshop, which looks a bit like Games Workshop in the logotype,

820
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:09,972
because it's yellow and red. And the guy next to Graham's Workshop says, when I click a dialogue,

821
00:46:10,012 --> 00:46:16,257
he says, someone at Graham's Workshop told me that in a distant future there is only war.

822
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:19,859
I find that kind of scary. And I started laughing.

823
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:26,324
No one? Okay, we'll take that later. Write that down and we'll take it later.

824
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:29,660
It's also important that you keep the vision true as a team.

825
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,760
You challenge each other.

826
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:33,102
You go up to, even if you're not an artist,

827
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:34,602
you can go up and say, you know what?

828
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:37,224
How is this badass?

829
00:46:37,584 --> 00:46:39,225
How is this art actually badass?

830
00:46:39,325 --> 00:46:41,346
Is this something that we want to stand for

831
00:46:41,546 --> 00:46:43,828
and we want to be behind when we release the game

832
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:46,429
with a vision we already agreed up?

833
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,031
Another thing that I think is underestimated,

834
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:51,352
I'm going to hurry up a bit here,

835
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:53,493
it's naming the game.

836
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:55,354
Just such a simple thing because

837
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:57,658
Naming a game takes forever.

838
00:46:57,698 --> 00:47:00,700
First of all, you have to search all the trademark databases and all that,

839
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,823
and then you have to figure if your name is a funny meaning in a foreign language.

840
00:47:05,163 --> 00:47:06,684
And yeah, there are so many things.

841
00:47:07,865 --> 00:47:08,465
Keep it simple.

842
00:47:10,546 --> 00:47:13,008
I love the old ADOS way of naming games.

843
00:47:13,408 --> 00:47:14,369
You are what you play.

844
00:47:14,689 --> 00:47:19,352
They did Hitman, Championship Manager, Thief.

845
00:47:20,413 --> 00:47:20,953
Super simple.

846
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:27,821
The only downside is that it's not Googleable in the same way that a very strange name like Europa Universal is.

847
00:47:27,861 --> 00:47:30,182
If you Google that, you'll only get hit some paradox.

848
00:47:31,744 --> 00:47:32,744
There are downsides to everything.

849
00:47:36,527 --> 00:47:39,249
From the vision, we boil it down to a consumer promise as well.

850
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:43,092
Like, what is the package that we promise to deliver to a consumer?

851
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:48,215
So what we do is ask ourselves, through the communication that we've done,

852
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:49,636
what are all the vision...

853
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:53,715
things that we communicated out to the customers,

854
00:47:55,435 --> 00:47:56,776
everything communication-wise.

855
00:47:57,436 --> 00:48:00,797
What do we think the people playing

856
00:48:00,857 --> 00:48:03,458
the game for the first time will actually experience?

857
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:05,999
What will be their first reaction?

858
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:07,220
What's the reaction we're after?

859
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,140
We're trying to envision that.

860
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,021
OK, so this is what they're going to do.

861
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:12,982
That's what we call the player fantasy,

862
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:16,483
because sometimes people have higher expectations on your game

863
00:48:16,503 --> 00:48:17,523
than you can actually deliver.

864
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:20,240
And trying to match the player fantasy

865
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,561
with what you actually deliver,

866
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:23,523
or even exceed the player fantasy,

867
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:25,085
is a very hard balance as well.

868
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:29,069
What is our commitment to deliver that?

869
00:48:33,073 --> 00:48:35,095
And I was mentioning Neyman Brands.

870
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:36,776
Another part of that.

871
00:48:37,965 --> 00:48:44,049
They can use just as a toy of like coming up with what is actually unique about this game,

872
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:47,612
what makes it stand out, are a few things like in sales,

873
00:48:47,632 --> 00:48:51,615
you often use an elevator pitch, which means that if you go up from elevator

874
00:48:51,635 --> 00:48:54,457
from floor 1 to floor 50, and you have to explain

875
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:58,140
to a big-time CEO your business model, how does that sound?

876
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,321
Because you only have 20 seconds.

877
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:00,582
Same with your game.

878
00:49:01,203 --> 00:49:03,164
I tried this on my parents.

879
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:09,814
My parents, they're very hard, they're a very hard sell because they're 70 years old and they never play games.

880
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:15,639
So I tried to sell Europa Universalis to my mom first and she refused to listen.

881
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,842
And then my dad said like, oh that sounds interesting,

882
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:21,444
and he said something really smart back at me.

883
00:49:21,884 --> 00:49:25,507
He's like, oh that takes a lot of research of maps, doesn't it?

884
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,269
And I'm like, I got it, I got it.

885
00:49:27,389 --> 00:49:29,150
Like so I'm just taking him in now.

886
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:34,855
But the only game he actually played was Fruit Ninja and then some Wii Sports.

887
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:38,038
So it's a tough sell for a hard strategy game.

888
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:43,648
Everything, I was touching actually on key performance indicators and numbers earlier on,

889
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:50,692
but it's very important for any organization to find the numbers that you're using to measure yourself.

890
00:49:51,412 --> 00:49:55,794
What are the numbers? The most common numbers are, for example, a Metacritic score.

891
00:49:56,335 --> 00:49:59,236
The Metacritic score doesn't say that much, to be honest, about the game.

892
00:49:59,656 --> 00:50:05,099
Probably the user score in Metacritic says more about your game than the actual Metacritic score does.

893
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:09,760
But you check out how long are your average player's sessions,

894
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:14,682
and does that match up with how you thought that people would play the game?

895
00:50:14,982 --> 00:50:18,423
Did you think that people would play the game for one hour at a time,

896
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,284
and they're only playing 20 minutes?

897
00:50:21,204 --> 00:50:23,465
Well, where is the bridge?

898
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:28,247
Why are you failing to deliver that one hour on average session to the game?

899
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:29,687
And what are you going to do about that?

900
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:44,480
We're into, again, engaging the fans. We've been touching a bit of this on inheriting fans and all that.

901
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,582
And the most important thing, I mentioned that as well, with only 2% having the problem.

902
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:56,884
That is not really respectful. So important is that even if you think that people are wrong, just be respectful.

903
00:50:57,244 --> 00:51:04,947
Because trust is the most valuable asset that you have, especially as an independent developer or a developer with limited resources.

904
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:07,148
I say like...

905
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:12,225
Treat all your gamers, I say to myself,

906
00:51:12,765 --> 00:51:14,326
like I treat my mother-in-law,

907
00:51:15,147 --> 00:51:16,288
because with my mother-in-law,

908
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:19,530
I have to live with her for the rest of her life,

909
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,432
or my life, depending on who kicks the bucket first.

910
00:51:23,752 --> 00:51:27,034
But you have to live with your customers

911
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,235
for the rest of your lives.

912
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:31,637
And this spreads very quickly, spreads very quickly.

913
00:51:32,937 --> 00:51:35,259
Listening versus hearing on the customer side as well.

914
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,959
There are many more people than you are.

915
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,421
The collective knowledge of the people playing your games

916
00:51:40,721 --> 00:51:43,003
is bigger than the knowledge that you can have

917
00:51:43,043 --> 00:51:43,703
in your company.

918
00:51:44,103 --> 00:51:45,704
It's true for any company out there,

919
00:51:45,804 --> 00:51:47,805
even for Apple, with thousands of employees.

920
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:50,667
The collective knowledge of the people using Apple's product

921
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:53,108
and their knowledge is bigger than Apple's own.

922
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:56,050
So if you listen to your customers,

923
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,951
you will do what they tell you to do.

924
00:51:59,247 --> 00:52:03,949
If you're hearing what they're saying, you will hear between the lines what they need

925
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:05,550
to have going forward.

926
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:11,634
And there's a classic quote here from Henry Ford, one of the inventors of the car, who

927
00:52:11,674 --> 00:52:17,717
said like, if I had listened to my customers, I would try to breed faster horses.

928
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:24,481
But what they were actually saying was that I want to get faster from point A to point

929
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:24,561
B.

930
00:52:25,804 --> 00:52:27,745
not that they actually wanted faster horses.

931
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,005
I have some examples of that.

932
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:32,807
If they say in SimCity 5, we want a bigger map,

933
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:35,409
what people are probably saying is

934
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:40,431
that we want to have longer and more advanced gameplay

935
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:43,693
settings or a gameplay universe.

936
00:52:45,314 --> 00:52:47,035
People say about Europa Universalis,

937
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,916
I probably don't understand this game.

938
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:53,598
What they're saying is that I would love to have.

939
00:52:55,224 --> 00:52:56,465
a really advanced tutorial.

940
00:52:58,046 --> 00:53:01,247
If someone says, this is a true story, I'm going to read here.

941
00:53:01,507 --> 00:53:03,568
I want a refund for this piece of crap

942
00:53:03,588 --> 00:53:07,250
you sold to me after playing 1,200 hours, which

943
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,211
we could see on Steam.

944
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:14,054
What he's actually telling us, because it's awesome to have a customer playing 1,200 hours,

945
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:19,016
then sending this email is a bit out of character, but what he's telling us is that

946
00:53:19,857 --> 00:53:27,140
if you had updated this game, I would have been buying every piece of DLC that you've ever released.

947
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,162
But now it's just sad that we abandoned the game, because we did, unfortunately.

948
00:53:38,441 --> 00:53:40,683
Fans, I'm going to touch on the...

949
00:53:46,286 --> 00:53:50,388
The world champions of treating your customers well,

950
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:54,671
or at least making the customers believe they're treated well, are about.

951
00:53:55,372 --> 00:53:59,854
They turned Team Fortress 2 into a totally customer-driven economy,

952
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:04,397
making it now the third most played game on Steam.

953
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:06,738
Every day, every month.

954
00:54:09,378 --> 00:54:14,202
One of the things that we say that the collective knowledge is bigger than the outside knowledge

955
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:19,206
is that when you create your game you're a limited crowd of people and then you have it out to a

956
00:54:19,986 --> 00:54:24,810
huge crowd of people that can look at it, mod it, make changes, come with feedback.

957
00:54:25,751 --> 00:54:31,956
Five of the 10 most played games on Steam started out as mods. I actually checked it.

958
00:54:32,714 --> 00:54:33,275
just yesterday.

959
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:34,756
And that is actually true.

960
00:54:35,216 --> 00:54:37,138
People do something that they care about,

961
00:54:37,678 --> 00:54:38,739
or they have their passion,

962
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:42,302
and it ends up being this fantastic game.

963
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,164
We call it the Dota factor within every game.

964
00:54:45,604 --> 00:54:47,806
So Warcraft III was incredibly popular.

965
00:54:48,306 --> 00:54:51,008
The mod Dota became even more popular

966
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:52,529
than anyone could ever imagine.

967
00:54:57,553 --> 00:54:58,334
So I'm actually gonna...

968
00:54:59,344 --> 00:55:02,985
I'm going to jump through this very quickly and see if I have any questions in the end here.

969
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:05,546
I'm building the fan base.

970
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:09,567
Just how you're going to build the fan base, step by step here.

971
00:55:10,548 --> 00:55:11,288
What kind of culture?

972
00:55:11,968 --> 00:55:17,550
If your game and your company was a country, what country would it be?

973
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,970
And how would it welcome people?

974
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,711
How would it communicate with people?

975
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:25,412
What sort of common language do you share with your customers?

976
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,531
What do you celebrate in terms of ceremonies?

977
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:30,552
What references do you have in common?

978
00:55:31,232 --> 00:55:33,893
If someone would symbolize your game or company,

979
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:36,354
what kind of symbol would they use for the company?

980
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:40,116
What legends do they tell about you?

981
00:55:40,536 --> 00:55:44,078
How good are you as a storyteller about your company?

982
00:55:44,098 --> 00:55:47,640
Because the company standing out is just as important

983
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,500
as the game standing out in itself.

984
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:51,401
Because a standout company

985
00:55:52,243 --> 00:55:55,485
can release mediocre games and get away with it,

986
00:55:55,845 --> 00:55:57,646
because they're a standout company.

987
00:55:58,446 --> 00:55:59,887
I'm not going to take any examples here,

988
00:56:00,307 --> 00:56:02,108
but it's very interesting.

989
00:56:02,449 --> 00:56:05,970
So how, in essence, do you create the sense of belonging

990
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:07,791
that you want for your gamers,

991
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:15,416
that they belong to what you're doing?

992
00:56:15,436 --> 00:56:17,637
So if I'm going to summarize what I've said here,

993
00:56:18,137 --> 00:56:20,999
divide it up to product, company,

994
00:56:23,251 --> 00:56:28,234
We say in Paradox that passion makes perfect, meaning that passion is more important than

995
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:28,874
strategy.

996
00:56:30,475 --> 00:56:33,797
Passion is more important than everything you do in the game, because it means that

997
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:37,500
you're willing to work hard to succeed and to complete what you're doing.

998
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:44,884
First of all, if I'm just going to make, set some advices here, is to set your vision and

999
00:56:44,924 --> 00:56:46,245
get your team on board with that.

1000
00:56:49,972 --> 00:56:54,613
Make sure to communicate what your vision and your consumer promise is to the people

1001
00:56:54,653 --> 00:56:56,874
are supposed to play your games.

1002
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:04,235
And be passionate and follow your heart when it comes to everything, not only to the game,

1003
00:57:04,816 --> 00:57:07,376
but to the marketing and to the business of the game.

1004
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:10,017
That's all.

1005
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:11,877
Thank you.

1006
00:57:20,364 --> 00:57:21,705
So now I've been talking for an hour.

1007
00:57:21,725 --> 00:57:22,586
Any questions?

1008
00:57:23,987 --> 00:57:24,227
Yes?

1009
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:26,408
Microphone here, if you can use it please.

1010
00:57:30,732 --> 00:57:33,894
Hello, I have a question about your internal methods

1011
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,895
and being brutally honest to yourselves.

1012
00:57:36,295 --> 00:57:36,996
Yep.

1013
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:39,798
What do you do if someone on the development team

1014
00:57:39,878 --> 00:57:42,720
loses his passion during the game they're working on

1015
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,961
and how do you proceed with this?

1016
00:57:44,942 --> 00:57:45,882
That's a very good question.

1017
00:57:45,942 --> 00:57:47,383
How do we get the passion going?

1018
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:53,019
When we have introduction days at Paradox, we have one full day, that's how we start at least.

1019
00:57:53,859 --> 00:57:55,319
We have one full day of presentations.

1020
00:57:55,739 --> 00:58:00,701
I always start in the morning telling Paradox history, the organization, a lot of boring things.

1021
00:58:01,381 --> 00:58:04,822
I always end my presentations with saying, you know what,

1022
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:09,204
when you walk into this office two weeks in a row or so,

1023
00:58:09,564 --> 00:58:12,765
and you don't feel that you're having fun, come to me.

1024
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:16,288
Come to me, and I'll help you get a better job

1025
00:58:16,568 --> 00:58:18,288
than the job that you have here at Paradox.

1026
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:19,129
I swear.

1027
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:22,230
So that's how we start, like setting it straight,

1028
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:25,731
saying like, it's mandatory to have fun at Paradox.

1029
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:27,472
Nothing else actually counts.

1030
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:29,672
But keeping the passion in the team

1031
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:31,273
is actually something ongoing.

1032
00:58:31,453 --> 00:58:34,434
That is more like you try to have peer-to-peer evaluations

1033
00:58:34,454 --> 00:58:37,195
and all of that, but it's very hard and very tricky to do.

1034
00:58:37,415 --> 00:58:39,196
So I don't really have a straight answer on that.

1035
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:40,876
Thank you very much.

1036
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:41,117
Thank you.

1037
00:58:49,677 --> 00:58:58,199
The target group of some video game genres, especially war games, is pretty hardcore and traditional,

1038
00:58:58,419 --> 00:59:03,320
and they like certain aspects of gameplay that are recurring through the series.

1039
00:59:04,981 --> 00:59:10,202
So how do you balance innovations in game and also stay true to your fanbase

1040
00:59:10,522 --> 00:59:13,363
and make the games that they are used to and love?

1041
00:59:14,897 --> 00:59:19,008
How we stand true to the brand and at the same time try to make new things.

1042
00:59:22,947 --> 00:59:24,268
A lot of the, if you take war games,

1043
00:59:24,448 --> 00:59:27,868
or for example, Hearts of Iron as an example of that,

1044
00:59:27,888 --> 00:59:31,589
I think that we have hidden a lot of what is actually fun

1045
00:59:31,749 --> 00:59:34,330
in the game underneath the surface in the past.

1046
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:36,870
I think that probably everyone in the world

1047
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:38,571
can enjoy a good war game,

1048
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:41,571
because it's like the basis of what you play,

1049
00:59:41,692 --> 00:59:42,732
even now today.

1050
00:59:43,072 --> 00:59:45,252
War games are the foundation of a lot of games.

1051
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:48,833
So in our case, I think one of the challenges,

1052
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:50,333
we have one of the Hearts of Iron developers here,

1053
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,414
so you can talk to him later on.

1054
00:59:51,794 --> 00:59:52,294
Hand up here.

1055
00:59:52,314 --> 00:59:52,774
Ha ha.

1056
00:59:53,614 --> 00:59:59,275
I think one of the challenges that we have is trying to lift it up to the surface and telling people like this is

1057
00:59:59,435 --> 01:00:04,056
Actually, what is fun in this game? And this is how you learn it. So it's it's a lot of

1058
01:00:04,297 --> 01:00:10,458
Interface issues actually, so it's very technical what is fun in the game, but also on our end to communicate

1059
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:15,179
This is what you can do in the game. This is the feeling you should have when you're playing the game so

1060
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:18,504
It's both, a bit like lifting up what's fun

1061
01:00:19,065 --> 01:00:20,307
and the other one is communicating.

1062
01:00:20,547 --> 01:00:21,750
It's not just a war game,

1063
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:25,837
it's like you're ruling the world, sort of, that feeling.

1064
01:00:25,857 --> 01:00:27,259
So a little bit of everything.

1065
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,622
We have one more question.

1066
01:00:29,303 --> 01:00:29,443
Yep.

1067
01:00:32,517 --> 01:00:39,302
Hi, you've been talking about that you do have, you need your developers to have passion

1068
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:41,924
for the game when they do the game and that they love to play the game.

1069
01:00:42,565 --> 01:00:46,288
You were also talking about that you need to listen to your customers and that your

1070
01:00:46,328 --> 01:00:51,672
customers are satisfied and that they are incorporated into the process in some way.

1071
01:00:51,692 --> 01:00:53,854
Do you ever have the situation that...

1072
01:00:54,994 --> 01:00:56,537
You're the developers and your customers

1073
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:58,660
were drifting apart in their vision,

1074
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,942
and how do you handle that?

1075
01:01:00,002 --> 01:01:02,405
I mean, if the team has an idea about where they want to go,

1076
01:01:02,786 --> 01:01:04,428
and it's totally not what the customers want,

1077
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:05,390
what do you do then?

1078
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,772
Well, we have that all the time.

1079
01:01:07,714 --> 01:01:12,277
Actually, and there are several ways to get people on board,

1080
01:01:12,598 --> 01:01:15,100
get the customers on board at an early stage.

1081
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,943
What our strategy game teams are doing really well

1082
01:01:19,203 --> 01:01:20,925
is to release developer diaries,

1083
01:01:21,085 --> 01:01:23,407
where you explain bits of gameplay,

1084
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:25,729
like every week you explain new things to the gameplay,

1085
01:01:26,029 --> 01:01:27,670
because that gets more and more people on board.

1086
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,772
They're like, oh yeah, this sounds really smart,

1087
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:31,814
and then you're very active in communication.

1088
01:01:32,976 --> 01:01:37,397
And you can also be like, you can listen to the fans, but you should also be very, very...

1089
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,717
clear what they can say about the game,

1090
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:45,197
saying like, you know what, we're hearing what you're saying

1091
01:01:45,237 --> 01:01:46,618
but this is how it will be.

1092
01:01:47,178 --> 01:01:48,919
So you're not fooling people to believe

1093
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:52,140
that they have influence over something that they won't.

1094
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,121
And then people can choose either to say,

1095
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:57,562
okay, that's sad, but probably I'll play the game again,

1096
01:01:57,762 --> 01:02:00,063
or they'll be really happy about that.

1097
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:02,664
So it's typically a dual situation.

1098
01:02:02,744 --> 01:02:04,865
But sometimes, in the past at least,

1099
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:07,145
we did polls on the forums as well.

1100
01:02:07,165 --> 01:02:08,246
So we asked people like.

1101
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,918
Do you want Paradox to do this next?

1102
01:02:12,619 --> 01:02:14,960
And then we had like, yes, because I love games,

1103
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,461
or no, because I'm a boring person.

1104
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,362
And then we got like 97% yes.

1105
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,303
So it depends on how you ask the question as well.

1106
01:02:22,844 --> 01:02:24,264
It was not that obvious though,

1107
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:26,705
but it depends a lot, like if you want people

1108
01:02:26,926 --> 01:02:29,327
to like really be on your side,

1109
01:02:29,487 --> 01:02:31,348
it depends a lot on how you ask the questions.

1110
01:02:36,402 --> 01:02:37,843
Oh, is that microphone not working?

1111
01:02:37,863 --> 01:02:38,323
No, working?

1112
01:02:38,783 --> 01:02:40,404
We've got one last question here.

1113
01:02:40,944 --> 01:02:42,765
Cool.

1114
01:02:43,646 --> 01:02:43,806
Hi.

1115
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:50,449
How important do you think language localization is to engage people?

1116
01:02:52,325 --> 01:02:55,526
I think language localization is quite important,

1117
01:02:56,466 --> 01:03:00,127
especially since there are basically just a few territories

1118
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,527
where you can release English games.

1119
01:03:01,607 --> 01:03:04,668
It's North America, it's UK, Netherlands,

1120
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:05,808
Nordic territories.

1121
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:07,549
Apart from that, if you want to reach

1122
01:03:07,569 --> 01:03:08,689
the highest sales numbers,

1123
01:03:08,729 --> 01:03:10,530
I think localization is very important.

1124
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,329
And for us it's always a balance

1125
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:14,530
in between localize or not.

1126
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,192
Because if you take for example Europa Universalis,

1127
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,054
it's like 600,000 words or something

1128
01:03:19,074 --> 01:03:20,215
in Europa Universalis for it.

1129
01:03:20,555 --> 01:03:21,396
So it's always a stretch.

1130
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:24,178
But I think as a concept, localization is really important

1131
01:03:24,378 --> 01:03:26,059
to get into every local market.

1132
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,642
Now that you have digital distribution

1133
01:03:28,862 --> 01:03:31,664
as like a global support on almost all platforms.

1134
01:03:37,409 --> 01:03:38,169
Okay, thank you.

1135
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:39,070
Thank you.

1136
01:03:50,718 --> 01:03:50,778
you
