1
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:14,109
Hello everyone, welcome to our presentation.

2
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:16,391
Thank you, thank you.

3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:23,075
You know, animation is the best way to make a video game alive.

4
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:27,679
Then, we'll be talking about our work on Rayman game,

5
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,182
and more specifically, all the technology helped to keep face

6
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:36,365
with the artistic vision for the animation in a game.

7
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:40,430
we will see how Rayman's world comes to life.

8
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,671
Hi, I'm AnaÃ¯s Dussautois.

9
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:47,874
I'm an animator on Rayman Origins and on Rayman Legends.

10
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:52,017
I'm going to talk to you about the technical part of this presentation.

11
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:53,358
And I'm Christophe.

12
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm the artistic director of animation

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,503
and character designer on Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends.

14
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:03,885
I'm in charge of the artistic part.

15
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:13,385
So first, we will start with the spirit of the Ubisoft

16
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:17,267
Montpellier studio, and how that way of life influences

17
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,507
the spirit of the game.

18
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:21,188
Then we're going to travel in time to go back to the

19
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:25,110
origins of Rayman, and we'll see how the artists work with

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,811
the Ubi art framework, or technology.

21
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:31,033
Then we're going to tell you the story of GenAnim,

22
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:33,715
the UBI framework animation tool.

23
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:36,537
And then we're going to finish if we've

24
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:41,259
got the time with a small demonstration about that tool.

25
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,600
Cool.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,801
Woo-hoo.

27
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:48,023
I'm not stressed at all.

28
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:52,346
Everything's fine.

29
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,447
Can you see me?

30
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,908
It's OK.

31
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,709
Not small.

32
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:05,081
Um, I'm going to try to imagine you, all of you, naked.

33
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,843
And it's going to be better.

34
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:13,465
So let's talk about the Ubisoft Montpellier Studio spirit.

35
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:17,627
We think that the ambience and the atmosphere at Montpellier

36
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:20,288
Studio contribute to our creative success.

37
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,890
So we are working in a very pleasant context.

38
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:26,805
Well, in the south of France, we've got the beach.

39
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:28,446
It's a sunny place.

40
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:30,508
Got Morito's bikinis and all that stuff.

41
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:36,253
We design creative projects, like From Dust, Beyond Good

42
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:39,976
and Evil, Rabbids Go Home, Roman Origins, Roman Legends,

43
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:42,478
of course.

44
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:46,962
We surround ourselves with a talented and passionate team.

45
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:49,845
And I to the team, by the way.

46
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:54,388
team is made of really hard workers.

47
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:57,590
They're working together in a very good team spirit,

48
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,733
and they are really involved in the final quality of the project.

49
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,114
And we also develop innovative tools,

50
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:08,677
and I think that the fact that we are creating innovative tools together

51
00:03:08,677 --> 00:03:12,860
make us understand the constraint of the other's job.

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,303
We have to leave our comfort zone and communicate a lot,

53
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:19,465
and it contributes to have a good team synergy.

54
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:30,395
But for now, I invite you to discover the villa, the place

55
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:33,297
that we work, with this small video of the team

56
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:33,757
that I have made.

57
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:45,062
It's homemade, so let's see that.

58
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:54,189
Yeah.

59
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:28,383
Adios

60
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:40,850
Really look very happy. Thank you for them

61
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:43,517
They deserve that.

62
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,957
Really, really.

63
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:47,738
So now, let's back to the origins.

64
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:51,778
To understand the art and the philosophy of Rayman,

65
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:55,179
how we did the connection with the Rayman origins

66
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,339
and Rayman legends, let's jump to the past.

67
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,700
So who's the character of Rayman?

68
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,580
Rayman's character with no arms, no legs,

69
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,361
and a really weird haircut.

70
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:09,582
But yeah, it's a little, ah.

71
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,419
But most of all, it's a very iconic silhouette.

72
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:16,020
But who's the best place to speak about Rayman

73
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,941
than his creator, Michel Ancel?

74
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:21,162
So let's see a small interview about that.

75
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:27,805
My name is Michel Ancel, and I'm the creative director

76
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:30,786
on Rayman Legend and Rayman Origin.

77
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:34,728
The creation of Rayman was really, in fact, very simple,

78
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:37,869
because it was something that I did when I was

79
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,822
around 20 years old.

80
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:47,145
And it was really the character I wanted to make

81
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:50,507
to experience the games I was creating.

82
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:56,470
Rayman is a very simple and direct character.

83
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,052
He's not talking, it's really about action.

84
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:07,716
So he's really made all the animation and the design.

85
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:13,556
is made so that you can understand the character just by looking at it.

86
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:16,759
It's not just storytelling and things like that.

87
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,483
It's really a direct connection between you and the character.

88
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:31,822
First, it was designed in pixels, and when you don't have a lot of pixels, you are forced to have very strong characteristics in your character.

89
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:42,529
And I think even now in 3D, because sometimes the character is far away, you still need a character that you can identify very easily.

90
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:45,671
We started with 2D games, because a long time ago it was easier to do 2D games.

91
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:52,224
And then we moved to 3D, and the games became more complex,

92
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:57,047
interesting, but really different in terms of gaming,

93
00:06:57,047 --> 00:07:01,129
of gameplay, and from what we started with.

94
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,972
Coming back in 2D is really a way

95
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:09,994
to go back to the roots of video games.

96
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,915
Phew.

97
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:13,616
Cool.

98
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:14,516
That's my boss.

99
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:14,696
Huh.

100
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:21,932
So the question is, why to come back in 2D?

101
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:24,413
Since the beginning of the industry,

102
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:27,235
and particularly the advent of the 3D games,

103
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:30,276
there has been a race to create more and more

104
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:34,458
photorealistic games with more and more complicated controls

105
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,038
and cameras.

106
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,519
So we tried to back to the basic,

107
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,901
keep simple controls, a visible game space,

108
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,882
to come back to an affordable way to play together.

109
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:50,520
We tried to make a game for the hardcore gamer,

110
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,904
but also for the casual gamers.

111
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:58,011
And we tried, the purpose was to make them play together

112
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,473
in one single room.

113
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:02,618
So the first three men.

114
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,882
the first one, the 20 years old were man,

115
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,283
still the favorite of the franchise and its top seller.

116
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:13,706
And we believe that has a lot to do with the accessibility

117
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:16,287
of the 2D graphics and gameplay.

118
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,229
That means more familiarity for everyone,

119
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:23,952
and also the promise of old classic gameplay

120
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:28,996
that platformers fans adore.

121
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:35,396
We try to keep the magic and the fantasy of the first Rayman,

122
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:39,759
and we mix it with the HD quality and the new technology

123
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,901
that we can access with the new tools that we create

124
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:48,104
to form a contemporary vision of this universe to all of you.

125
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:50,245
So the gamers, non-gamers, everybody.

126
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:55,950
At the beginning, the team was focused

127
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,113
on inventing a more efficient, flexible, and creative approach

128
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:00,914
to build 2D games.

129
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:03,976
So we started to develop the UbiArt framework.

130
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:09,781
At the beginning, it was an idea of Michel Ancel.

131
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:14,284
And it begins with a small team of artists and engineers.

132
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:18,387
They work together to create all those tools.

133
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:21,630
So it's designed to all small creative team.

134
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:28,961
to produce high-quality graphics and gameplay rapidly and efficiently.

135
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:35,104
With it, you are able to animate a large style of animation, like cut-out paper, drawing,

136
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:35,664
paintings.

137
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:38,366
Can I say modeling past?

138
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,947
Yeah, modeling past.

139
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:40,147
Clay?

140
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:40,947
Yeah, clay.

141
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:41,227
Okay.

142
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:41,608
Thank you.

143
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,149
Thank you.

144
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,070
Sorry, I'm French.

145
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:54,674
So it's built to fit with the needs of the artist in 2D.

146
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:56,875
On Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends,

147
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,737
we wanted to fit perfectly with the vision of the artist.

148
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:02,857
So we developed a tool that allows

149
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:06,399
to put directly the drawing of the artist, the concept

150
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,740
art, into the game.

151
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:12,025
So we don't lose the essence of the primary art concept,

152
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:14,626
and we keep the energy on the artistic part

153
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:18,548
to stay focused on the creation.

154
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:25,091
As we modified the classic pipe to fit with the old 2D

155
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:25,792
concepts.

156
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:31,301
We saved lots of time and energy to product a great variety of universes,

157
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:33,202
great variety of assets,

158
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:38,605
to build backgrounds, platforms, create different worlds,

159
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,546
life elements,

160
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:40,626
characters,

161
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:46,670
that give to the game its own personality.

162
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,270
So, to...

163
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:53,468
To be more clear, I'm gonna show you a small video

164
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:55,270
about the artistic pipeline

165
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:11,600
or the artist work with those tools.

166
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,782
I'm Jean-Christophe Alessandri,

167
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:16,683
I'm the artistic director of Emanuel Jones.

168
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:23,288
The graphic creation on A Man's Legend starts with a preparatory work

169
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:25,408
based on sketches and concept art.

170
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:33,291
Then we go through a validation stage with the creative director

171
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,152
and the different managers of the other trade corps

172
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:39,913
to then arrive at a prototyping phase, especially on the framework.

173
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,502
We work in a very organic way, and the framework allows us to do that.

174
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:49,563
It allows us to be very flexible, to make several iterations from a design.

175
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:56,006
What is also interesting with the framework is that it is the concept art that we will put in the game in the end.

176
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:03,669
We are not in a heavy production pattern, but on the contrary, we are in a very reactive logic

177
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:09,891
that really allows us to test as much as possible all the ideas that can fuse in a team

178
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:16,340
Between animations, level art, level design, game design, concept artists,

179
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,748
all these people can really create in the same way.

180
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:25,844
I like to take a look at the concept art that's made for the worlds for the game from the

181
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:30,885
artists themselves before actually building something in the level because I think when

182
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:36,406
I make something for the game I want it to be visually coherent with the actual overall

183
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:42,767
vision for the final product and so even if I'm making something that's purely gameplay

184
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:46,748
oriented I like to know that it's going to fit with the direction that the artists have

185
00:12:46,748 --> 00:12:47,428
for the final product.

186
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:58,254
And also what I end up doing when I'm looking at the concept art is I have a tendency to be inspired by even small things like a fallen tree that the player is walking through in the picture.

187
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:00,895
And it makes me want to use that kind of geometry in my level.

188
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:09,120
So then I do that and sometimes it leads to the creation of interesting gameplay elements or terrain properties that we wouldn't normally have.

189
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,705
And so I like to be inspired by the art before actually proceeding in my area of expertise.

190
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:18,909
But I also like to make sure that my work is just consistent with the overall vision.

191
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:22,512
What's interesting is that we have a template frieze.

192
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:30,360
So that have no graphical content, just a basic mockup.

193
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,744
So we can build the level using this mockup frieze.

194
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:38,584
They already have the constraints for visual things,

195
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,347
but by themselves they don't have a particular visual,

196
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,509
so they can be used in any circumstance.

197
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:51,574
But they already have the constraints for the collision and everything,

198
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:54,317
so we don't build things like we want.

199
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:58,760
We already have constraints to work with.

200
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,924
And we already know that when the artist will find a visual for the freeze

201
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:04,205
and a visual for every element,

202
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:11,536
It will fit with the collision we put so we'll not have to work a lot on top of that.

203
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:16,200
When the level is built, when the gameplay element, the situation are done,

204
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,503
we'll make a new review with the artist. We'll say

205
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:23,566
what intention we have, what was the

206
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,467
idea of the level.

207
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:30,851
And with that, they will be able to build a world landscape.

208
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:37,772
Easily, normally they don't have to touch our work, we don't have to add new constraints to their work.

209
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:42,115
And so they can build the level on top of that, graphically speaking.

210
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:48,159
We developed some small tools, including the Atlas Editor,

211
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,603
which allows artists to gather many graphic elements in a single texture,

212
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:57,385
and to cut the mesh directly by drawing them by hand in 2D.

213
00:14:58,138 --> 00:15:02,868
and to be able to re-apply them in-game and make sure that we optimize as much as possible.

214
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:07,056
It also allows to add volume and animate these objects

215
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,842
with a simplified interface that allows you to go very fast.

216
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:15,860
I have a lot of fun with trying to bring a lot of life and things happening on screen,

217
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,341
lots of wow moments.

218
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:22,303
And I think that the tools that we have, but also the concept and the game and the gameplay

219
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:27,766
mechanics really mesh well together with this kind of philosophy of creating levels that

220
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:29,627
are alive with lots of things happening.

221
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:37,351
And it makes for some very exciting results and it's always fun to see people playing

222
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:39,472
these levels and reacting to such.

223
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:41,934
animated worlds and

224
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:47,919
Just the fact that they enjoy them so much when stuff surprises them, you know, it's not predictable

225
00:15:47,919 --> 00:16:02,332
It's just wow and amazing and they always want to come back and experience something new. So it's really cool for me

226
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:05,955
Thank you, thank you

227
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:08,817
So now let's approach the character design

228
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:13,555
And how it influence the style of animation.

229
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:18,878
And how we made the transition between Rayman 2,

230
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:23,040
The Great Escape, Rayman 3, Oodlemavok,

231
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,521
and the new Rayman in 2D.

232
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:31,585
Michel Ancel is a fan of Joan Sfar, Jean-Louis Marco,

233
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:34,207
that kind of French book style.

234
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:38,769
So we decided to adapt the character design.

235
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,283
from a comic book named Roscoe le Rouge.

236
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:52,909
At the beginning of the project, we didn't know what the animation tool was capable of.

237
00:16:52,909 --> 00:17:01,835
But we knew that we wanted for the animation something easy to do, a simple process, something

238
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:08,800
cool to look at, something punchy, and not just a simple cut-out animation.

239
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:17,655
And we asked the engineer to implement scale, stretch, and squash.

240
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:24,578
Then the character design made its step into US cartoon style.

241
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:33,883
To make the animation more efficient, give more opportunity to optimize the action line

242
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:37,685
with a strong and clear pausing and more snappy timing.

243
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:47,105
And we wanted the game to look like an animated cartoon.

244
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:50,066
That means a sophisticated painterly style

245
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:55,588
for the background, a celluloid look for the characters,

246
00:17:55,588 --> 00:18:03,952
more extreme poses, and to have some wacky situations.

247
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:07,753
OK, it's clear that the style of the character design

248
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:07,913
impact.

249
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:11,957
the style of the animation.

250
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:20,482
The more your design is realistic, and the more you need drawings to make the animation

251
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:24,545
subtle, and the more it's difficult to step to reality.

252
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:28,327
That process could be long, especially for cut-out animation.

253
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:35,452
But the more the design is stylized, graphic or cartoony, and more it will be easy to adapt

254
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:37,333
the animation to cut-out style.

255
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:45,121
And our reference are Tex Havry, Chuck Jones, and Bob Glumpet,

256
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:45,862
of course.

257
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:51,304
But we were more influenced by some more recent cartoons,

258
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:59,188
like Cats on Dance or Ranald Snippy.

259
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:03,571
And cartoon snappy style is very fun to draw and to animate,

260
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:04,351
too.

261
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:08,933
But it's very practical for all kind of games.

262
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:17,647
Now let's talk about the pipeline of creation.

263
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:23,271
In order to create a strong character design, there is one very important rule.

264
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:24,312
Form follows function.

265
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:28,214
That means

266
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:31,136
the player got to identify the nature,

267
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,658
the dangerousness of an enemy.

268
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:42,161
the function of a gameplay element in one single look

269
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:50,948
that's got to help him to stay reactive and to keep the flow.

270
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:58,334
That means we got constraints

271
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:05,100
that we got to take care when we are designing a gameplay element, an enemy or any characters.

272
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:15,283
That constraint is given by the game design, the level design, or the environment.

273
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:18,364
An example.

274
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:26,468
About the design of a gameplay element in a food world.

275
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:33,290
the constraint for designing a gameplay element.

276
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,510
It took place in a kitchen.

277
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,091
It was a very...

278
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,711
environment.

279
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:42,172
The gameplay constraint included the fact that

280
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:47,333
the gameplay element threw dangerous things.

281
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,454
It was two meters high.

282
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:53,195
It needed to move right and left.

283
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:56,295
And the playable character died if he touched it.

284
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:10,623
So, okay, let's find some ideas like the dangerous things could be a fireball.

285
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:19,852
But what kind of enemy, for example, could throw a fireball?

286
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:24,076
Could be a dragon.

287
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:29,054
But a dragon in the kitchen, yes, why not?

288
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:35,116
But if we dress him with a chef's hat, an apron,

289
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:36,876
he's going to look like a cook.

290
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:41,297
And he needs a weapon for the near attack.

291
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:43,497
So no problem, he's going to have a fork.

292
00:21:43,497 --> 00:21:47,698
And it's done.

293
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:50,379
And that's the easy part in Iron Man.

294
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,760
That's an easy, crazy world.

295
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,520
Almost everything is a joke, you know?

296
00:21:57,574 --> 00:22:01,796
So now the character designer can start to work.

297
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:04,638
He makes some sketches.

298
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:05,278
One is approved.

299
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:10,022
And on that stage of process, the character

300
00:22:10,022 --> 00:22:15,325
stays a rough sketch.

301
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:19,047
He could be colored, or stay in black and white,

302
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,428
or very simple color.

303
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:25,712
After that, different parts of his body are split apart.

304
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:29,816
The animator makes the setup.

305
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:33,019
At the same time, the technical director

306
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,720
makes the animation tree.

307
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,663
Then the first animations are made with rough assets.

308
00:22:39,663 --> 00:22:42,726
And the gameplay programmer uses it

309
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:48,710
to improve artificial intelligence.

310
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,212
The timing to test his prototype,

311
00:22:51,212 --> 00:22:54,775
that's the same for the LD, the level designer.

312
00:22:56,249 --> 00:23:03,294
He can test his map with a rough asset, the same.

313
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:07,397
And after some iteration, when the map is approved,

314
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:10,900
we can clean the character up.

315
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,804
The character designer make a contrast on Photoshop.

316
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:20,987
We replace the rough asset by the clean one,

317
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:23,209
directly on the TGA texture.

318
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:24,030
No need to change.

319
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:30,278
The name on any asset or animation, no need to modify the setup.

320
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,399
The new clean character works in the game directly.

321
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:50,382
To illustrate the pipeline process, let's take another example with a playable character.

322
00:23:55,564 --> 00:24:02,656
We had already created the animation for Rayman and Globox.

323
00:24:02,656 --> 00:24:06,924
And we wanted to reuse the animation tree

324
00:24:06,924 --> 00:24:08,647
to create the Teensy.

325
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:18,583
I said before, when we are designing a character, the way in which it will be animated is always

326
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,484
kept in mind.

327
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:23,327
We must be able to separate each part of the body of the character.

328
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:29,091
For example, eye, mouth, legs, body, etc.

329
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:36,063
This method has an impact on how the character is designed, for sure.

330
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:45,548
A well-designed character means a minimum of number of assets, like you can see there,

331
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:49,950
for a maximum of amount of animations.

332
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:55,252
With the TenZ, with only one texture, we created like three...

333
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:57,773
three hundred and fifty animations.

334
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:06,185
And on Romano Regis, the animator in charge of this character,

335
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:09,948
made about 250 animations in like two weeks.

336
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:13,631
So it's really fast to produce animations.

337
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:16,232
And he was very smart, but the way

338
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:20,536
that he used the few elements that he's got,

339
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:27,981
he reused elements like different arms or different.

340
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:34,068
or the nose to be, if you want to take the tinsy

341
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:37,010
and put it in a front view.

342
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:44,277
It just deforms the nose to pretend that it's a new asset,

343
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:45,818
but it's not.

344
00:25:45,818 --> 00:25:49,762
So we've got a few examples in this video.

345
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:06,878
So it's only done with one squared texture

346
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:23,470
and with no new assets.

347
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,771
So thanks for him.

348
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:25,291
Thanks for them.

349
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:32,624
So it's an important part of the work of the animators.

350
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:37,327
You know, we are not God creating life.

351
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:44,191
We are kind of cheater, nice cheater, like a magician,

352
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:45,592
something like that.

353
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:50,035
And if we succeed to do great animation, it's like you take

354
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:52,376
part into the magic that we create.

355
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:52,757
So it's cool.

356
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:59,233
To work on characterization, it's probably the funniest part

357
00:26:59,233 --> 00:26:59,874
between us.

358
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:05,278
Emma's character designer, and me as an animator,

359
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,301
we had to work very close together.

360
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:09,902
And it's really, really cool.

361
00:27:09,902 --> 00:27:13,245
And it's very good for the game, too.

362
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:17,508
One thing make our production very efficient,

363
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:22,312
especially at the beginning when the team was very small.

364
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:30,171
is a multi-talented profile of the collaborators and the animators.

365
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:38,619
To make the ideal crew, we thought it would be smart to recruit animators from a French

366
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:39,980
animation school.

367
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:48,168
In fact, in school they learn a lot of different school, they learn traditional animation.

368
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:53,818
3D, and they learn to use a lot of different software.

369
00:27:53,818 --> 00:28:00,122
So, our animators are very multi-talented.

370
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:02,844
That's right.

371
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:07,247
Most of them are character designers, too.

372
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:09,769
They can cut out a character, make the setup.

373
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:15,690
Some are also storyboard artists, color artists.

374
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:26,837
That means we have a complete small crew able to work on gameplay animation,

375
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:30,559
make a cutscene from the concept to the final.

376
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,601
That's very efficient and practical.

377
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:38,383
And to illustrate, we have a video.

378
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:48,342
The last one, but...

379
00:28:48,342 --> 00:28:50,182
The animators.

380
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:53,843
Let's see that.

381
00:29:10,992 --> 00:29:18,787
For example, for Blue Box, I try to go on trips with Rupi, Bardet, Deception, all those things,

382
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:21,292
the sleeping side but cool at the same time.

383
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,864
There was already a Globox made on Rayman 3D, so we had to remake a Globox a little bit weird.

384
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:32,211
We had to do something a little bit different from the usual crazy Globox, where you're just messing around, doing stupid things in every way.

385
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:35,233
We had to do something a little bit more groovy, so to speak.

386
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:40,539
It was interesting because we had to remake a character that already exists and that we've seen a lot.

387
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:44,062
We tried to see where we could put some fun, for example.

388
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,693
on things like a walk, jump, attack sequence.

389
00:29:49,693 --> 00:29:52,595
As the space is very limited to do an anime,

390
00:29:52,595 --> 00:29:56,698
we're not going to be able to express ourselves as much as possible.

391
00:29:56,698 --> 00:30:01,321
So we're going to try to make a distinct pose appear, a bit crazy.

392
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:04,983
And we're going to try to put the fun there.

393
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:08,365
And if not, to really let go, poses like wait or stand,

394
00:30:08,365 --> 00:30:11,887
where we have a beach of time, not unlimited, but much wider.

395
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:13,808
There, we can express ourselves and do crazy things.

396
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:19,539
The inters are managed by GeneAnim, so you just have to set your own pace,

397
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:23,947
put some good pausings, and the machine does the rest.

398
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:27,696
The idea of Genanim comes from Michel.

399
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:33,040
Throughout the creation of the tool, throughout its development,

400
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,922
we tried to keep it simple and intuitive,

401
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:38,464
to be able to iterate quickly and easily.

402
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:41,566
One of the main advantages of the Genanim chest

403
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:44,608
is that it allows no intermediary between the drawing

404
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:47,431
and animation. There is no interpretation between the two.

405
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:52,396
The animator will directly animate the drawings of the concept artist.

406
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:56,179
This makes it possible to be very faithful to the original concept.

407
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:00,684
We take the picture and we extract from it a mesh.

408
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,918
But it's a mesh that we can deform to make the movement.

409
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:09,980
So we can take an arm and we put points on it.

410
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,401
And after, very easily, we can deform,

411
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:16,422
we move really the picture to create the animations.

412
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:26,415
Every time an animator needs a special feature, we discuss it with our DT.

413
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:32,938
My work with U3 is to evaluate improvements that could be made

414
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:39,240
to facilitate the work of the animators or to optimize the performance of the characters in the game.

415
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,123
It allows you to have directly what you download in the software.

416
00:31:45,123 --> 00:31:45,363
It's cool.

417
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:56,628
So we jump into the technical part of this presentation.

418
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:57,908
What is GenAnim?

419
00:31:57,908 --> 00:32:02,710
GenAnim is a UBI framework animation tool.

420
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,091
It's a customizable tool created at Ubisoft Montpellier

421
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,911
for Rayman Origins.

422
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:11,392
And we reuse and upgrade it for Rayman Legends.

423
00:32:11,392 --> 00:32:16,314
It's done principally by Philippe Vimon and Yossri Salas.

424
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:17,374
It's to, uh...

425
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:22,519
to some tool programmer that they work very close to us.

426
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,829
So it's really cool if we need to improve some tools

427
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:30,452
as animator.

428
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:33,236
We just ask them to improve the.

429
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:38,853
one particular tool, and they just do it.

430
00:32:38,853 --> 00:32:43,195
And in like one week, we've got the new tool

431
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:43,975
at our disposal.

432
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:49,018
So it's made as all the technology.

433
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:53,620
It's made to fit with those specific needs in 2D.

434
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,481
So we can put directly, as we've seen before,

435
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:58,302
the drawing of the artist.

436
00:32:58,302 --> 00:33:02,264
And here is the drawing of the character artist

437
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:04,085
into the animation software.

438
00:33:05,314 --> 00:33:11,756
So we can keep the essence of the drawing, and there is no long skinning or rigging to do.

439
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:17,298
And we save a lot of time to work on the characterization of the characters.

440
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:22,980
And this adds a lot of fun into the game.

441
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:30,656
It's an intuitive to use tool.

442
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:35,804
The animator, like me, I can quickly transform any drawings

443
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:38,789
to an animated character.

444
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,191
I can do my own actors set up.

445
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,993
I can upgrade it with new drawings.

446
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:46,775
If I start an animation and I need some new assets,

447
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:50,076
I just have to ask Christophe to draw them,

448
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:51,757
and then he send it to me.

449
00:33:51,757 --> 00:33:57,920
And I can implement that into my actual animation,

450
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,622
into my actual setup, with no long time,

451
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,124
no long technical stuff to manage.

452
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:06,805
It's really easy to use.

453
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,667
The animations are done faster, so we

454
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,929
can product many original characters

455
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,870
in a very tiny time of production.

456
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:21,673
And that's why Rayman is a rich and immersive 2D platformer

457
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:23,273
with a lot of funny characters.

458
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:28,976
It's a simple to use tool, but it's powerful.

459
00:34:28,976 --> 00:34:33,058
We have additive animation for the gameplay needs.

460
00:34:33,058 --> 00:34:36,500
We have inverse kinematics to facilitate the animator's work.

461
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:42,743
We've got polyline collision to fit with the gameplay collision with the punch, the hit, and all that stuff.

462
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:49,165
We can add event on the timeline to trigger effects, sounds,

463
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:56,387
to separate the animation between transition and loop to help the gameplay programmer.

464
00:34:56,387 --> 00:35:00,328
And the optimizations while tinkering too.

465
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:01,608
We can practice.

466
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:04,029
When you create a character, you have...

467
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:07,967
several different textures, different assets,

468
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:11,309
different arms, different legs, different bodies.

469
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:17,812
And we create like one, two, three, a lot of textures.

470
00:35:17,812 --> 00:35:21,114
And we have a tool that just brings

471
00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:25,616
all the assets in the textures and brings them

472
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:29,918
into one single texture with the space optimized.

473
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:31,759
So it's really cool.

474
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:32,359
We don't have to.

475
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:38,847
to take care really about that at the first time

476
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:42,587
when we're doing animations.

477
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:45,008
We just take care of that later.

478
00:35:45,008 --> 00:35:48,068
And the optimization is really good.

479
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:53,909
That allows us to put a lot of assets into the game,

480
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:57,630
because we've got the space to do it.

481
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:01,491
We can also reuse the animation of a character

482
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:03,391
by changing his skinning.

483
00:36:04,024 --> 00:36:05,405
It's great.

484
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:11,534
So I can make, if I want, a different look of Freyman

485
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:16,080
or some bosses that we've made that are a gabary.

486
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,283
They have a shape and a.

487
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:30,640
I can't just talk too much about that, because it's not really allowed.

488
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,202
You know, Rayman Legends is not out, so you'll see when you'll buy it.

489
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:42,044
It's okay.

490
00:36:42,044 --> 00:36:49,006
And the easiness to use GeneAnim means that we can produce fast and a lot.

491
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:58,847
And to make move things, it's a better way to make it alive and rich.

492
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:08,449
And of course we have characters like playable, enemies, bosses, fairies, different costumes

493
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:12,170
like you said, or skins for the same characters.

494
00:37:14,304 --> 00:37:22,366
For example, the fairies in the Oreman origin were one skeleton in a different costume.

495
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:34,688
We can animate platforms, breakables, groups, backgrounds, UI and interface,

496
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:40,389
crowds, plants, mechanics with a different system of animation.

497
00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:46,809
We use GNAnim for gameplay animation and for cutscene in-game videos.

498
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,954
Everything needs to be animated.

499
00:37:50,954 --> 00:37:58,503
So, we're gonna see...

500
00:37:58,503 --> 00:38:01,466
I'm just gonna move...

501
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:09,833
So we're going to see a few examples of how we bring life

502
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:14,155
into the Rayman's world really easily.

503
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:21,377
And it's a low-cost character that we call life elements

504
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:24,738
that we can put on the foreground or on the background

505
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:26,759
to bring life to the game.

506
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:32,380
So here we work with a simplified.

507
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:39,659
simplified version of O2.

508
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:39,960
We just.

509
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:51,505
We don't keep the information of the bones, we only keep the information of the miges, the drain.

510
00:38:51,505 --> 00:39:05,053
And so we can make a lot, a lot, a lot of those things. We can put them into a level and we still have 60 frames per second. It's great.

511
00:39:16,302 --> 00:39:18,824
Then we can animate effects too.

512
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:26,771
And this technique is really different, kind of.

513
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:30,855
It's just like a sprite animation,

514
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:34,639
but we put it in GenAnim so we can add deformation

515
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,680
to that sprite animation.

516
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:43,254
And with that one single texture, it looks like a drawing.

517
00:39:43,254 --> 00:39:43,954
Old-fashioned style.

518
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:45,435
Yeah, old-fashioned style.

519
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:45,755
That's it.

520
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:51,257
So now it's time for the demonstration.

521
00:39:51,257 --> 00:39:58,060
I'm going to work a bit on the genanine,

522
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,042
and we're going to see how it works together.

523
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:05,503
So I got to just get out of here.

524
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:19,763
So we prepare a character, Kristoff Drozd.

525
00:40:19,763 --> 00:40:26,067
This small character looks like a testicle a bit.

526
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:26,688
But it's OK.

527
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:34,093
I'm going to animate it.

528
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:35,094
Fine.

529
00:40:35,094 --> 00:40:42,038
We can make anything alive in Roman origin, even a testicle.

530
00:40:44,584 --> 00:40:47,286
So I'm going to do like if I was in my workspace.

531
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:58,996
So I'm maybe going to skip some parts, because we are a bit

532
00:40:58,996 --> 00:40:59,517
late.

533
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:06,602
But I'm going to try to do an animation really quickly.

534
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:09,165
So first, when you open GenAnim, you've

535
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:10,846
got nothing inside of it.

536
00:41:12,998 --> 00:41:20,402
FaceUp sends me the drawings, and then I cut it out in few parts.

537
00:41:20,402 --> 00:41:33,748
And I just had to drag and drop the TGA textures that I created

538
00:41:33,748 --> 00:41:37,130
to start the setup of the character.

539
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,271
So I was talking about cheating.

540
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:43,250
Obviously, I'm going to cheat here.

541
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:48,631
I'm just going to show you how we create easily a bone

542
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:53,052
that we can rename.

543
00:41:53,052 --> 00:42:03,375
And this bone is not ever attached to the visual.

544
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:09,116
So I had to create a mesh.

545
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:09,717
That's it.

546
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:24,279
Easy.

547
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:27,862
So I'll create mesh around each element.

548
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:31,065
I'll create bones to control them.

549
00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:33,087
And here I've got some templates.

550
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:38,591
I'm going to create one template per element.

551
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:39,832
And cheating.

552
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:40,013
OK.

553
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,010
And we just do all the elements like that.

554
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:49,411
You've got here the template names

555
00:42:49,411 --> 00:42:53,812
that we can rename to find ourselves easily

556
00:42:53,812 --> 00:42:55,592
in the animation process.

557
00:42:55,592 --> 00:43:05,174
Then with those bones, I'm going to copy them and put that

558
00:43:05,174 --> 00:43:07,275
into the skeleton edition.

559
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:12,098
to connect the different parts of the body.

560
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:18,440
Like, OK, the arms to the body, the mouth to the body,

561
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:18,960
to the testicle.

562
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,041
I'm going to copy that.

563
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:29,283
It's really not fast.

564
00:43:29,283 --> 00:43:31,363
It's really not.

565
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:33,564
It's easy to do.

566
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:40,140
to do the setup, and I've done it yesterday night.

567
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:45,942
And it takes me like half an hour to just doing the setup

568
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:48,362
and then creating the one animation.

569
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:52,504
I think we're going to have no time,

570
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:57,285
if you want to have some questions to ask at the end.

571
00:43:57,285 --> 00:44:00,686
So stop speaking and start working.

572
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:04,047
Thank you.

573
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:08,705
the bone of the body.

574
00:44:08,705 --> 00:44:13,291
There is no visual attached because we

575
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:15,474
are in the edition mode.

576
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:30,888
So the mouth is there.

577
00:44:30,888 --> 00:44:32,769
You can attach them with that.

578
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:37,512
You can see that with the blue line, they are connected.

579
00:44:37,512 --> 00:44:50,560
I'm going to do that for all the bones.

580
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,301
It's going to be more faster.

581
00:44:58,273 --> 00:45:02,737
It's a bit scary to animate just in front of you.

582
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:06,360
It's an encouragement.

583
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,941
Woo!

584
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:07,201
Oh.

585
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:07,662
All right.

586
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:09,443
Thank you.

587
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:12,606
Yeah.

588
00:45:12,606 --> 00:45:15,088
Yeah.

589
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:15,128
OK.

590
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:15,628
There exists.

591
00:45:30,534 --> 00:45:40,677
It's a kind of old version of Shendanim, so there is not really an interface or something like that.

592
00:45:40,677 --> 00:45:42,418
Oh... Okay...

593
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:44,979
Cut to math...

594
00:45:44,979 --> 00:45:46,299
Just hit one...

595
00:45:58,082 --> 00:46:02,565
Okay, so the arms are left.

596
00:46:02,565 --> 00:46:05,727
Okay, this way.

597
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:13,552
So all I'm doing is just connect

598
00:46:13,552 --> 00:46:17,494
the different parts of the bodies together.

599
00:46:17,494 --> 00:46:22,478
So now when I move the body bones,

600
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:26,540
all the things come with it.

601
00:46:27,298 --> 00:46:28,959
Now I connect them to the root.

602
00:46:28,959 --> 00:46:36,301
OK, now I have my bones down with all the influences.

603
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:41,642
Now I can start to animate something.

604
00:46:41,642 --> 00:46:42,522
Woo, my favorite part.

605
00:46:42,522 --> 00:46:53,525
So I'm just going to call the visual on the bones.

606
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:15,457
So I call those templates.

607
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,898
Okay. Eyes.

608
00:47:16,898 --> 00:47:22,199
I forgot the eyes.

609
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:27,101
Can I sing a song?

610
00:47:30,074 --> 00:47:36,419
So I'm going to bring all these elements in the animation mode.

611
00:47:36,419 --> 00:47:37,861
OK, so it looks like that for now.

612
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:45,708
And I need to refer to the drawings of Christophe

613
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:51,694
to see how I'm going to mix them together.

614
00:47:55,588 --> 00:48:07,374
So I can control the z function to put an element in front

615
00:48:07,374 --> 00:48:13,237
or in the back.

616
00:48:13,237 --> 00:48:18,880
So now the mouth is in the front.

617
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,163
The eyes are in the front.

618
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:30,406
I'm just going to stay in France.

619
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:39,911
I text the same visual for the right arm and the left arm.

620
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:46,635
And I'm going to just symmetrize them to bring some less

621
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,476
space in the database.

622
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:54,989
The same thing for the foot.

623
00:48:54,989 --> 00:48:59,290
For the feet.

624
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,992
Feet, feet.

625
00:49:02,992 --> 00:49:03,572
Okay.

626
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:03,632
And...

627
00:49:03,632 --> 00:49:03,792
It's...

628
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:06,793
Is it okay for you?

629
00:49:06,793 --> 00:49:07,433
Yeah.

630
00:49:07,433 --> 00:49:08,614
Okay, I approve it.

631
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:16,557
We've got the pair.

632
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:18,618
Right.

633
00:49:21,522 --> 00:49:27,166
So now, all I had to do is just put, let's make a jump.

634
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:27,827
Okay, jump.

635
00:49:27,827 --> 00:49:34,712
So I can deform the scale in different axis,

636
00:49:34,712 --> 00:49:40,676
like X, Y, and it's still 10 minutes,

637
00:49:40,676 --> 00:49:46,861
so I had to do that really fast.

638
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:47,181
Okay.

639
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:57,318
So I'm going to scale axes in X and Y with the deformation

640
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:01,641
to do something like that.

641
00:50:01,641 --> 00:50:11,467
Yeah, I use a special thing that allows me to deform all

642
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,648
in the same time.

643
00:50:13,648 --> 00:50:14,509
That makes me.

644
00:50:18,486 --> 00:50:33,213
I'm gonna win some times with that.

645
00:50:33,213 --> 00:50:36,494
That's my keyframe.

646
00:50:36,494 --> 00:50:44,318
Not done, ever! Thank you!

647
00:50:45,652 --> 00:50:49,713
My boss look at me when I work, and I'm not sure I appreciate that.

648
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,593
That's pretty sure.

649
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:57,275
Maybe I'm going to be fired at the end of this presentation, so I have to do the best that I can.

650
00:50:57,275 --> 00:51:02,197
Okay.

651
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:11,899
So I can copy past different keys.

652
00:51:11,899 --> 00:51:14,880
It's not going to be a subtle animation, but...

653
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:22,204
It's just going to show you the power of the tool.

654
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:27,828
So I can play, but it's going to be really fast.

655
00:51:27,828 --> 00:51:28,468
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

656
00:51:28,468 --> 00:51:37,194
So I can reduce the speed just to see if it works.

657
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:43,018
Seems pretty good for a two-minute animation.

658
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:44,680
And then.

659
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:48,898
I'm going to do the transition.

660
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:54,300
So I insert frames between the key frames.

661
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,500
You can't put any at all?

662
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:56,660
Huh?

663
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:02,722
You can't put any transition at all?

664
00:52:02,722 --> 00:52:03,682
Yeah.

665
00:52:03,682 --> 00:52:06,523
Almost done.

666
00:52:32,073 --> 00:52:32,713
Wing wing.

667
00:52:32,713 --> 00:52:41,920
We've got no overlap here, but it's a start.

668
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,260
It's a start.

669
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:48,805
We're not going to develop that so much,

670
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:52,308
because maybe you've got some questions.

671
00:52:52,308 --> 00:52:54,469
And I want to answer that if I can.

672
00:52:54,469 --> 00:52:58,712
So OK, I'm going to just.

673
00:53:00,035 --> 00:53:09,820
do a few resume, a few summary about what we've said in that conference.

674
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:14,603
So, if I can take you, give you advice.

675
00:53:17,557 --> 00:53:23,462
Just communicate a lot with your team members and leave your comfort zone to be more efficient.

676
00:53:23,462 --> 00:53:25,524
It's very cool.

677
00:53:25,524 --> 00:53:32,509
For my part, I work a lot with the gameplay programmers and it helps to put a lot of life

678
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:39,675
into the game because they've got the conscience of what I need and I've got the conscience

679
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:40,416
of what they need.

680
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:43,923
If you reinvent an iconic character,

681
00:53:43,923 --> 00:53:46,865
be sure to remember where he comes from

682
00:53:46,865 --> 00:53:50,227
and where you want him to go.

683
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:55,932
Use tools that allow you to fit the best

684
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,934
with your vision of your game.

685
00:53:58,934 --> 00:54:01,076
If you want to create any characters,

686
00:54:01,076 --> 00:54:04,618
just remember that forms follow functions in the video game.

687
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:09,682
It's really, really important to not losing the player.

688
00:54:12,053 --> 00:54:15,335
And if you want to do a good characterization,

689
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,097
keep your silhouette very recognizable.

690
00:54:18,097 --> 00:54:21,299
Don't lose the fact that it had to stay

691
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:24,462
visible in the game space.

692
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:28,164
And focus on strong posing.

693
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:29,985
That's it.

694
00:54:29,985 --> 00:54:33,168
So thank you for coming.

695
00:54:33,168 --> 00:54:36,150
It's the end of our presentation.

696
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:36,250
Woo!

697
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,190
Thank you.

698
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:37,571
Thanks.

699
00:54:37,571 --> 00:54:38,091
Thanks a lot.

700
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:40,233
Thanks.

701
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:41,073
A bwing, bwing, bwing.

702
00:54:42,515 --> 00:54:49,901
So if you have any questions, I need someone to translate because my English is not so fluent, as you can see.

703
00:54:49,901 --> 00:54:56,046
I call Gabrielle Schragers, she's the writer on Rayman Origins, actually.

704
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:59,329
So, big applause for her. Thank you, Gabrielle.

705
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:07,695
And just try and help these guys if you have any questions. So, please, ask away and I'll translate.

706
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,484
Hey, first of all, big fan, well done.

707
00:55:11,484 --> 00:55:12,425
It was an amazing job.

708
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:16,531
But then also, you have this amazing game on console,

709
00:55:16,531 --> 00:55:18,253
and you moved to an amazing game on iOS.

710
00:55:18,253 --> 00:55:20,456
Can you talk a little bit about the iOS game?

711
00:55:20,456 --> 00:55:21,498
Was it the same team?

712
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:24,301
Did you guys use the same engine at all

713
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,384
when you made the iPad iPhone game?

714
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:32,893
Ah, so we used the same tools to do on all the iOS for the sharing.

715
00:55:32,893 --> 00:55:33,934
Is it the same tools?

716
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,775
Yes, exactly the same tools.

717
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:38,557
Same engine, same tools.

718
00:55:38,557 --> 00:55:41,518
Same pipeline, same tools.

719
00:55:41,518 --> 00:55:43,760
Not on the tablet.

720
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,640
Alright.

721
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:55,407
Yeah, it's another engine, but for all the consoles for PC, for the Vita too.

722
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:58,853
I think that's the same engine and the same tools.

723
00:55:58,853 --> 00:55:59,314
Yeah.

724
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:03,417
And from art directing the work on the iOS game,

725
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:05,599
the tablet game, Jungle Run,

726
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:11,984
were you art directing it, or was it outsourced at all?

727
00:56:11,984 --> 00:56:14,025
Man 2 speaking French

728
00:56:14,025 --> 00:56:14,266
No. No. No.

729
00:56:14,266 --> 00:56:15,046
It's another team.

730
00:56:15,046 --> 00:56:18,409
It's another team, but they were using all the assets,

731
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:20,130
obviously, that were created for...

732
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:30,841
They reuse the assets that we create on Rayman Origins, so they keep a lot of the same animations.

733
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:31,642
Fantastic, thank you guys.

734
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:32,062
You're welcome.

735
00:56:32,062 --> 00:56:33,342
Anybody else?

736
00:56:33,342 --> 00:56:34,042
Don't be shy.

737
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:34,963
Not shy, just short.

738
00:56:34,963 --> 00:56:37,003
I don't have a question.

739
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:38,384
I gotta run.

740
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:47,547
But I just want to say, you guys are like, Rayman is the reason I'm in the industry.

741
00:56:48,211 --> 00:56:50,992
I've hopped around to a lot of really stylized studios.

742
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:53,412
So keep doing this rad stuff.

743
00:56:53,412 --> 00:56:55,973
This latest game is amazing.

744
00:56:55,973 --> 00:56:58,853
You guys are fantastic.

745
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:00,713
So thanks for inspiring a veteran.

746
00:57:00,713 --> 00:57:02,014
Continue, continue.

747
00:57:02,014 --> 00:57:03,994
That was a really easy question.

748
00:57:03,994 --> 00:57:04,414
Thank you.

749
00:57:04,414 --> 00:57:04,734
Thank you.

750
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:06,195
That was not really a question, but thank you.

751
00:57:06,195 --> 00:57:06,255
OK.

752
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:06,515
It's all you.

753
00:57:06,515 --> 00:57:15,777
Did you also have any technical artists to help you with the particle effects, the special effects, or was it all done in 2D?

754
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:30,576
The question, I should translate into English, is whether or not we have particular tools to create the special effects in the animation, or whether it's the same tools as we're using for all the other animations?

755
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:40,220
If all the effects and the particle was all draw, or if someone did a specific job on that using other tools or technical artists.

756
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,841
Thank you for translating for yourself.

757
00:57:44,615 --> 00:57:46,496
We have...

758
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,857
Okay.

759
00:57:47,857 --> 00:57:55,842
On Roman Origin, we have tools for the FX, of course,

760
00:57:55,842 --> 00:58:00,025
but we have two FX artists.

761
00:58:00,025 --> 00:58:04,828
One comes from the traditional animation.

762
00:58:06,288 --> 00:58:14,576
And the other is more technical and use a procedure more specific for procedural stuff.

763
00:58:14,576 --> 00:58:16,818
For the particles?

764
00:58:16,818 --> 00:58:19,180
Yeah, particles and stuff like that, yeah.

765
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,403
But they were all hand drawn, were they not?

766
00:58:23,403 --> 00:58:25,585
You don't like, did they see me?

767
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:25,986
Yes, yes.

768
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:26,606
Oh yes, yes.

769
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:27,627
They were all hand drawn.

770
00:58:27,627 --> 00:58:27,927
Okay.

771
00:58:27,927 --> 00:58:30,710
Go ahead.

772
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:31,370
Bye.

773
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,080
Thanks for coming, great talk.

774
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,223
That Gen Anim tool looks really amazing.

775
00:58:36,223 --> 00:58:38,244
I was wondering if you guys had any plans

776
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:40,947
to distribute or sell the tool to other companies.

777
00:58:40,947 --> 00:58:43,709
I will show you a few questions.

778
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:48,653
So the question is if we're going to sell the tool

779
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:52,196
or share the tool.

780
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:55,678
I think we...

781
00:58:56,768 --> 00:59:02,757
We want to share the tool, but I'm not sure about the position of Ubisoft at that point.

782
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,039
So it's over.

783
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:06,079
OK?

784
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,540
It could be great to share that tool.

785
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,721
We had to do a small modification

786
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:15,323
to make it a lot more user-friendly.

787
00:59:15,323 --> 00:59:20,005
It could be great, but I'm going to ask my bosses

788
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:24,768
and post something on the Facebook page of Rayman

789
00:59:24,768 --> 00:59:28,389
or something like that to answer your questions,

790
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:30,730
because I really don't know what.

791
00:59:31,247 --> 00:59:32,907
strategy.

792
00:59:32,907 --> 00:59:33,988
For the moment.

793
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,128
Thank you very much.

794
00:59:35,128 --> 00:59:35,888
Thank you.

795
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:37,029
Thank you.

796
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:38,790
Thank you.

797
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:46,753
Sorry, I just found out that we actually have nothing

798
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:49,114
in here next session, so if you wanted to QA a few

799
00:59:49,114 --> 00:59:53,095
more questions, you're more than welcome to.

800
00:59:53,095 --> 00:59:53,515
Cool.

801
00:59:53,515 --> 00:59:55,116
Additional time.

802
00:59:55,116 --> 00:59:57,457
I can stay one hour

803
00:59:57,457 --> 00:59:58,757
longer then.

804
00:59:58,757 --> 00:59:59,938
Thank you.

805
01:00:01,153 --> 01:00:11,821
Hi, I was just curious how you handled the lighting on the characters because it seems to bend and not just wash over the flat 2D.

806
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:12,541
So how did you handle that?

807
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:16,184
He was asking how you handled the lighting on the characters because it was 2D, 3D...

808
01:00:16,184 --> 01:00:21,007
If you ever see a French rapper, you'll be like...

809
01:00:21,007 --> 01:00:26,531
On Roman Origins, there was no dynamic lighting.

810
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:28,947
It's like a cartoon.

811
01:00:28,947 --> 01:00:32,209
It's like an animated cartoon.

812
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:34,291
No dynamic lighting.

813
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:36,452
It's just like a traditional cartoon lighting.

814
01:00:36,452 --> 01:00:39,034
Hi, yeah, I was wondering, as an animator,

815
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:46,440
was there like a learning curve to using the actual polygons yourself?

816
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,762
Does that make sense?

817
01:00:48,762 --> 01:00:52,484
Did you say a learning curve? I'm sorry.

818
01:00:52,484 --> 01:00:55,367
Yeah, to defining the polygons when animating.

819
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:00,047
as opposed to it just being a square.

820
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:03,812
Is there a curve to make it square?

821
01:01:03,812 --> 01:01:08,159
No, it's not just a square.

822
01:01:09,813 --> 01:01:12,454
I didn't show you that because I've got no time,

823
01:01:12,454 --> 01:01:15,955
but you can deform the mesh to adapt it

824
01:01:15,955 --> 01:01:19,817
to the shape of the assets.

825
01:01:19,817 --> 01:01:23,538
And when you do an articulation tool, as you can see,

826
01:01:23,538 --> 01:01:27,039
as you have seen in the video of the animators,

827
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:32,321
you can replace the, you can move the points.

828
01:01:33,085 --> 01:01:38,688
to be close to the shape of the arm.

829
01:01:38,688 --> 01:01:45,591
And you can also move those points,

830
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:46,712
like to make a...

831
01:01:46,712 --> 01:01:47,893
a plieur.

832
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:52,875
A fold. You want to create a fold.

833
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:56,517
If you want to create a fold more stronger or more smooth,

834
01:01:56,517 --> 01:01:58,898
you can modify that to answer your question.

835
01:01:58,898 --> 01:01:59,578
Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Thank you.

836
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:07,521
Oh, okay. Go ahead.

837
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:09,483
How long did it take you to develop the tool?

838
01:02:09,483 --> 01:02:17,390
All from creating the animation system and developing the 2D background, you know, layering.

839
01:02:18,555 --> 01:02:29,340
How long did it take you to develop the GeneAnim tool?

840
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:56,614
So when did it become functional, was it a two month window, three month window?

841
01:02:56,614 --> 01:02:57,354
Oh, from...

842
01:02:57,354 --> 01:03:00,095
It was very, very quick.

843
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:08,659
And Michel worked with a very small team of artists and engineers to do that.

844
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:16,423
And it took about six months to get it up and running, basically.

845
01:03:16,423 --> 01:03:16,843
Awesome.

846
01:03:17,301 --> 01:03:17,901
Thank you.

847
01:03:17,901 --> 01:03:19,262
Beautiful stuff.

848
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:19,642
Cool.

849
01:03:19,642 --> 01:03:22,523
Other questions, other questions,

850
01:03:22,523 --> 01:03:23,603
there's questions everywhere.

851
01:03:23,603 --> 01:03:26,644
I just wanted to compliment you on how intuitive

852
01:03:26,644 --> 01:03:33,447
the Genonym tool seemed, and also you showed a video

853
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:37,968
with the level editor, appearing to be just as intuitive

854
01:03:37,968 --> 01:03:40,209
as the Genonym tool.

855
01:03:40,209 --> 01:03:44,511
Is it all part of Genonym, and maybe if you guys,

856
01:03:44,511 --> 01:03:45,011
if Ubisoft.

857
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:48,914
sells it, will the level editor and how intuitive that looks

858
01:03:48,914 --> 01:03:49,795
be packaged with it?

859
01:03:49,795 --> 01:03:50,736
That'd be awesome.

860
01:03:50,736 --> 01:03:53,017
Yes, so the level editor is not genanime,

861
01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:55,399
but it's part of the framework package.

862
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:56,220
Yes, it's another tool.

863
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,501
Yes, that's right.

864
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:00,583
Yes, framework, it's part of genanime,

865
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,505
is part of the framework engine.

866
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:05,427
So it's included in the package.

867
01:04:05,427 --> 01:04:10,151
And yes, the level design tools are incredibly intuitive.

868
01:04:10,151 --> 01:04:11,812
And the level designers love to work with them.

869
01:04:11,812 --> 01:04:13,813
So yes, easy tools.

870
01:04:16,422 --> 01:04:21,386
Hi, it's a question about art direction.

871
01:04:21,386 --> 01:04:21,706
Can I ask it?

872
01:04:21,706 --> 01:04:23,307
About animation.

873
01:04:23,307 --> 01:04:29,633
I was wondering if you had an artist that

874
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:33,696
unified all the style of the different levels,

875
01:04:33,696 --> 01:04:36,138
since all are painted.

876
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:40,602
Or if each artist managed to keep the style consistent

877
01:04:40,602 --> 01:04:41,502
through the game.

878
01:04:41,883 --> 01:04:57,223
The question is, do you have an artist who is in charge of unifying the style throughout the different levels?

879
01:04:58,332 --> 01:05:01,396
It's like in many productions.

880
01:05:01,396 --> 01:05:07,024
Michel Ancel, on Reman Origins, is an artistic director.

881
01:05:07,024 --> 01:05:12,111
And each concept artist and each level artist

882
01:05:12,111 --> 01:05:14,955
is able to work on any level, any world.

883
01:05:15,814 --> 01:05:23,018
So you're saying Michel Ancel, as the artistic director of the project,

884
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:25,519
obviously does the...

885
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:31,783
makes sure that there's the coherency throughout the world

886
01:05:31,783 --> 01:05:38,166
and every one of our artists are capable of working on any of the levels

887
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:43,950
and adapting their style to whatever his creative and artistic vision is.

888
01:05:44,675 --> 01:05:46,235
As we said, of course, artists have a...

889
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:51,296
Sometimes they work more easily with organic material,

890
01:05:51,296 --> 01:05:53,677
with life, living organisms,

891
01:05:53,677 --> 01:05:56,677
and others have a preference for working with more metallic

892
01:05:56,677 --> 01:05:59,138
and structured architectural elements.

893
01:05:59,138 --> 01:06:02,738
But so they can choose also which universe

894
01:06:02,738 --> 01:06:04,099
works the best for them.

895
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:05,279
Okay.

896
01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:07,899
Well, obviously, great team and great games.

897
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:08,100
Thanks.

898
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:08,780
Thank you very much.

899
01:06:10,894 --> 01:06:14,896
Hi, this is also about the artistic direction of the levels actually.

900
01:06:14,896 --> 01:06:20,939
So one thing that struck me was that the levels of Rayman Origins were really imaginative

901
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:22,379
and they felt they really popped in a way.

902
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:27,362
So I was curious about how did you go about creating the particular style of each level?

903
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:32,284
Was it like somebody wrote a story for it or was it up to the imagination?

904
01:06:33,253 --> 01:06:36,935
Yeah, that's part of the creative process of working with Michel,

905
01:06:36,935 --> 01:06:41,018
who will come in every day with a great story to tell about,

906
01:06:41,018 --> 01:06:42,458
which are all sort of micro-stories,

907
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:46,601
so little stories of what happens in the food world.

908
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:50,303
And then together, the team bounces off his ideas

909
01:06:50,303 --> 01:06:53,524
and makes character designs and backgrounds,

910
01:06:53,524 --> 01:06:56,246
and then iterate.

911
01:06:56,663 --> 01:07:02,208
Every day, every day, every day, there is new stuff that pops, that appears and disappears,

912
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:07,792
depending on what Michel, what pops into his brain, and how much the rest of the team embraces

913
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:12,756
each of the levels. So that's, yeah, that's why there's so many unbelievable variety, like 70

914
01:07:12,756 --> 01:07:19,702
levels with, I don't know how many, completely different environments. Yeah, and that's part

915
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:23,905
of the fun, and that's what makes Rayman. And it's because we're in this completely iterative

916
01:07:23,905 --> 01:07:24,926
process constantly.

917
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:28,801
That's so much stuff, so much creativity just goes out.

918
01:07:28,801 --> 01:07:33,325
And probably as much as you guys have seen on screen,

919
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:36,206
also gets lost in the process because we

920
01:07:36,206 --> 01:07:39,289
can't keep everything.

921
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:39,929
Thank you.

922
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:40,309
That's it.

923
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:40,369
OK.

924
01:07:40,369 --> 01:07:40,589
OK.

925
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:40,790
OK.

926
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,730
Go to lunch now.

927
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,471
It's better.

928
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:44,472
If you've got any questions, we're

929
01:07:44,472 --> 01:07:47,094
going to stay outside a bit.

930
01:07:47,094 --> 01:07:48,054
Thanks to you.

931
01:07:48,054 --> 01:07:48,835
You've been great.

932
01:07:48,835 --> 01:07:50,456
Thank you very much.

933
01:07:50,456 --> 01:07:50,976
Thanks.

934
01:07:50,976 --> 01:07:53,018
Thank you for coming.
