1
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,341
We were just standing up here talking about it.

2
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,602
This is the 15th annual Experimental Gameplay Workshop.

3
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:16,702
Woo!

4
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:17,503
Woo!

5
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:17,583
Woo!

6
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:17,663
Woo!

7
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:17,743
Woo!

8
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:17,823
Woo!

9
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:17,903
Woo!

10
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:17,983
Woo!

11
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:22,304
Woo!

12
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:22,424
Woo!

13
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:22,584
Woo!

14
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:23,024
Woo!

15
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:25,425
That's 15 years of experimental games.

16
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:26,705
That's amazing.

17
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:29,586
How many of you have been to Experimental Gameplay before?

18
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:31,966
Yeah.

19
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:32,527
Welcome back.

20
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:36,288
All right, now how many of you are here for the very first time?

21
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:36,348
Oh.

22
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:42,921
Oh, we're so happy you chose us and that you waited in the long line.

23
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:44,242
That was long.

24
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:50,463
Thank you for getting into the session, for sitting so nice and peacefully and just gathering

25
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:51,003
here together.

26
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:53,104
I'm not going to lie.

27
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:57,705
It's been a little bit of a tough year so far for a lot of us.

28
00:00:58,305 --> 00:00:59,985
We lost some people that we really love.

29
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:03,026
We've seen a little bit too much of some people.

30
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:09,499
And when we were trying to think of what to say, you know, to welcome you into the session,

31
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:16,146
I realized that what I wanted to say is that this is the best session of GDC.

32
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,535
Because it's about the community.

33
00:01:24,976 --> 00:01:27,918
We could not have organized this year

34
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:31,861
without the help of some amazing, amazing people.

35
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,983
So before we get started, I want Eddie and Ted

36
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:37,325
to come up here and stand up on stage.

37
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:37,405
Woo!

38
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:37,505
Woo!

39
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:37,605
Woo!

40
00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:37,705
Woo!

41
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:37,785
Woo!

42
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:37,865
Woo!

43
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:37,945
Woo!

44
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:38,025
Woo!

45
00:01:41,027 --> 00:01:43,989
These two gentlemen did an amazing job

46
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,372
organizing all the speakers, getting everything ready

47
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:49,273
this year, because you were very busy.

48
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:59,895
And I also just wanted to say that the community is really in this room.

49
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:04,618
The people that love experimental games are at the forefront of pushing games to where they're going to be,

50
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:09,921
and asking the hard questions about what they should be, and dreaming the dreams of what they could be.

51
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:14,463
And it's not always easy. Sometimes you work on something for four or five years,

52
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:17,344
and it just never hangs together, and you have to set it aside.

53
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,566
Sometimes those things come back later, and they're great,

54
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:23,867
and sometimes they become a painful but valuable memory.

55
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:27,649
And this year's show is an example, like every year,

56
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,130
of how pushing through the hard stuff

57
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:32,071
is better than giving up.

58
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,053
And so I want you to give everyone in this room

59
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,793
a round of applause for sticking with it

60
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:38,174
and staying game developers.

61
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:48,929
We have a fantastic lineup.

62
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:51,718
Daniel, do you want to give a little bit of a flavor

63
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,002
of what we're going to see?

64
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:54,287
You want to say anything about the show?

65
00:02:55,143 --> 00:03:00,066
Well, we have a bunch of really good surprises this year, I think.

66
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:05,108
And also, I wanted to say that since there are so many veterans of EGW in this room,

67
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:07,609
so many people that have been coming to this session for years,

68
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:13,131
for next year, I want to start taking suggestions.

69
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:18,313
If some games are never submitted to EGW, like it happened this year,

70
00:03:18,953 --> 00:03:20,054
for example, ReCursed.

71
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:27,521
and other games just fly under a radar so if you find a game that you think is a good fit for

72
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:33,707
this session just send it to me or Robin in whatever way you find most comfortable but just

73
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:36,129
get it to us so we can go see it for next year.

74
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:45,961
Yes, we really like to expand the reach of experimental gameplay and to have lots of people from all over the world, all walks of life, all kinds of ways of being to be up here on stage.

75
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:49,602
And the easiest way for us to do that is to delegate that task to everybody else.

76
00:03:49,662 --> 00:04:00,466
And so once again, we will tell you all that it is your responsibility to let us know about the coolest shit out there, because we want those people here, want them representing and speaking and bearing witness to their true, lived, awesome selves.

77
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:13,841
All right, with that, we're going to end the welcome and we're going to bring up Bennett and AP to show us MultiBowl.

78
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:21,986
APPLAUSE

79
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:22,927
Hi, I'm Bennett Foddy.

80
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:24,448
And I'm AP Thompson.

81
00:04:24,908 --> 00:04:28,831
And we're here to show you MultiBowl, which is the world's first video game collage.

82
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:34,136
MultiBall is a mixtape of real multiplayer games from the 1980s and 90s.

83
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:39,478
There have been projects in the past, like Rom Check Fail, or the Indie Pirate Cart,

84
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:44,941
or WarioWare, that make a pastiche of multiple original games, but there's never been a collage

85
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:49,103
made up of hundreds of existing games running on multiple hardware platforms.

86
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:53,339
At its core, MultiBowl is a modified emulator.

87
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,401
MAME, or the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator,

88
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:58,482
is the biggest and one of the oldest emulators

89
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:00,423
on the planet, now 20 years old.

90
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:03,165
It now emulates practically every arcade game

91
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,666
and every console and computer platform from history.

92
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,707
And last year, it switched to a proper open source license,

93
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:10,789
so it became possible to think about projects

94
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:13,010
that don't run on one hardware platform,

95
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,071
but on all hardware platforms.

96
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:17,832
Not one game, but all games.

97
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:19,493
Here's how it works.

98
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:24,632
It loads a random exciting moment from an old two-player game and lets you compete until

99
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:28,435
someone scores a goal or kills the other player or until a timer runs out.

100
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:33,400
By watching the memory in the emulated computer, it detects when someone wins the point and

101
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,502
loads another random moment from a random game.

102
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:43,410
MultiBall now contains over 300 games across arcade platforms, consoles, and computers.

103
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:48,165
And of course, there's way more than 300 good multiplayer games out there,

104
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:53,249
but we tried to create a diverse list in terms of gameplay, art style, and country of origin.

105
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,074
Each state is designed to run for about 30 seconds before it produces a win.

106
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,537
So some games are just naturally perfect for that format.

107
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:07,562
Outlaw is symmetrical and short, so we simply monitor the score and see who gets the first point.

108
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,806
But some games need to be saved at a particular moment.

109
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:14,868
For instance, after beating the final boss in Double Dragon,

110
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,489
if both players are still alive,

111
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:17,990
they then have to fight to decide

112
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,871
who gets to rescue the red guy's girlfriend.

113
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,134
In some cases, we change the rules

114
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:25,375
to make a moment more exciting,

115
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:28,177
as in this case, where the player's guns are disabled

116
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:31,919
to turn Dodonpachi into a pure game of dodging.

117
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,243
When you start playing MultiBowl, it's a pure test of video game talent.

118
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:44,685
Who can figure out the mechanics and form strategies the fastest?

119
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:50,710
Because it has a lot of lesser-known games, nobody has played the majority of them before.

120
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:58,516
But once you've been playing for a while, it becomes more like a test of pure video

121
00:06:58,536 --> 00:06:59,156
game knowledge.

122
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:06,701
Now, not every game lends itself well to competitive play, especially in 30-second slices.

123
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:11,187
In Life Force, if you make the players compete for points, it's very hard to see whose bullets

124
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:12,028
are hitting the enemies.

125
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:14,771
And if you play to survive, it's just way too easy.

126
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:18,896
Fundamentally, the problem is that each player can't affect the other player's performance.

127
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:25,372
The solution we found to that is to have compound rules like score more points but don't die.

128
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:31,059
So here a player can decide to be more aggressive, flying closer to the enemies, but that carries

129
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,560
a risk of colliding with them.

130
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:40,700
Sometimes, the game itself has rules that can be harnessed to make an interesting 30-second challenge.

131
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:45,084
In Timber, the point for cutting down a tree goes to the person who hits it last,

132
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:46,525
kind of like in League of Legends.

133
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,906
So we picked a state with just one tree,

134
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:53,209
so there could be a standoff as players try to avoid doing the second last hit.

135
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,513
And sometimes you need to invent entirely new rules, like in Rampage,

136
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:00,895
where we challenge players to avoid touching the ground.

137
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:10,976
Of course, we can't make MultiBowl available publicly for legal ‑‑

138
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:12,237
All right. Let's do a demo now.

139
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,941
Can we get Rich and Robin up to play down in front?

140
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:29,468
Oh, my word. I'm so nervous.

141
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,030
Can we switch the video feed, please?

142
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:37,961
Game over.

143
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:46,636
Peach has a pretty sweet fireball in this.

144
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:48,398
Definitely throw a fireball.

145
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,748
Robin's player one, Rich is player two.

146
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:28,157
You

147
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:01,937
Red Warrior is now it.

148
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,068
bad luck. You're rigid. Keep going.

149
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:58,890
Don't give up, brother.

150
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:41,053
I like your outfit

151
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:41,513
you got it

152
00:14:40,424 --> 00:14:40,924
Shouldn't have helped.

153
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:09,051
Thanks for watching!

154
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:11,964
That was totally amazing, even though I lost.

155
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:15,727
It's just because I pretended I couldn't play Tetris.

156
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:17,447
under pressure.

157
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:22,551
Alright, so next up we have someone coming up to show a game,

158
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:24,813
but before we have them come up to show a game,

159
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:27,815
I would like to ask for eight volunteers

160
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:30,797
who would like to play a dance game to come up.

161
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,599
and stand where the man is waving his hands.

162
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,240
Over there.

163
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:37,402
Eight. Eight people only.

164
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:38,382
How many we got?

165
00:16:39,503 --> 00:16:42,866
One, two, three, four, five, six,

166
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:45,128
I think seven, eight.

167
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,989
I think that last person, you're done.

168
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:47,930
Alright, we're good.

169
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:48,891
Thank you.

170
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,672
Okay, so next up, we have

171
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:53,094
Ian Thompson showing us Recursed.

172
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:55,215
Hi.

173
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:56,456
Whoa.

174
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:05,311
My name is Ian Thompson, I'm an independent developer from Scotland, and this is Recursed.

175
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:10,434
Recursed is a puzzle platform game, and by puzzle I mean logic puzzle.

176
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:20,740
There's three types of items, keys that open doors, blocks you can stand on to reach high places, and treasure chests which manipulate reality.

177
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,682
Okay, I'll jump in and show some levels.

178
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,452
I'm actually looking at it down here, so excuse me if I mess this up.

179
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,234
Okay, so here's a simple level.

180
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:36,016
We need to jump up and get that crystal.

181
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:40,858
We can't jump high enough, so we need to unlock the door and get the block.

182
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:46,161
First thing we find out is that when we're holding the key or any item,

183
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:47,201
we don't jump as high.

184
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:48,402
Okay?

185
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:53,765
The second thing we find out is that you can throw items horizontally.

186
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:54,905
Like this.

187
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:58,053
which allows us to get the block and finish the level.

188
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:03,817
So there's restrictions on movement and throwing and jumping

189
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:05,458
that allow the levels to be...

190
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:06,819
There we go.

191
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,602
Sort of imbued with logic problems.

192
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:12,764
Anyway, that's all just sort of puzzle platform stuff.

193
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:14,065
I'm sure you're familiar with that.

194
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:15,386
Um...

195
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:18,128
So those treasure chests.

196
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,610
Here's a treasure chest.

197
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:24,273
If I jump into this, I go to a new room.

198
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,584
Now this room has a key and two doors.

199
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:31,925
So it seems impossible.

200
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:37,348
It's not impossible, because there's a subtlety to the chests

201
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:41,270
that I haven't mentioned, which is when you exit them,

202
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:47,414
oops, and re-enter, the room resets back to the default

203
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:50,675
state, which means the door is back and the key is back.

204
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:53,817
Okay, how does that help?

205
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:55,278
Well, we can take this key.

206
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:01,780
leave the room, re-enter the room, and it's reset.

207
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,302
So we have the key and the key from the previous instance.

208
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:07,365
And we can open two doors with one key.

209
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:11,409
So items can be duplicated.

210
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,372
And remember, rooms are items.

211
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:15,993
OK.

212
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:22,499
So it seems like a positive, but there are downsides too.

213
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:29,017
In this level we have some blocks, a whole stack of them.

214
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:31,418
And in the other chest there's a crystal.

215
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:33,000
There we go.

216
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:37,983
So if we try and do it with one block we see we can't get it, we need two blocks.

217
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:41,806
So now I can exit, go get another block and come back,

218
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:45,709
but what I find when I jump back in, my block's gone.

219
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:52,254
So I'm limited to only bringing one item into the room, but we need two blocks.

220
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:54,849
Okay, well, it is a puzzle game.

221
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,971
What one item do we bring?

222
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:01,373
Well, we bring this room.

223
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:02,734
Into here, like that.

224
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:04,696
And jump in here.

225
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:08,598
Here's our infinite stack of blocks.

226
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,802
Now this room doesn't reset because I never exited it, I just went into a room beneath it.

227
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:16,184
Okay.

228
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:18,746
There we go.

229
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:22,348
So far so simple.

230
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:27,369
Don't worry, it gets so much worse.

231
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:28,470
Right.

232
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:35,396
So that's how chests can restructure the world in a basic sense.

233
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:37,838
Let's look at this level.

234
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,541
Okay, here we have a choice of a key or a block.

235
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:42,262
We can't jump high enough to get back up.

236
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,284
Let's get the key.

237
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:47,847
We can open the door and we find out we need the block to jump up.

238
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:50,509
So let's jump in the chest and see where we end up.

239
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:53,266
Oh, it's back in the same room.

240
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:56,187
But it's a different instance of the same room.

241
00:20:56,267 --> 00:21:00,368
So if I exit, here's the instance I was in before with the unlocked door.

242
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:02,769
And this is a new instance.

243
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:05,090
But because it's the same room, it has another chest.

244
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,532
Which of course leads to another instance of the same room.

245
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:11,752
As far as you want.

246
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,493
You can recurse as much as you like.

247
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:18,535
And you can do that and you find out that that's actually not the solution.

248
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,276
So I'll leave that as an exercise.

249
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:25,918
Okay. Right.

250
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:30,060
In the next song, there's a water mechanic.

251
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:33,382
I'm not gonna show it, but when you jump into a chest

252
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:35,544
that's underwater, the rooms underneath,

253
00:21:35,804 --> 00:21:37,105
the room you enter is flooded.

254
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:39,286
So it's like stateful,

255
00:21:39,526 --> 00:21:41,727
and that makes things a bit more confusing,

256
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:44,789
but we don't want a bit more confusing.

257
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:46,110
We want a lot more confusing,

258
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:51,233
which is this mechanic that's introduced in the fourth area.

259
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,201
Is that the right level? Yes, there we go.

260
00:21:56,861 --> 00:22:00,723
In this area we have enchanted items.

261
00:22:02,643 --> 00:22:07,445
This block and this key are enchanted, as you can see from the green stuff.

262
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:09,706
I'll probably call them green items.

263
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:15,228
Enchanted items are not affected by the reset mechanic.

264
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:16,729
They are unique.

265
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:22,931
And, um, I can't jump that up there because I can't jump high enough.

266
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:28,206
So if I leave them there on the left hand side and I exit and re-enter,

267
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:30,848
they're still there.

268
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:35,511
They're not unique to the room instance, they're unique to the room type.

269
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,853
It's a subtle difference.

270
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,815
Okay, so how do we get these items up here?

271
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:43,438
Well, let's look in this chest and see what we have.

272
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:46,460
Nothing. It's an empty room.

273
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:52,365
But rooms are items, so an empty room is like an empty backpack.

274
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:54,505
So let's...

275
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:55,826
Whoops!

276
00:22:55,846 --> 00:23:00,268
There we go, let's dump this in here, and let's dump the key in there.

277
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:04,230
Okie dokie!

278
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,113
So now we have our enchanted items stored in this chest, but I still can't jump high

279
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:11,093
enough with the chest.

280
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:18,137
That chest, however, is not enchanted, it's just a regular recurse item, so if I exit

281
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,859
and re-enter, it's up there now because it's been reset.

282
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:27,696
Yes, and I can get the key and...

283
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:28,736
Uh, yeah.

284
00:23:30,057 --> 00:23:30,978
That is the answer to that one.

285
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:32,419
Okay.

286
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:35,522
Uh...

287
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:36,643
Right.

288
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:39,645
So, keys and blocks are simple

289
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,507
even when they're enchanted, they're not too bad.

290
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:44,029
Chests are also items

291
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,130
which can be enchanted

292
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,791
which makes them unique.

293
00:23:48,632 --> 00:23:49,693
So on this level we have

294
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:50,854
an enchanted chest.

295
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:52,816
And if I jump into this chest

296
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:54,998
it's also recursive.

297
00:23:56,067 --> 00:24:00,990
So now I'm inside the chest, in the room in the chest, which is also the room the chest is in.

298
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,490
No bother.

299
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:09,395
If I move it over here, and then exit the chest, because that chest is unique to that room, that's where it is.

300
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:10,515
Right?

301
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:11,456
Yeah?

302
00:24:12,677 --> 00:24:13,617
No, maybe not. Okay.

303
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:16,499
Let's jump in it a few times.

304
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:19,240
Uh, one, two, three, yeah, that's probably enough.

305
00:24:20,441 --> 00:24:22,362
Now, I can throw this chest up here.

306
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:26,065
And that's somewhere I can't jump to, that's too high for me to jump.

307
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:31,648
And because I'm inside that chest I can then jump out of it and now I'm up there.

308
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,709
But I'm still inside the chest.

309
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,570
So I can pick it up again and throw it.

310
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,292
And now I can leave the chest and get the crystal, right?

311
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,173
I just... yeah.

312
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,875
So that's a small taster.

313
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:55,297
With the enchanted chest, the problem space kind of explodes.

314
00:24:56,077 --> 00:25:01,139
You can get an enchanted chest that's inside itself,

315
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:02,439
but exists nowhere else.

316
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,401
You can create recursion with them wherever you find them.

317
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:10,542
You can use them to, uh.

318
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:15,689
move through solid walls using the flooding mechanic,

319
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,412
and probably worst of all,

320
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:21,594
you can enter an enchanted chest,

321
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,956
then remove it from the room it's in,

322
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,718
and then try and exit it.

323
00:25:26,078 --> 00:25:27,999
So you're exiting into a room

324
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,461
and jumping out of a chest that's no longer there,

325
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:32,203
which is a paradox.

326
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:35,506
And that's when it gets really weird.

327
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:36,547
So.

328
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,410
I'll leave that as an exercise for you guys.

329
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:42,573
It's out now on Steam, PC, Windows, Mac, Linux.

330
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:44,374
Yeah, that's Recursed.

331
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:45,195
Hope you check it out.

332
00:25:45,215 --> 00:25:50,379
Thank you very much.

333
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:51,299
Yeah.

334
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:57,784
So, I probably shouldn't tell you all this, but his daughter sent him a picture before

335
00:25:57,824 --> 00:26:00,567
the session saying, good luck and I hope you win.

336
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:04,309
So congratulations for winning Experimental Gameplay Workshop 2017.

337
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:15,007
So funny. It was adorable. It had like tons of hearts on it and stuff. It was so cute.

338
00:26:15,147 --> 00:26:22,729
Okay, so next up we have Dance Together with Tobiah Zarlez. Are you ready to dance?

339
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:29,911
All right, dancers, come on up. All right, this is Dance Together from very simple rules. Everyone

340
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:35,373
gets a device and headphones. First off, no talking, no hand gestures. Players are only

341
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:38,314
allowed to communicate with each other through dance.

342
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,173
them and one other player are gonna listen to the same song.

343
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,255
They don't know what it's gonna be.

344
00:26:44,275 --> 00:26:46,037
Could be techno, could be Russian folk,

345
00:26:46,117 --> 00:26:47,799
could be mariachi, could be tango.

346
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,921
They don't know until they have to start dancing.

347
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:50,722
Their goal.

348
00:26:51,813 --> 00:26:54,976
find their dance partner through dance alone.

349
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,599
When you're ready, press the green button

350
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,020
and your game should start

351
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,781
and they'll start dancing in a moment.

352
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:03,043
Big shout out to Brody and Aaron

353
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,905
for helping me demonstrate over there.

354
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:06,827
While they're playing, I'll talk to you,

355
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:09,289
the larger crowd, about the game, what's going on.

356
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:11,271
I made this game because I hate dancing.

357
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:14,562
Seriously, I just don't know what to do.

358
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:15,562
I don't know how to move my body.

359
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:17,023
So I'm like, you know what, I'll make this game.

360
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:19,764
It will encourage me to go out on the dance floor

361
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,425
and actually have some fun,

362
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:24,087
but also to take the person who loves dancing

363
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,368
and give them that same moment of terror

364
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:27,568
when they go on the dance floor

365
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:29,649
and there's an Irish jig going on

366
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,451
and they have no idea what they should be doing.

367
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:35,434
I've played this game with adults, with children,

368
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,234
with people of all ages.

369
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:38,557
I've had some players come up and first they just start

370
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:40,098
moving their shoulders a little bit.

371
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:41,760
And then after a couple of play sessions,

372
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,281
they're just throwing their body into it

373
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:43,962
and they're having fun.

374
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:46,184
They realize that you too can just go out

375
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,186
and start dancing together.

376
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:54,008
I was inspired by this, of course, Silent Discos, and also Johann Sebastian Jaus.

377
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:55,669
So they played a game, I thought, that changed my life.

378
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:57,750
I want to make a game like that.

379
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,752
I'm not saying this is as good as that, but I love physical play games.

380
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:03,814
I love games where you can just take your phone, have a bunch of people get together,

381
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:07,637
and do something with their physical bodies in a room that, you know, is not typically

382
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:09,438
done in most digital games.

383
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:11,259
I actually had this idea, like...

384
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,906
Years ago, I think like three years ago at this point, but I never bothered making I told people about it

385
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:19,289
I finally just sat down and prototyped it

386
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:25,798
And I just hacked together this really really simple broken version. Here's my first early screenshots

387
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:28,862
The UI is better than this right now, though not much better

388
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:34,852
I tried using standard music at first but I realized I needed custom music to really

389
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:38,556
make this work well so I commissioned a bunch of pieces because it needs to be genre typical

390
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:41,138
in the first 15 seconds.

391
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:45,142
Most songs, you don't really think about this when you listen to it, they have a 30 second

392
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,485
to a minute attack before they really get into it.

393
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:54,232
and I really need a song to know that if it's trance versus dubstep versus mariachi, you

394
00:28:54,252 --> 00:28:55,514
know, that first few seconds.

395
00:28:55,834 --> 00:29:00,379
So I got 60 second loops that they play through that are genre typical right away.

396
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,304
Right now this is only one game mode which is what I described where there's one other

397
00:29:04,324 --> 00:29:06,466
player listening to the same song they have to find that person.

398
00:29:07,187 --> 00:29:10,890
tons of ideas for this game on ways to do different game modes.

399
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,793
Of course, teams would be cool, where maybe in an eight-player game, there's four versus

400
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:15,053
four.

401
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:20,157
I've play-tested this up to 16, but I'm really curious what the upper limit might be.

402
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:24,461
You know, there's only so many songs I can include with this before songs just kept getting

403
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:27,063
too similar to each other to be able to identify it.

404
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:30,506
So I'm thinking about making kind of a music category system, like there might be a...

405
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:36,470
techno song and folk song and an old dance song or something like that and do some kind

406
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,832
of programmatic way to make sure the songs are unique enough for each other as I add

407
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:41,133
more and more over time.

408
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,996
What I'm most excited for is a spy mode.

409
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:44,456
It might be cool.

410
00:29:44,476 --> 00:29:45,737
So imagine an eight-player game.

411
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:47,598
There's eight people dancing.

412
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:50,520
Only one person doesn't have the right song.

413
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:52,662
And the goal is to not be noticed.

414
00:29:53,743 --> 00:29:54,303
The trick...

415
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,924
They don't know they're the spy when the game starts.

416
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,986
You just get music and you don't know what to do.

417
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,268
I also think this game could scale up really well,

418
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:05,090
not just with more players, but maybe audience participation.

419
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,013
Maybe you as an audience could be judging these people

420
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:09,954
and trying to figure out which player was dancing

421
00:30:09,994 --> 00:30:11,836
to which music and make this kind of a massive

422
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,998
multiplayer game played at conventions.

423
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:16,240
And lastly, I really, the fear to future of the game,

424
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,622
I really need to work out the UI, UX to figure out

425
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,243
how you actually choose the other player.

426
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:23,206
I have all sorts of ideas on how to figure out that.

427
00:30:23,506 --> 00:30:24,886
Which kind of leads me to my next point.

428
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:27,107
I need help finishing this game.

429
00:30:27,207 --> 00:30:30,408
I made this simple prototype and I submitted to Indiecade.

430
00:30:30,448 --> 00:30:31,409
I got selected to Indicate.

431
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:32,909
Submitted to EGW, I got selected to EGW.

432
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:36,110
So there's something interesting here, but I need help finishing it.

433
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,092
So if you're a UI UX person, you want to come help me out, please contact me.

434
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:42,333
If you're a musician, audio engineer, contact me.

435
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:46,874
I, instead of trying to sell this game, there's a couple different ways I can make money with it,

436
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:51,595
but I decided it'd be cooler to make this open and I want to see this at all sorts of different

437
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:55,937
conventions, I want to see it played in the halls of GDC next year. So it's open source,

438
00:30:55,997 --> 00:31:00,738
it's available on my GitHub right now, and I just want people to contribute to it and help me make

439
00:31:00,778 --> 00:31:04,760
it. But I also don't believe people should work for free, as a general statement.

440
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,581
So if you don't want to help me for free, which you probably shouldn't, you could also throw money my way.

441
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:15,582
I just set up a Patreon, patreon.com slash Tobiah, where you can throw some money per update.

442
00:31:15,642 --> 00:31:19,743
I promise not to be updating too often because I do have a full-time job.

443
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:26,825
But if you do that, a hundred percent of the money will go towards paying other people to get those assets, polish this, and

444
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:29,805
hopefully you'll see a much better version at GDC 2018.

445
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:34,787
All right, that's Dance Together. You can find more Dance Together today.

446
00:31:38,048 --> 00:31:40,108
And I'll be around after, we can play in the hallways.

447
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,510
Thank you dancers.

448
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,290
Thank you very much.

449
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:47,251
Okay.

450
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:50,232
So, that's a really awesome thing, right?

451
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:54,553
I mean, it's kind of experimenting with the idea that games need to make money, which

452
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,734
is, I think there's a word for that, it's called art.

453
00:31:59,155 --> 00:31:59,855
Like doing art.

454
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:02,836
Like you make it and then you just give it to people because it's cool.

455
00:32:04,343 --> 00:32:09,285
So we got a lot of submissions this year for VR stuff.

456
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:15,606
And we weren't really sure how to do the sort of VR scene

457
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:17,846
justice, because a lot of stuff is still pretty new.

458
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:22,047
And Isaac here has agreed to give us

459
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:24,148
a little showcase of some of the things that

460
00:32:24,988 --> 00:32:27,188
are new and weird and experimental in VR.

461
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:29,589
That means not necessarily just.

462
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,992
a game form that we already know being translated into VR, which is the most common submission

463
00:32:35,513 --> 00:32:39,595
that we get, is a submission that's something like, we kind of already know it, but then

464
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:42,757
they put it in a new context, like, you know, it's a racing game, but you're bananas, you

465
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:42,917
know?

466
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:43,258
No.

467
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:46,100
So, without further ado, here's Isaac to give us a VR overview from 2017.

468
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,220
Cool.

469
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,280
Hi.

470
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,480
I'm Isaac.

471
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm the CEO of the company.

472
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,781
I'm the CEO of the company.

473
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:48,461
I'm the CEO of the company.

474
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:49,342
I'm the CEO of the company.

475
00:32:49,362 --> 00:32:50,382
I'm the CEO of the company.

476
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,184
I'm the CEO of the company.

477
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:54,705
I'm the CEO of the company.

478
00:32:55,817 --> 00:33:01,581
I'm Isaac, I go by Khabib on the Internet, and this is a talk called Previously Considered

479
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:02,362
Experimental.

480
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:09,807
So, I've been making experimental WebGL experiences, like Universe of Sound and Enough for quite

481
00:33:09,827 --> 00:33:15,271
some time, and I still do a lot of web work, but like many of you, I heard that Pied Pipe

482
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:17,853
and Hype Train of VR, and I hopped on board.

483
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:22,815
I've been doing that for about two years now and I wanted to tell you a bit about what

484
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:27,317
I've learned about experimental VR games and the way that VR has actually influenced my

485
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:30,539
views on experimentality in general.

486
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:35,081
It's definitely going to be a lot of stuff for ten minutes, but we're going to try to

487
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:37,982
show some of the games over there afterwards.

488
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:43,144
Obviously, there's a lot of people here, but we'll also have fun conversations and stickers,

489
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:45,225
so come through and say hi.

490
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:51,133
Last thing I want to say before we really get into it is that these games in no way

491
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:59,206
obviously represent the totality of experimental gameplay in VR because all of VR is experimental.

492
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:06,877
And I know that sounds like the ultimate soundbite from that hype train, and rest assured, it is.

493
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:09,560
But I also think that there's some truth to it.

494
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,225
Games have had so long to develop, to build this universal vocabulary,

495
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:18,029
that with our shared vernacular, we can describe these massive undertakings,

496
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:21,152
these entire universes, with just three letters.

497
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:28,810
Using terms like FPS, RPG, RTS, MMO, we have the ability to communicate so efficiently,

498
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:34,092
so clearly, but these crystallized explanations leave little room for flexibility.

499
00:34:34,612 --> 00:34:37,013
They can be brittle, almost stifling.

500
00:34:37,954 --> 00:34:42,578
VR, obviously, on the other hand, doesn't have that much of a shared vocabulary yet.

501
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,404
This means that it's tougher to describe a lot of the work, but with that ambiguity comes

502
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,746
room to experiment.

503
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:54,531
In a medium that doesn't even have a cohesive vision on what it means to move,

504
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:58,294
Experimentation isn't just desirable, it is vital.

505
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:03,219
It's a bit sad to see that already in this medium, which is so new,

506
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,561
we see this tendency towards crystallization,

507
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:08,484
the desire to use what has already been created

508
00:35:08,904 --> 00:35:12,107
instead of exploring and discovering what has never been,

509
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:16,051
to manifest mechanics out of the ether.

510
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:22,196
But even for games that tend towards the monolithic vocabulary, we see experimentation thrive.

511
00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:27,998
Take Cosmic Trip, which is made by a studio called Funktronic Labs, for example.

512
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:35,521
This is a FPRTS, a first-person real-time strategy, which has a core loop that's extremely

513
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:42,643
similar to a plethora of previous easily-definable experiences, Starcraft, Red Alert, etc.

514
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,684
But it literally changes your perspective on RTSs.

515
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:48,266
Take their menu system for example.

516
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:52,790
UIs and menus in their current form are these displaced objects which are not part of the

517
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,632
same universe as the rest of the game.

518
00:35:55,193 --> 00:35:59,657
But in Cosmic Trip, the menu has physicality, legitimate weight.

519
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:05,522
Instead of falling into the rut of developmental efficiency, using the already normalized point

520
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:10,788
and click of a brutally defined UI vocabulary, Funktronic took the time to explore.

521
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:16,346
It's the same thing with their teleportation system, and movement is something that VR

522
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:17,766
has been struggling with for a while.

523
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:22,727
Rather than the typical ballistics which so many games now unceremoniously implement,

524
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:25,488
they built this unique system that would fit their game.

525
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:30,710
By pulling up the columns and stepping through them, they created a cohesive world that was

526
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,311
so different from any before it, it became hard to describe using the current vocabulary.

527
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:42,097
It may be that in the distant future, this weighty user interface, or possibly the column

528
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:47,842
transportation system, might become one of the TLAs, three-letter acronyms, that we will

529
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:52,685
all know and love, but it will be because of those brave possibility space explorers

530
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:58,850
over at Funktronic Labs, and many other studios went out and tried word after word after word

531
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,973
until a few finally made sense, and they could let us experience the thrill of

532
00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:06,316
of understanding something for the first time.

533
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:09,518
And I think that's why a lot of us are here.

534
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:15,403
That moment where we get to grok one of those untranslatable words, and it becomes part

535
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:17,806
of our vocabulary, part of our reality.

536
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:22,930
Games have an inherent ability to do this, to take the unfamiliar and make it familiar,

537
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,974
to take the unknown and make it known, and has been doing so since its beginning.

538
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:35,082
Tetris, Pong, Breakout were all once unfamiliar, but once played and understood, they become

539
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:39,407
part of the vocabulary, transitioned from experimental to canonical.

540
00:37:40,048 --> 00:37:42,030
They created a word.

541
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,034
And this wordsmithing is everywhere in VR.

542
00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:47,597
Even I tried to do it myself and also came up with a word.

543
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:48,658
Blarp.

544
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:55,815
Now, its gameplay is only as deep as its name and its artistic polish is, you know, equally

545
00:37:55,875 --> 00:38:00,520
amateur, but I can safely say that there are no TLAs that describe its mechanics.

546
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:05,767
I've tried describing how it works and I actually fail quite often, so I wanted to let some

547
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:08,010
of the reviews from Steam try to do the same.

548
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:14,308
As Person Guy says, you spin these things above your head like a stretchy lasso and

549
00:38:14,328 --> 00:38:16,069
try to toss them at a randomized target.

550
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:22,331
Bassem, on the other hand, argues, you corral an ever-growing number of floating eyeballs

551
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:26,653
in an ever-growing room, twirling them around like bolas or a bunch of yo-yos.

552
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:30,654
Perhaps the most articulate is Seibert, who claims,

553
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:34,896
Blarp, blarp, blarp, blarp, blarp, blarp, blarp, blarp, blarp, blarp, blarp, blarp,

554
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:35,876
blarp, blarp.

555
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,137
Couldn't have said it better myself.

556
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:44,452
But blarp is confusing to describe because it wasn't a word that could exist before VR.

557
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:48,833
It requires a room-scale HMD to be able to quickly spin and dodge.

558
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:54,695
It would be impossible without hand controllers to pull the floating eyeballs on that stretchy lasso.

559
00:38:55,375 --> 00:39:03,057
And without the floating point trigger, you couldn't be so delicate, twirling and spinning in some ritualistic dance of cord-tangling delight.

560
00:39:04,698 --> 00:39:08,562
This is not, of course, to say that Blarp will become a classic like Tetris or Pong.

561
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:15,469
On the contrary, it is the unfortunate fact that many experimental games never become

562
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:20,315
part of the vocabulary because they are ignored, or even worse, because they might get attention

563
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:23,618
but are considered too far out for popular consumption.

564
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,966
Besides, blarp isn't a very good word.

565
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:32,570
It might be fun to say, goofy and non-assuming.

566
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,753
But in the end, the thing that it is pulling from the ether,

567
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:38,256
though a novel mechanic, doesn't really

568
00:39:38,396 --> 00:39:40,278
say anything that could not be said before.

569
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:43,161
It's just creating a new mode of entertainment.

570
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:48,466
It's just making another feedback loop that scratches that itch of scoring a point, scoring

571
00:39:48,506 --> 00:39:52,990
another point, losing and starting over again, knowing that this time, this time will be

572
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,153
the time that I win and prove my worth with quantified score.

573
00:39:58,276 --> 00:40:00,777
But there are other words out there, difficult words,

574
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:02,939
that try and say delicate things,

575
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:04,800
that try to describe emotions

576
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,221
that might have been impossible to describe before.

577
00:40:08,301 --> 00:40:10,823
Take Nebula Hands, which is a prototype

578
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:12,364
that Mike Tucker has been working on.

579
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:14,805
It lets you be alone in the darkness,

580
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,607
exploring the physics of these tiny particles,

581
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:20,108
letting you feel like a solitary god

582
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:23,110
witnessing the sparkling, iridescent light in the abyss.

583
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,311
Or Cave Carver by Fernando Romero.

584
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:31,193
where you slowly sculpt away layers of your cocoon

585
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,994
until you discover the infinity in which you reside.

586
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:37,536
Or Irrational Exuberance, the first VR piece

587
00:40:37,616 --> 00:40:38,396
that made me cry.

588
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,538
In it, you travel through this universe,

589
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:43,859
gently tapping rocks to reveal secrets,

590
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,040
and as they crumble on your hands,

591
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,201
you sense this feeling of time passing,

592
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:50,482
a sunset that must dissipate.

593
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:54,117
You grow crystals, the sounds tickling your ears,

594
00:40:54,197 --> 00:40:57,859
as you marvel at your ability to create and to wreck conversation

595
00:40:57,899 --> 00:41:00,680
with your entropy-based destruction of the level before.

596
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:07,224
It's mysterious, ambiguous, paradoxical, and also delightful.

597
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:11,146
As usual, the Steam reviews show it.

598
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:18,310
MetaVisual says, this is, there aren't really words.

599
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,531
It's beautiful, existential.

600
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:25,981
And I know that Steam reviews are a bit of a silly way to prove a point, because some

601
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:32,091
of them are equally as banal as the above was poetic, such as this one, which I got

602
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:32,652
for Loon.

603
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:35,716
Amusing and neat for about 10 minutes.

604
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:37,319
Not recommended.

605
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:44,386
Loon, a accidental creation that came from trying to implement a GPU-based cloth sim,

606
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:49,469
is an architectural haiku whose thesis is very difficult for me to describe.

607
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:55,272
It's the only thing in VR which I have made which I know says a word that matters.

608
00:41:56,823 --> 00:42:00,125
But it is a word that requires somebody quietly and calmly

609
00:42:00,205 --> 00:42:01,465
going through the experience.

610
00:42:02,046 --> 00:42:04,107
I tried it myself and felt that emotion,

611
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:06,028
but didn't know how to communicate it

612
00:42:06,368 --> 00:42:10,130
and what it even meant until I read this review by 60FPS.

613
00:42:11,971 --> 00:42:14,433
I was a sobbing mess, muttering to myself alone

614
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:16,034
in the bathroom mirror in disbelief

615
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:19,116
at how squarely this dev had hit a certain emotional nail

616
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:22,758
on the head, the tritone nail of beauty, awe,

617
00:42:23,158 --> 00:42:24,018
and boundless love.

618
00:42:25,662 --> 00:42:28,163
And I say this not just to flaunt my own ego,

619
00:42:28,523 --> 00:42:30,064
even though it is the best compliment

620
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:32,264
that I will probably ever receive,

621
00:42:32,744 --> 00:42:36,065
but more to say that it is okay to try and say these words,

622
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:39,226
even if we fail at saying them in the process.

623
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:41,407
The attempt to say a new word

624
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:43,728
will many times result in gibberish,

625
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:47,029
like blarp or warka-flarka-flim-flam.

626
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:51,010
But when we find something that can say something more,

627
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,370
we must try to say it.

628
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:58,347
I believe that people are hungry, not just for novel mechanics, but for those novel mechanics

629
00:42:58,407 --> 00:42:59,707
to say something else.

630
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:05,310
To make us remember that our reality is so much more than we thought was possible before.

631
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:10,168
that in a place where no word has ever touched,

632
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:11,370
there lies meaning.

633
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,093
And I want to very, very, very adamantly add

634
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:17,055
that this is not unique to VR,

635
00:43:17,536 --> 00:43:20,158
but I can already see the same pattern emerging

636
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:24,102
where so many tender and nuanced emotions are explored,

637
00:43:24,503 --> 00:43:26,325
but only the ones that are catchy

638
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:28,206
or palpable enough rise to the top.

639
00:43:29,855 --> 00:43:33,977
This is not to say that those games have, those catchy games have any less importance.

640
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:38,700
I really, really, really do love Blarp and I really, really do love catchy games.

641
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,903
But rather that exploration must be valued at its core.

642
00:43:44,603 --> 00:43:45,964
I don't know exactly what...

643
00:43:46,664 --> 00:43:49,345
attaining this value looks like. It could be something like

644
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:55,548
the stuff that David Kanaga has been talking about with the GPU. It could be something else totally different.

645
00:43:56,008 --> 00:44:01,951
But the point is not just to be trying to find these new places, these new places,

646
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:09,935
these new games, these new planets that have unobtainium or platinum ore, but to explore because that curiosity,

647
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:14,096
that desire to expand the understanding of the worlds we live in,

648
00:44:14,877 --> 00:44:17,257
is a big part of what makes us human.

649
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:22,819
Because in the end, I hope that we are not exploring

650
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,559
just to find the palpable words

651
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:26,280
that can be financially successful,

652
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,121
to make games that will be considered PCE,

653
00:44:31,581 --> 00:44:35,242
but rather to acknowledge that we, as creators,

654
00:44:35,662 --> 00:44:38,543
have the ability to find new words

655
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:42,084
that shape the very language we use to describe our reality.

656
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:46,465
And with that description, we define that reality.

657
00:44:47,147 --> 00:44:47,527
Thank you.

658
00:44:52,697 --> 00:44:53,158
Awesome.

659
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,461
Woo!

660
00:44:54,641 --> 00:44:54,962
All right.

661
00:44:57,212 --> 00:45:02,154
So as he mentioned, there will be games up here at the front of the session when the session is over.

662
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:06,616
And there will be games that you can play physically with your body,

663
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:13,059
which is hopefully not in as rough shape as mine is after four nights of three hours of sleep.

664
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:22,143
And so next up, we actually have Bastien Gorisson and Pauline Morillet to talk about

665
00:45:22,163 --> 00:45:24,484
Panoptic.

666
00:45:33,743 --> 00:45:37,484
Hi everyone, we are part of Team Panoptes and we are making Panoptique.

667
00:45:38,185 --> 00:45:41,106
My name is Pauline Marrière and I am the Art Director of the game.

668
00:45:41,566 --> 00:45:44,688
For the purpose of the presentation, I'll be inside the VR headset.

669
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:49,905
Hi, I'm Bastien, I'm one of the designer, developers and I'm the composer for the game.

670
00:45:50,326 --> 00:45:51,947
And so, what is Panoptic?

671
00:45:52,688 --> 00:45:58,234
Well, it's an asymmetrical VR game in which a small character, played by me here on this laptop,

672
00:45:58,514 --> 00:46:02,078
has to avoid detection by the huge mask that you see in the sky,

673
00:46:02,198 --> 00:46:04,881
and that's played by Pauline using the VR headset.

674
00:46:06,393 --> 00:46:12,757
So my goal is to reach the end of the level without getting shot by the Overseer, while

675
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:18,301
of course her goal will be to find where I am in the level and just shoot me down before

676
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:19,101
I reach that goal.

677
00:46:19,642 --> 00:46:22,944
So it's really some kind of hide and seek game.

678
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:30,272
in which I have several options. I can take it very careful and slow and be methodical and try to blend in with

679
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:38,262
all these little guys that look exactly like me or I can just break into a run and try to use like jumping and

680
00:46:38,823 --> 00:46:40,084
sprinting to avoid

681
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:42,648
the shots from the overseer.

682
00:46:43,853 --> 00:46:50,678
So, as you see, the core gameplay is very simple, but we did have to iterate quite a bit to get to where we are now.

683
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:56,163
And we are actually still finding out some of the things that make the game design click.

684
00:46:56,723 --> 00:47:02,528
One thing that's fairly evident, and that was fairly obvious from a while ago,

685
00:47:02,848 --> 00:47:06,551
was that the game is at its most fun when the two players are interacting.

686
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:11,775
When the VR player is really hot on the heels of the PC player and...

687
00:47:12,636 --> 00:47:17,183
where there's real tension in all the moves you do as the PC player.

688
00:47:17,624 --> 00:47:21,370
So that's really one of our main goals in the game,

689
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:26,658
is to provide those kind of situations and improve the time both players spend.

690
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:29,802
on each other's heels.

691
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:34,027
But to show you how we arrived at that point,

692
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:36,109
let me take you back to the very beginning.

693
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,274
So we started by testing out the basic concept of the game.

694
00:47:41,034 --> 00:47:43,557
So basically, we had a regular-sized player,

695
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:47,702
and we just scaled up the VR person like 30 times.

696
00:47:49,624 --> 00:47:58,990
We spent way too much time doing just that, like picking up the player and trying to get him to stay on the controllers and preventing him to fall.

697
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,233
You're not getting away, you know.

698
00:48:03,893 --> 00:48:10,237
Obviously not, because when you're so big in VR, your hands move way too quickly for the PC player to ever compete.

699
00:48:10,758 --> 00:48:18,303
So basically we decided that that was maybe a bit too overpowered and that was probably out as a way of interacting between the players.

700
00:48:19,804 --> 00:48:22,906
But of course, you still needed a way to stop the challenger

701
00:48:23,006 --> 00:48:24,347
from reaching his goal.

702
00:48:24,688 --> 00:48:28,490
So we were thinking about what's really fun about the game.

703
00:48:28,891 --> 00:48:31,773
And we found out that actually just looking around

704
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:33,554
was a lot of fun.

705
00:48:33,574 --> 00:48:35,556
You have all these small structures,

706
00:48:35,616 --> 00:48:37,697
and you see the little character and all that.

707
00:48:37,737 --> 00:48:40,399
And it's a bit like when you look at a model train or Legos

708
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:41,680
or dollhouses.

709
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:45,445
stuff that people like to examine. So we said, okay, we might like

710
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:47,929
find something to work with in that.

711
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:53,017
And we said, okay, what if you could shoot a laser from where you are looking at?

712
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:55,977
fell straight forward, and so we went with that.

713
00:48:56,518 --> 00:49:00,560
And almost immediately, we knew that there was no avoiding

714
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,401
a comparison to like Lord of the Rings

715
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,163
and the Eye of Sauron kind of deal.

716
00:49:04,523 --> 00:49:06,204
So instead of trying to dodge that

717
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:08,906
and be like all artsy about it, we just owned it.

718
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:13,409
And we put as a visual feedback for the overseer,

719
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:17,511
we just put a big spotlight in front of its face,

720
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:18,472
as you've seen before,

721
00:49:19,613 --> 00:49:22,875
and we upped the contrast between the level and the...

722
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:29,380
and the light just to have like a real like big big effect visual effect and

723
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,743
yeah it basically clicked. Hey for the now give me my ring please

724
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,041
Anyway, back to the game itself.

725
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:44,684
What we found out was good about this light mechanic

726
00:49:44,704 --> 00:49:46,666
is that it served a couple purpose.

727
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:50,588
So not only was it a good way for the VR player to aim

728
00:49:50,948 --> 00:49:53,129
and to know what it was going to shoot at,

729
00:49:53,169 --> 00:49:54,910
which is the functional part,

730
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:58,852
it was also a good way to communicate to the PC player

731
00:49:58,932 --> 00:49:59,933
what was going on without...

732
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:07,875
For example, right now I'm looking at the overseer, but if I'm walking and trying to be sneaky like and don't get noticed,

733
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:21,818
then I still see if the overseer is watching me and I can make informed decisions as to whether I need to stay in formation or just break into a run and try to avoid the gaze of the overseer.

734
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:27,059
So that was a nice find we made about that mechanic.

735
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:34,286
Then, if you have that light as a way to aim and as an interesting effect, we had to design

736
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:37,609
the levels to make use of that as much as we could.

737
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:44,816
One of the first things we decided is to actually place the level on the outside of the room

738
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:45,617
scale play area.

739
00:50:45,677 --> 00:50:51,723
So it's basically a 360 degree level all around, so that means that the overseer has to...

740
00:50:52,404 --> 00:51:00,290
turn his head just to find the PC player and it makes for like a good searchlight effect.

741
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:05,335
Right, but also the fact that the level is outside of the playfield means that it acts as its own

742
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:11,400
very very own chaperone system which also eliminates the need for any locomotion system so.

743
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:15,978
Normally, nobody should get sick from Panoptic, is what we hope.

744
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:23,624
And since we had all that surface to play with, with all the walls and stuff, it made

745
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:25,626
us do some fun things with heights.

746
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,189
So there's like a part of the level at the beginning that's very close to the ground.

747
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:33,213
That ended up making for a fun photo opportunity.

748
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:36,777
If you see somebody who's lying on the floor,

749
00:51:37,298 --> 00:51:39,681
crannying his neck in a weird way

750
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,244
to try to see into a building with a VR headset on,

751
00:51:42,645 --> 00:51:44,307
you probably know they're playing Panoptic.

752
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:46,229
And since they don't know, you can just snap pictures

753
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,811
and that's a fun thing to do.

754
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:56,798
But it was also a challenge because as I said before, we want to keep the player close together

755
00:51:57,218 --> 00:51:58,019
as much as possible.

756
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:05,183
But if that works with a linear level, we also wanted to try some more open levels.

757
00:52:05,203 --> 00:52:11,046
So here you see we just have four spheres and there's a lot of open spaces and I could

758
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:15,709
go as a PC player in any direction and the overseers don't really know where I'm going.

759
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:17,049
So we decided that...

760
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:21,622
we could, if you wanted to make more varied levels,

761
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,723
we probably needed to bring some tools for the overseer

762
00:52:24,763 --> 00:52:27,064
to locate the PC player.

763
00:52:27,384 --> 00:52:29,765
And so one of the things we've been experimenting with

764
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:32,286
is giving back some hands to the VR player,

765
00:52:32,306 --> 00:52:34,487
because let's face it, it's still fun to have something

766
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,788
to do with your hands when you are in VR.

767
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:38,628
And we made those kind of lenses

768
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:43,490
that Pauline Noah has on her controllers,

769
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:47,331
and that she can use to basically see roughly where I went.

770
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,380
Come here, come here, little one.

771
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,882
I will find you, you know.

772
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,045
Will you now?

773
00:52:54,726 --> 00:52:55,167
Where are you?

774
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:58,411
And so as you see, the trail of particles

775
00:52:58,591 --> 00:52:59,672
takes a while to appear.

776
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:03,137
And that means I cannot stay really stationary.

777
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:04,799
I have to continue moving.

778
00:53:06,493 --> 00:53:11,875
So that's only one of the approaches, of course,

779
00:53:11,915 --> 00:53:13,356
to try and solve this balance issue.

780
00:53:13,396 --> 00:53:17,797
But yeah, we really think there's some good ideas that

781
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:20,958
can come from just having the very different scales

782
00:53:21,078 --> 00:53:22,039
for the two players.

783
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:26,040
But anyway, I think that was Panoptic in a nutshell.

784
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,461
We obviously really like talking about the game.

785
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:31,142
So if you're interested, just come find us after.

786
00:53:31,402 --> 00:53:32,062
And yeah.

787
00:53:32,882 --> 00:53:34,183
Yeah, thank you for your attention.

788
00:53:39,113 --> 00:53:39,993
It's so cute.

789
00:53:41,193 --> 00:53:42,734
So devilishly cute.

790
00:53:42,874 --> 00:53:43,914
I will catch you.

791
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:45,255
I will pick you up.

792
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:51,857
OK, so the next speaker is Tim Garbus.

793
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:56,138
And he is going to talk to us about keyboard sports.

794
00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:59,699
He also has the rainbow keyboard, which is so cool.

795
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:01,419
My favorite thing.

796
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:01,479
OK.

797
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,100
Ready to go.

798
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,180
Hi.

799
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:06,781
Just going to check the audio.

800
00:54:19,596 --> 00:54:24,638
Yeah, hi, I'm Tim Garbus and I'm going to be talking about Keyboard Sports, a game that

801
00:54:24,738 --> 00:54:26,718
uses every single key on the keyboard.

802
00:54:27,479 --> 00:54:31,700
And I didn't make this alone, so some of the other people are down there, but I'm just

803
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,380
going to start playing.

804
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,982
So first a little bit about alternative controllers,

805
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:44,944
because I'm really, really excited

806
00:54:44,985 --> 00:54:46,106
about alternative controllers.

807
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:49,249
And every time I come to GDC, it's the big thing.

808
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:50,110
And I love them.

809
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:53,113
But when I get home, I only have my laptop.

810
00:54:54,154 --> 00:54:57,357
So this is a project to set up to see what we can do

811
00:54:57,397 --> 00:54:58,699
with just ordinary controllers.

812
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,141
Yeah, this is Master Qwerty and you're the young apprentice.

813
00:55:17,402 --> 00:55:19,683
And he's gonna do some nice key puns here.

814
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:21,664
So you can enter my house.

815
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:23,446
And here comes the trick.

816
00:55:23,566 --> 00:55:25,127
I'm gonna press enter.

817
00:55:27,688 --> 00:55:31,931
Please sit down in the cozy space.

818
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:33,472
Pressing space.

819
00:55:39,176 --> 00:55:40,637
Would you mind getting tea for me?

820
00:55:41,217 --> 00:55:41,798
Pressing tea.

821
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:47,976
And then you sort of see that you can walk around on the keyboard like this.

822
00:55:48,016 --> 00:55:56,098
So we're gonna give him his tea.

823
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:02,540
And when you live on a tiny keyboard, you can shift between rooms.

824
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,240
So I press the left shift, shift over here.

825
00:56:11,097 --> 00:56:15,521
And here comes the first challenge, because now you need to use the number row up here.

826
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:19,264
That you usually don't use that much in games.

827
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:21,445
You also get to use your Windows key.

828
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:23,907
Feels really weird.

829
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:30,413
We're gonna shift back here.

830
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:35,176
So, let's say I wanted to exit his house.

831
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:37,258
I'm gonna try escape here.

832
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:42,029
You can't enter my house again. Again, use escape to get outside.

833
00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:43,850
So I'm now going to press escape.

834
00:56:44,731 --> 00:56:46,032
That's totally okay in this game.

835
00:56:52,795 --> 00:56:56,757
So now we sort of know the basic movement and we can move around on the keyboard.

836
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,198
So let's see what we can do with this.

837
00:57:19,154 --> 00:57:20,915
Oh no, the game is caps lock.

838
00:57:20,955 --> 00:57:23,237
Caps lock.

839
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:28,380
So now we know how to move and we can avoid some things.

840
00:57:28,801 --> 00:57:31,803
And then we try a few different things we can do with this movement.

841
00:57:32,263 --> 00:57:34,144
So I'm just going to shift through some different games.

842
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:44,515
So we have the same movement here just with a little bit of action added on top

843
00:57:45,436 --> 00:57:49,042
but now if I hold down one of the keys it goes down

844
00:57:49,062 --> 00:57:53,710
So i'm just gonna play a little bit here

845
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:35,073
So next up we have some precision. This one is pretty straightforward.

846
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:47,752
And I'm gonna jump down here and skip to the next scene.

847
00:59:01,878 --> 00:59:05,121
So here you're forced down on all the windows buttons and space and everything.

848
00:59:29,022 --> 00:59:34,424
So now I'll show a few examples of what you can do with just one key at a time on the keyboard.

849
00:59:34,464 --> 00:59:37,665
But the keyboard will support more than one key at a time.

850
00:59:37,885 --> 00:59:39,585
So now we go for two keys.

851
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:50,928
So I still move around, same point, press a key.

852
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:53,729
But if I hold down that key, press a secondary key.

853
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:58,935
Then I get a pretty huge multi-directional...

854
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:04,062
So I'm just gonna shoot this target here.

855
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:06,626
And then just play for a little bit.

856
01:00:32,938 --> 01:00:36,001
And yeah, that's Peebles Boss.

857
01:00:36,021 --> 01:00:36,262
Thank you.

858
01:00:36,282 --> 01:00:36,382
Woo!

859
01:00:36,402 --> 01:00:36,522
Woo!

860
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:36,602
Woo!

861
01:00:36,642 --> 01:00:36,702
Woo!

862
01:00:36,722 --> 01:00:36,802
Woo!

863
01:00:36,822 --> 01:00:36,882
Woo!

864
01:00:36,902 --> 01:00:37,002
Woo!

865
01:00:37,022 --> 01:00:37,143
Woo!

866
01:00:37,163 --> 01:00:37,443
Woo!

867
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:37,823
Woo!

868
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:37,923
Woo!

869
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:38,003
Woo!

870
01:00:38,023 --> 01:00:38,104
Woo!

871
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:39,085
Woo!

872
01:00:39,145 --> 01:00:39,345
Woo!

873
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:45,171
Woo!

874
01:00:45,191 --> 01:00:45,251
Woo!

875
01:00:45,271 --> 01:00:45,351
Woo!

876
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:45,451
Woo!

877
01:00:46,092 --> 01:00:46,472
Thank you.

878
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:50,596
Next, we have Anita Tong and Kasson Crooker here to talk about Shard.

879
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:27,195
Hi. We are here to talk about the cooperative two‑player game Shard. Shard was created and

880
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:32,219
conceptualized by Roger Hannah Moresh. He was the programmer, game designer and built the

881
01:01:32,279 --> 01:01:37,984
underlying game engine from scratch. I'm Anita. I joined Roger as the game's visual artist and

882
01:01:38,024 --> 01:01:41,006
became significantly involved in the game's narrative and design.

883
01:01:42,511 --> 01:01:46,075
Hi, my name is Kasson Kroeker. I worked with Roger for many years at Harmonix.

884
01:01:46,656 --> 01:01:51,521
And then actually on one of Robin's SF Indies picnics, I met up with Roger again.

885
01:01:51,581 --> 01:01:55,866
And of course he had his laptop and immediately showed me an early version of the game.

886
01:01:55,926 --> 01:01:58,889
And so I joined on the spot to write music and do the sound design.

887
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:06,206
So for those of you who did not have the fortune of knowing Roger, he and his wife Val

888
01:02:06,286 --> 01:02:12,529
tragically passed away in January at their home in Berkeley, feeling a mixture of both joy to

889
01:02:12,569 --> 01:02:17,072
be here in front of you and share his game with you and sadness at their passing.

890
01:02:18,987 --> 01:02:25,252
It was really his dream to be able to show a game like Shard in a room full of these amazing, innovative designers.

891
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:28,614
So, thank you to EGW for having us, of course.

892
01:02:29,635 --> 01:02:35,159
Roger was one of the most fiercely intelligent people I've ever met, stressed on fiercely,

893
01:02:35,179 --> 01:02:38,941
and he really just wanted to make progressive, thought-provoking games.

894
01:02:39,642 --> 01:02:44,088
In addition to Shard, I worked with him on Rock Band franchises and Dance Central.

895
01:02:44,729 --> 01:02:48,834
He also made a Chrome and Native client of Port of Bastion.

896
01:02:49,655 --> 01:02:55,643
He was a lead engineer on last year's Amplitude game, and he worked on about 15 games in total.

897
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:59,525
He was also an avid game player as well as game maker,

898
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:03,666
and he consistently just wanted to enjoy every game

899
01:03:03,686 --> 01:03:04,286
that he played.

900
01:03:04,306 --> 01:03:06,647
He was consistently on the top of the leader boards

901
01:03:06,947 --> 01:03:09,048
for Amplitude, and he was the first person

902
01:03:09,088 --> 01:03:10,689
to speed run Braid.

903
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,750
Roger was incredibly devoted to finding ways

904
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,872
to push game design into new realms and unexplored themes.

905
01:03:18,632 --> 01:03:20,553
For five years, Shard was his passion,

906
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:22,273
so we wanted to speak a little here

907
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:24,334
to celebrate his life and his game.

908
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:32,066
Shard began as a visual algorithm for breaking down images. Roger had previously made a

909
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:37,369
music visualizer that took advantage of the triangle based nature of GPU rendering and

910
01:03:37,409 --> 01:03:42,612
started to think about ways to use aspects of that experiment in a game. We use an

911
01:03:42,692 --> 01:03:48,375
offline process that takes in a roster image as a PNG and uses a learning algorithm to

912
01:03:48,415 --> 01:03:50,876
describe the images using triangles.

913
01:03:53,399 --> 01:03:58,801
Making a game entirely out of particles opens up a lot of opportunities for really weird

914
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:03,983
interactions without having to animate anything by hand. Also, visually, the amount of

915
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:08,506
triangles correlates to how closely the generated art will resemble the original art, which

916
01:04:08,546 --> 01:04:13,508
allows us to use different levels of abstraction for different areas of the game. This

917
01:04:13,548 --> 01:04:17,630
approach, coupled with his custom coded game engine, made the games rendering highly

918
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:20,511
efficient and easily executed on any platform.

919
01:04:23,512 --> 01:04:28,214
This is just a transition animation from a really early build of Shard showing the way

920
01:04:28,274 --> 01:04:36,337
that things in the world form from the triangles. The theme of breaking familiar things apart

921
01:04:36,757 --> 01:04:41,778
in order to change them is something that is carried into multiple parts of the game. The

922
01:04:41,858 --> 01:04:46,740
algorithm takes a preexisting image and abstracts it and we wanted Shard to continue that

923
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,821
abstraction in its non-visual aspects.

924
01:04:50,029 --> 01:04:53,870
Narratively, it starts as a hero's journey, but along the way, the world breaks apart,

925
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:59,451
revealing new dimensions. This makes the world itself the center of the story, and the

926
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:04,972
players shift focus to an exploration of their broken world. Mechanically, they start

927
01:05:05,993 --> 01:05:10,574
with familiar run and jump platformer abilities, but after the world breaks, many new

928
01:05:10,634 --> 01:05:12,314
interactive options become available.

929
01:05:13,772 --> 01:05:15,655
In addition to the unique aesthetic

930
01:05:15,715 --> 01:05:16,897
of this triangle-based system,

931
01:05:17,218 --> 01:05:19,241
it allows for scaling the resolution of the game

932
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:22,366
easily and quickly as a tool for imparting game state,

933
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:23,888
health, or other mechanics.

934
01:05:26,247 --> 01:05:31,149
Beyond the custom engine and unique gen anim system that sort of drives the whole initial prototypes of the game,

935
01:05:31,629 --> 01:05:39,452
Shard was so much more than that. Roger really would describe it as a fractured platformer with local cooperative multiplayer gameplay.

936
01:05:40,313 --> 01:05:45,875
Roger and I really felt strongly that the game needed to have an overarching philosophy of being

937
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:50,937
inclusive and cooperative and it's a social game and something that's really easily

938
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:55,379
discoverable. We wanted to represent different races and genders identity in the game. It's

939
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:59,561
not the focus but we wanted to have that be a part. And it's really about the cooperative

940
01:05:59,721 --> 01:06:03,823
aspect of the game. We wanted the social experience where the dialogue between the two

941
01:06:03,883 --> 01:06:06,964
players in front of the computer really was essential to making progress.

942
01:06:07,404 --> 01:06:11,148
And then with the two players, we wanted to make sure there was a low barrier of entry,

943
01:06:11,209 --> 01:06:15,874
no tutorials, everything was very discoverable, and very important that players of different

944
01:06:15,954 --> 01:06:20,159
skill levels could sit down and play together, even if they didn't know the basics of Platformer.

945
01:06:21,788 --> 01:06:25,211
But I think the most innovative aspect of the game was this fractured element.

946
01:06:25,591 --> 01:06:29,414
Playing on this system of being able to generate these triangles and break things down,

947
01:06:30,055 --> 01:06:36,060
low-res to high-res, really meant that we could also break other things in addition to the graphics.

948
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,123
We could break the physics at any time, we could break the narrative,

949
01:06:39,183 --> 01:06:46,149
we could break standardized platformer mechanics and really play with those and embed them inside the narrative.

950
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:56,146
Using this tool has allowed us to build environments and look for really interesting combinatorial mechanics that led to unique gameplay experiences.

951
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:06,312
Here's some footage of the most recent build of Shard from late last year.

952
01:07:06,352 --> 01:07:10,993
The two players have six unique abilities that increase in complexity,

953
01:07:11,053 --> 01:07:14,655
and they're presented as skills that the two players share.

954
01:07:15,695 --> 01:07:20,957
The players cannot use the same ability set, but they can switch at any time between them,

955
01:07:21,017 --> 01:07:23,878
so this is the prompting of the dialogue between the two players

956
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:28,260
to coordinate how they're going to overcome these different environmental obstacles.

957
01:07:32,059 --> 01:07:40,122
As the game goes on, they're given new abilities that allow them to change the properties of the triangles that make up their character forms

958
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:43,463
and have effect on the triangles surrounding them in the world.

959
01:07:44,564 --> 01:07:49,666
These abilities progress as the game goes on in power, but also in abstraction.

960
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:55,258
And then as the gameplay becomes harder,

961
01:07:55,278 --> 01:07:56,919
the two players really have to coordinate

962
01:07:56,959 --> 01:07:58,240
these abilities to advance.

963
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,961
There are, we had to build a number

964
01:08:00,982 --> 01:08:03,123
of different environmental levels, you see some here,

965
01:08:03,403 --> 01:08:05,264
just as prototype beds to be able to sort of,

966
01:08:05,344 --> 01:08:06,625
you know, flesh out the look of the game,

967
01:08:06,845 --> 01:08:09,227
but also experiment with the combinatorial aspects

968
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:11,248
of these abilities to yield mechanics.

969
01:08:11,409 --> 01:08:12,970
And what I, you know, in demos,

970
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:14,831
we were really seeing a lot of emergent gameplay.

971
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,431
There's a moment that we haven't built yet

972
01:08:24,552 --> 01:08:25,512
in the future of the game,

973
01:08:26,053 --> 01:08:28,574
where the item that grants the abilities and powers

974
01:08:28,615 --> 01:08:29,595
to the players breaks,

975
01:08:29,956 --> 01:08:33,398
and force them to adjust to a new level of abstraction.

976
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:36,440
The character forms end up breaking down completely,

977
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,282
and although the game responds to input,

978
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:40,483
it might not be in ways that are completely expected.

979
01:08:41,304 --> 01:08:42,004
After this moment,

980
01:08:42,064 --> 01:08:43,705
the players have to deliberately restore

981
01:08:43,726 --> 01:08:45,026
a degree of order to the world.

982
01:08:46,377 --> 01:08:47,918
On the audio side, as an audio person,

983
01:08:47,938 --> 01:08:50,059
I was always working with Roger to try to explore

984
01:08:50,099 --> 01:08:52,921
some audio aspects of doing the same thing.

985
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:54,682
And so we had come up with this great system

986
01:08:54,722 --> 01:08:56,763
that I was really looking forward to implement,

987
01:08:56,843 --> 01:08:58,705
and hopefully we will in the future of the game,

988
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:02,287
which would be the ability to both de-res the audio,

989
01:09:02,367 --> 01:09:04,448
basically fracture the audio in real time,

990
01:09:04,508 --> 01:09:07,049
scaling it from full fidelity all the way down

991
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:11,512
to highly compressed and thereby very artifacted sounding

992
01:09:12,092 --> 01:09:14,154
to sort of play along with the same scaling up

993
01:09:14,194 --> 01:09:15,675
and scaling down of the triangle system.

994
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:27,801
So, just before the end of 2016, we had finished our first vertical slice and began working

995
01:09:27,821 --> 01:09:29,461
on the horizontal slice of the game.

996
01:09:30,001 --> 01:09:34,803
But then the sudden passing of Roger in January, obviously, has halted our progress.

997
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:40,244
And so, we're currently working through all the emotions to be surrounded by such an amazing

998
01:09:40,284 --> 01:09:41,145
community of gamers.

999
01:09:41,805 --> 01:09:48,167
who have supported him has been really amazing. And Anita and I and those close to Roger are

1000
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:53,049
extremely passionate about the future of Shard. And so Anita?

1001
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:58,412
Our goal is that in a few months we'll be able to formulate a plan on how we can complete and

1002
01:09:58,432 --> 01:10:05,254
release Shard in a way that honors Roger's legacy. So until then, here's some ways you can

1003
01:10:05,294 --> 01:10:10,657
continue to follow us online. Thanks so much to the whole EGW team.

1004
01:10:11,244 --> 01:10:16,808
and especially to San Francisco indie developers for your support. I want to leave you with a

1005
01:10:16,888 --> 01:10:23,613
quote from Roger, which he once wrote in response to the question, why do you play games? If

1006
01:10:23,633 --> 01:10:28,536
something can be imagined, it can be created in a video game. In that regard, that's the

1007
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:34,201
ultimate form of freedom of expression of ideas. And games today touch on a large gamut of

1008
01:10:34,261 --> 01:10:34,401
that.

1009
01:10:35,423 --> 01:10:44,711
dread, euphoria, desire, fear, rage, compassion, order, chaos, logic, beauty in all its forms.

1010
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:46,532
Thanks.

1011
01:11:10,654 --> 01:11:14,895
I just wanted to take a moment and acknowledge the fact that the community came together

1012
01:11:15,495 --> 01:11:20,716
very well and in a great, amazing, loving moment when Roger passed.

1013
01:11:21,256 --> 01:11:25,017
It was his dream to present this game here and to be able to do that is one of the greatest

1014
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:26,057
things of my life.

1015
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:29,658
It's my greatest regret that he didn't live to see this moment.

1016
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:32,479
I just wanted to say that he loved you all very, very much.

1017
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:33,399
Thank you.

1018
01:11:44,945 --> 01:11:49,801
And with that, one of my most favorite people, Jen Sandercock and Josh are here to show us Edible Games.

1019
01:11:57,007 --> 01:11:59,868
All right, hi everyone, I'm Jen Sandercock,

1020
01:12:00,308 --> 01:12:01,448
and I'm talking about edible games.

1021
01:12:02,529 --> 01:12:03,189
What do I mean?

1022
01:12:03,809 --> 01:12:07,751
I mean games where one of the core gameplay mechanics is eating.

1023
01:12:08,451 --> 01:12:09,891
And I'm not talking about food as a reward,

1024
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:14,353
I'm talking about like somehow eating changes the games somehow.

1025
01:12:14,753 --> 01:12:15,673
Why am I doing this?

1026
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,374
I'm doing this because I love to bake,

1027
01:12:18,314 --> 01:12:20,135
I really like real world games,

1028
01:12:21,235 --> 01:12:23,016
and I like designing games.

1029
01:12:23,216 --> 01:12:25,877
This is a bunch of games that I've worked on over the years.

1030
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,343
So by my powers combined, yay, edible games.

1031
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:34,408
So in the beginning, one of the first games I did

1032
01:12:34,428 --> 01:12:35,709
was called the cookie baking game.

1033
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:38,893
In the cookie baking game, you compete for ingredients

1034
01:12:38,993 --> 01:12:40,555
and then you eat the cookies that you bake

1035
01:12:40,575 --> 01:12:41,496
at the end as a reward.

1036
01:12:44,164 --> 01:12:48,325
But the thing was, the gameplay was kind of little mini-games to compete for the ingredients

1037
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:51,746
and you didn't really interact with the food particularly much and it wasn't really cohesive

1038
01:12:51,786 --> 01:12:52,126
as a whole.

1039
01:12:52,606 --> 01:12:58,968
So the big question I needed to ask was, what new gameplay mechanics are only possible with

1040
01:12:59,048 --> 01:13:01,668
edible games and cannot be done with any other type of game?

1041
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:04,389
Basically I was asking, what does food give us?

1042
01:13:05,129 --> 01:13:09,810
Food gives us a bunch of societal norms, hidden information with your taste buds, allergies,

1043
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:13,311
personal preference, they're messy, germs, all of these things.

1044
01:13:14,151 --> 01:13:17,612
So because I'm doing a series of games, I'm going to talk to you about six of the games

1045
01:13:17,672 --> 01:13:20,013
that I've got that I think are pretty solid right now.

1046
01:13:20,814 --> 01:13:23,315
So the first one is Gingerbread Friends.

1047
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:27,416
Gingerbread Friends is set up with a board with lids on top.

1048
01:13:27,496 --> 01:13:29,597
It's a slow game about making friends.

1049
01:13:30,037 --> 01:13:33,798
There are hidden prizes inside, which are the gummy bears, and then there are also pieces

1050
01:13:33,858 --> 01:13:34,339
of paper.

1051
01:13:34,779 --> 01:13:38,280
The pieces of paper are Minesweeper-like and tell you where to find a gummy bear.

1052
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,903
You earn the right to eat a lid by guessing others' answers to social questions.

1053
01:13:44,384 --> 01:13:47,706
So, for example, when it's your turn, you might ask the group,

1054
01:13:48,865 --> 01:13:53,806
Would it be a relief to realize you were ordinary, no better or worse than most others?

1055
01:13:54,466 --> 01:13:58,087
And then you guess if everybody will say yes or no and then you might get a lid.

1056
01:13:59,028 --> 01:14:00,408
Next game, Master Taster.

1057
01:14:00,468 --> 01:14:03,169
In Master Taster, it's about memory and taste buds.

1058
01:14:03,469 --> 01:14:08,070
There are a series of rounds and in each round you find out the taste preferences of the

1059
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,270
two main characters.

1060
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,731
Then you must eat one of the items with your eyes closed.

1061
01:14:13,552 --> 01:14:16,496
As you're eating it, you need to work out what flavour that is.

1062
01:14:16,796 --> 01:14:18,798
And it might be a combination of flavours too.

1063
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:21,762
You then say whether the characters can or can't eat it

1064
01:14:21,782 --> 01:14:23,565
by putting thumbs up or thumbs down.

1065
01:14:24,045 --> 01:14:25,747
If you're correct, you stay in the game.

1066
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:29,853
Information is never repeated, and information builds every single round.

1067
01:14:30,734 --> 01:14:32,335
Next game, Flavour Roulette.

1068
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:35,978
In Flavour Roulette, there are four players with four morsels.

1069
01:14:36,178 --> 01:14:37,979
One of these does not taste like the others.

1070
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,480
It's probably pretty gross.

1071
01:14:40,621 --> 01:14:44,864
You take turns eating, and then you have to pretend like yours is normal.

1072
01:14:44,924 --> 01:14:46,445
So this is my friend Owen here.

1073
01:14:47,706 --> 01:14:53,211
So, would you believe he actually has a normal one?

1074
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:55,833
He's trying to convince everybody that they should vote for him.

1075
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:01,014
So once everybody's eaten, you then guess who had the bad one.

1076
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:04,058
The next game is Flip and Stick.

1077
01:15:04,118 --> 01:15:07,602
In Flip and Stick, there are a grid of peanut butter covered crackers.

1078
01:15:07,963 --> 01:15:12,248
You choose a square to hit, for example, D5, and you try to aim for it and hit.

1079
01:15:13,185 --> 01:15:16,550
If you miss, there are more points for everyone else and slash chocolate.

1080
01:15:17,491 --> 01:15:21,938
And if you hit it, you need to flip upside down your square and see what sticks.

1081
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:25,122
You get as many points as whatever sticks to your square.

1082
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:28,627
And then you get to like throw a bunch of chocolate at the table so that there's more

1083
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:29,408
points for everyone.

1084
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:35,004
The next game is called J-Wobbler, and this is a tray

1085
01:15:35,304 --> 01:15:37,506
of what I call jelly, you guys call Jello.

1086
01:15:37,926 --> 01:15:40,588
With gummy bears hidden inside, you have 10 seconds to try

1087
01:15:40,628 --> 01:15:42,790
to wobble to get the jawbreaker to land on top

1088
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,731
of one of the gummy bears.

1089
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:46,453
If it does, you then get to eat the square.

1090
01:15:47,714 --> 01:15:49,215
Now there's a big hole in the board

1091
01:15:49,415 --> 01:15:51,497
which your jawbreaker is very likely to fall into.

1092
01:15:52,663 --> 01:15:56,452
So I'm going to now do a deep dive on a game called The Order of the Oven Mitt.

1093
01:15:56,953 --> 01:16:01,303
The tagline is, do you have the appetite to join the Knights of the Oven Mitt?

1094
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:06,763
I did this for the Global Game Jam in 2016, where the theme was ritual.

1095
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:11,025
I did a bunch of failed prototypes where there was too much thinking, not enough fun, and

1096
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:12,385
definitely not enough eating.

1097
01:16:13,566 --> 01:16:17,708
It's a two-team game, and you move just like a chess knight on the board, so in an L shape.

1098
01:16:18,728 --> 01:16:22,770
There are two types of squares, the sacred squares, which are the dark squares, and the

1099
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:24,631
common squares, which are the light squares.

1100
01:16:26,272 --> 01:16:30,934
If you land on a sacred square, you must consume it according to the sacred ritual as laid

1101
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:34,149
the sacred tomb of the oven mitt.

1102
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:38,651
This is what some of the rituals look like.

1103
01:16:39,731 --> 01:16:41,271
Once you have consumed that square,

1104
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:43,052
you then have a hole on the board.

1105
01:16:43,352 --> 01:16:44,672
And you can't stand on top of a hole,

1106
01:16:44,732 --> 01:16:47,253
so you have to push the squares around.

1107
01:16:47,673 --> 01:16:48,753
That might push you.

1108
01:16:48,853 --> 01:16:50,673
It might move the other player as well.

1109
01:16:51,213 --> 01:16:54,714
And it will mean that perhaps the other player might not

1110
01:16:54,734 --> 01:16:56,175
be able to get the candy you like.

1111
01:16:57,716 --> 01:17:02,458
If you land on one of the common squares, you can't eat the common squares because that will sully you.

1112
01:17:03,378 --> 01:17:06,159
So the game is over when all of the sacred squares have been eaten.

1113
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:12,641
The rituals are really a fun performance for players and observers.

1114
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:15,742
It's creating a sacred space where you're allowed to be totally silly.

1115
01:17:16,803 --> 01:17:21,785
The initial feedback I got on the game was that I could push the rituals to make them even more embarrassing for people.

1116
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:26,181
There's kind of two different sorts of play styles that you can play.

1117
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:30,304
Because the game itself doesn't really care who eats the sacred squares, they just have

1118
01:17:30,344 --> 01:17:30,884
to be eaten.

1119
01:17:31,164 --> 01:17:35,467
You can either compete to see who gets the most or cooperate and help each other both

1120
01:17:35,507 --> 01:17:36,628
get the squares that you want.

1121
01:17:37,348 --> 01:17:40,471
There are unique play strategies because people have food preferences.

1122
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:43,012
So for example, this is a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.

1123
01:17:43,352 --> 01:17:44,633
Many people like these.

1124
01:17:46,114 --> 01:17:48,417
Some people don't, but if you're both like them,

1125
01:17:48,438 --> 01:17:49,860
you might compete for them and go,

1126
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,482
hey, I'm gonna not let you have that.

1127
01:17:51,802 --> 01:17:55,187
But you might go, ooh, if I let you have the jelly beans,

1128
01:17:55,207 --> 01:17:57,090
will you let me have the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup?

1129
01:17:58,662 --> 01:18:00,983
There are unique challenges for demoing this.

1130
01:18:01,063 --> 01:18:02,824
I've showed it at IndieCade last year,

1131
01:18:02,884 --> 01:18:04,065
and I spent days baking.

1132
01:18:04,105 --> 01:18:06,466
I had an army of helpers helping me.

1133
01:18:06,606 --> 01:18:07,287
It was amazing.

1134
01:18:08,067 --> 01:18:11,049
I'm now going to try to do a live example.

1135
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:12,609
So we're gonna switch to, I've got a camera,

1136
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:16,631
and I have some volunteers over here.

1137
01:18:17,812 --> 01:18:18,633
Say hello to everyone.

1138
01:18:18,673 --> 01:18:19,974
So, we've got Josh doing the camera.

1139
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:21,175
We've got six people.

1140
01:18:21,195 --> 01:18:24,519
So, we've got two teams.

1141
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,721
We set the board up earlier

1142
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:29,463
so that they started playing before the session began.

1143
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:34,328
And let me see, is it Sue, Sandy and Pat's turn currently?

1144
01:18:34,788 --> 01:18:35,149
All right.

1145
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:37,811
So, would you like to, they are playing

1146
01:18:37,871 --> 01:18:40,614
as the dinosaur kangaroo object.

1147
01:18:41,497 --> 01:18:45,039
At the beginning of the game you get to decorate your piece so that it becomes more like you.

1148
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:46,719
With edible pens of course.

1149
01:18:46,899 --> 01:18:49,140
The pieces are, the whole board is entirely edible.

1150
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:56,263
So they are moving and they're going to land on top of the candy corn.

1151
01:18:57,103 --> 01:18:59,684
So we can see on the side there's a little legend.

1152
01:18:59,964 --> 01:19:01,825
The candy corn is number six.

1153
01:19:02,065 --> 01:19:07,227
So I pull out the sacred tomb of the oven mitt and I look up ritual number six.

1154
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:10,851
Pick up the sacred square.

1155
01:19:11,772 --> 01:19:13,353
Now, everybody gets a sacred square.

1156
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:15,214
So if you're playing with more than just two people,

1157
01:19:15,614 --> 01:19:17,996
people grab them from the extra supply that I have.

1158
01:19:19,437 --> 01:19:23,019
Hold sacred square high above your head with both hands.

1159
01:19:26,021 --> 01:19:27,702
Look at the sacred square.

1160
01:19:29,423 --> 01:19:29,883
Squint.

1161
01:19:30,383 --> 01:19:31,664
Squint against the grandeur.

1162
01:19:33,907 --> 01:19:36,873
Move the sacred square to your mouth with your hands.

1163
01:19:37,735 --> 01:19:39,359
Consume the sacred square.

1164
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:52,631
So when they are done consuming, they then get to push things around on the board.

1165
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:55,352
So hopefully we'll be able to zoom in and see what they're doing.

1166
01:19:55,693 --> 01:19:58,834
You have to push everything so it all hits up against the edge.

1167
01:19:59,734 --> 01:20:00,835
So that might move you.

1168
01:20:01,275 --> 01:20:05,436
And in this case, it's actually moved the eyes into a position where the other team

1169
01:20:05,516 --> 01:20:06,197
can reach it.

1170
01:20:06,897 --> 01:20:09,658
So I don't know, do they want the funny candy eye things?

1171
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,600
Looks like they do.

1172
01:20:15,514 --> 01:20:18,677
Alright, so that is ritual number eight.

1173
01:20:19,998 --> 01:20:21,579
Alright, let me make sure I get the right one.

1174
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:21,940
Okay.

1175
01:20:22,961 --> 01:20:24,442
Pick up the sacred square.

1176
01:20:24,462 --> 01:20:30,727
Everyone's got one.

1177
01:20:31,588 --> 01:20:32,509
Close your eyes.

1178
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:37,453
Do a 180 degree turn so that no one will see what happens.

1179
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,976
Keep your eyes closed.

1180
01:20:43,072 --> 01:20:45,655
Think of your most embarrassing memory.

1181
01:20:46,095 --> 01:20:47,797
It's not like anyone's watching you right now.

1182
01:20:50,059 --> 01:20:53,022
Place square in your mouth and consume.

1183
01:20:55,244 --> 01:20:57,286
When you are done consuming, you may turn around.

1184
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:00,149
Keep thinking about that embarrassing moment.

1185
01:21:10,669 --> 01:21:15,194
Yay, and so now they would get to move stuff on the board if they want to finish their

1186
01:21:15,214 --> 01:21:15,514
turn.

1187
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:22,742
You switch where they're going to push it.

1188
01:21:22,762 --> 01:21:24,344
They're going to go that way.

1189
01:21:24,364 --> 01:21:26,486
So you always have to end up on top of a square.

1190
01:21:28,128 --> 01:21:30,730
So we're now going to switch back to the slides, hopefully.

1191
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:32,470
Brilliant.

1192
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:35,071
Alright, so what's my next stage?

1193
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:39,553
I have a bunch of half-baked ideas, literally, half-baked, I just couldn't resist.

1194
01:21:40,914 --> 01:21:44,836
There's obviously a bunch of scalability and delivery issues with this style of games.

1195
01:21:45,276 --> 01:21:50,999
It takes a really long time to make these boards, they don't last forever, I don't have

1196
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:55,561
food handling licenses, some people have allergies and can't eat these things, but I'm planning

1197
01:21:55,581 --> 01:21:56,902
to do an edible games cookbook.

1198
01:21:57,342 --> 01:21:59,044
baker's dozen of edible games.

1199
01:21:59,104 --> 01:22:02,106
So it'll have the recipes and the rules on how to play.

1200
01:22:03,087 --> 01:22:05,669
I have Flip and Stick, the peanut butter cracker game,

1201
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:08,231
available to play after the talks are over over there.

1202
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:09,111
So come and join me.

1203
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:12,074
And if you're interested, follow me on Twitter

1204
01:22:12,274 --> 01:22:13,535
or sign up to get my newsletter.

1205
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:13,755
Thank you.

1206
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:14,055
Thank you, Jen.

1207
01:22:14,075 --> 01:22:20,900
That was delicious.

1208
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:21,621
Thank you.

1209
01:22:21,641 --> 01:22:24,343
Thank you.

1210
01:22:24,383 --> 01:22:24,603
Thank you.

1211
01:22:24,623 --> 01:22:24,803
Thank you.

1212
01:22:24,823 --> 01:22:25,003
Thank you.

1213
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:25,264
Thank you.

1214
01:22:25,284 --> 01:22:25,504
Thank you.

1215
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:25,724
Thank you.

1216
01:22:25,744 --> 01:22:25,944
Thank you.

1217
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:26,485
Thank you.

1218
01:22:27,384 --> 01:22:35,128
Okay, next we have a fold apart and if I make this a little bit bigger I can actually read the names off of the thing.

1219
01:22:36,169 --> 01:22:40,791
This year is new. Can you see how smooth it is? It's so smooth. Everything just happens.

1220
01:22:41,592 --> 01:22:45,754
There's another group of people that we haven't said thank you to yet, which I think we should probably do right now.

1221
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:50,977
And that's the AV staff for this room who are tireless and helping us assemble the session.

1222
01:22:51,017 --> 01:22:52,698
So let's give them a huge round of applause.

1223
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:00,161
They work with us to practice these talks.

1224
01:23:00,281 --> 01:23:03,523
They let us come into the room several times over the course of the conference

1225
01:23:04,024 --> 01:23:06,386
and work with our schedules and our weird hardware

1226
01:23:06,466 --> 01:23:09,108
and all the little things that we want to do, including stuff like that camera,

1227
01:23:09,468 --> 01:23:10,369
and they make it happen.

1228
01:23:10,469 --> 01:23:13,071
And it wouldn't happen if they weren't here and they weren't dedicated to their jobs.

1229
01:23:13,411 --> 01:23:15,513
They also made everything else work at GDC,

1230
01:23:15,593 --> 01:23:17,314
so for that we'll give them a second round of applause.

1231
01:23:17,374 --> 01:23:17,995
Thank you once again.

1232
01:23:25,446 --> 01:23:30,889
So, in introducing Mark and Steven, I actually asked Mark, how do I pronounce your last name?

1233
01:23:31,709 --> 01:23:37,953
It's LaFramboise, but he said it's LaFramBoise, because then you have LaFramBoise and LaFramGirls.

1234
01:23:40,874 --> 01:23:42,655
And I was like, oh damn, that's really funny.

1235
01:23:42,675 --> 01:23:48,599
But, all the time, no, doing a little bit of extra stuff.

1236
01:23:48,739 --> 01:23:52,501
Alright, so show of hands, everyone in the room, how many of you are game designers?

1237
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,612
All right. How many of you are artists?

1238
01:23:57,973 --> 01:23:59,954
All right. How many of you are sound designers?

1239
01:24:00,455 --> 01:24:01,876
Musicians? Okay.

1240
01:24:02,556 --> 01:24:04,737
Writers? All right.

1241
01:24:05,038 --> 01:24:07,219
Producers? All right.

1242
01:24:07,639 --> 01:24:09,741
How about the people that raise the money?

1243
01:24:09,901 --> 01:24:11,402
How many of you are raising money right now?

1244
01:24:12,623 --> 01:24:14,984
All right. You do hard work.

1245
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:17,346
I appreciate you now much more than I ever did before.

1246
01:24:18,206 --> 01:24:19,527
How many of you give away money?

1247
01:24:20,862 --> 01:24:21,702
Oh, you suckers!

1248
01:24:21,722 --> 01:24:25,783
Now I know where you're sitting.

1249
01:24:28,543 --> 01:24:30,904
Okay, how many of you had your hands up more than once?

1250
01:24:32,284 --> 01:24:33,124
All right, thank you.

1251
01:24:33,184 --> 01:24:36,545
That's what makes games awesome, is that set of hands.

1252
01:24:36,565 --> 01:24:39,825
It's the fact that there are so many people in the community that do more than one thing,

1253
01:24:39,905 --> 01:24:41,005
which is a good thing to do.

1254
01:24:41,746 --> 01:24:44,746
I'm trying to think if there's anything else I can talk about.

1255
01:24:47,637 --> 01:24:49,098
I was just going to say that.

1256
01:24:49,538 --> 01:24:51,498
I'm not going to talk about those things yet.

1257
01:24:51,658 --> 01:24:55,719
As for a shout out, right before the shout out, indeed.

1258
01:24:57,179 --> 01:24:59,080
Well, I can tell you a joke.

1259
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,221
All right, we're going to bring the next person up.

1260
01:25:02,581 --> 01:25:03,541
But I'll still tell you a joke.

1261
01:25:06,682 --> 01:25:10,022
The joke is, why do giraffes have long necks?

1262
01:25:13,303 --> 01:25:14,383
Because their feet stink.

1263
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,482
My friend Kian made that up when he was eight and it's still the funniest joke in the universe.

1264
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:29,409
Okay, so the next speaker, we're going to go a little bit forward, is Hamish Todd.

1265
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,950
Hamish Todd.

1266
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:32,491
I always do it wrong, every time.

1267
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:36,234
And he's presenting Virus, the beauty.

1268
01:25:36,254 --> 01:25:37,555
Oh my gosh!

1269
01:25:38,276 --> 01:25:38,796
Look at that!

1270
01:25:39,236 --> 01:25:39,797
Never mind.

1271
01:25:40,017 --> 01:25:41,058
We'll see him in a minute.

1272
01:25:41,878 --> 01:25:43,880
Without further ado, here's Stephen Mark.

1273
01:25:58,415 --> 01:25:59,576
The laptop just died.

1274
01:26:00,316 --> 01:26:02,858
All right, good afternoon GDC.

1275
01:26:03,938 --> 01:26:05,899
So I'm Mark, and this is Steven, and we

1276
01:26:05,959 --> 01:26:07,840
are the co-founders of Lightning Rod Games.

1277
01:26:08,561 --> 01:26:10,802
So we're going to be talking about our game, A Fold Apart.

1278
01:26:11,622 --> 01:26:13,263
So before we start, how many people here

1279
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:15,644
have been in a long distance relationship

1280
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:16,505
at some point in their lives?

1281
01:26:17,285 --> 01:26:17,965
Oh, quite a few of you.

1282
01:26:17,985 --> 01:26:18,566
OK, this is great.

1283
01:26:18,946 --> 01:26:20,627
So you guys will probably get something

1284
01:26:20,647 --> 01:26:22,368
a little bit of extra of our presentation today.

1285
01:26:23,663 --> 01:26:25,324
So we're gonna get into our gameplay pretty quickly,

1286
01:26:25,545 --> 01:26:27,265
but I just wanna do a little brief overview

1287
01:26:27,946 --> 01:26:29,987
of the inspiration for the game

1288
01:26:30,127 --> 01:26:31,828
and how we arrived at the mechanic that we're using.

1289
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:36,731
So before I started Lighting Rod Games with Steven,

1290
01:26:37,171 --> 01:26:39,572
I was working in California at Disney Interactive,

1291
01:26:39,932 --> 01:26:42,074
and my wife was still living in Orangeville, Canada.

1292
01:26:42,714 --> 01:26:43,835
And so for a year and a half,

1293
01:26:44,055 --> 01:26:46,636
we were in a long distance relationship, and it sucked.

1294
01:26:46,656 --> 01:26:49,177
You know, it was a lot of emotional ups and downs,

1295
01:26:49,718 --> 01:26:51,739
and it was a very, very trying time for both of us.

1296
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:55,332
Now, the good news is we've been back together in Canada for over three years,

1297
01:26:56,092 --> 01:26:58,072
but whenever I look back at that time when we were apart

1298
01:26:58,552 --> 01:26:59,893
and the emotions that we went through,

1299
01:26:59,913 --> 01:27:02,713
I always thought that would be a very interesting story for a game.

1300
01:27:02,733 --> 01:27:07,214
Because long-distance relationships really aren't something you see in games

1301
01:27:07,234 --> 01:27:10,075
or even other media like film and television all that often.

1302
01:27:10,775 --> 01:27:12,255
However, we wanted to make a game

1303
01:27:12,576 --> 01:27:14,896
that didn't just have a story about a long-distance relationship,

1304
01:27:15,316 --> 01:27:19,417
but mechanics to help enhance that feeling of being apart from someone that you loved.

1305
01:27:20,525 --> 01:27:22,006
And we didn't really know how to do that at first.

1306
01:27:22,507 --> 01:27:24,569
And it wasn't until after GDC one year,

1307
01:27:24,589 --> 01:27:27,091
and actually it was after an experimental gameplay workshop,

1308
01:27:27,431 --> 01:27:30,094
that Steve and I were brainstorming ideas

1309
01:27:30,154 --> 01:27:32,176
for game mechanics that we thought would be interesting

1310
01:27:32,236 --> 01:27:33,537
and we hadn't seen before in games.

1311
01:27:34,358 --> 01:27:37,340
And the idea of folding paper came up,

1312
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:40,243
like origami or the back of a Mad magazine.

1313
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,745
And we thought it was cool, but we didn't really know

1314
01:27:43,006 --> 01:27:45,328
how to turn that into a fully fledged game.

1315
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:49,730
And it wasn't until a few months later that I realized that folding paper is actually

1316
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:52,191
a really good way to represent a long-distance relationship.

1317
01:27:53,291 --> 01:27:56,573
Because if you have a piece of paper and you have a character on one side and a character

1318
01:27:56,593 --> 01:28:00,494
on the other, they're in two entirely different worlds and they can't get to one another.

1319
01:28:01,035 --> 01:28:05,036
But if you fold that paper, you can merge those two worlds together and create a way

1320
01:28:05,076 --> 01:28:05,857
for them to reunite.

1321
01:28:05,877 --> 01:28:10,559
And I thought this was a good representation of how it feels when you're in a long-distance

1322
01:28:10,579 --> 01:28:10,899
relationship.

1323
01:28:10,919 --> 01:28:13,540
You wish you could just take your two worlds and just mash them together and be in the

1324
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,020
same place.

1325
01:28:15,578 --> 01:28:18,119
So that provides the basis for our game of Fold Apart.

1326
01:28:18,779 --> 01:28:21,240
It's a puzzle game about a long distance relationship

1327
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,221
in a world made out of paper.

1328
01:28:26,261 --> 01:28:28,562
So there's two characters, an architect and a teacher,

1329
01:28:29,302 --> 01:28:30,622
and they're separated across a desk.

1330
01:28:30,902 --> 01:28:32,543
And the only way for them to reach one another

1331
01:28:32,963 --> 01:28:34,903
is by folding and manipulating the papers that

1332
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:35,583
lie between them.

1333
01:28:36,841 --> 01:28:38,922
So throughout the game, you're going to be able to play as both characters,

1334
01:28:39,343 --> 01:28:42,945
and you're going to be able to experience the unique perspective that both of them have.

1335
01:28:43,825 --> 01:28:47,248
Another thing is you're also going to be able to choose the genders of both characters.

1336
01:28:48,088 --> 01:28:50,950
We're still in the process of establishing our style and iterating on it,

1337
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:55,353
so I wasn't able to, unfortunately, be able to show it in the presentation today,

1338
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:58,254
but as a studio, we believe love is universal,

1339
01:28:58,274 --> 01:29:01,657
and we want that to be an option for every player who plays our game.

1340
01:29:01,937 --> 01:29:03,718
All right, so we'll stop.

1341
01:29:04,098 --> 01:29:04,298
Thank you.

1342
01:29:07,922 --> 01:29:09,944
Alright, so I'll set up this level a little bit as Steven plays.

1343
01:29:10,004 --> 01:29:11,446
So, we're gonna start this off.

1344
01:29:11,486 --> 01:29:13,689
The architect just started his new job in his new city.

1345
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:16,773
And, uh, he's gonna go for a walk and start exploring.

1346
01:29:17,173 --> 01:29:18,355
So he's gonna walk out of his office,

1347
01:29:18,815 --> 01:29:21,238
and he's gonna go into some of the papers that are adjacent to it.

1348
01:29:22,933 --> 01:29:25,754
And as he walks along, he's going to get to this retro movie theater,

1349
01:29:26,335 --> 01:29:30,397
and he sees a memory of a time when him and the teacher were happy together.

1350
01:29:30,417 --> 01:29:31,798
And so he goes and collects it.

1351
01:29:32,398 --> 01:29:34,759
And as he continues along, he gets to this paper,

1352
01:29:34,779 --> 01:29:36,320
and now all of a sudden he can't cross it.

1353
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,521
There's no way for him to get across to the next area.

1354
01:29:39,062 --> 01:29:41,923
But because the world's made out of paper, what we can do is we can turn that paper over,

1355
01:29:42,483 --> 01:29:45,705
and on the back you can see there's a platform now that he can walk across all the way to the next area.

1356
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,081
So he gets to another puzzle here.

1357
01:29:54,401 --> 01:29:56,702
So this one, you can see that there is a platform

1358
01:29:57,222 --> 01:29:59,063
on one side and there's a little bit of a platform

1359
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:00,763
on the other, but it doesn't go all the way across.

1360
01:30:02,224 --> 01:30:04,385
So what we can do now is actually fold the paper

1361
01:30:04,725 --> 01:30:06,406
and we can merge those two platforms together,

1362
01:30:06,486 --> 01:30:08,507
creating one single long one that he can walk across

1363
01:30:08,527 --> 01:30:09,147
to the next area.

1364
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:18,611
So the other thing we can do with the paper

1365
01:30:18,991 --> 01:30:20,731
is we can move characters and objects

1366
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:22,132
from one side of the paper to the other.

1367
01:30:23,285 --> 01:30:26,289
So here you can see the exit door is on the backside of the paper, so we have to get the

1368
01:30:26,309 --> 01:30:27,250
character over there somehow.

1369
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:31,335
So the first thing we can do is fold the paper, so we can merge these two platforms, kind

1370
01:30:31,355 --> 01:30:32,296
of like we did in the last puzzle.

1371
01:30:32,777 --> 01:30:36,261
But now what we can also do is unfold that paper, so that will move the characters to

1372
01:30:36,281 --> 01:30:37,443
the backside to where the door is.

1373
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:45,472
So a lot of you have been in long distance relationships,

1374
01:30:45,492 --> 01:30:47,053
so you know the most important thing

1375
01:30:47,273 --> 01:30:48,534
when you're that far apart from someone else

1376
01:30:48,594 --> 01:30:49,295
is communication.

1377
01:30:50,095 --> 01:30:51,696
So that's one of the things that we're experimenting

1378
01:30:51,736 --> 01:30:53,158
right now with how to tell that story.

1379
01:30:53,658 --> 01:30:55,559
And so we're using like the memories

1380
01:30:55,639 --> 01:30:57,501
where the characters can react to moments

1381
01:30:57,541 --> 01:31:00,083
that they remembered from a time when they were happy.

1382
01:31:00,523 --> 01:31:02,304
And we're also exploring telling a story

1383
01:31:02,344 --> 01:31:03,886
through these love notes on the puzzles.

1384
01:31:04,286 --> 01:31:05,867
Where one side, where it's a conversation

1385
01:31:05,887 --> 01:31:07,789
that goes back and forth between these two characters.

1386
01:31:08,549 --> 01:31:10,690
And it's not only nice because it helps tell a story,

1387
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:14,411
but it gives a presence to the character who is absent

1388
01:31:14,451 --> 01:31:15,552
in the puzzle as well.

1389
01:31:15,592 --> 01:31:17,052
So they're able to show their support

1390
01:31:17,573 --> 01:31:19,533
as the other characters try to travel across the desk.

1391
01:31:19,553 --> 01:31:23,155
The other cool thing is that we can actually fold

1392
01:31:23,215 --> 01:31:23,895
in any direction.

1393
01:31:24,495 --> 01:31:26,536
So in this puzzle here, we can actually fold diagonally.

1394
01:31:27,376 --> 01:31:29,097
So which will move, when we move on there,

1395
01:31:29,117 --> 01:31:30,637
we'll be able to move up to a higher level.

1396
01:31:30,698 --> 01:31:32,998
So we're in level with that door that's on the other side.

1397
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,001
Alright, so this was pretty happy.

1398
01:31:43,021 --> 01:31:46,804
We all know long distance relations are not always happy.

1399
01:31:47,304 --> 01:31:49,025
So that's another area that we want to explore with our game.

1400
01:31:53,347 --> 01:31:58,268
So there's a lot of times when you're in a long distance relationship and you feel terrible.

1401
01:31:58,388 --> 01:31:59,249
You feel really alone.

1402
01:32:00,549 --> 01:32:03,550
You know, just you feel like the other person isn't always there.

1403
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:05,870
Maybe you're out of sync, maybe you're in a different time zone.

1404
01:32:06,631 --> 01:32:09,351
And there's times where you just need them and they're just not around.

1405
01:32:10,092 --> 01:32:13,332
And so sometimes you know, you message them, you don't hear back right away

1406
01:32:13,352 --> 01:32:14,873
because either they're busy or they're sleeping.

1407
01:32:15,853 --> 01:32:19,794
And you just wish that there was a way to be with them and you just can't be.

1408
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:26,271
And that's it!

1409
01:32:26,311 --> 01:32:27,272
Thank you for watching!

1410
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:30,174
I hope that this video will help you!

1411
01:32:30,475 --> 01:32:32,956
If you have any questions, please leave a comment!

1412
01:32:33,157 --> 01:32:35,879
And don't forget to subscribe!

1413
01:32:35,899 --> 01:32:37,420
See you in the next video!

1414
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:37,720
Bye!

1415
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:42,951
So that's a little bit of an overview of our folding mechanics.

1416
01:32:42,991 --> 01:32:47,354
So what we're working on now is kind of iterating on our art style and our story.

1417
01:32:47,694 --> 01:32:51,857
And even in the gameplay, we really want to push this idea of paper folding and the world

1418
01:32:51,877 --> 01:32:56,761
being made out of paper, including things like environmental effects or, you know, ripping

1419
01:32:56,821 --> 01:33:00,744
and tearing and things like that, which we feel will kind of help emphasize this idea

1420
01:33:00,764 --> 01:33:03,006
of traveling through a world made out of paper.

1421
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,522
So one thing that we're really interested in is hearing from other people who have been in long distance relationships

1422
01:33:29,582 --> 01:33:34,523
because it's always a unique story and there's always different emotions that everyone goes through.

1423
01:33:35,143 --> 01:33:39,984
And so one thing is we really like hearing from other people so absolutely if you want to talk to us after,

1424
01:33:40,424 --> 01:33:45,366
tell us about your own story, that's awesome because it always is inspirational to us for things to add into the game.

1425
01:33:46,166 --> 01:33:49,032
So please feel free to contact us, talk to us after the talk.

1426
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,376
Our contact information is up here as well.

1427
01:33:51,857 --> 01:33:53,561
So we're looking forward to hearing from you

1428
01:33:53,801 --> 01:33:55,224
and telling you more about the game.

1429
01:33:55,324 --> 01:33:55,524
Thank you.

1430
01:34:04,618 --> 01:34:08,980
Thank you for reminding us once again why it's so important that the AB staff is so talented.

1431
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:17,804
So next up we do have Hamish Todd talking about virus, the beauty and the beast.

1432
01:34:29,449 --> 01:34:30,490
I don't have any more jokes.

1433
01:34:31,364 --> 01:34:37,847
It's okay, I think I'm ready. All right. Thank you, Robin. Yeah, I'm Hamish. I used to write

1434
01:34:37,887 --> 01:34:44,710
for action button dot net. Anybody remember that website? And this guy in the front row also

1435
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:50,633
did. All right. I also wrote a bunch of articles about game design. My most famous one was

1436
01:34:50,673 --> 01:34:58,557
about Medusa heads in Castlevania. And I made some, oh, brilliant. And I made some games that

1437
01:34:58,597 --> 01:34:59,117
nobody played.

1438
01:35:01,809 --> 01:35:06,693
And actually I sort of left the games industry to go into biology.

1439
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:11,337
This is me at the International Rice Research Institute.

1440
01:35:11,837 --> 01:35:16,601
They cured world hunger once, but the population increased, so nobody noticed.

1441
01:35:18,643 --> 01:35:20,544
Not that there's anything wrong with the population increasing.

1442
01:35:21,765 --> 01:35:25,708
And so we're going to think about some biology.

1443
01:35:26,909 --> 01:35:29,691
So this thing on the left here is polio.

1444
01:35:31,067 --> 01:35:39,171
And on the right is a young man whose life is made worse than it ought to be by polio

1445
01:35:39,671 --> 01:35:41,212
and shorter than it ought to be as well.

1446
01:35:43,213 --> 01:35:48,655
This is Hepatitis B. You probably know it, it infects your liver.

1447
01:35:50,596 --> 01:35:56,439
This is one that you probably don't recognize, it's a Ugandan virus called Rift Valley Fever.

1448
01:35:58,179 --> 01:35:59,160
causes a lot of suffering.

1449
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:03,144
But one thing that you might notice about the viruses

1450
01:36:04,045 --> 01:36:05,706
is that they all have patterns on them

1451
01:36:06,767 --> 01:36:09,390
and there's actually a close connection between those patterns

1452
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,692
that I'm going to illustrate now.

1453
01:36:13,626 --> 01:36:15,727
So, on the left here we've got polio again.

1454
01:36:16,628 --> 01:36:18,849
And on the right here we've got something which

1455
01:36:19,449 --> 01:36:22,151
I'd like you to stare at until you've convinced yourself

1456
01:36:22,191 --> 01:36:23,491
that it looks like polio.

1457
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:30,475
It's a bit abstract, but if I hold it like this, maybe,

1458
01:36:30,735 --> 01:36:32,556
you can maybe see that there's two shapes

1459
01:36:32,616 --> 01:36:34,617
on the front facing us.

1460
01:36:36,278 --> 01:36:37,519
But what do we do with this, though?

1461
01:36:37,839 --> 01:36:41,021
Well, I've got a button here, and I'm gonna open it up.

1462
01:36:43,108 --> 01:36:47,489
Because that lets us sort of see the whole spherical pattern all flattened out in front of us.

1463
01:36:47,509 --> 01:36:49,030
It lets us see the whole pattern at once.

1464
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:56,452
And it also allows us to see that the pattern on polio fits very nicely into this pattern of hexagons.

1465
01:36:58,353 --> 01:36:58,953
But so what?

1466
01:36:59,493 --> 01:37:07,476
Well, if I grab it and increase its size and then wrap it back up again...

1467
01:37:08,657 --> 01:37:14,898
Well now we have a new shape and it just so happens that this shape is precisely the pattern

1468
01:37:14,938 --> 01:37:18,579
of hexagons that you get on Rift Valley Fever.

1469
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:23,721
In fact you can make almost any other virus this way.

1470
01:37:31,005 --> 01:37:33,246
and this is a model used by actual scientists.

1471
01:37:33,286 --> 01:37:35,987
You can make about 60% of all viruses this way,

1472
01:37:36,027 --> 01:37:39,348
and since 90% of all organisms on Earth are viruses,

1473
01:37:40,028 --> 01:37:44,010
pretty much all, like the majority of organisms on Earth

1474
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:46,890
are some variation on this pattern.

1475
01:37:49,151 --> 01:37:52,152
But not all viruses are sort of well-behaved like this.

1476
01:37:52,292 --> 01:37:53,773
These are three viruses that...

1477
01:37:54,728 --> 01:38:00,012
are a bit more weird geometrically and here are the shapes that we use to talk about them

1478
01:38:00,372 --> 01:38:01,332
as biologists.

1479
01:38:03,254 --> 01:38:05,495
I've got a different thing to show you now.

1480
01:38:06,616 --> 01:38:08,417
Well, very similar actually.

1481
01:38:08,897 --> 01:38:10,218
Again we've got a similar sort of shape.

1482
01:38:11,358 --> 01:38:14,100
If we open it out we can see it flattened again.

1483
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:18,163
Now I can grab these, maybe move them a bit.

1484
01:38:18,823 --> 01:38:19,603
Take that one as well.

1485
01:38:21,545 --> 01:38:22,605
Now we've got a different shape.

1486
01:38:23,783 --> 01:38:30,348
And because of the way this thing is set up, that shape could well correspond to some virus that's out there.

1487
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:34,390
Here's a virus from before.

1488
01:38:35,151 --> 01:38:36,612
There's the shape that it corresponds to.

1489
01:38:36,632 --> 01:38:40,154
If I grab this, maybe put that there.

1490
01:38:49,501 --> 01:38:50,742
Ah, it doesn't look right, does it?

1491
01:38:51,562 --> 01:38:52,623
Ah, maybe from that angle.

1492
01:38:54,017 --> 01:38:56,117
Okay, if I had a bit more time...

1493
01:38:57,378 --> 01:38:58,218
Oh, um...

1494
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:02,020
If I put it like that and wrap it up...

1495
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,982
Well, now we have a shape that corresponds to this virus over here.

1496
01:39:07,922 --> 01:39:10,744
That thing kills more than a million people every year.

1497
01:39:11,344 --> 01:39:12,104
That's HIV.

1498
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:15,586
And that's actually one of the best pictures that we have of it.

1499
01:39:15,706 --> 01:39:17,706
It's extremely difficult to get pictures of HIV.

1500
01:39:20,285 --> 01:39:26,306
And now I'll show you the context in which players will see this.

1501
01:39:27,867 --> 01:39:36,049
Zika virus has an extremely peculiar pattern on it, and it's part of a group of viruses that all have subtly related patterns on them.

1502
01:39:36,889 --> 01:39:42,351
They have to be understood using this quite particular model, and you can try it out now.

1503
01:39:53,397 --> 01:39:58,319
Now what you're seeing here may not seem very much like a virus at all, and so we are going

1504
01:39:58,359 --> 01:40:03,761
to take a close look at this particular virus called HPV, a very nasty virus which is known

1505
01:40:03,781 --> 01:40:04,661
to cause cancer.

1506
01:40:05,662 --> 01:40:12,765
So if we take this x-ray of HPV and we increase the contrast on it, then we get a bunch of

1507
01:40:12,965 --> 01:40:20,308
white blobs, and it just so happens that those white blobs tell you exactly where HPV's proteins

1508
01:40:20,508 --> 01:40:20,588
are.

1509
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:26,926
Now proteins are connected together and so we're going to draw lines between those proteins that

1510
01:40:26,946 --> 01:40:33,214
have a connection and this gets us something that can be made in the model. If you feel

1511
01:40:33,254 --> 01:40:37,579
like challenging yourself now you can try constructing HPV.

1512
01:40:50,758 --> 01:40:53,081
And there's a link from the previous guys, by the way,

1513
01:40:53,142 --> 01:40:57,648
the algorithm that's used to wrap up these shapes.

1514
01:40:57,668 --> 01:40:59,912
I actually took it from a bunch of origamists.

1515
01:41:06,677 --> 01:41:08,919
I don't actually do this as my day job.

1516
01:41:08,939 --> 01:41:10,961
I've actually left the games industry, like I say.

1517
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:14,423
So I'm a biologist, really.

1518
01:41:15,624 --> 01:41:18,767
On the left, I'm working on virtual reality lecturing,

1519
01:41:18,987 --> 01:41:20,788
virtual reality, molecular fitting.

1520
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:26,052
And it's really exciting to be working with the new hardware.

1521
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:31,176
Virtual reality, it's not what a lot of people say it is.

1522
01:41:31,917 --> 01:41:33,178
But it's pretty cool.

1523
01:41:35,369 --> 01:41:42,153
but as I'm getting used to the new hardware, I'm acutely aware that there are so many things

1524
01:41:42,774 --> 01:41:46,536
that are possible with the old hardware that we never even touched.

1525
01:41:48,117 --> 01:41:48,457
Thank you.

1526
01:41:59,925 --> 01:42:00,665
Thank you, Hamish.

1527
01:42:01,502 --> 01:42:05,466
So it's very interesting, the idea of experimental games being used in education,

1528
01:42:05,526 --> 01:42:09,510
and as education can become more and more accessible through virtual reality

1529
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:13,194
and ways of the internets, maybe we can actually start

1530
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:15,876
sort of finding the viruses before they find us.

1531
01:42:17,758 --> 01:42:21,622
So last up, we have John to talk about

1532
01:42:21,642 --> 01:42:24,325
the Alt Control Showcase.

1533
01:42:26,026 --> 01:42:26,367
Are you ready?

1534
01:42:29,842 --> 01:42:32,043
Please come up to stage, alt controllers.

1535
01:42:32,844 --> 01:42:34,445
Wait, you're not controllers, you're people.

1536
01:42:35,446 --> 01:42:35,706
What?

1537
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:41,311
Saying not responding right now.

1538
01:42:41,331 --> 01:42:46,775
I don't know what's happening.

1539
01:42:50,274 --> 01:42:51,715
Awesome, thanks for your patience.

1540
01:42:52,075 --> 01:42:52,595
Hello everyone.

1541
01:42:53,555 --> 01:42:56,356
The Alternative Controller Exhibit, Alt Control GDC,

1542
01:42:56,896 --> 01:42:58,497
doubled its boot space this year

1543
01:42:58,557 --> 01:43:00,998
and gave away its first award Wednesday night,

1544
01:43:01,458 --> 01:43:04,059
providing a huge, well-deserved visibility bump

1545
01:43:04,179 --> 01:43:06,300
to the dozens of teams crafting unique,

1546
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,921
tangible, and unforgettable experiences.

1547
01:43:09,761 --> 01:43:12,062
The exhibit thrives, thanks in large part,

1548
01:43:12,162 --> 01:43:14,203
to your amazingly positive feedback,

1549
01:43:14,343 --> 01:43:16,483
so I want to say thank you so much for your support.

1550
01:43:18,425 --> 01:43:23,068
The exhibit is the brainchild of Simon Carlis, EVP of GDC and Gamasutra,

1551
01:43:23,188 --> 01:43:25,750
and myself, John Polson, your friendly neighborhood,

1552
01:43:26,231 --> 01:43:27,552
humble bundle publishing lead.

1553
01:43:28,973 --> 01:43:32,375
I took my somewhat unhealthy obsession for Konami music controllers

1554
01:43:32,455 --> 01:43:33,796
and countless other peripherals,

1555
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:37,039
and my love for showcasing and organizing awesome devs,

1556
01:43:37,319 --> 01:43:39,300
as I've done for MineCon and The Mix,

1557
01:43:39,901 --> 01:43:42,643
and channeled those passions into finding and showcasing

1558
01:43:42,683 --> 01:43:45,925
the most alternative of controllers for the past four years at GDC,

1559
01:43:46,506 --> 01:43:48,007
bringing us to the showcase today.

1560
01:43:49,762 --> 01:43:53,065
We spend a lot of time talking about how games touch people.

1561
01:43:53,445 --> 01:43:57,168
I'm thankful we get to celebrate here the converse, how people touch games.

1562
01:43:58,249 --> 01:44:00,491
Studies say touch is the first sense to develop.

1563
01:44:01,132 --> 01:44:05,176
My own study says that when I first touch and learn new controllers, I develop some

1564
01:44:05,216 --> 01:44:08,819
of my strongest memories coupled with extraordinary sensations.

1565
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:13,583
Learning new controls often becomes a mentally gratifying game by itself.

1566
01:44:15,155 --> 01:44:17,796
Sometimes we can create really different ways to touch games,

1567
01:44:17,956 --> 01:44:20,617
and this brings hundreds of millions of new people to play.

1568
01:44:21,577 --> 01:44:23,277
Experiments to change how we play

1569
01:44:23,317 --> 01:44:25,798
do not always happen in the halls of huge companies, though.

1570
01:44:26,358 --> 01:44:28,339
Sometimes all it takes is a tiny team.

1571
01:44:28,999 --> 01:44:30,639
Here are five such teams featured

1572
01:44:30,679 --> 01:44:33,300
at the All Control GDC 2017 exhibit,

1573
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:35,561
handpicked by the EGW committee.

1574
01:44:44,622 --> 01:44:45,202
Hello everybody.

1575
01:44:45,222 --> 01:44:48,824
Yes, of course.

1576
01:44:48,964 --> 01:44:51,045
Hi everybody, my name is Jonas Buchatsch.

1577
01:44:51,265 --> 01:44:56,288
I'm a media artist and creative technologist from Vienna, Austria.

1578
01:44:56,788 --> 01:45:00,630
I'm here to present the project called VinylOS.

1579
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:02,090
It's a joint...

1580
01:45:03,191 --> 01:45:06,532
project collaboration I did together with Josef Hu,

1581
01:45:07,212 --> 01:45:09,573
who is probably currently wrapping it up

1582
01:45:09,753 --> 01:45:11,873
at the OutControl GDC booth.

1583
01:45:14,334 --> 01:45:15,454
Let me just check my notes.

1584
01:45:16,114 --> 01:45:18,955
Yeah, it's a project we developed over the last year

1585
01:45:18,995 --> 01:45:19,635
in our free time,

1586
01:45:21,056 --> 01:45:25,517
and we're calling it an alternative controller device

1587
01:45:25,757 --> 01:45:27,618
art turntable console.

1588
01:45:30,923 --> 01:45:34,105
If you wonder what device art is, you might want to check it out.

1589
01:45:34,766 --> 01:45:35,446
You might like it.

1590
01:45:35,527 --> 01:45:39,069
It's a pretty cool Japanese media art thingy.

1591
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:42,512
But we're here to talk about VinylOS.

1592
01:45:42,572 --> 01:45:49,478
VinylOS enables you to play games, video games, on turntables.

1593
01:45:50,771 --> 01:45:58,513
And this works by firstly, we are projecting onto the white record.

1594
01:45:59,113 --> 01:46:00,573
So, we are using the record as a screen.

1595
01:46:02,554 --> 01:46:10,395
And secondly, there is an audio track, a timecode, audio signal actually on the record.

1596
01:46:10,776 --> 01:46:15,857
And as you toy with the record, as you play it back, as you spin it or scratch it,

1597
01:46:16,457 --> 01:46:19,698
this audio gets played back and it gets played into the computer.

1598
01:46:20,838 --> 01:46:29,761
and the computer listens to the signal and therefore it can tell the speed the record is turning and the direction.

1599
01:46:30,281 --> 01:46:38,544
It's a system actually used for digital DJs to control MP3s, for DJs who use digital systems, whatever.

1600
01:46:40,165 --> 01:46:47,067
So, yeah, that's the two kind of things needed to make this work.

1601
01:46:48,707 --> 01:46:50,890
Can we have the videos play actually?

1602
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:52,993
Yeah, we're trying to do that.

1603
01:46:53,013 --> 01:46:56,998
Seems to be a technical difficulty.

1604
01:46:57,299 --> 01:46:59,882
So far we developed two games for this setup.

1605
01:47:02,065 --> 01:47:03,146
One is a circular shooter.

1606
01:47:04,607 --> 01:47:09,650
So you turn the record and you scratch the record,

1607
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:12,032
like you make a scratch move like a DJ,

1608
01:47:12,212 --> 01:47:14,514
and you scratch to shoot your enemies.

1609
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:21,820
And the second one is a kind of defend your base like game

1610
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:23,441
where you swing a pendulum

1611
01:47:24,281 --> 01:47:27,384
and have to kick out objects of the record,

1612
01:47:27,784 --> 01:47:32,047
virtual objects of the record to survive kind of.

1613
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:36,741
Who has actually seen it? Who has played it? Who knows what I'm talking about?

1614
01:47:36,762 --> 01:47:38,943
Okay, cool. Wow, that many people.

1615
01:47:39,544 --> 01:47:43,227
Great, yeah, I can't show you anything anymore, I guess.

1616
01:47:44,308 --> 01:47:45,789
Okay. So, thank you.

1617
01:47:53,102 --> 01:47:59,025
Alrighty, hi everybody, I'm Taylor. I'm up from DigiPen Institute of Technology, which is up in

1618
01:47:59,065 --> 01:48:06,868
Washington State, up in the Redmond area. I'm part of Team PsyLite, the 16 plus team that has

1619
01:48:07,909 --> 01:48:08,509
built this

1620
01:48:10,524 --> 01:48:17,252
project Sandgarden. Up there is a picture of most of the team, just to give you an idea of the

1621
01:48:17,392 --> 01:48:22,898
kind of scale of everyone involved with this project, and also the initial prototype of our

1622
01:48:23,719 --> 01:48:27,584
sandbox. So to give you an idea of what the game actually is,

1623
01:48:29,522 --> 01:48:34,043
Sandgarden is a game where the idea was to make a game entirely out of a box of sand.

1624
01:48:34,124 --> 01:48:36,404
So the only controller is that box of sand.

1625
01:48:36,504 --> 01:48:42,007
And more than that, we just wanted it to be an actual game with objectives.

1626
01:48:43,627 --> 01:48:49,150
So how the game works is we take a Kinect that's mounted above the box of sand, we take

1627
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:54,652
the height map from that, we crop it and do a little bit of post-processing, and then

1628
01:48:54,732 --> 01:48:57,533
we plug that directly into Unity's terrain component.

1629
01:48:58,874 --> 01:49:04,216
From there, the actual gameplay is we spot a bunch of houses on the map, and then each

1630
01:49:04,296 --> 01:49:05,416
one wants to beat a specific height.

1631
01:49:07,017 --> 01:49:12,739
Some of the more interesting things about the actual design of the game were that trying

1632
01:49:12,759 --> 01:49:17,321
to break down the space of a sandbox into just simple actions.

1633
01:49:18,161 --> 01:49:22,643
So we tried to center the entire game around building hills and making holes in the sand.

1634
01:49:24,203 --> 01:49:26,524
That way we could communicate to the player.

1635
01:49:28,587 --> 01:49:31,049
how to interact with our controller in the most easy way.

1636
01:49:32,009 --> 01:49:34,951
And from there, we built our entire game.

1637
01:49:35,471 --> 01:49:36,372
Thank you very much for your time.

1638
01:49:48,598 --> 01:49:55,022
Hello, my name is Anders Karlsson, and I live on an island in Sweden where I study game

1639
01:49:55,042 --> 01:49:55,422
design.

1640
01:49:57,055 --> 01:50:02,200
Every year there is a project called Theme Park there where the first year we'll make a game

1641
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:08,586
with an unconventional controller. It could be controlled by anything from a pair of

1642
01:50:08,626 --> 01:50:19,756
backpacks to a bookshelf. So I got together with my amazing team and we made a game that we

1643
01:50:19,816 --> 01:50:21,918
like to call Zombie Crawler. And...

1644
01:50:24,046 --> 01:50:26,449
There's supposed to be a video showcasing it.

1645
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:26,970
Yep.

1646
01:50:28,552 --> 01:50:31,756
Sorry about that.

1647
01:50:31,816 --> 01:50:32,437
I didn't, too.

1648
01:50:32,537 --> 01:50:32,878
OK.

1649
01:50:32,938 --> 01:50:33,238
Yeah.

1650
01:50:33,519 --> 01:50:34,980
That's more than her.

1651
01:50:37,864 --> 01:50:38,846
Oh, our video plays.

1652
01:50:52,368 --> 01:50:57,070
I'm disappointed. Are you satisfied with your performance? You just have to try a little bit more.

1653
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:57,130
Oh.

1654
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:03,272
You just ruined my day. I hope you feel good about yourself.

1655
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:19,731
Hi, I'm Yu Meng, an undergrad from Design Technology Program

1656
01:51:19,831 --> 01:51:21,012
at Parsons School of Design.

1657
01:51:21,632 --> 01:51:25,553
My teammates Jane, Charles, Chuck, Max, Magnus,

1658
01:51:25,653 --> 01:51:27,154
and I created Victor the Loser.

1659
01:51:27,834 --> 01:51:30,715
And seemingly an old school intelligence test machine,

1660
01:51:31,235 --> 01:51:33,956
Victor reveals its true colors when it feels threatened

1661
01:51:34,016 --> 01:51:35,556
by the player's imminent victory

1662
01:51:35,997 --> 01:51:38,197
and tries to sabotage the player's progress

1663
01:51:38,337 --> 01:51:39,518
and mock their destined failure.

1664
01:51:40,523 --> 01:51:43,486
So we don't have that much experience making games,

1665
01:51:43,546 --> 01:51:45,407
and we just came together to this course

1666
01:51:45,447 --> 01:51:46,889
called The New Arcade at our school.

1667
01:51:47,669 --> 01:51:49,671
And we started out thinking about

1668
01:51:49,911 --> 01:51:51,793
different kinds of people who play games.

1669
01:51:52,333 --> 01:51:53,694
And one of the things we landed on

1670
01:51:53,734 --> 01:51:55,496
was this idea of a bad loser,

1671
01:51:56,296 --> 01:51:58,138
someone who really wants to play with you,

1672
01:51:58,518 --> 01:52:01,460
but start to get a little upset when they start to lose.

1673
01:52:02,121 --> 01:52:04,603
And sometimes you just have to let them win a little bit

1674
01:52:04,683 --> 01:52:05,984
in order to prevent the drama.

1675
01:52:09,515 --> 01:52:11,176
So what are you really trying to accomplish

1676
01:52:11,216 --> 01:52:12,277
while playing with Victor?

1677
01:52:12,297 --> 01:52:15,599
Our game attempts to redefine what it means to win,

1678
01:52:15,619 --> 01:52:18,401
and especially because Victor only cheats

1679
01:52:18,462 --> 01:52:19,162
when you are winning.

1680
01:52:19,843 --> 01:52:24,046
It puts an emphasis on being okay at playing a game,

1681
01:52:24,066 --> 01:52:27,048
and Victor provides an alternative experience

1682
01:52:27,108 --> 01:52:29,870
focused on the journey rather than the results,

1683
01:52:30,431 --> 01:52:32,172
a journey that is unexpected

1684
01:52:32,332 --> 01:52:34,674
and kind of becomes a negotiation.

1685
01:52:35,894 --> 01:52:39,042
And actually this game also combined two of my biggest fears.

1686
01:52:39,483 --> 01:52:44,435
One is the intelligence test that I had to do a lot of them when I was...

1687
01:52:45,674 --> 01:52:48,657
younger and the other one is that I

1688
01:52:49,838 --> 01:52:51,960
I'm really bad at playing games in front of other people

1689
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:58,045
So this game gave me making this game give me that message that being feeling bad about yourself

1690
01:52:58,325 --> 01:53:02,029
Actually is okay, and it can be fun and

1691
01:53:02,869 --> 01:53:09,235
In the end we would like to thank our teachers Brian and Henry and if you haven't played with Victor yet stop by the all-control

1692
01:53:09,255 --> 01:53:09,715
section

1693
01:53:10,436 --> 01:53:13,338
In the afternoon and see how Victor can ruin the rest of the day

1694
01:53:23,448 --> 01:53:28,511
Hi, my name is Martin Sebastian Guayn. I come from Argentina. I'm really glad being here.

1695
01:53:30,251 --> 01:53:35,114
Well, they asked me to do this presentation like a couple of days before GDC, so you'll have to

1696
01:53:35,174 --> 01:53:43,038
excuse my artwork. So let me introduce to you the making of Doggy Dog of War. It's a game about

1697
01:53:43,698 --> 01:53:48,721
pulling string and playing against a dog. Some of you might have played it. So...

1698
01:53:49,904 --> 01:53:52,785
Yeah, well, I'll tell you the story, right?

1699
01:53:53,365 --> 01:53:54,645
Because I'll skip the video.

1700
01:53:56,086 --> 01:53:58,086
Well, I was walking down the street, right?

1701
01:53:58,526 --> 01:53:59,367
That's me on the left.

1702
01:54:00,967 --> 01:54:03,047
And I found a printer on the sidewalk, right?

1703
01:54:03,828 --> 01:54:05,308
So, I took it.

1704
01:54:07,349 --> 01:54:09,049
It was like in this state, sort of.

1705
01:54:09,069 --> 01:54:10,469
Yeah.

1706
01:54:14,650 --> 01:54:17,690
So I remember I had this idea like for an art game.

1707
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:20,671
Like it's, imagine this, it's a boat

1708
01:54:20,811 --> 01:54:23,352
with a crystal glass on it and it's a rope to the dock.

1709
01:54:24,152 --> 01:54:26,192
So if you pull, it's a metaphor

1710
01:54:26,272 --> 01:54:27,433
for human relationships, right?

1711
01:54:27,533 --> 01:54:29,833
So if you pull too hard, the glass will fall and break.

1712
01:54:30,713 --> 01:54:32,934
But if you like just leave it, it would drift away.

1713
01:54:33,894 --> 01:54:35,254
That was the original concept, right?

1714
01:54:35,595 --> 01:54:37,355
So I started messing up, messing around

1715
01:54:37,375 --> 01:54:41,916
with all the printer and with Arduino and all that.

1716
01:54:43,036 --> 01:54:43,716
And well.

1717
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:50,333
Finally, I said, instead of just seeing numbers on the screen, why don't put a video and synchronize with it?

1718
01:54:52,354 --> 01:54:57,877
And I looked at gify.com to find a video and took it.

1719
01:54:57,897 --> 01:55:02,860
And for all the rest of the programming parts, I mean, it's magic. I'm not going to explain it. It just happens.

1720
01:55:04,962 --> 01:55:07,623
And finally, the result was this game.

1721
01:55:09,884 --> 01:55:11,305
You know, you pull against the duck.

1722
01:55:12,922 --> 01:55:16,563
And well, I'll skip the videos, so thank you for listening.

1723
01:55:16,903 --> 01:55:21,185
And thanks a lot to John Paulson for organizing this

1724
01:55:21,285 --> 01:55:23,566
and for email, for answering all my emails.

1725
01:55:24,067 --> 01:55:25,947
And Adrian Nobel for standing in the booth with me.

1726
01:55:26,228 --> 01:55:26,608
Thanks.

1727
01:55:27,908 --> 01:55:31,170
We're gonna try to run the zombie crawler video real quick.

1728
01:55:34,111 --> 01:55:34,571
Sorry.

1729
01:55:35,352 --> 01:55:36,172
Mind the rewind.

1730
01:55:36,432 --> 01:55:40,574
Except I don't know what this big black bar is doing here.

1731
01:55:41,394 --> 01:55:42,175
Let's just cut that out.

1732
01:55:47,132 --> 01:55:55,656
So basically the game is two wooden frames on top of each other with a sort of treadmill

1733
01:55:56,256 --> 01:56:02,859
on so it's made to simulate you crawling through a corridor as a zombie.

1734
01:56:18,664 --> 01:56:26,032
Yes, and in the way there is furniture in your way that you have to smash with the two buttons that is on the sides of the controller.

1735
01:56:26,092 --> 01:56:29,817
Yes, it's like BAM! You smash the furniture.

1736
01:56:30,578 --> 01:56:30,898
BAM!

1737
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:37,366
And the goal of the game is to get to the end, so you can...

1738
01:56:39,153 --> 01:56:48,059
Yes, that will shoot at you and you will have to tilt the entire controller from right to left to avoid the incoming barrage of bullets.

1739
01:56:48,079 --> 01:56:50,961
Like this, it tilts along this axis.

1740
01:56:52,021 --> 01:56:53,542
So I tilt...

1741
01:56:53,862 --> 01:57:01,127
So the goal will be to get up to this person and then just go nuts and just claw their eyes out.

1742
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:07,231
And that's basically the game.

1743
01:57:19,042 --> 01:57:20,223
Wow, that was intense.

1744
01:57:20,824 --> 01:57:22,605
Someone just clawed my eyes out in front

1745
01:57:22,625 --> 01:57:24,387
of the entire EGW folks.

1746
01:57:25,408 --> 01:57:27,089
Well, OK, so thank you.

1747
01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:28,230
Thank you.

1748
01:57:33,275 --> 01:57:33,975
Did I get the front mic?

1749
01:57:36,137 --> 01:57:37,859
Yeah, that was intense.

1750
01:57:38,779 --> 01:57:40,701
So there's always one presentation every year

1751
01:57:40,801 --> 01:57:41,582
that doesn't quite work out.

1752
01:57:41,822 --> 01:57:43,303
But it isn't because we don't love games,

1753
01:57:43,363 --> 01:57:44,464
and it isn't because we didn't try.

1754
01:57:44,484 --> 01:57:46,126
It's just because sometimes things don't work out

1755
01:57:46,166 --> 01:57:46,886
the way you expect them to.

1756
01:57:48,041 --> 01:57:54,286
So let's have a loud round of applause for everyone who presented and let's have all the presenters come up on stage.

1757
01:58:02,413 --> 01:58:07,196
And all the staff that helped out, if you were a judge and you're in the room, please come up on stage.

1758
01:58:07,937 --> 01:58:09,758
If you helped set up, please come up on stage.

1759
01:58:10,619 --> 01:58:14,302
If you helped act out a game, please come up on stage.

1760
01:58:15,642 --> 01:58:18,004
If you donated food, please come up on stage.

1761
01:58:18,985 --> 01:58:21,827
If you loved Roger Hanna, please come up on stage.

1762
01:58:23,168 --> 01:58:24,709
I'm not lying, seriously.

1763
01:58:24,729 --> 01:58:27,451
If you're a friend or a close loved one,

1764
01:58:27,491 --> 01:58:28,351
someone who worked with him,

1765
01:58:28,472 --> 01:58:30,313
anyone who had a chance to work with Roger,

1766
01:58:30,793 --> 01:58:31,794
please come up on stage.

1767
01:58:42,084 --> 01:58:43,985
Indie games is a community.

1768
01:58:44,145 --> 01:58:45,806
We're strong because we love each other.

1769
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:57,153
Our heart is so huge for all of you.

1770
01:58:57,173 --> 01:58:59,114
It's like gigantic.

1771
01:59:01,276 --> 01:59:03,537
There are games up here, please come up and play the games.

1772
01:59:03,937 --> 01:59:05,178
Please come and tell us that you love us

1773
01:59:05,258 --> 01:59:06,339
and please come give me a hug.

1774
01:59:06,479 --> 01:59:07,640
I love you, we'll see you next year.
