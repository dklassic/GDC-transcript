1
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:06,794
All right, hi, everybody.

2
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:08,355
My name is Bennett Foddy.

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,896
I'm a philosopher at Oxford University,

4
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:15,818
and I also make games at Foddy.net and on iOS.

5
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,159
And I'm going to be talking a little bit

6
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,021
about the relationship between games and real sports.

7
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,883
Video games are played in a simulated world

8
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:30,785
with arbitrary rules for imaginary points.

9
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:33,586
Players aren't harmed when they die.

10
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:36,541
And for the most part, they don't have any money on the line.

11
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:41,486
So I think the most fundamental of all design challenges

12
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:44,829
is to make the events in the video game world matter to the player.

13
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:50,575
In particular, the player needs to care about how they play the game.

14
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:53,579
If there's no need to play the game well,

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,102
the player's actions become lazy and then routine.

16
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:00,289
And at some point, the only thing that's keeping them playing

17
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,991
is a story that they're passively consuming,

18
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,993
or the art, or the Xbox achievement points.

19
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:10,415
A game where player performance doesn't matter

20
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:11,816
might still be enjoyable,

21
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:13,877
but it's ultimately disposable.

22
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:15,999
You know, it's a simulation of a simulation.

23
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,460
It's like a movie where you have to wiggle a thumbstick

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,841
in order to keep the projector running.

25
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:25,584
This is what players do to get the frequent flyer achievement

26
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,725
in Superman Returns.

27
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:31,073
They're so disengaged that they're not even looking at the screen,

28
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:32,935
not even touching the controller anymore.

29
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:39,499
I think as designers, if we can get players to care about the outcome of our games,

30
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:44,722
they'll be more engaged, more focused, and the games will ultimately be more meaningful to them.

31
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:49,225
But it's a pretty hard problem, since the events in a video game are ultimately,

32
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:52,286
they don't matter at all in any kind of practical sense.

33
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,739
So what I want to talk about is how this problem is addressed

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,904
in the world of real non-digital sports.

35
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:06,985
Now real world competitive sports, you have to say, I mean, first of all, they're not

36
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,566
designed usually in the same way that video games are.

37
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:13,668
They evolve as a set of shared social or cultural practices.

38
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:19,291
So American football, we think, evolved from the ancient Greek game Episkeros, which is

39
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:24,233
pictured here, which in turn surely evolved from an even more ancient game, probably involving

40
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,775
throwing rocks at other people in order to hurt them.

41
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,838
But if you were designing a new sport, like when Frisbee golf was designed,

42
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,800
you'd face the same basic design challenges that we face when we make video games.

43
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:40,983
Like games, sports are basically enjoyable or fun activities,

44
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:46,287
but the outcomes in any sporting activity are fundamentally pretty pointless and arbitrary.

45
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,829
You might play a sport for enjoyment,

46
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:53,672
but there's no inherent reason why you should care about who wins, who loses,

47
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:55,273
and how people played the game.

48
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:02,591
Despite that, sports have been far more successful at video games at making their performances

49
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,553
and their results matter, both to the players and the spectators.

50
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:09,715
Football and basketball stadiums routinely filled to capacity.

51
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:13,077
More than a billion people watch the Olympics every four years.

52
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:18,520
Athletes are prepared to sacrifice everything to attain the highest possible performance.

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,803
They train day in, day out, suffering painful and even disfiguring stress injuries.

54
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:27,225
They collapse at the finish line, crying or fainted.

55
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,949
They take life-threatening doses of performance-enhancing drugs,

56
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,132
even in sports where the financial rewards are tiny, like in the Olympic racewalk.

57
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:41,817
Think of Liu Xiang and his crippled hop to the finish line in last year's Olympic hurdles.

58
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:46,020
Now that kind of commitment would be ridiculous in a video game player,

59
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:50,844
even though video games basically are no more silly, no more pointless than real sports.

60
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:59,215
Of course, part of the reason why athletes care so much about their sports is that there's a huge amount of money and fame on the line, you know.

61
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:02,917
And part of it is that sports, of course, are just older than video games.

62
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,799
I guess if we play Street Fighter continuously for over a hundred years,

63
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,602
and give people a million dollars when they win at Evo, people probably care about it a lot more. That's true.

64
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,871
But those can't be the only reasons why people care more about sports.

65
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:22,114
You know, basketball was shown at the Olympics just 13 years after it was invented.

66
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:25,736
The Street Fighter, for comparison, is now 20 years old.

67
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:31,339
Even in sports with relatively small audiences and no prize money, like Little League Baseball,

68
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,422
people care much more about the outcome than they do in the case of video games.

69
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:39,164
You almost never hear of people taking a game as seriously as this,

70
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:44,087
even though sports are fundamentally just as inessential and arbitrary as video games.

71
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:49,486
No competitive video game fills a big stadium or is televised on a major network.

72
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:54,731
There's no bans of violent Starcraft hooligans, no Halo player trading cards.

73
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:57,194
There's no back page column in the local paper.

74
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:01,037
This is how Evo looks, the biggest tournament for Street Fighter.

75
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:05,181
Note that pretty much everyone in the audience here is also a competitor and not just a fan.

76
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,010
And that's how the Super Bowl looks.

77
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,432
So clearly, real world sports are doing something right

78
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,132
that video games aren't managing to do.

79
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:16,433
And I think as designers, we can take a lot of inspiration

80
00:05:16,494 --> 00:05:17,554
from what sports are doing.

81
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:18,894
So that's what this talk's about.

82
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:20,915
I'm going to talk about a few of the things that we can do.

83
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:27,656
I should acknowledge up front that we already have things that we call eSports, I think,

84
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:28,276
legitimately.

85
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:32,478
I take it that a genuine eSport really only differs from a non-digital sport in that it

86
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:33,959
involves a computer.

87
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,159
It has a lot going right for it.

88
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:38,921
So what makes sports, or eSports, different from games?

89
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:44,543
I think that part of the answer is that all sports, including eSports, are heavily steeped

90
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:45,704
in performance.

91
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:47,085
Two senses of the word.

92
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:53,525
In sports, there's a big difference between knowing what to do and being able to do it.

93
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:57,668
You have to perform your moves in a way that's not trivial to do.

94
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:00,811
It's not easy to reproduce the same movements twice in a row.

95
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:04,674
And that's one of the things that makes Street Fighter a viable sport,

96
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:06,115
while a game like chess isn't.

97
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:09,798
You know, performance in the sense of high performance, or performance enhancement.

98
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:16,605
But the second dimension of performance is that sports, unlike many games, are performative.

99
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:20,628
Your actions within a sport convey meaning to the audience.

100
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:24,991
Sometimes they convey some of your character, your personality, or your feelings to the

101
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,012
people who are watching you.

102
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:31,836
And the presence of the audience, in turn, imparts meaning on your sporting performance

103
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:35,378
and it makes it matter more, both to you and to the audience.

104
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:39,219
Here's a simple way of looking at it.

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,005
Usain Bolt probably broke the world record for the 100 meter sprint dozens of times in

106
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:50,749
training, even in competition against his friends and his teammates on the Jamaican

107
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:51,270
track team.

108
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:57,055
But it doesn't count, and it doesn't matter, and in some sense it's not even really a sport

109
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:58,436
until the grandstand is full.

110
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:01,980
That's when it goes from being training to being a sport.

111
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:09,288
When you play FIFA over an internet connection with nobody watching except you and your opponent,

112
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:14,732
it's nothing like a sport. So it's not as though only sports-themed games automatically

113
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:19,755
get to be eSports. You have to directly support it in your design. Here's one that does. I

114
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:24,498
think Counter-Strike is more like a sport because even though you play it alone in your

115
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:28,861
bedroom over the internet, it's set up so that the people who lose when you die

116
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,480
You form part of a peanut gallery that's forced to watch the surviving players compete for the win.

117
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,100
Right, so the win matters more in Counter-Strike

118
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:42,862
because your teammates and your vanquished enemies are watching and cheering and booing.

119
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:46,523
But, you know, I think they could make it matter even more if they altered it

120
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:52,744
so that the players could see or hear the cheers and boos of the ghosts looking on.

121
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:59,097
And not many people know about this, but in I Want to Be the Guy Gaiden,

122
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:00,717
which is a single-player game,

123
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:04,318
the developer, Michael O'Reilly, has the ability to

124
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,740
visit your game, drop in without you knowing at first, give you hints,

125
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,821
even manipulate variables to make it harder or easier for you to kind of

126
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:13,341
mess with you.

127
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:16,774
Right, so the point I'm trying to make here is this.

128
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:20,335
If you make sure your game has a physical performance aspect,

129
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:22,476
like Street Fighter, even if only in the thumbs,

130
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,898
and if you make it so that it's played in front of some kind of audience,

131
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:28,939
then you can pretty much guarantee that the outcome of the match

132
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,800
will matter more to the players and to the onlookers.

133
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,021
And that's part of what I think it means for something to be a sport,

134
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,742
to perform in front of others,

135
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:39,483
to be watched, cheered, booed.

136
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,035
Human rituals in general, whether you think of weddings, funerals, executions or football matches,

137
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,378
don't mean much unless you have participants and witnesses.

138
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,679
And the same is true of video games.

139
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,001
You can make your game matter just by designing it to be performed

140
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:58,185
in front of a simulated crowd, if you like, in front of a single human being, as in this case.

141
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,468
Or you can build your game out from the ground up

142
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,570
so that it's designed to be watched by a crowd, played at a party.

143
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,781
Design your game so that it gives the spectator something to watch for, right?

144
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:14,125
So you also have to be aware that anything that happens between the player's thumb and the gamepad

145
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,006
is probably invisible to anybody watching.

146
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,547
So this is why joust works well.

147
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,188
All of the motions are out there for everybody to see.

148
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,732
Some of the ways that sports make themselves matter to the players

149
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:29,314
come out of that public performative aspect.

150
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:36,279
So for example, one crucial aspect that is basically missing from games next to sports is drama, right?

151
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:44,584
This focus on human suffering, frustration, striving, that's absolutely core to the spectatorship experience in sport.

152
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,706
Sports are dramatic because the stakes are higher.

153
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:52,149
And of course you get higher stakes for free when there's spectators, right?

154
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:56,212
Spectators make you embarrassed if you play badly, or proud if you play well.

155
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:03,784
But sports are also often explicitly designed to bring out emotional and physical suffering

156
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:06,486
to the maximum allowable degree, right?

157
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:13,789
So in the race walk at the Olympics or in the Tour de France, it pushes the human body

158
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:16,371
to the absolute limits of physical endurance.

159
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:22,709
is structured in such a way that it puts one solitary awayside batter

160
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,692
in the path of nine guys who oppose him

161
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:29,474
and tens of thousands of local fans in the bleachers

162
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:31,436
who hate him and want him to die.

163
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,518
And I think there's a kind of pressure that comes out of that.

164
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:37,881
Something really interesting can happen under that kind of pressure.

165
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:42,470
Athletes puke, athletes cry, athletes spit the dummy.

166
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,873
And it generates feelings of drama and emotional investment

167
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,995
in the players and in the fans and in the press,

168
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:51,678
making sports matter in a way that video games usually don't.

169
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,262
And video games do their best to undermine

170
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:58,404
the sense of occasion and the sense of drama

171
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,986
that's present in every big sporting performance.

172
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,269
You quick load, you make a little bit of progress,

173
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,390
and then you quick save.

174
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:09,687
The player erases every mistake and they keep every lucky break.

175
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:14,730
And I think this is one of the worst and most pervasive failures of game design.

176
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:20,692
Even in games where there's no quick save, we design them systematically so that they avoid,

177
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:24,094
that we avoid the chance that someone will be frustrated or humiliated,

178
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:30,397
and thereby we also avoid the chance that someone will feel really seriously proud or accomplished.

179
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:37,122
But we can easily reverse that. We raise the pressure on players by drawing inspiration

180
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:39,443
from things that lend drama to real-world sports, right?

181
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:44,808
So one example is, it's embarrassing to screw up in a real sport because the crowd is watching

182
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:49,872
your every move, right? And parlor games, like pool, especially those

183
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,915
that aren't played with an audience, are more like video games than sports in this sense,

184
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:56,157
right? Because the audience is very small or non-existent.

185
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,482
But with parlor games, we've found some ways to compensate

186
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:03,824
for the lack of the audience, the lack of public shaming.

187
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:07,587
In Australia, the tradition is that if you lose a game of pool

188
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:09,588
without getting a single ball in a pocket,

189
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:13,691
you have to pull your pants down and go once around the table.

190
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,433
Go, dude!

191
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:26,932
With that on the line, I think then your performance matters a lot, right?

192
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:30,393
In a video game, you could roll out a ready-made crowd using Twitter

193
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:34,415
by auto-tweeting the poor performance of the player to publicly embarrass them.

194
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:40,557
You can design your games with controls that are designed to be physically exhausting,

195
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,297
like our game MegaGurp.

196
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:47,319
In this case, you have to play efficiently or else you'll get, like, a very painful leg cramp.

197
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:54,457
But maybe the most effective way to raise the stakes in a video game is to take the most basic thing

198
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,098
that makes the results of sporting events matter, right?

199
00:12:57,138 --> 00:13:00,239
There is no do-overs in competitive sport.

200
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:06,040
You can create a sense of occasion by designing levels that can only be played once, or only once a day.

201
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,961
Or you could let the players play any time, but only challenge for the leaderboard once every four years, like in the Olympics.

202
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:17,282
Maybe that all sounds a little bit too radical.

203
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,663
I want to say that you can also raise the stakes of a game in more subtle, metaphorical ways.

204
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:28,967
In competitive sports, especially boxing, we've developed this kind of complex language

205
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:34,071
around challenging, winning and losing that includes trash talk, or shit talking, the

206
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:34,611
other players.

207
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:50,003
So that language is used to invoke deeper social concepts

208
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,924
like honor and pride in sporting results.

209
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:56,326
And I think it increases the stakes, both metaphorically

210
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:57,306
and in reality.

211
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,808
We increase the stakes of a sport metaphorically

212
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:03,049
by saying things like, I'm going to bury you, right?

213
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:03,849
Or I crushed you.

214
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:07,371
Even the basic term, I beat you, is a violent term.

215
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:12,014
We borrow the language of deadly combat and violent crime

216
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:15,576
in order to make losing sound a lot worse and more important

217
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:16,416
than it really is.

218
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:20,197
Now, obviously, you can get all the trash talk that you want

219
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:22,038
if you play an online multiplayer shooter.

220
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,299
But I think you can also use it in single player designs,

221
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:27,340
where we face the toughest challenge to make

222
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,440
players' performance matter.

223
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,922
An example would be, Devil May Cry.

224
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,303
Shit talks to you if you do poorly.

225
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:36,403
Tells you that easy mode is unlocked.

226
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:43,178
I did this more explicitly in my game Klop has this antagonist called Sherrod who literally

227
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:44,719
insults you every time you lose.

228
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,904
There's no real life audience in this case, but in this case there is this NPC character

229
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:56,207
who forms a kind of a peanut gallery, observing and reacting and criticizing your performance.

230
00:14:57,828 --> 00:15:01,211
It doesn't really matter what Sherrod thinks of your running style, but it kind of starts

231
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:02,091
to feel like it does.

232
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,342
And more often in games, we use a visual metaphor for high stakes

233
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:08,443
instead of a verbal one.

234
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:11,525
So if you think about it, this is the reason why so many games

235
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:13,846
use the player avatar's death as the failure state.

236
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:18,009
In fact, I think that's the best or most legitimate reason,

237
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,731
justifying reason, for the amount of violence

238
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:23,753
that we have in single-player games.

239
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:30,199
And that's why there's something so unsatisfying about games that bend over backwards to avoid a death state.

240
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,322
If the player is invulnerable, there's no metaphor for high stakes.

241
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:38,145
And the outcome of the game starts to feel predestined and meaningless.

242
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:43,489
You think of L.A. Noire, where they made it almost impossible to run over pedestrians.

243
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:48,073
If there's no danger of a penalty, the stakes are lowered.

244
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:51,396
The outcome matters less, and the player stops trying to drive well.

245
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:57,958
Of course in sports, in real sports, apart from martial arts I guess, the penalty for

246
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:02,860
failure isn't injury or death, it's just humiliation, frustration and shame.

247
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:08,203
But that's deliberately designed into sport as well, again making heavy use of metaphors.

248
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:13,285
For example, sports make heavy use of the concept of nationalism by forming teams around

249
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:13,805
countries.

250
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:17,527
So there's this idea in the player's head, if you're playing for your country, you know

251
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:21,048
everyone in the country is watching you and depending on you.

252
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:25,147
And I think the Trackmania guys realized that when they made nations,

253
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:27,849
where you can compete to push your country higher up in the ladder,

254
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:29,210
again like in the Olympics.

255
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,271
Now, it's not a real way of raising the stakes.

256
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:35,354
You know, there's no actual benefit to your country to be higher in Trackmania nations.

257
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:38,697
But it's a metaphor for something that matters, just like trash talk.

258
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,201
All right, so one final point.

259
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:50,382
In real world sports, there's this strong ethic of player integrity, which I think is

260
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:54,423
an essential part of what makes the outcome of a sporting match matter to the players

261
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:55,003
and the fans.

262
00:16:57,003 --> 00:17:01,824
We spend billions of dollars every year testing athletes for this long list of illegal drugs,

263
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:02,124
right?

264
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:07,606
We have an international panic when Tiger Woods cheats on his wife or when Lance Armstrong

265
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,406
turns out to have been doping the whole time.

266
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:15,289
And sporting organizations have sided incredibly heavily against things like match fixing,

267
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,310
especially in soccer and boxing.

268
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:26,712
In the sporting world, the reason we object to fixed games or performance enhancing drugs

269
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:29,413
is that they violate an ethic of integrity in sport.

270
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:35,194
So integrity is important because it's part of what gives the result of a game legitimacy and importance.

271
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:40,690
If you win because the other team wasn't trying, or because you paid for an unfair advantage,

272
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,352
then the results of the match aren't interesting.

273
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:48,015
So integrity is part, it's like an important part of what makes the outcome of any sporting

274
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:48,615
event matter.

275
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:53,499
It's really difficult to give single-player video games the same legitimacy when there's

276
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,422
no spectators, no human referees, and no one will ever know if you've used a trainer or

277
00:17:58,442 --> 00:17:59,103
a cheat code.

278
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:04,467
But I think certain reward structures that we put in our games undermine the ethic of

279
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:06,028
integrity even more.

280
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:07,664
even if you're not cheating.

281
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:13,546
Pay to win, I think, is the video game equivalent

282
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,446
of match fixing or doping.

283
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:20,248
If you can pay to improve your performance by purchasing

284
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:24,329
upgrades or unlocks, then it doesn't matter anymore how well you're playing.

285
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:27,750
Even when it's sanctioned by the developer, even when it's provided by the

286
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,290
developer,

287
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:32,292
buying progress undermines the player's integrity.

288
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:39,928
I'd also argue that any game that lets you just exchange progress for time, time for

289
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:45,693
progress without really trying is essentially suffering from the same problem.

290
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:49,696
So grinding is just paying to win with a different currency, time.

291
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,460
If you're grinding, it doesn't matter how well you're playing at all.

292
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,605
I mean, you can obviously speed up the grind by playing well, but you can get more efficiency

293
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:02,287
by playing eight copies of the same game at once.

294
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:09,590
Now, it's true, I mean, one of the things that may jump to mind is that in sport you have to do something that's a bit grind-like, which is training.

295
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,913
You have to train in order to play well. It's not just a matter of showing up on match day and focusing hard.

296
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:22,057
But training also has to be done skillfully. You know, you can't just exchange time for victory in any sport.

297
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:29,921
And people always tell me that they beat QWOP. They're really proud and they're really happy they come and they say that they beat QWOP.

298
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,831
And then I inquire a bit further,

299
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,271
and it turns out that they did it this way,

300
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:35,632
by kind of tapping the keys as fast as they can

301
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,253
and scooting along on one knee.

302
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:40,514
Now, I would feel pretty ashamed to admit

303
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:43,456
that I was playing a game with so little dignity.

304
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,258
But I'm in the minority there, right?

305
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,039
That's the minority view, because we

306
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,320
don't have a norm of integrity in video games.

307
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:58,142
So as designers, what can you do to foster that norm

308
00:19:58,162 --> 00:19:59,202
of integrity in your game?

309
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:04,514
Well, if you approach a game in the same way as you approach a real-life sport,

310
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:08,735
the first thing that you do is you do your best to maintain a canonical record

311
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,415
of the player's performance, especially in single-player.

312
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:13,056
Right, so that might mean

313
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:17,376
doing your best to make sure that the scoreboards are secure or that

314
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:18,617
high scores are validated.

315
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:23,478
It might mean doing your best to make sure that updates to the game rules

316
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:26,438
don't invalidate previous scores.

317
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:31,854
It might mean making sure that players can't pay for better equipment,

318
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:34,455
or grind mindlessly to achieve better stats,

319
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:36,276
or progress through the game.

320
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:43,440
But if our games don't explicitly reward and support integrity in the players,

321
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,361
then I think that they're basically doomed to be disposable entertainment

322
00:20:47,802 --> 00:20:48,862
rather than something more.

323
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:54,732
All right, so in this talk, I've argued that the biggest

324
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:57,853
challenge that we face as designers is to make the events

325
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,714
in our games matter to players.

326
00:21:01,255 --> 00:21:03,856
And I've argued that we can meet that challenge in a

327
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,357
number of ways, taking inspiration from real sports.

328
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:11,299
If we're making a multiplayer game, we can give it

329
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,920
performativity by placing it in front of live spectators,

330
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,481
either online or in live performance spaces.

331
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:20,776
And you can raise the stakes of the game by running one-off tournaments where the player

332
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,277
only gets one chance to do well.

333
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:28,881
In the event gaming scene, at Baby Castles, Wild Rumpus, Wagos Rancheros, Prince of Arcade

334
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:31,803
and so on, we've been doing these things as much as we can.

335
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:37,047
And I think in single player it's harder, but there are still things that you can do.

336
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:42,150
You can utilize social networks or NPCs to build real or simulated audience.

337
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,814
You can enforce permanent consequences to bad player performance.

338
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:52,377
You can have one-off game events to build a sense of occasion.

339
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:57,721
And you can even jump in and shit-talk the player, either automatically or as in, I want

340
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,943
to be the guy guiding by hacking their game.

341
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:07,527
And you can make sure that they can't win unless they're trying their hardest.

342
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:12,867
I think it's super rare to see single player games or even private multiplayer games that

343
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:14,809
do all those things at once.

344
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:19,212
But games that do will be engaging and they'll be memorable.

345
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:24,636
And I think they'll matter a lot more to the players and to the spectators, just like real

346
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:25,576
single player sports.

347
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:27,578
Thanks very much.

348
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:39,196
We've got a question from Chris.

349
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:39,956
Do you, uh...

350
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:44,120
Just, can you talk about the cultivating integrity

351
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,661
and the norm of integrity versus, like,

352
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:48,323
hacking as kind of a metagame thing for games?

353
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:50,745
Like, you know, figuring out a solution to co-op

354
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:52,487
that doesn't require you to play the way you want it.

355
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:54,669
Can you talk a little bit about the conflict between those?

356
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:59,413
All right, so, okay, so the question is,

357
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,414
you know, is there a tension between, uh...

358
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:07,368
cultivating a norm of integrity and allowing players, I guess,

359
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:11,891
so I guess in QWOP, I didn't do anything to stop players from

360
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:15,454
from scooting along on one knee. And even after I realized that they were all doing that,

361
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:19,396
I could have, I could have, I mean I published it on my website. I could

362
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:21,558
easily have just gone in and made some kind of rule

363
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:23,679
that stopped people from doing that.

364
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,241
And actually...

365
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:37,581
One of the things about this is that I think that if you enforce too hard...

366
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:41,432
If you try too hard to force players to play with integrity,

367
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:44,773
there's a risk that it no longer is integrity, right?

368
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:46,994
They're not making a choice to play with dignity,

369
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:50,334
that maybe there is less dignity after all.

370
00:23:50,354 --> 00:23:51,715
And I've been trying it both ways.

371
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:55,616
I actually think that it's better in QWOP

372
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:58,496
that I didn't enforce it too much.

373
00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:01,177
But what I've been trying to do as a developer is going around.

374
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:04,680
and ridiculing players who do that,

375
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,181
I'm trying to publicly shame them.

376
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:08,643
That's my way as a developer

377
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:10,524
of trying to foster that norm of integrity.

378
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:12,986
Look, I do believe that games

379
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:14,567
shouldn't be too strict with their rules.

380
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,730
So, but, you know, hopefully,

381
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,011
hopefully if I put up enough of these slides,

382
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:21,833
people will feel bad about playing that way.

383
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:23,714
All right, next.

384
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:25,215
Hi, my name's...

385
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:31,296
My name's Roy, and I'm developing right now a strictly local multiplayer competitive game.

386
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:35,980
And we had an event at a local bar back in Vermont in the States

387
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:41,023
where we had people off the streets play the game, and we had a tournament.

388
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:45,706
And largely, it was pretty successful, but there were still some people in the crowd

389
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:47,847
who were like, oh, why is there a video game here?

390
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:51,450
So, my question to you...

391
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:53,142
Sorry.

392
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,902
Is how large of a role do you think the decreasing,

393
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:58,183
yet prevalent, stigma against video games

394
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:01,003
plays a part in the popularity of video games versus sports?

395
00:25:01,904 --> 00:25:02,044
Yeah.

396
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:02,984
It's a real problem, right?

397
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:09,205
I mean, we were at the Sony event at IndyCade last year.

398
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:12,946
And they rented out the bar.

399
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:15,686
But at some point, it was no longer completely private.

400
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:18,247
And regular people started coming in.

401
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,332
And they were mad at us because we were sitting playing Samurai Gun in a big group.

402
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:24,414
Everyone's having a good time. You know, they're ordering drinks.

403
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:26,015
It's not like we're not, you know, doing that.

404
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,718
And then, you know, waitresses start to shut us down.

405
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:32,481
And we've got, like, these kind of guys in suits and ties

406
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:34,883
who've come from the picture studios, like, making fun of us

407
00:25:34,963 --> 00:25:36,484
for playing video games in a bar.

408
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,489
I can sort of understand it in a way.

409
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:42,630
We've got a whole bunch of cultural norms about those spaces,

410
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,891
about what people are doing.

411
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:48,392
And I guess video games are constructed as not being part of that, right?

412
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:51,012
And that's something that's going to take some time to change.

413
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,473
We need games that are designed for those spaces.

414
00:25:53,493 --> 00:25:57,414
I mean, part of the problem is, you know, we're sitting around with this laptop.

415
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,680
It's like 15-inch screen.

416
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,701
It's four of us huddled around it.

417
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:03,982
There's really, it's very difficult to kind of get the

418
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,843
spectatorship aspect going, because nobody can see it

419
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:08,383
except for the people who are playing it, right?

420
00:26:08,423 --> 00:26:10,184
And nobody actually knows what we're doing, because we're

421
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:11,964
sitting here with these controllers and our thumbs are

422
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:12,985
just sort of barely moving.

423
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,466
And so to somebody who doesn't know about video games and who

424
00:26:16,486 --> 00:26:18,607
doesn't want to get up really close to us, there's nothing

425
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:20,647
in it for them except that we're sort of taking up space

426
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:21,708
and kind of killing their vibe.

427
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:28,496
But when we run Doug Wilson's game, Johann Sebastian Joust,

428
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:31,540
in the same sorts of spaces, people don't seem to object.

429
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:34,424
Suddenly, that's something everybody wants to get involved in.

430
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:36,286
So it is possible, I think.

431
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:37,928
We've got two jobs to do.

432
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,931
One is to design games that can be played within the kind of context

433
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:42,033
of the existing spaces.

434
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:45,867
And then the other one is that we have to try to support the

435
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:47,248
establishment of new spaces.

436
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:51,649
You know, like I was supporting LA Games Space, and I've been

437
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:55,290
contributed to Baby Castles for many years, Silent Barn.

438
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,711
So there are emerging some spaces where we can start to

439
00:26:58,731 --> 00:27:02,852
kind of create our own culture in those spaces and not be

440
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:06,673
kind of like harshing the vibe of these millionaires who've

441
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,394
come down from the picture studios trying to have a

442
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:10,635
regular bar experience.

443
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:13,945
Hey, it was totally fascinating.

444
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,207
I really like the idea of what sports can bring to games.

445
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:20,590
I was wondering what you thought about what games

446
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,411
can bring to sports design.

447
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:26,734
I'm thinking a lot about current debates happening

448
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:29,856
about rugby rules that are kind of broken,

449
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,098
and soccer rules that are kind of broken,

450
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:35,020
and what the video game world can bring to sports.

451
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,581
Yeah, it's an interesting question.

452
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:42,736
So when you have like the electronic linesman in tennis

453
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:47,298
or in soccer, it decides whether the ball has

454
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:48,078
gone over the line.

455
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:52,020
There is definitely a blurring of the lines between video

456
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,081
games and real sports, right?

457
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:57,062
I'm all for that.

458
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:59,543
I think that video games, the reason I'm interested in video

459
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:02,905
games rather than just playing or making sports is that I

460
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:05,166
think that there is something special about video games.

461
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:12,593
that you can't get with tabletop games, with parlor games, or with real sports, right?

462
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:17,395
I think there is this kind of tight pairing between a system that can react instantaneously

463
00:28:18,255 --> 00:28:29,019
and a human brain and human body that allows you to have experiences and to produce engagement

464
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:29,879
that sports can't.

465
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,530
At least as they're currently envisaged.

466
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,952
So I think there is absolutely a lot of room to bring

467
00:28:35,252 --> 00:28:37,233
the kind of benefits of video game technology

468
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:40,215
to real sport and maybe we can have like a best of both worlds.

469
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:41,276
That would be fantastic.

470
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:49,315
So a lot of what you're talking about is certainly relevant to competitive games and multiplayer games and

471
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:56,497
talking about raising the challenge and raising the stakes and stuff.

472
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:00,998
Those kind of things certainly appeal to people that are really into those sort of competitive games.

473
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:10,300
But I wonder, to what extent do you feel like that some of these prescriptions that you're offering

474
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:14,001
would apply outside of those types of games?

475
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:20,043
Because obviously, a lot of the reason why a lot of games are getting easier or less punishing

476
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:24,243
are to, in the interest of, you know, widening the potential audience.

477
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,844
Do you see that potentially working in a mass market?

478
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,685
Or would it always have to be kind of that niche, competitive kind of...

479
00:29:30,073 --> 00:29:30,434
Yeah, OK.

480
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:33,295
So the answer to that is that it's really easy to explain

481
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:35,596
in a kind of multiplayer competitive scheme

482
00:29:35,636 --> 00:29:36,676
how to make it more like a sport,

483
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:38,097
because sports are kind of often like that.

484
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,858
But I think that there are kind of lessons

485
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:42,999
that you can take from sports, even if you're making single

486
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,480
player games that are not even designed

487
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,261
to have that kind of adversarial, difficult,

488
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,621
competitive thing, right?

489
00:29:50,742 --> 00:29:53,183
So if you think about a game like Proteus, which

490
00:29:53,283 --> 00:29:54,303
doesn't even have goals.

491
00:29:55,832 --> 00:29:57,092
Proteus by Ed Key.

492
00:29:57,612 --> 00:30:00,773
So it's a game where you basically just walk around

493
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,774
a beautiful landscape and you experience

494
00:30:05,294 --> 00:30:07,415
some sounds and you see some things, right?

495
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:09,835
That's the sort of description of the game. It's amazing.

496
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:13,856
Now that's the kind of game which is nothing like a real-world sport.

497
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:19,649
But we've had very good results showing it in public

498
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:21,210
to large groups of people, because there

499
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,031
is a kind of performance aspect using

500
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:24,271
the music and the visuals.

501
00:30:24,832 --> 00:30:27,153
And so it's possible to bring out that kind of experience

502
00:30:27,213 --> 00:30:29,834
performance, even without the competitive thing,

503
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,255
even without the multiplayer thing.

504
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:35,837
If you're thinking about how this will be perceived.

505
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,372
As a performance, even if it's not in a big public space

506
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:41,512
with a huge audience, even if it's

507
00:30:41,552 --> 00:30:42,813
just the people in your household who

508
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:44,514
are watching you play over your shoulder

509
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:48,095
while you're playing on the couch, you can design for that.

510
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,677
So I think that it's harder in the case of single player

511
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:54,138
games, especially single player games that are not

512
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:55,178
sort of super competitive.

513
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,200
But it's still possible to think creatively about this.

514
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,101
And I think still you can take some inspiration

515
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:03,402
from real sports, for sure.

516
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:04,582
OK.

517
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,531
We're out of time, so thanks very much, everybody.
