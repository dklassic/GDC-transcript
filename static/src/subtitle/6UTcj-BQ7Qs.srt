1
00:00:05,998 --> 00:00:08,741
Okay, hello everyone, I'm Caitlin Brunel.

2
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:13,145
I have been in the industry about seven years.

3
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:14,146
Right now I'm at Naughty Dog,

4
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,248
although the ideas for this talk were developed

5
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:17,650
while I was still at CCP.

6
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,134
So before I start, a quick spoiler warning.

7
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,456
I will be spoiling a couple of plot moments.

8
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:27,159
Chances are you've already heard of most of these,

9
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:30,102
even if you haven't played these games, but fair warning.

10
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:36,617
So, before I launch into the meat of this talk, let me give a quick review of the major terms.

11
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:41,460
Autonomy, competence, and relatedness are psychological terms used for increasing

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,225
intrinsic motivation to play your game. And, well, why am I focusing on these three?

13
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:53,569
There's actually quite a few statistics about how effective these three together

14
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:58,452
are at increasing player retention. For instance, these stats from Immersive

15
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:04,056
claimed that MMO retention was much higher in games that provided these three psychological needs.

16
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:10,159
In their study, 46% of players who had spent one month playing an MMO with autonomy,

17
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:16,302
competence, and relatedness were still playing that MMO nine months later. By contrast,

18
00:01:17,562 --> 00:01:22,404
18% of players who had spent a month playing an MMO that they self-described as fun

19
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,946
were still playing that MMO nine months later.

20
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:31,369
Autonomy, competence, and relatedness have strong statistical results.

21
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,850
And they work in more than just games.

22
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,131
They've proven effective in education, in sports, in the workplace.

23
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:43,172
So what are they?

24
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,073
Autonomy is feeling like you have options, like you're in control,

25
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:50,954
feeling like you're responsible for the results of your own actions.

26
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:55,335
For instance, why is Grand Theft Auto so popular?

27
00:01:56,309 --> 00:02:01,272
It's not because any one piece of the game is totally flawless, it's that you can do anything

28
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:07,797
you want. Want to drive a firetruck? Okay, go drive a firetruck. Similarly, everyone likes

29
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:14,181
making silly pictures in Photoshop because you can create anything, and part of Lego's appeal is just

30
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:20,566
how open-ended it is. Competence. Competence is feeling like you're up to the task.

31
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:26,601
Like the thing you're trying to make the character do is what the character actually does on screen.

32
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:29,602
It's also associated with a feeling of mastery.

33
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:33,424
The player feeling like they know the strategies and they're good at the game now.

34
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:40,386
For instance, people who never played a console game before will play Wii Sports

35
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:43,708
because they feel like they're up to the task of swinging a Wii Mote.

36
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:47,965
On the flip side, people hate Microsoft Word's autocorrect

37
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:52,907
because they think they intend to type is not what actually appears on the screen.

38
00:02:53,487 --> 00:03:00,769
The controls don't do what they intend. So Microsoft Word is a badly designed game.

39
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,831
Now there's actually a bit of a special case with competence where,

40
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:10,212
statistically speaking, it has no effect without autonomy.

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,461
Let's say I hand you a piece of chalk and tell you to write on the chalkboard.

42
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:22,142
Probably all of you feel like, yeah, I have the skills to do this. But are you motivated?

43
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:28,064
If I tell you to write the same line over and over, probably not. If I tell you to put

44
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:32,105
anything you want on the chalkboard, yeah, now you've probably got some good ideas.

45
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:35,365
For betterness

46
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:42,410
long, that you're part of something bigger, that you have peers who will look out for you, and that

47
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:49,134
you're also responsible for their well-being. And despite relatedness being all about people,

48
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:56,137
ironically, NPC interactions are more consistently effective at giving positive relatedness. Unlike

49
00:03:56,177 --> 00:04:01,600
other players who might just yell at you for being a noob, NPCs can every single time have a reaction

50
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,001
of, wow, you're that guy who saved the whole town! I can't believe I'm meeting you!

51
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,075
So to give a quick shorthand for these terms,

52
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,896
autonomy is having options,

53
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:14,336
competence is feeling up to the task,

54
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,577
and relatedness is connecting with people.

55
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:20,498
So you might be asking,

56
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:23,198
why wouldn't we just want to max out

57
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:25,259
autonomy, competence, and relatedness?

58
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,179
After all, you get a huge spike

59
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:29,560
in player retention if you do,

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,260
and some games do go this route.

61
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:34,601
Take Farmville, for instance.

62
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,122
You can plant crops in any pattern you want, giving you autonomy.

63
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:44,243
The only skill is clicking, so no one feels a lack of competence.

64
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,565
And your friends are relying on you to play and benefit from you playing,

65
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:54,427
giving you relatedness. So does that make Farmville the pinnacle of game design?

66
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,748
Now, don't get me wrong, it is very efficient at what it does,

67
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:02,489
but let me make a case for deliberately denying the player

68
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,810
autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

69
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,109
I'm going to compare two different scenes where autonomy is taken away.

70
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:14,094
In Portal, there's a scene where you have to destroy an inanimate box.

71
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:19,861
And quite a few people, not everyone, but quite a few, form a sort of emotional connection

72
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:24,166
with this box, and so destroying the box is something they really don't want to do.

73
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:32,555
In Portal 2, there is a scene where in order to advance the plot, you have to put the villain back into power.

74
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:39,582
And a lot of people don't want to do this because they're angry with the villain, breaking the player's autonomy.

75
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:43,525
Now, here's the interesting thing.

76
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:48,009
People love Portal's scene and hate Portal's previous scene.

77
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,712
In both of these scenes, you have your autonomy taken away.

78
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,230
the villain is making you do this heinous act,

79
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,853
and in the other, the game designer is making you do it.

80
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:03,795
Which means, in one case,

81
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:05,597
the player is angry with the villain,

82
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:06,938
and in the other case,

83
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:09,200
the player is angry with the game designer.

84
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,803
Or, alternatively, they might just end up feeling

85
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:14,544
like they can't relate to the main character.

86
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:18,647
Either way, you probably don't want the player

87
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:21,250
hating your game design or hating your main character.

88
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:27,328
That's usually a writing success.

89
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:31,370
Now, some of you are probably saying,

90
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,971
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

91
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,791
Were we talking about autonomy?

92
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:37,853
How did we end up talking about villains?

93
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:40,934
In other words, how do we go from talking about

94
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:42,595
a purely game mechanical concept

95
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,555
to a purely narrative concept?

96
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:46,776
So here's what's happening.

97
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:49,057
You start with a piece of game design,

98
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:52,078
in this case, one that takes away the player autonomy.

99
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:55,659
This causes a powerful emotion in the player.

100
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,219
Anger at having their autonomy taken away.

101
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,141
And then we use trickery to get the player

102
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,342
to associate that emotion with a narrative and not

103
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:08,123
the game design that caused the emotion in the first place.

104
00:07:09,624 --> 00:07:10,464
This is a big deal.

105
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,945
This is an emotional storytelling tool

106
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,966
that exists only in games.

107
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:22,684
But is this the only way to produce the emotions we want through game design?

108
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:26,966
I mean, do we have to break autonomy?

109
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:30,809
Because autonomy is something we really don't want to break.

110
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,091
I mean, it triples our subscriber numbers.

111
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:40,715
Could we maybe modify the scene a bit so that it doesn't actually break autonomy?

112
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:46,559
What if there was some super secret way to save the Cuban portal?

113
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:56,534
would this be better? Well, there's a couple of problems with that. The first is newbies.

114
00:07:57,214 --> 00:08:00,635
Newbies aren't going to know there's a secret and therefore they're still going to feel the

115
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:07,896
autonomy loss. The second is that eventually when the newbies go online and talk about this scene,

116
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:13,818
they're going to hear no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you did it wrong. You're supposed to save the cube.

117
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:17,211
And now all of a sudden they feel incompetent.

118
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:20,492
So now we're breaking two rules instead of just one.

119
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:24,853
So okay, wow, that didn't work.

120
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:27,914
Do we really just have to break autonomy?

121
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:30,055
Well, hold on.

122
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:34,736
What if we just let people keep the cube?

123
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:36,396
No secrets?

124
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:41,057
Now, nobody loses autonomy or competence.

125
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:46,493
But now you've completely changed the emotional tone of the scene,

126
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:49,575
why be angry at the villain anymore?

127
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:52,017
Why be sad at the scene now?

128
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:57,600
In short, if we want our game design to produce negative emotions

129
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,523
to be harnessed in our narrative, then we need to break rules.

130
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:06,646
So now that we know what makes Portal's scene effective,

131
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,228
let's try to fix Portal 2's scene.

132
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:16,299
The problem with Portal 2's scene is, why does the main character agree to the plans?

133
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,541
Who's forcing her to do so?

134
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:23,385
I mean, the main character gets ordered around by a potato.

135
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,008
Why does she obey the potato?

136
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,630
Why doesn't she just make her own plans?

137
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:33,574
To fix this, what you need is a stronger authority figure.

138
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:37,237
Someone who can give the main character orders she can't refuse.

139
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,266
Let's come back to Portal 1 now.

140
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,828
Given that we already have our formula,

141
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,210
villain that takes away your autonomy,

142
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,412
how can we improve the impact of this scene?

143
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,714
Now, the funny thing about this scene

144
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:54,596
is that it has no real impact

145
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,417
on a certain percentage of the audience.

146
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,859
Some people, when they play Portal, react,

147
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,121
it's just an inanimate object.

148
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,263
Sure, I'll incinerate it, no problem.

149
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,985
It would be a very different story

150
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:09,206
if the cube was instead...

151
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:14,139
a cute robot with personality and seeming intelligence.

152
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:20,785
Now, the walls in Portal are covered in graffiti from past test subjects, leaving

153
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:28,271
poems and tributes to the cube. What would happen if you let people write their own graffiti?

154
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:32,695
What would happen if there were flowers in the scene that they can move around?

155
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:36,758
Basically, give the players a small piece of autonomy.

156
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:41,933
you're still breaking their autonomy, the player still has no control over the big things,

157
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:48,814
they still have to kill the cube, but they do have a small some autonomy over what kind of

158
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:55,996
send-off they give the cube and how much respect they pay, which theoretically will make them more

159
00:10:56,136 --> 00:11:03,737
engaged with the scene. So enough analysis about Portal, let's take a step back and look at the

160
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:11,209
Some of you might be wondering, could we use the emotion in Bug produced by our game design

161
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:18,873
to enhance something other than narrative? And the answer is yes, it could be used to emphasize

162
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:25,616
a moral. Brenda Brathwaite, for instance, has games where you experience various historical

163
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:28,778
atrocities, such as the slave trade from Africa to America.

164
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,142
These games give you a history lesson. They probably get you closer to understanding what

165
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:39,204
people were really feeling than any history textbook ever could, because you feel your

166
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:48,047
human rights being taken away through gameplay. Alternatively, instead of narrative or morals,

167
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:53,829
you could give people strong feelings about an abstract concept. This is most commonly seen

168
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:59,271
in flash games that try to argue against a certain kind of game design. Let me give you an example.

169
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:03,325
This is a screenshot from Super Press Space to Win.

170
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,926
Now, the only controls of this game are the space bar.

171
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,827
The game never gives you a choice about anything.

172
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:13,467
It's press space to buy a potion,

173
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:17,268
and press space to walk, and choose a stat to upgrade

174
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:19,509
when you only have one stat.

175
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:23,830
A lot of people playing this game would say,

176
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,991
oh, of course, this is a critique of linearity in RPGs.

177
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,553
Although, actually, I think the message is a little ambiguous.

178
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:35,816
I think another group of people would walk away

179
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,058
concluding that linear RPGs actually

180
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,620
do give them a lot of freedom, a lot of autonomy.

181
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,662
And they just didn't notice it until you

182
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:44,023
took that autonomy away.

183
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:50,789
But I would argue that impacting narrative, impacting morals,

184
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:55,052
and impacting an abstract thesis are all pretty similar.

185
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:59,712
You're trying to convey a message and you're using game design to make the player feel

186
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,154
exactly the way you want them to feel.

187
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:08,098
So yes, you could manipulate player emotion around any external idea,

188
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,380
but the tricks are basically the same.

189
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:16,024
So you might ask, what about not going external at all?

190
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:21,929
Could we map a negative emotion from one piece of gameplay to another piece of gameplay?

191
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,551
And the answer is yes.

192
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:31,213
you can make people dislike a well-made part of your gameplay, if you wanted to.

193
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:40,581
For instance, this is a fairy from Zelda who yells at you to stop what you're doing and

194
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:46,146
listen to her, and nobody likes to be told to stop what they're doing, so most players

195
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:49,850
hate her, and yet she's just a hint system.

196
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,851
That's usually good game design.

197
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:57,309
Why would you want people to hate a well-made part of your gameplay?

198
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:01,150
And by the way, I'm not just being rhetorical here.

199
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,651
In narrative, there are villains that audiences love to hate.

200
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:10,293
Will there ever come a point in games where there are game mechanics that audiences love to hate?

201
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,555
Video games are a young, evolving medium.

202
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:18,516
Maybe someday audiences will clamor for villain game mechanics.

203
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:19,757
Who knows?

204
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:22,738
All right.

205
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,806
So far we've only really done a dozen variations on one example,

206
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:32,752
and it produces one emotion. Let's expand our repertoire of emotions.

207
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:37,937
Specifically, so far we've only been messing with people's autonomy.

208
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:42,742
We can get different emotions by messing with their competence and their relatedness.

209
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:49,568
For comparison purposes, breaking autonomy makes people feel controlled,

210
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:53,789
makes them feel like a pawn, like they're being forced to do something against their will,

211
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:57,150
which in turn makes them angry against authority,

212
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,731
and all of these feelings together naturally make people want to start a rebellion.

213
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:06,292
Breaking competence has a very different effect.

214
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:12,054
Instead of making people want to start a revolution, it makes them want to feel helpless,

215
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:14,095
makes them want to admit defeat.

216
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,481
makes them want to ask for help.

217
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:20,845
Relatedness is a bit less one-dimensional.

218
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,747
Psychologically speaking, relatedness

219
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:25,048
is the opposite of loneliness.

220
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:28,531
However, when someone is in a state of relatedness

221
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,812
and you take that away, depending

222
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:32,514
on how you remove relatedness, they

223
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:38,238
might feel grief or loss or homesickness.

224
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:41,981
So let's talk about breaking relatedness

225
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:43,742
through game mechanics.

226
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:48,118
There are several ways to break up an existing relationship.

227
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:51,759
You can use death killing a character the player cared about.

228
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:56,801
You can use physical distance. Have the player go on a long journey far away

229
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:00,742
from friends and family. You could have the player's friends and

230
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:05,163
peers reject the player. Of course, rejection can go both ways.

231
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:08,785
You can make the player want to reject their friends and peers because it

232
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,706
turns out their friends and peers are horrible, like maybe they're Nazis or something.

233
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:15,743
And a couple of games use exactly that plot twist.

234
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:17,464
You know, your friends are secretly Nazis.

235
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:20,585
But the vast majority of games just go for murder.

236
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:24,346
And it's easy to criticize this and say

237
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:26,606
that games should broaden their writing horizons.

238
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:27,907
And they probably should.

239
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,788
But is there a psychological reason why

240
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:32,548
murder might be more effective?

241
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:36,929
To answer this question, let me first

242
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:39,210
go on a tangent about a psychological experiment.

243
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,890
In this experiment.

244
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:44,128
people were given electric shocks by someone in another room.

245
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:48,130
And like any good scientific experiment,

246
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,271
it was a double-blind test with two groups.

247
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:53,132
One group is told that people in the other room

248
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,733
were acting maliciously,

249
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:58,435
that they know pressing the button will cause pain.

250
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:00,976
The other group is told that

251
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:03,837
there's someone in another room pressing a button,

252
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:05,778
but they're totally innocent.

253
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:08,079
They don't know they're hurting anyone.

254
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:13,069
Now, it turns out malicious shocks really hurt.

255
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,810
Innocent shocks don't.

256
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,511
Well, the first one does, but the pain quickly drops off.

257
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:23,092
So why murder?

258
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,172
Because it's malicious.

259
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,693
The malicious act is going to cause more pain.

260
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:33,674
So if we are going to use a murder scene,

261
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:37,475
how do we make sure we get the most emotional impact out of it?

262
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:43,176
One of the more important points is making sure people care about the victim.

263
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,538
And how do we do that?

264
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:47,399
We use gameplay.

265
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,082
We create a game mechanical relationship between the player and the victim.

266
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:56,065
But don't skip narrative either.

267
00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:59,788
Remember how not everyone cared about the cube from Portal

268
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:02,430
because to some people it was just an inanimate box.

269
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:06,913
So how do we create game mechanical relatedness?

270
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:11,756
in all the same way that relationships are built between humans.

271
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:16,917
You want to create trust and respect between the NPC and the player.

272
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:20,958
Enough trust that the player will happily do the character a favor

273
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:24,478
because they know that character will return that favor.

274
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:30,700
You want them to rely on each other. Maybe your main character can't fly and

275
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,840
so relies on someone who can, and she in turn

276
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,881
relies on the main character for brute force.

277
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,045
You want them to feel like a peer to the player,

278
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:43,926
like they are working together towards something bigger.

279
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:49,167
So let's take a look at Daederas.

280
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:52,368
Now, okay, like her or hate her,

281
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:55,228
she's gotten more attention than any other video game death.

282
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,149
Maybe there are game mechanical reasons for this.

283
00:18:58,709 --> 00:18:59,269
Let's analyze.

284
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,130
She gives things to the player,

285
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,490
lore explaining how to defeat the bad guy,

286
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,371
goals that the player can do.

287
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:12,297
At the same time, she needs your help, and she will often fight by your side, helping you.

288
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:18,080
And finally, she dies halfway through the game, not in the ending credits,

289
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,262
after the game ends, after the game mechanical contract is over.

290
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:28,204
All the characters could die at the end of the game, and at some level the player would not care.

291
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:33,006
But no, Eris dies in the middle of the game, when she's still needed for more lore,

292
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:35,327
more missions, and more gameplay.

293
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:45,363
So we've been talking about how to make people care about a character. So far we've used relatedness.

294
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:52,747
But what about using autonomy and competence? After all, autonomy and competence are good

295
00:19:52,787 --> 00:20:00,031
techniques to get people to care about pretty much anything. So how do we increase player

296
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:01,351
carrying through autonomy?

297
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:09,932
One way is to use user-created characters, like with The Sims, where players create lives and

298
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:15,314
relationships for their characters. If you tell someone to dream up a set of characters and invent

299
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:20,376
stories and relationships about them, they're going to be upset if you next tell them,

300
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:29,540
okay, one of your characters is now dead. How do we increase player caring through competence?

301
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:35,063
make them feel like they rely on this character to be competent.

302
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,384
Like they're more competent at the game

303
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:38,845
when they're using this character.

304
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,647
And actually, Eris does a little bit of this.

305
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:45,169
She is your healer.

306
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:48,171
And when she dies, you lose all of her equipment

307
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,812
and any experience you invested in leveling her up.

308
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:57,256
So, so far, all of the examples I've used

309
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:58,396
have been strictly linear.

310
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:03,784
Let's take a moment to talk about how to extend these to nonlinear storylines.

311
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:10,727
Remember, all we're doing when using this technique is that we take a gameplay moment

312
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:15,649
that produces a negative emotion in the player and fool the player into feeling that emotion

313
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:22,112
about the narrative. All you need for this is a small piece of gameplay and a small piece

314
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:25,854
of narrative that you can freely place anywhere in a nonlinear setting.

315
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,550
And you don't even have to pair the same piece of gameplay

316
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,831
with the same piece of narrative.

317
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:33,312
You can mix and match.

318
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,374
Just make sure that you have one of each.

319
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:41,737
What you don't ever want is intentionally bad gameplay

320
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:45,079
that's not serving a purpose by driving narrative emotion.

321
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,881
Let's go into some specific examples.

322
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:53,483
How might we do murder in a non-linear setting?

323
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:57,726
Find the character that the player seems to care about the most.

324
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:04,730
the character that they're coming to rely on for help, for whom they're doing the most favors.

325
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:12,493
And then you kill that character. A few games actually use exactly this trick already. I

326
00:22:12,553 --> 00:22:19,536
believe Far Cry 2 does, for instance. What about coercion, like in Portal,

327
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:24,458
where the villain forces you to incinerate the cube? When you think about this...

328
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,120
You're taking away player autonomy and forcing them to do things.

329
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:33,482
How can this ever, ever be nonlinear?

330
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:37,943
The answer is to make the entire scene optional.

331
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,944
Like, maybe it's something that happens only if you're captured.

332
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:44,665
Once you're captured, you're on rails for a bit,

333
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:47,466
but you don't need to be captured in the first place.

334
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:55,699
So every example I've given so far can be reduced to a single dramatic moment where

335
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,022
something happens in gameplay and is immediately linked to a piece of narrative.

336
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:07,466
What about an emotion that takes time to build up? For example,

337
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:12,849
the loneliness that you get in games where there's just nobody around that you can talk to.

338
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:20,469
Now, first things first, before asking how to extend this to nonlinear narratives, we need to

339
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:27,632
tie the game mechanical loneliness into a narrative. Portal, once again, gives us a fairly good example

340
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:34,674
where not only are you lonely, you know who to blame. There is this robot running tests on you

341
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:40,756
like a lab rat who won't let you leave. Not only that, it's malicious. The robot knows you want to

342
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:42,617
leave and won't let you.

343
00:23:45,796 --> 00:23:49,137
In order to pull off this kind of loneliness in a non-linear setting,

344
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:53,919
you have to make an isolated section of the game that's all going to obey the same rules.

345
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,842
You have to decide from the moment you set foot on this island, you lose all radio contact with

346
00:23:59,862 --> 00:24:05,124
your allies. And sure, maybe you don't need to set foot on the island at all.

347
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:10,106
Maybe there's multiple routes you can go once you get to the island, but...

348
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:16,560
You need a section of your game where the game mechanics reinforce emotion consistently,

349
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,621
regardless of player path.

350
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:25,667
There's also potential for going the other way around in a non-linear story,

351
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:30,511
of dynamically detecting a loss of autonomy, competence, or relatedness,

352
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:36,676
and then harnessing that emotion. For instance, noticing the player is frustrated.

353
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:39,418
Maybe they can't beat a boss and...

354
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,498
turning that frustration into a plot moment.

355
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,121
Now we get to actually give an example of breaking competence.

356
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:53,862
Breaking competence actually has several pitfalls.

357
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:59,864
The first is a psychological result that people just don't care about competence

358
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:03,206
unless it's a situation where they have autonomy as well.

359
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,967
If you force a player into doing something, they're not going to care that

360
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:08,768
much if they fail.

361
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:15,289
Next, feeling like you're terrible at a game makes people want to give up and quit.

362
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,990
And if they quit, they never see your wonderful plot moment.

363
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,952
Finally, skill levels vary. Be extremely careful when you create an impossible task

364
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:31,813
that people are meant to fail, and make sure that people actually do fail it.

365
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:38,275
Let's dive into an example and look at some techniques for solving these issues.

366
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:43,741
This is an image of a board game that Brenda Brathwaite made for her daughter to teach her

367
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:47,242
daughter about what really happened in the slave trade from Africa to America.

368
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:55,147
The middle passage. Her daughter had to sail a boat of slaves across the ocean. Now, each turn

369
00:25:55,267 --> 00:26:00,930
she rolled a die to see how much food was used on their trip, and she was rolling really high,

370
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:09,555
and she said, Mommy, we're not going to make it. What are we going to do? And her mother replies.

371
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:16,452
well we can keep going and hope that people don't die or we can put some people in the water.

372
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:26,580
And this had a powerful effect. Suddenly her daughter had a much deeper understanding of

373
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,603
the historical event. I started asking all kinds of great questions like did that really happen

374
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:37,428
so I could come home one day and you'd be gone and would we get together again on the other side?

375
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:50,237
All right, let's break down this game design and analyze how it gets around the major pitfalls associated with breaking competence.

376
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:55,760
How does Brenda's game make sure that the player retains autonomy?

377
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:00,463
She gives the player choices during failure.

378
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:06,787
Her daughter has two terrible options, drowning or starvation, but she has autonomy.

379
00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:10,929
In fact, this is the most autonomy she's had since they loaded up the boats.

380
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:18,599
And this is really noteworthy. Most games, when you're not going to make it, do the exact opposite.

381
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:25,062
They take away player autonomy. Your buttons don't even do anything. Your screen fades to grey.

382
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:31,985
Taking away autonomy makes sure you don't care about failing. And these games don't want you

383
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:37,868
to care about failing. This is exactly the opposite of Brenda's game. Brenda wants her

384
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:39,629
daughter to care about failing.

385
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:45,267
How does Brenda's Game deal with players of higher skill level?

386
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:47,369
Luck.

387
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,174
Brenda's Game is not a game where you can sail through every time without problems.

388
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,896
Eventually, if you play this game enough,

389
00:27:56,697 --> 00:28:00,200
you're going to run into a crisis situation where you have run out of food

390
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,042
and you will have to make some hard decisions.

391
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,148
How does Brenda's Game deal with people who want to give up and quit?

392
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:17,364
Brenda's game has a GM who can respond at the perfect time, right before the player quits the game out of frustration.

393
00:28:19,185 --> 00:28:24,290
Now, okay, obviously that's not an option for most of us making electronic games.

394
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:29,654
In electronic games, we basically need to do the same thing we've been doing for years.

395
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:32,017
Guess what the player is feeling?

396
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:36,140
It also helps to just drag the seat out.

397
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:42,389
make sure that the player can see their impending game mechanical doom coming a mile away while they

398
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:51,834
struggle against it. So how could we modify Brenda's game? Now don't get me wrong, I happen

399
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:57,837
to think Brenda's game design here is quite brilliant, but not everyone is making a game

400
00:28:57,897 --> 00:29:05,021
about historical atrocities. Let's say we wanted to modify the scene to have a more positive spin.

401
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:11,738
How would we go about doing that? You could get rescued by another captain.

402
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:17,619
Now, think back to every rescue scene you've come across in a game.

403
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:25,821
Chances are you barely remember them. You feel like you didn't need rescuing and could have

404
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:32,283
fought those enemies off on your own. Take away player competence first, however, and then players

405
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:34,343
tend to feel gratitude.

406
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:36,983
We've made the player feel helpless,

407
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,745
which means they really want and appreciate help.

408
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:48,652
So, okay, maybe you're thinking of using one or two of these scenes

409
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:52,795
and are now wondering how many of these scenes to use,

410
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:54,957
at what point in the game to use them.

411
00:29:56,158 --> 00:29:58,379
Psychology has a few more hints for us.

412
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,543
First, don't overuse these techniques.

413
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:08,613
The way human emotions work is that a corresponding chemical is released in the brain.

414
00:30:09,594 --> 00:30:14,118
If the brain runs out of that chemical, then you actually can't feel that emotion anymore.

415
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:19,623
This is why people always talk about creating highs and lows in game design,

416
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:25,288
because the human brain literally cannot maintain a constant high state of emotion.

417
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,102
And yes, eventually the human brain can refill its chemical supply,

418
00:30:31,702 --> 00:30:35,404
but this takes time and isn't something you can rely on your player doing.

419
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:43,167
Another interesting psychological result is that human memory is actually very easily overwritten.

420
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:49,150
Instead of remembering what someone's face looked like every day for the past five years,

421
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:56,074
you just remember the most recent version. And older versions of the memory literally get

422
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:56,594
overwritten.

423
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,692
And this is already known in cinema, where if people like the final scene of a movie,

424
00:31:04,052 --> 00:31:06,613
they usually say they like the entire movie.

425
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:13,916
So when sticking in a scene with negative emotions, you usually won't want this to be

426
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:15,096
the final scene of your game.

427
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:19,938
Unless, of course, your goal is to have a sad ending.

428
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,941
And actually, there are games that do finish on a sad ending, and a few of them use some

429
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:26,581
of these techniques.

430
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:35,378
Next note, psychological studies generally point to the presence of autonomy having a larger impact

431
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:42,420
than the presence of either of the other two. So this most likely means that losing autonomy

432
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,461
will have the strongest emotional impact of three.

433
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:52,723
Okay, enough psychological tricks. Let's review the process from start to finish.

434
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:58,004
First, you're going to want to choose a part of the narrative.

435
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:05,317
Next, of all the possible emotions you could use,

436
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:10,319
decide which emotion you want to add to the scene.

437
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,500
Once you've decided, this emotion

438
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,421
will dictate what kind of game design rule

439
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:19,783
you're going to break, be it autonomy, competence,

440
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:21,244
or relatedness.

441
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:25,326
And then you use the emotion created by gameplay

442
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:28,147
to enhance the emotional impact of your narrative.

443
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:31,857
And that summarizes the strategy.

444
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,419
At this point, I'd like to open things up for questions.

445
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,842
Oh, also, I've been asked to mention that, yes, we

446
00:32:37,882 --> 00:32:38,402
are hiring.

447
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,524
OK, let's go to questions.

448
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,971
So how do you explain all of these ideas to your publisher?

449
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:18,201
I mean, if your publisher is pushing you towards having autonomy, competence, relatedness,

450
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:23,966
I mean, if they're not, then you just say, oh, hey, we're going to have a scene with a death

451
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:27,169
in it, and those are really good movies, right? So they'll be great in games, right?

452
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:35,098
You're talking about an idea that's possibly alienating for your player base and therefore alienating your revenue.

453
00:33:35,258 --> 00:33:38,580
And that's definitely something that they're going to look at.

454
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,201
Of course.

455
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:45,786
I mean, is movies probably one of your strongest things that you can use as a common ground to go,

456
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:49,169
look, we've had these tragedies and we've had these upsets.

457
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,752
You can also point to other games that do similar things.

458
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:54,813
Like you can point to Portal and look at how much...

459
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:58,698
You know, the way to companion cube became like an internet meme, right?

460
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:00,039
Yeah

461
00:34:07,063 --> 00:34:12,548
Okay, so you were talking about player death and saving them kind of at the end and how

462
00:34:12,568 --> 00:34:13,388
they might be thankful.

463
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,810
In the 2008 version of Prince of Persia, Elika would always save the player before they died

464
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,292
and people ended up finding it as something not useful and something they didn't like.

465
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:20,794
In the end, they felt it was too easy and there was never really any sort of punishment

466
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:21,075
for falling.

467
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:22,095
What do you think of that?

468
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:22,356
Right.

469
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:22,756
Well, I mean...

470
00:34:22,776 --> 00:34:23,376
I don't know.

471
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:24,057
I think it's a pretty good joke.

472
00:34:24,077 --> 00:34:24,497
It's very appropriate.

473
00:34:24,517 --> 00:34:25,058
It's a very good joke.

474
00:34:25,078 --> 00:34:25,758
I like it though.

475
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:26,059
Well, okay.

476
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:26,899
I'm going to go kill some people.

477
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:27,560
Okay, bye!

478
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:27,680
Bye!

479
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:27,780
Bye!

480
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:27,860

Bye!

483
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,140
Bye!

484
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,281
All right, well, that's the end of the story.

485
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,062
I hope you enjoyed it!

00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:32,904
Bye!

498
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:32,984
Bye!

499
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:39,161
it starts to become expected after a while, right? The feeling of gratitude, part of it is like,

500
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:45,463
the unexpected part is important. It's not like, okay, I know this is going to happen. It's like,

501
00:34:45,703 --> 00:34:50,405
I feel helpless, right? You don't feel helpless if you know that you are going to be saved no

502
00:34:50,445 --> 00:34:56,287
matter what, right? So you think it would have improved it if sometimes she saved you and

503
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:59,248
sometimes she didn't? Um...

504
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,674
Possibly, I mean, I don't actually, I haven't actually played the game in question, so...

505
00:35:04,694 --> 00:35:10,656
I mean, I think it's, these are things best used sparingly as opposed to

506
00:35:11,537 --> 00:35:14,558
your player expects you to always do this, so...

507
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:15,758
Yeah.

508
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:16,439
Thanks.

509
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:22,541
Do you have more examples of taking away confidence from existing games?

510
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:27,043
Yeah, I mean, like, specifically for the rescue thing, like...

511
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:32,838
uh... megaman x has a scene in the very at the very start where you have this

512
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:34,500
enemy that you basically can't beat

513
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:35,501
uh...

514
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:40,446
and then you like you know you get rescued by zero and then you know

515
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:44,270
similarly i mean i i sort of alluded to it in the picture but uh... let's go back

516
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,510
here

517
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:51,977
far enough but uh... super metroid has you being rescued by a metroid

518
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:52,878
uh...

519
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:59,085
So and then there's also like, oh gosh.

520
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:04,929
I mean, Brenda Brathwaite has done, well,

521
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:07,550
I mean Brenda Brathwaite's games are just good examples of like,

522
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,811
they're full of this kind of stuff.

523
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:09,211
But I mean.

524
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:16,294
One Falls for Each of Us was a game where she's talking about the Trail of Tears.

525
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:26,380
And you have to, you know, it's a situation where 50,000 Native Americans were moved,

526
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,862
displaced from their homes, right? And she actually has 50,000 game pieces. And, you know,

527
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:35,165
the first reaction is like, you want me to move 50,000 game pieces? Are you crazy? And then it's

528
00:36:35,185 --> 00:36:40,208
like, oh my god, they had to move 50,000 people. That's crazy, right? So, yeah.

529
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:46,094
Yeah, I should have just kept a note of like, I mean, I went into this with like 50 examples and I paired it down to like three, so.

530
00:36:48,755 --> 00:36:50,496
Go ahead.

531
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:56,018
In terms of taking an atom, an atom.

532
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:58,239
Autonomy. Autonomy, thank you.

533
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:06,082
But, taking away from the player, is it, do you think there's a key difference between

534
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:10,444
Taking it away so much that it you know

535
00:37:10,484 --> 00:37:17,849
It's a cutscene versus literally make buying off all their options that it's the only thing that they can do

536
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:21,091
But they still have to do it. Yeah, absolutely

537
00:37:21,131 --> 00:37:25,594
I think there's a huge difference between that like forcing the player to inseminate the Cuban portal

538
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:30,638
Would be it would be an extremely different scene if that was an FMV where it's just like oh

539
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:34,460
Why is it the main character doing that that's not what I would have done right like

540
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,854
Although sometimes it can be just as effective, I can think of one game.

541
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:46,400
So maybe for your next speech, would you kindly mention Bioshock in it?

542
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:52,926
Yeah, no, there's tons of games I could mention, of course, but yes.

543
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:57,750
I just wanted to mention that you were talking about confidence in games and people wanting

544
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,291
an example.

545
00:37:58,351 --> 00:37:59,272
A great example is...

546
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,900
heavy rain when you have the option of killing the drug dealer.

547
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,961
If you kill the drug dealer, you are in his child's room,

548
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:11,422
and therefore, if you kill him, you are incompetent as a parent and human being,

549
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:12,482
as a moral human being.

550
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:16,402
However, if you let him go, you do not get the information that you need

551
00:38:16,442 --> 00:38:17,503
in order to save your own son.

552
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:21,603
So, no matter what, you make a decision in which you are not competent.

553
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,104
Huh.

554
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:27,664
Yeah.

555
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:32,159
Go ahead.

556
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:39,562
One thing I had a question about was the type of scene where you're in an unwinnable situation

557
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:44,204
is sort of a convention you see a lot in, say, JRPGs.

558
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:48,947
Very frequently you'll find there's a boss fight somewhere that you have to lose to move

559
00:38:49,187 --> 00:38:53,308
the plot forward, and quite often the player actually knows they have to lose.

560
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:59,631
It's usually really obvious that the level gap is just so disparate, and does that take

561
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,212
away from...

562
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,621
the ability to evoke emotion when you know, like,

563
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:06,263
I better not waste my potions, because this is one I have to lose.

564
00:39:06,663 --> 00:39:11,286
Yeah, when you know it's just a scripted sequence, then yeah, I mean, absolutely, that takes away from emotion.

565
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:17,310
Or, like, even just in JRPGs, if you're, like, I mean, half the time when you play them, you're suspicious.

566
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:20,472
Like, is this fight a plot fight, or is it not? Right?

567
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:25,796
So, I mean, it's more effective than when, yeah, like, you legitimately feel like,

568
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:28,718
I should be winning this, why am I not winning this? Like, yeah.

569
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:32,385
But then you run the risk that players quit because they think,

570
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:33,766
oh, I must have done something wrong.

571
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:34,327
Right, yeah.

572
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:38,969
I mean, you have to be careful to save them at the right time

573
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,910
or cut off the scene at the right time, right?

574
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:42,091
Cool.

575
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:42,531
Thank you.

576
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,714
Hey, you probably knew I was coming to the mic.

577
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:47,975
Yes, I knew you were coming to the mic.

578
00:39:47,995 --> 00:39:49,736
So Scott Rugby from Immersive.

579
00:39:49,756 --> 00:39:51,457
Since one of our guidelines is autonomy,

580
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:54,278
I love the fact that there's a talk on breaking the guidelines

581
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:55,339
because that's all about it.

582
00:39:56,593 --> 00:40:02,095
You know, to the question about, I thought there were a lot of interesting points, two

583
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:03,036
things I wanted to mention.

584
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:08,298
One is that autonomy is technically not just about choice, but volition.

585
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:13,320
And so one thing that we find, and we found this, I think I mentioned this to you yesterday

586
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,562
in Uncharted 2, that, because you do a lot of things where like people are betraying

587
00:40:18,602 --> 00:40:20,162
each other and a lot of nasty stuff.

588
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:22,383
One of the things is that emotional stuff.

589
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:25,460
gets people really engaged in the story.

590
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,181
And so even though, so they volitionally,

591
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:30,302
they feel very volitional about moving forward,

592
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:31,723
even if their choice is taken away.

593
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,364
And so actually, the autonomy scores are maintained

594
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:35,465
by that sense of volition.

595
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:35,985
Right.

596
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,606
But another thing I wanted to mention,

597
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:39,167
just as an example, is Left 4 Dead,

598
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:42,188
where you really talk about getting your competence

599
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:44,770
taken away and your autonomy is when you're incapacitated.

600
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,251
Those are some of the most terrifying moments I've ever had.

601
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:49,652
That's why I didn't play for very long.

602
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:50,784
It's too scary.

603
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:54,107
But when that NPC comes along and saves you,

604
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:55,848
we actually have done measurements

605
00:40:55,868 --> 00:40:58,010
where you see this real surge in relatedness.

606
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,070
Right, of course.

607
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,011
Because you matter.

608
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:03,053
So there's actually this, it's almost

609
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,075
like there's one need being traded off for another.

610
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:06,816
Yeah, no, I think a lot of these cases,

611
00:41:06,836 --> 00:41:09,358
like at least the positive ones, maybe not Brenda Brathwaite's

612
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:11,980
board games, but the positive ones, you generally,

613
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,521
like maybe you're losing in one area,

614
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:15,023
but you're gaining in somewhere else.

615
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:15,903
Yeah, absolutely.

616
00:41:30,316 --> 00:41:36,003
Okay, well thank you everyone, and don't forget to fill out your reviews that will be sent

617
00:41:36,023 --> 00:41:36,564
to you through email.

618
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:36,764
Thank you.

619
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:37,305
And have a great day.

620
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:37,385
Bye.

621
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:37,465
Bye.

622

Bye.

626

Bye.

627
00:41:38,006 --> 00:41:38,066
Bye.

628
00:41:38,086 --> 00:41:38,146
Bye.

629
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:38,226
Bye.

630
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:38,306
Bye.

631
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:38,386
Bye.

632
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:38,466
Bye.

633
00:41:38,486 --> 00:41:38,546
Bye.

634
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:38,626
Bye.
