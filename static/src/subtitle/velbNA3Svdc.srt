1
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:16,830
Hello. Hello. Hi. All right. Good? Good, good. Okay. Hi, guys.

2
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:21,573
I am speaking first. I'm Christine Forbus. I'm the ‑‑ oh,

3
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,774
all right. Early claps. Go ahead. Bring it on. Yeah.

4
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:32,376
I deserve it. Keep it going. That's all right. I am the CEO and co-owner of the SuperDuper Game Company.

5
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:39,258
My husband Garrett and I work on a game called Black Ice. And I wasn't too comfortable using

6
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:43,939
post-mortem because we're still on early access, so I made up mid-mortem. It's not a real word,

7
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:49,921
I'm sorry, but it will have to do. So I want to talk a little bit about our game, how development

8
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:50,781
has gone so far.

9
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:56,501
what I can pass on to you from what I've learned. So before I

10
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:00,643
get into all of that, I want to get into what Black Ice is. This

11
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:03,905
is Black Ice. It's a cyber punk hacking game. You're a hacker in

12
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:09,207
cyberspace checking down servers of large corporations. So pretty

13
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:12,869
cool. We kind of say it's like borderlands meets Tron as far as

14
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,711
visuals and game style goes. So we started development in 2013.

15
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:28,265
Got green lit in 2014 and moved back from the Bay Area to Austin, Texas where we are

16
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:29,627
now in 2015.

17
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:32,931
And now it's 2016 and I'm speaking at GDC.

18
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,000
What can I teach you?

19
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,585
Before I was in the game industry, I was a high school teacher, so I kind of instinctively

20
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:44,468
frame everything I do as a teacher.

21
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,211
And I didn't want to come up here and say, this is what I did and it sucked, this is

22
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:53,356
what I did and it was great, and then not put that in anything constructive for you

23
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,038
if you want to get into the indie industry.

24
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:03,667
What can I teach you? First thing, go to conventions. You have to go to conventions.

25
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,671
Because people need to see your game.

26
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:09,129
Twitter is not enough.

27
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:11,251
Telling your friends isn't enough.

28
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:14,194
Your mom telling her friends isn't enough.

29
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,016
You have to get out there.

30
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,778
You have to say, hey, this is my game.

31
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:21,781
So you need to get eyes on your game.

32
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:27,307
And don't get stuck into thinking that that means PAX only or GDC only.

33
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:33,798
Don't shy away from local conventions, conventions that are geared towards things that are outside

34
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,019
of video games.

35
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:41,766
We are games really like kind of cyber punky, kind of retro that you saw, so we looked at

36
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:43,068
classic game conventions.

37
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:52,171
It's about cyberpunk stuff so we looked at hacking conventions or places that communicate with

38
00:02:52,191 --> 00:03:00,513
hackers. Look at the style of your game, the video, the visual styles, the play styles, find

39
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:04,674
those really niche conventions and reach out to them. Even board game conventions I've heard

40
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,775
you can do really cool things with. So...

41
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:12,923
Find the people who are looking for a game like yours.

42
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:15,246
I don't care how weird your game is.

43
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,087
I don't care how niche you think it is.

44
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:20,731
There is a human being out there who wants it and wants to play it.

45
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:23,714
But you cannot trust your audience to find you.

46
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:25,696
You have to find them.

47
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:31,682
So get out there and say, oh, you like video games about rabbits picking up carrots?

48
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:32,122
Guess what?

49
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:36,986
I make that. And you're going to make somebody's day and that person is going to go and say,

50
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:41,889
I have been looking for a game with rabbits and carrots for months. Somebody made it. Hooray.

51
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,931
Be that person. Be that game developer that can give somebody what they want.

52
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:49,854
But find them. Because they're not, they don't know. They don't know to look for you.

53
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,273
So do that.

54
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:55,054
But with that comes this exception.

55
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,215
Limit your storefront presence.

56
00:03:57,855 --> 00:04:01,797
This is something that we did wrong when we first started.

57
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,858
And it sounds counterintuitive.

58
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:07,999
You think, well, the more places I sell my game, the more money I'm going to make and

59
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,420
then I'm going to be a millionaire.

60
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:17,971
No, you're not. You're really, really not. It doesn't work that way. And so when I say we had

61
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:24,075
too many storefronts, I mean we had too many storefronts. These are all the places that you

62
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:30,080
could get black ice when we first started, not including our own website. And just to kind of

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,004
break that down, before we got on Steam, this is how our sales looked. And you notice that's

64
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:40,268
only four out of the many that I showed you. There's a reason.

65
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:45,537
People didn't buy them on that storefront. They're not going to go to all these different

66
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:50,180
storefronts to buy our game. And what's more is once you make it onto steam, that's what it

67
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,323
looks like now when we sell black eyes. We replaced the humble widget with the humble

68
00:04:55,363 --> 00:05:01,286
store. The only reason that 8% is a big number like 8 is because we were on their front page

69
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:05,729
for a while. So once you're on steam, step back a little bit.

70
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:10,210
Reasons to limit your store front presence is it's less work for you.

71
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:14,953
When we first started out, we thought that the coolest thing we could do was push out

72
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:15,734
a patch a week.

73
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:22,150
So it wasn't just one patch a week, it was one patch a week to eight different store

74
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,491
fronts.

75
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:28,578
And oh my God, did they make sure that was the hardest thing to do.

76
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:34,164
Because every store front works differently, everyone gets patch notes differently, and

77
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:37,348
so you're pushing a patch to one place, pushing a patch to another place.

78
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:39,090
Don't do that.

79
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:39,690
Don't do it.

80
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,831
It's not worth the trouble.

81
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:48,096
Have one really good build on a couple sites instead of one kind of okay build on like

82
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:49,177
10 sites.

83
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:52,039
And also, it's important to build and focus your brand.

84
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:52,619
Think about...

85
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,281
What you want your game to be and who you want to play it.

86
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,061
And that goes back to conventions.

87
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:07,343
If your game is educational, then don't worry about all these other sites that focus on FPS's and war games.

88
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:13,345
Find some cool education sites that focus on maybe selling to teachers or selling to classrooms.

89
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:20,987
If your game is—if you don't even want to sell it. If you just want to give it away, try looking at charities, non-profits, things like that.

90
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,187
Learn more at www.cdc.gov

91
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:23,786
Make your game

92
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:27,867
tailored to the people you want to give it to.

93
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:32,028
And doing your homework with storefronts is the best way to do that.

94
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,970
Because there are a lot out there, and they're all going to come out of the woodwork

95
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,650
once they see you're selling to one place.

96
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,331
We got emails on emails,

97
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,232
Hey, I have this storefront.

98
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:44,833
Would you like to give me 50% of your earnings and I'll put it on my store?

99
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:45,533
No.

100
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:46,474
No, I wouldn't.

101
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:47,674
And it's tempting.

102
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,295
It's tempting when you're not making any money from your game.

103
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:52,936
50% of the cut is going to sound really good.

104
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:54,617
But don't do it.

105
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:58,181
And I'm going to get to value later, because value is super important.

106
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,564
And that goes in with price perception control.

107
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:07,070
Out of all the storefronts we had, one of them, they decided when and for how much our

108
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,051
game would go on sale.

109
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:10,674
And that was really tricky.

110
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,497
And we got lucky that we could opt out.

111
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:20,996
But we had to tell them, excuse me, I don't think I want my $5 game 75% off today.

112
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:22,557
And then they would, okay, fine.

113
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:26,579
And so you want to make sure that your game

114
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:30,943
is selling for what it's worth. And again, going back to you're

115
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:34,724
going to get stuck in this mindset of screw it, I need $10

116
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:39,585
now. Fine, it's a $30 game, whatever, I'll take it. Don't

117
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:43,186
take it. And controlling that price perception, there's a

118
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:47,748
really nifty plug-in that I'm sure all of you know that will

119
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:52,189
tell you where a game is being sold the cheapest.

120
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:59,361
So it doesn't matter if your game is being sold for $10 on 100 websites. If one site is selling

121
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:05,946
it for $5, everybody is going to go there and buy it for $5. So you need to be in control of how

122
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:10,229
much your game costs. And that goes into something else you should do, which is take yourself

123
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:10,969
seriously.

124
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:20,253
With the indie scene, nobody wants to be the boss guy. Nobody wants to be the suit or the

125
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:24,379
you need to do this and you need to do that and I'm a professional. It's like, nah, man,

126
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,722
I'm just an indie dev. I'm chill. I'm cool.

127
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:30,483
But people don't want to take you seriously if you're chill and cool.

128
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:32,124
And then nobody's going to buy your game.

129
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:34,205
Nobody's going to want to feature your game.

130
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:36,746
Because then you look like somebody who doesn't know what you're doing.

131
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:40,327
And so you need to set professional standards.

132
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:44,329
One of the worst things we did when we were starting out is because we were new.

133
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:48,350
We weren't comfortable telling contractors that they had a due date.

134
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,312
So we ended up with assets.

135
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:53,372
We've been developing this game for three years.

136
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:55,713
Their assets I still haven't received from artists.

137
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:59,335
I'm just never going to get them. There's a cool poster. Not

138
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,223
going to have that. An animation. Nope.

139
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:08,998
All kinds of things. You need to do that even if it feels uncomfortable. You need to do that. You

140
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:15,283
need to say, no, I'm sorry, I need this by this time. And then once you get that, you'll get

141
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:19,527
comfortable with it. And then it will make everything so much easier for you. Because you

142
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:25,292
need to treat your game like it has value. Because it does. I don't care how terrible your game is.

143
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:30,256
It could have the worst graphics and it could lag every half second.

144
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:35,320
But you're putting your time into this game. You're putting your everything into this game.

145
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:39,524
And if you don't treat it like it's worth something, nobody else is going to treat it

146
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:44,227
like it's worth something either. So you need to step back, look at what you're working on,

147
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:48,891
and say, hell yeah. Like, this is worth it. And I'm going to let other people know that

148
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:53,215
they need to treat it that way, too. So get feedback.

149
00:09:54,044 --> 00:10:01,307
Don't shy away from that. Don't baby your game and coddle it and say, no, it's not ready and go away and you can't look at it.

150
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:08,210
Like, don't do that. Get it out there. Put it out there early, often, and everywhere.

151
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,772
And when I say everywhere, these are some amazing places to get feedback for your game.

152
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:18,354
Reddit was one of the best places that we got awesome feedback from our game.

153
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,135
Not just like...

154
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:26,099
Indie dev or game dev subreddits. We were on the cyberpunk subreddit. Just posting early

155
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:31,263
screenshots of our demo of our earliest build and saying, hey, guys, we make a cyberpunk

156
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:36,846
game. Is this cool? They were like, yeah, this is cool. Find, again, I know I keep going

157
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:42,270
back to it, those really niche communities. Find a small community that fits with the

158
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,792
themes of your game and ask them what they think.

159
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,634
Also listen to what people have to say.

160
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:52,056
It's really easy to give people an opportunity to talk,

161
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:54,718
but it's impossible sometimes to listen

162
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,799
to what they have to say.

163
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,043
I had maybe 50 people tell me in a row at a convention

164
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:03,524
that the crosshair in our game is hard to see.

165
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:05,786
And I was like, no it's not.

166
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:07,467
It's right there.

167
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:12,511
I know, but I just, and I'm watching these people who,

168
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:21,087
I'm wrong. They're taking time out of their day to play my game, and they're trying to tell me

169
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:26,449
this part of your game doesn't really work, and I'm like, no, I can see the crosshair.

170
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:30,870
So 50 people the whole day. And then the second day of the convention,

171
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,952
uh, just, has anyone ever told you, like, your crosshair's kind of hard to see,

172
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:41,934
and they're squinting at my computer, and I'm back there like, no, nobody's ever said that to me.

173
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:50,407
And I went home and we fixed the cross hair. And people loved it. Not a single complaint

174
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:55,329
since. So it's going to bruise your ego. It is. You're going to want to think that you're

175
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,250
the best game developer in the world. You're going to want to think that you know exactly

176
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,851
what you're doing because it's your baby. But

177
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:06,470
You got to listen. People are going to sit down and the first thing out of their mouth, you

178
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,374
need to remember what it is. The first thing they say, good or bad, that's their instant

179
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:15,718
immediate impression, you need to write it down if you're not going to remember. If it's, I

180
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:19,421
can't see your cross hair, the colors don't make sense. I don't get it.

181
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,181
Take the time to talk to them.

182
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:23,001
What don't you get?

183
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:24,282
Ask that question.

184
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:24,762
It's simple.

185
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:26,182
People love to talk.

186
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:29,344
People love to tell you what they don't like about stuff.

187
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:32,025
So take that opportunity.

188
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,526
Be like, good, tell me what you don't like about it.

189
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:35,927
Make it better.

190
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:41,029
All of this goes into the most important thing.

191
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:44,790
Keep your day job.

192
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,441
And I'm not going to be the first indie developer to tell you that, and I pray to God I'm not

193
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:55,923
the last indie developer to tell you that, but you need to keep your day job.

194
00:12:56,524 --> 00:13:04,467
No matter how much fun it is to work on your game, no matter how much time you think you

195
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:09,069
can spend on it, and kind of, like, maybe I don't really need that game job.

196
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:13,331
And I'm going to give you some real logistical adult reasons why, which is the first one

197
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:15,011
is you subsidize your game costs.

198
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:22,541
Your game is not going to make money right away. If it makes money at all. Let's be real. So you

199
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:27,027
need to pay for things out of your own pocket. Our first couple conventions, that was all us.

200
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:31,314
Paying our contractors, paying our artists, that came from us.

201
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:34,356
You have to have that available.

202
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:38,759
And if you don't, if you think, I'm just going to quit my job and I'm going to become an

203
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,021
indie game developer, it's not free making a game.

204
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,122
It's work and it's money.

205
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:52,627
And quitting your day job eliminates any chance you have of subsidizing game costs.

206
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:54,889
Also, you need a safety net.

207
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,201
Your game might fail and it hurts to think about that and it hurts to admit it to yourself

208
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,901
and to keep that in your back pocket while you're developing a game.

209
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:06,122
It could fail.

210
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:11,883
And if it does, you need to have something that's going to prop you up.

211
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:13,603
It cannot be your game.

212
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:20,384
I hate to tell you that and it sounds so negative, I guess, but you need to have something there

213
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:22,145
because that's your livelihood.

214
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,325
You can't play with that just because you want to make a cool...

215
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:33,928
Platformer. Like, that's not worth it. You get to define success and failure when you keep your day

216
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:40,910
job. If your game fails and you don't get to eat dinner that week, you have failed. You don't get

217
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,751
to deny that. You don't get to say that that's not a failure. Because it is a failure.

218
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:53,429
If you have income already, if you have something to carry you, you get to define what success

219
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:54,150
and failure is.

220
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,533
For us, success was having the game pay for itself.

221
00:14:58,674 --> 00:14:59,395
That's all we wanted.

222
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,858
All we wanted was a game that could eventually sustain itself.

223
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:04,039
And we got there.

224
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,921
And we got there because we kept our day jobs.

225
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,963
And we got there because we were...

226
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:15,278
fortunate enough to have that foresight and put ourselves in a position where we could

227
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:21,841
define what success is to us. And I want that for you. I want you to be able to pay your

228
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:27,484
rent. I want you to be able to get your kids a new backpack for school. Don't tie those

229
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:32,006
things to the success and failure of your game because it's not worth it. But it will

230
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,867
be worth it when it succeeds.

231
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:42,311
If you don't have all that stress. So I wanted to end with that because I've heard so many

232
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:49,514
horror stories from other devs losing houses, not struggling to get by, and that does not need to

233
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:55,377
be you. I'm here telling you the industry does not need to be that difficult. If you have a day job,

234
00:15:55,457 --> 00:16:01,740
keep it. If you don't have a day job, find one, keep it, and then work on your game. So...

235
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:09,370
That's all I have to say. That's our game. That's me. That's Garrett. I would absolutely love

236
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,191
for you guys to come and find me after this, ask me questions, talk. You can talk to Garrett. He's

237
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:20,813
lead developer so he will be able to answer more technical questions. But you guys can do this. You

238
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,833
can do this. If I can frickin' do this and I was a high school teacher, you can do this. Like,

239
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:32,615
come on. Just do everything I said and you'll be totally fine. So, yeah, awesome. Thanks, guys.

240
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,436
applause

241
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:35,496
applause

242
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:36,156
applause

243
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:36,596
applause

244
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:37,297
applause

245
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:37,677
sigh

246
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:37,977
hello

247
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:04,231
This is my, the longest talk in English ever.

248
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:18,561
Yeah, my name is Sun Park, and I'm a creative director at Turtle Cream.

249
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:22,504
Turtle Cream is an independent game studio based in South Korea.

250
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:28,817
And in 2009, I founded our studio as a school assignment

251
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:34,740
project. And since 2011, we've turned our studio into a

252
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,842
professional game studio. We made three free-roll games and

253
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:42,124
two commercial games so far. Today we will talk about our

254
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:43,965
latest project, 6180 The Moment.

255
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:56,109
So in our team, we are just two man team. So our programmer,

256
00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:03,093
Youngmin, do code and I do everything but code. Except

257
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:08,977
music. Including us, a total of five people worked on our game

258
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:12,459
6180 the moon. A different programmer made the original

259
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,283
version of game maker and two different music composers

260
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,383
created the music.

261
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:24,412
The game is available on Steam, Xbox One and Wii U so far and will launch on iOS soon.

262
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:33,577
Android? We don't have Android phone. Sorry. I actually didn't work on, yeah. That's good.

263
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:40,581
Yeah. So maybe you don't know well about our game. So this is trailer.

264
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,972
As you see, this is a really minimalistic game.

265
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:51,674
We've connected the top and bottom of the screen so players can jump extremely high through the screen.

266
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:52,875
Yeah.

267
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:56,676
I like that sound.

268
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:01,438
Okay, skip it.

269
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:11,237
The first prototype was made in a game jam. One day my previous freelance programmer Jerome and I

270
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:17,982
visited my friend's game studio. And then they were doing their internal game jam at that time.

271
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:25,907
When we arrived there, there was only one hour and 43 minutes left until the end of the jam.

272
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:31,430
Jerome and I decided to join in that jam. We had less than two hours.

273
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:38,802
Jerome said, hey, I prepared things to make a platformer game so you should make an awesome

274
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:48,568
idea for it. Within three minutes. Okay. I agreed and started to work on my, our game's

275
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:58,295
main concept. So I'm always interested in making weird fun games. So this time I wanted

276
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,656
to make a weird platformer game.

277
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:10,531
So how can we make a weird platformer game? I have only three minutes. At first I thought that the

278
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:19,616
most essential thing in a platformer game is jump. So I tried to make an idea for kind of weird

279
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:28,521
jumping. Suddenly I realized that all platformer games have a limit on the jump height. It's

280
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,262
screen size as you see.

281
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:35,903
So I wanted to make a jumping mechanic that exceeds that jump

282
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:39,825
limit. Finally we did it by connecting top and bottom of

283
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:48,028
the screen. This is it. The first version is this video. And

284
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:53,030
yeah, it has just four tiny levels. We really love this

285
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,311
prototype. So we decided to make a full version.

286
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:04,191
In this version, this white circle, yeah, it was just circle in the first version,

287
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:14,835
have a skill which make it stop in the mid-air. Yeah, maybe you will see that soon. Yeah.

288
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:18,337
As you see, it could stop infinitely, but...

289
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:27,554
In the full version, we changed it as one time for one jump if the player had the item.

290
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,718
So we had a play test with our close friends.

291
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:34,479
They also like our games.

292
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,142
Of course, there were both good and bad feedback.

293
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:43,445
But we decided to concentrate only on good feedback.

294
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:46,207
Why?

295
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:47,508
Why good feedback only?

296
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:53,838
First, we are not veteran developers. Though we've made

297
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:59,280
games for several years, I think we are still newbie developers.

298
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,142
If we couldn't make a perfect game, then we wanted to make a

299
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,903
game which have its own color.

300
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:13,822
So I also think maximizing good points goes toward minimizing

301
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:18,266
bad points as well. So to keep improving our game's unique

302
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:22,749
color, I made a game design checklist based in only good

303
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:30,655
feedback. The most important purpose of this list is making

304
00:22:30,735 --> 00:22:32,176
every build fun.

305
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:38,378
This is a part of the list. They are mostly for supporting our

306
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:43,182
main mechanics. Extremely long jump through the screen. Let's

307
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:48,087
take a look at guidelines. We thought our jump mechanic is

308
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:53,212
super unique. But whenever I added new elements in our game,

309
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:58,256
I felt like the game was becoming too normal.

310
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:04,668
So I boldly quit expanding contents. It was just try to

311
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:10,210
make a tiny sexy game. I wanted to end the game before people

312
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:15,032
felt like our game mechanics wasn't fresh anymore. Actually

313
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:20,954
the average clear time is just around 60, 180 seconds. Like our

314
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:25,016
game title. We didn't intend to make it though. Yeah.

315
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:30,906
Lots of people said our game is too short, but I think this is

316
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:35,631
totally enough game play length. If we make our game longer with

317
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:42,957
same puzzle elements, it must be a loose a bit. I think

318
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:51,370
Our main mechanics super long jump in connected space would be a little complicated to some

319
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:56,536
players. Actually in the game the player should think before almost every jump.

320
00:23:57,331 --> 00:24:04,133
So the core mechanic is already complicated in our case. To reduce the difficulty and make the

321
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:11,895
game more simple, we used only common puzzle objects like breaking thing, blinking thing, and

322
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:19,417
keep falling thing. They are really common things in platformer genre, so they could support our

323
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:23,778
jump mechanic without elevating the difficulty of our game.

324
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:29,573
The most important thing while game designing is checking

325
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:32,895
whether game object block both of the top and bottom of the

326
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:39,037
screen. As I've said again and again, long jump in open space

327
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:44,400
is main feature of our game. But if we block the space,

328
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:50,916
it would become a normal platformer. So I always try to

329
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:55,079
keep both top and bottom of the screen open and there is only

330
00:24:55,939 --> 00:25:00,162
one exception to this. It was breaking blocks. Because the

331
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:06,106
space would be open after breaking. I really like these

332
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:10,749
breaking ones. In the early stage of development, we said

333
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:13,831
it's sound effect like glass crashing.

334
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:19,928
But I wanted to make it a kind of music thing after we made

335
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:20,849
background music.

336
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:26,212
So we made five musical sounds which fit with each BGM and

337
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:28,793
play them randomly when they are broken.

338
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:34,316
Yeah, like making music through the game play.

339
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:42,521
So yeah.

340
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:43,121
Pretty.

341
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:54,120
We also tried to make all sound effects in-game as a music thing, but as a result we just made only this breaking sound as musical sound.

342
00:25:54,541 --> 00:26:04,153
It was my opinion. I thought that would be more charming if we make only several musical experiences in the whole game.

343
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:11,485
We didn't want to make a hard game. Basically I hope more

344
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:16,110
people could see our game's ending. That allows us to show

345
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,013
the whole thing we made to players. So I designed all

346
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:23,717
levels as fun experience, not as a kind of challenging thing.

347
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:29,042
For this, placing save points in each level is really important.

348
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:33,963
Basically I placed save points right before hard challenge,

349
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:37,505
but I tried not to make it too often.

350
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:44,128
It was just for reducing kind of useless action before retry.

351
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:51,023
For the same reason, I tried a lot to place spikes in proper

352
00:26:51,063 --> 00:26:55,805
location. While making games, if I tried to make the player

353
00:26:55,825 --> 00:27:01,706
die, they always die. So I tried to make them to threaten

354
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:07,227
players, not to kill players. In addition to making our games

355
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:13,369
long jump more attractive, I placed the spikes slightly down

356
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:15,590
position on the normal jump path.

357
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:27,291
It could give a feeling like kind of slightly good jump to players. That makes the player

358
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:28,453
excited without dying.

359
00:27:30,153 --> 00:27:33,536
We had such an interesting experience while we made the

360
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:38,801
second phase of the game. I made about 200 levels and selected 50

361
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:45,246
levels for the game. At first we set five words which have ten

362
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:49,209
levels and tried to make a different gravity space in each

363
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:53,113
word. Like braid did it well with variety mechanics with

364
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:55,455
time. But everything wasn't good.

365
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,961
As you know, there are tons of gravity puzzles in the world,

366
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:04,443
so it was really hard to make a kind of unique gravity-based

367
00:28:04,623 --> 00:28:05,003
puzzle.

368
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:08,724
One day I just reversed gravity in some levels,

369
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:11,004
and the magic has started.

370
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:16,906
Frankly, reversed gravity is one of the most popular gravity

371
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:19,467
puzzles, so I didn't expect anything.

372
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:23,428
But it changed all levels totally different.

373
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:26,389
It's because of our game's jump height.

374
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,292
In other platformer games, the player's character cannot touch

375
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:36,074
the bottom side of the platform. On the other hand, in our game,

376
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:41,156
the moon can touch that bottom side after jumping through the

377
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:46,379
screen. So in normal levels, some spikes aren't really

378
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:51,501
threatening, but in the reverse gravity, they become critical

379
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:53,122
obstacles in some cases.

380
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:59,110
So this is normal level.

381
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,732
It's a really tiny level.

382
00:29:05,314 --> 00:29:07,176
And when we reversed gravity,

383
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:10,659
it's a bit different, but yeah.

384
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:19,866
It have a bit different mechanics in the same space.

385
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,122
So as a result, we've got 53 levels for the second page. We

386
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:32,984
should have to edit a bit several levels, though. As I

387
00:29:33,044 --> 00:29:37,045
mentioned when I talked about puzzle objects, if the game

388
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:41,547
mechanic is unique enough, the freshness remains when it mixed

389
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,108
with familiar things.

390
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:50,884
Let's talk about audio. Our game's graphic style is very minimal, so we wanted to fill

391
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:58,028
the lack of visual with audio. Actually, we didn't have an artist when we made this game,

392
00:29:58,148 --> 00:30:05,112
so I did the art as well, even though I don't have any professional art skill. That's why

393
00:30:05,212 --> 00:30:09,574
our game has only circles, rectangles, and triangles in the game.

394
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:22,028
When we made the first prototype, yeah, this is one of our games, BGM. When we made the first

395
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:30,557
prototype, we used music from my favorite Japanese artist, Ray Harakami. He died two years

396
00:30:30,637 --> 00:30:32,078
ago. RIP.

397
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:40,621
The music has a kind of space feeling and it was a great mix with our long jump mechanics.

398
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:47,667
So I requested that kind of space feeling music to our composer, actually my wife.

399
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:54,412
This game has a bit slower pace because the player should think before jumping.

400
00:30:55,193 --> 00:31:00,157
So I think our slow background music makes the player calm down properly.

401
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:04,500
And it also makes a great atmosphere when mixed with

402
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:13,562
musical SFX. Yeah. This is good. So now I'll talk about our

403
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:18,063
porting process to different platforms for the last. Basically

404
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:23,084
the Xbox One and iOS version are almost exactly the same as our

405
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:27,305
original PC version. But the Wii U version is a special case.

406
00:31:28,643 --> 00:31:31,484
After launching the original game maker version, we showed

407
00:31:31,644 --> 00:31:39,266
our game at E3's Indicate Showcase 2013. We met Nintendo

408
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:44,168
representative there and decided to make a console version. At

409
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:50,029
first, Nintendo proposed that we make a 3DS version, but we heard

410
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:52,830
that making a game for 3DS is too hard.

411
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:58,313
So we thought that if we port our game to Unity 3D then we

412
00:31:58,353 --> 00:32:01,975
could support Wii U and also support many other platforms

413
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:08,959
easier. So we decided to port the game to Unity 3D first. The

414
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:10,920
Wii U gamepad was really interesting.

415
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:17,168
It was too big, though. We talked a lot about how to use

416
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:21,230
the gamepad screen in our game. Basically, we are always

417
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:25,832
interested in making something new and weird thing, so we

418
00:32:25,872 --> 00:32:29,773
didn't want to use it as a typical second screen. We

419
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:34,595
didn't want to make it mini-map viewer or inventory like other

420
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:34,895
games.

421
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:41,775
Our game featured connected space as the main mechanic so we

422
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:46,139
tried to connect both of screens. So the player can jump

423
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,524
from Wii U game pad to TV and vice versa. Yes, super

424
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:55,108
complicated. Of course, that means

425
00:32:56,249 --> 00:33:01,172
that all our existing levels didn't work in two screen space

426
00:33:01,453 --> 00:33:06,116
so we had to make entirely new levels for the Wii U version.

427
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:12,680
Frankly speaking, this is not a popular use of the Wii U game

428
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,383
pad. We already knew that Wii U players like its TV off feature

429
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:23,007
but we didn't want to quit our experiment as a developer even

430
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:25,228
though we would fail to succeed with this.

431
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:30,810
We wanted to finish this experiment well. Like the

432
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,474
original PC version, connected TV and game pad would be

433
00:33:34,574 --> 00:33:38,959
frustrating to some people. So I tried to reduce that

434
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:47,908
confusion. So what? Why? Why don't move?

435
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:06,228
Oh, sorry. The timing. Let's get back. Okay. So this is

436
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:14,334
gameplay footage of Wii U version. Complicated? Yeah. For

437
00:34:14,394 --> 00:34:17,837
example, I tried not to make levels that make player move

438
00:34:17,937 --> 00:34:24,602
super fast between TV and game pad. So, yeah. This is

439
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:25,322
gameplay.

440
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:33,450
We released Wii version several weeks ago in U.S. and Europe. Many reviewers said that this is the

441
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:43,461
best version of 6180 the moon. I think we did well. As a result we made a game which has both

442
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:44,662
likes and dislikes.

443
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:48,607
Some people said our minimal graphic is really beautiful.

444
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:52,751
But others said it's like an Atari game.

445
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:57,756
Also some people said our game is really experimental and

446
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:58,136
unique.

447
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:03,541
And others said it's another copycat of wee wee wee wee wee

448
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:05,583
or geometry dash.

449
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:07,945
Anyway.

450
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:27,239
Yeah. If one of you thought about it, try our game. It's totally different. Anyway, we really

451
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:35,745
loved our game. Why should I care about the taste of other people? I'm Indy. I played hundreds of

452
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:43,312
times while testing our game, but I think this is really great fun game if I play this game again

453
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:43,792
now.

454
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:53,243
Yes, so we are indie and I love it. That's enough. So the most

455
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:55,305
important lesson we learned is

456
00:35:56,951 --> 00:36:00,794
love our own game. This is the most important thing while making

457
00:36:01,014 --> 00:36:05,877
games. Every time we decided something we did, something we

458
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:11,460
did what we liked, not what people liked. And we are

459
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,863
satisfied with it. And think, I'm not a special person. You

460
00:36:16,923 --> 00:36:23,107
too. We are not special. So if we love our own game, others

461
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:24,448
would love your game.

462
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:30,900
Right? So love your own game. Thanks for listening.

463
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:09,764
So I'm going to show you how to do this. There we go. What's

464
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:14,287
happening? Can we just do regular? Can you see it? Yeah.

465
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:39,308
Yeah. Awesome. Hi. My name is A.V.B. and I wrote a game called we know the devil. And I

466
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,260
Now you're going to know a whole lot more about the devil.

467
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:52,021
So let's see.

468
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:57,242
I've been a games critic for an awful long time, about eight years, which is horrifying.

469
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:00,523
And I've been freelancing for a lot of different places.

470
00:38:01,084 --> 00:38:03,984
I'm currently running my own alt website called Zeal.

471
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:10,366
And last summer from June 2nd to September 12th, we conceived of and completed a short

472
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:12,146
visual novel called We Know the Devil.

473
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:18,393
It's a visual novel about choosing which of the three teens trapped in a weird and unsettling

474
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:23,157
Christian summer camp will hang out and maybe kiss and which one they'll leave out and then

475
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:26,781
what happens when the devil shows up for them all in the end.

476
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:27,862
You know, normal stuff.

477
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:33,107
It's heavily steeped in the aesthetic of unbearable midwestern summers, 80 whores moving and

478
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,369
growing up gay in repressive religious communities.

479
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:39,372
It has a unique mechanic to it actually and I'm going to spend

480
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:42,294
a lot of this talk talking about how the mechanic of the visual

481
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:46,776
novel, because visual novels do have game mechanics. Screw you.

482
00:38:48,137 --> 00:38:52,719
They are games. And how that created a structure when it came

483
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:55,840
to outlining and designing this process. Because we made this

484
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,922
game in 100 days actually. Which is an awfully short time. Like

485
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,804
we didn't have, I pitched the idea on June 2nd. We had an

486
00:39:03,964 --> 00:39:05,505
outline a week from then.

487
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:08,067
And then it was like a whirlwind process.

488
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:12,070
So I'm going to mostly focus on what I did,

489
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,152
because I'm the writer and designer.

490
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:17,034
I wasn't the programmer or the artist.

491
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:20,177
There are super wonderful, talented people

492
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:21,097
who can be here today.

493
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,279
And they have their own perspectives.

494
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:26,141
But I thought that it would be most useful

495
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:27,702
to frame this as a writer.

496
00:39:27,722 --> 00:39:29,864
How did I design this as a writer?

497
00:39:30,224 --> 00:39:33,507
How do you marry writing and game design together?

498
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:39,271
And I hope that it will become clear that there's a lot of the

499
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:43,093
larger structural ways in which you frame long pieces of

500
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:45,795
narrative writing that are not linear are actually very similar

501
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:49,257
to game design. If you want to write something longer than an

502
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:52,179
essay, at least for me, I have to break it into smaller chunks.

503
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:56,822
And the structure and the mechanics of We Know the Devil

504
00:39:57,242 --> 00:40:02,405
helped us do that. So I'll go into those in a little bit.

505
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:07,316
So this is my talk, how to finish a visual novel in less

506
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:09,358
than a year if you also know how to do a bunch of other

507
00:40:09,378 --> 00:40:14,140
stuff and here's that other stuff. I won't spend too long

508
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,042
on this but I want you to know this was my first commercial

509
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:21,285
game and it was also the artist and co-creative director Mia

510
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:25,827
Schwartz's first video game. But neither of us had shipped

511
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:33,212
anything before that. Is it auto advancing? Okay. Cool. I'm

512
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:33,572
watching you.

513
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:35,451
Um...

514
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:39,733
But part of the reason why we were able to do that is because

515
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:42,295
we were both experienced story tellers in our own mediums. We

516
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:45,057
had this structure that allowed us to start applying it to

517
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:50,881
games. And we also knew an amazing team, the date Naito who

518
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:55,324
makes visual novels in HTML 5 and they had a programmer, a

519
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:57,846
project manager and gave us a whole bunch of start up capital.

520
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:02,809
So part of a subtext to this is make sure that you know people.

521
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,611
Make friends. Create like

522
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:13,073
make cool stuff on your own and you might be able to find some really great collaborative partners later on if you prove yourself

523
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:20,115
in your own field even if it has nothing to do with games, they'll be impressed enough by your your gumption and

524
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:21,675
All right

525
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:23,016
so

526
00:41:23,936 --> 00:41:27,837
All right, so this is we know the devil or at least this is what we know the devil looks like to me

527
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:34,034
Until a few weeks before we shipped. I wrote this whole

528
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:36,597
thing in scrivener which is a wonderful program that I'll talk

529
00:41:37,278 --> 00:41:41,442
more, I'll talk your face off about this. It's really useful

530
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:44,746
because it is a non-linear writing program. It lets you

531
00:41:44,866 --> 00:41:48,850
subdivide things. If you look at the left-hand side of the screen

532
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,572
and I'm going to zoom in on it, I promise.

533
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:55,874
You can see how every branch of the game is subdivided into

534
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:58,615
different little folders. So whenever there was a choice,

535
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:03,377
then I could have, I could nestle those choices together.

536
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:07,258
And it helped for me visually and it also helped for the

537
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:15,681
overall structure. So what I'm going to do is step by step.

538
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:21,558
Go from the initial concept to the day when I figured out how

539
00:42:21,578 --> 00:42:24,180
many words long this visual novel was going to be.

540
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,465
Because all of that stuff, about seven days into

541
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,928
development, I was like, this is going to be 15,000 words

542
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:32,188
long.

543
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:36,432
And I knew that because of the groundwork that I did in the

544
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:37,273
first seven days.

545
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:38,274
So let's go.

546
00:42:39,095 --> 00:42:43,258
through it. Here's the plan. First there's the premise and

547
00:42:43,278 --> 00:42:47,580
the mechanics. Like what defines this game. Second, because this

548
00:42:47,641 --> 00:42:51,183
is a character driven game and there are three characters in

549
00:42:51,223 --> 00:42:53,965
it, we needed to have a firm idea of who they were, what

550
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:57,567
they looked like, what their personalities were. Because the

551
00:42:57,627 --> 00:43:00,609
entire mechanic of the game is putting these characters in a

552
00:43:00,649 --> 00:43:02,931
room with each other and seeing

553
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:09,757
You actually have their three main characters and at every

554
00:43:09,817 --> 00:43:12,299
choice point you decide which two of them hang out and which

555
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:17,023
one gets left out. And the ending is different depending on

556
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:20,026
which two were together the most and which person was left out

557
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:23,769
the most. So two people will find some sort of happiness with

558
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:28,153
each other and then the one who is left off will have an awesome

559
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:29,854
time with the devil at the end.

560
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:36,136
So that's it. And then so from the beginning premise and

561
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:39,776
mechanics, the character profiles, and then the chapter

562
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:45,938
branch and editing structure was basically what was the nitty

563
00:43:45,978 --> 00:43:49,439
gritty of this bee. And from that we got to go to the word

564
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:55,020
count. So let's start. With the premise.

565
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:19,246
Because we both wanted to actually complete this game in a month, because we originally did this for the I Love You Game Jam, which is a visual novel dating sim game jam that takes place every month, Mia, my artist, was like, I want something that feels complete. I don't want like a proof of concept or a vertical slice or something like that. Let's make a short story in visual novel form.

566
00:44:20,047 --> 00:44:22,268
And I thought that was a really good idea because I didn't want

567
00:44:22,308 --> 00:44:26,371
it to feel unsatisfying. I wanted to take this concept and

568
00:44:26,411 --> 00:44:29,874
explore it as much as I could. So that meant like the smallest

569
00:44:29,914 --> 00:44:32,856
possible implementation of the single mechanic. There was

570
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:35,978
originally four characters in we know the devil and that's

571
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:39,600
exponentially more interactions between those characters. So we

572
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,803
cut it down to three just as a sort of like.

573
00:44:44,003 --> 00:44:48,507
Yeah, three people. That's all you need to have three different combinations. Three

574
00:44:48,527 --> 00:44:54,912
different people, three endings, a very easy to see branching structure.

575
00:44:57,169 --> 00:44:59,411
And from that we started coming up with premise and

576
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:02,293
aesthetics that would emphasize the mechanics but also be

577
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:05,895
within our budget. So 80s horror movies. We decided to use

578
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:08,477
realistic photograph backgrounds. We actually took

579
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:10,859
them with a disposable camera in the woods. It was really,

580
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:16,123
really scary. I was sure I was going to get ax murdered. But

581
00:45:16,543 --> 00:45:18,805
because of that, we were able to have something that was really

582
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:22,488
thematically resonant but also very easy to do because we

583
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:24,689
didn't have the money for a background artist and we didn't

584
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,421
I want to go through all of that effort.

585
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:34,263
And it's also representative of other indie visual novels,

586
00:45:34,843 --> 00:45:39,825
like Tsukihime and Umineko, which are Japanese visual novels,

587
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,887
actually do kind of like cheaply filtered backgrounds.

588
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,008
We thought if we unfiltered them, they would stand out more

589
00:45:46,068 --> 00:45:47,849
and seem like a really cool artistic choice,

590
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:51,891
instead of like we were just lazy and didn't have a lot of money.

591
00:45:54,072 --> 00:45:56,914
The small cast was also really important because we ran into

592
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:01,338
memory constraints later on. So let's talk about character

593
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:06,022
development. So Mila and I had a really good working relationship

594
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:09,826
where I would basically pitch, I would write up this profile of

595
00:46:09,846 --> 00:46:13,689
the character, she would draw that character. And then the two

596
00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:15,691
of us would just kind of like spit ball and come up with

597
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:16,732
scenarios for that.

598
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:19,614
For those characters interacting with each other.

599
00:46:19,634 --> 00:46:21,655
Because Mia's not just like a character designer

600
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,476
and a visual artist, she's a cartoonist.

601
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:26,618
And she does storytelling and comics.

602
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,440
I think comics are such an untapped medium for video games.

603
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,641
It's like we want somebody,

604
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:34,502
we want to like hire the art person.

605
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:35,663
It's like just draw this thing

606
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:37,143
and I'm going to put it in my game.

607
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:40,145
My relationship with Mia though was more like

608
00:46:40,285 --> 00:46:42,446
we designed the characters together.

609
00:46:42,506 --> 00:46:44,708
We co-created each and every one of them.

610
00:46:45,568 --> 00:46:49,229
Which is why I'm the co-creative lead on this title.

611
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:53,550
And even though I wrote every single word in this, the characters, the ideas for the

612
00:46:53,571 --> 00:47:00,033
characters, their personalities and stuff were shaped very much by Mia emailing or sending

613
00:47:00,053 --> 00:47:04,694
me a message in Slack at like 2 in the morning saying like, this vine is totally like Venus!

614
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:14,099
And those sorts of, like, us kind of like finding the characters and their preferences and their likes and dislikes in the world helped us come up with scenarios for them.

615
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:24,225
Because the whole game was going to be like, okay, we're going to put these, you can choose between these two characters drinking underage together or these two characters drinking underage together.

616
00:47:24,585 --> 00:47:26,786
What would it be like if they were in that situation?

617
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:32,229
Part of the reason why that's so, so important...

618
00:47:36,337 --> 00:47:41,480
So this was the first thing that I sent Mia of the scrivener

619
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:47,903
file and the final chapter list is on the other side. We came

620
00:47:48,023 --> 00:47:52,145
up with this when Mia was like, I need some sort of structure.

621
00:47:52,925 --> 00:47:55,806
We were going for a horror movie thing. Mia said let's just do

622
00:47:55,846 --> 00:47:58,668
it over the course of a single day. And I cut it to 12 hours

623
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:00,528
because it seemed like, oh, an evening.

624
00:48:02,656 --> 00:48:06,440
You know, from afternoon to early morning feels like an

625
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,601
appropriate length of time.

626
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,823
And this is a totally arbitrary mechanism.

627
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:13,947
But it allowed us essentially what is like no different than

628
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:17,791
like a world level structure like you would see in Mario or

629
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,013
like virtually any other like platform or something like

630
00:48:20,053 --> 00:48:20,974
that.

631
00:48:21,134 --> 00:48:21,835
It's just it's.

632
00:48:22,455 --> 00:48:25,996
Based off of this idea, but it ensures that we have 12 slots.

633
00:48:26,057 --> 00:48:28,537
We have to fill each of those 12 slots with something.

634
00:48:28,937 --> 00:48:30,038
What will go into them?

635
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:33,699
And how will the dramatic structure kind of like go from

636
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:33,919
there?

637
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:40,581
I decided that it would be, let's see, character work,

638
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,202
throw them together and what happens.

639
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:50,792
After a while of just bowling together, we decided that

640
00:48:50,832 --> 00:48:54,333
like, there's going to be seven different events, because

641
00:48:54,353 --> 00:48:57,153
that's going to create an uneven number of choices. And I

642
00:48:57,193 --> 00:49:00,114
decided to only have two possible pairings, even though

643
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:04,515
there's three possible pairings for each interaction, I decided

644
00:49:04,995 --> 00:49:08,376
to narrow it down to two, because it would force

645
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:11,176
characters to pick pairings that they didn't necessarily want,

646
00:49:11,537 --> 00:49:13,497
because they wouldn't always have their favorite pairing

647
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:16,798
available to them, and also because it would be less work.

648
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:20,159
And that was the really important thing.

649
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:26,421
Again, it's the smallest implementation of a really potentially huge idea.

650
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:31,503
And in order for us to explore and see that it worked, we really didn't need to go any

651
00:49:31,543 --> 00:49:32,243
more ambitious.

652
00:49:33,044 --> 00:49:37,025
And the less ambitious we were, the more able we were to actually do this.

653
00:49:37,705 --> 00:49:40,688
Like I said, this is about making a plan to write something

654
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,350
in one month so that you can actually write it in three and

655
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:47,554
a half months. If we had the more that we over scoped the

656
00:49:47,594 --> 00:49:49,375
more we would have over shot this completely.

657
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:58,517
All right. So word count goals. So I decided on this. We had

658
00:49:58,557 --> 00:50:01,078
the setting. We had the chapter structure. We knew that there

659
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:03,139
would be seven different choices. There would be an

660
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:08,221
intro chapter. There would be an extended ending sequence. So I

661
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:10,982
knew exactly how many of those little slots that I made in the

662
00:50:11,022 --> 00:50:13,143
scrivener file would exist.

663
00:50:14,064 --> 00:50:18,146
Practically within a few days of coming up with this concept.

664
00:50:18,386 --> 00:50:21,308
Then I decided, okay, what can I actually do as a writer?

665
00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:23,770
I can write about a thousand words a day.

666
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:28,553
And potentially I can write more than that.

667
00:50:29,013 --> 00:50:30,574
But if you've ever had the experience,

668
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:32,696
I know anyone who's ever written has had the experience

669
00:50:32,736 --> 00:50:34,697
of looking at a blank sheet of paper

670
00:50:35,258 --> 00:50:38,300
and having no idea what to put there for hours and hours.

671
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:41,261
No matter how good of a writer you are,

672
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,083
if you don't know what you're writing about,

673
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:52,437
You can't do it. Which is a very logical thing. So by coming up with this plan though, I knew what I

674
00:50:52,497 --> 00:50:57,861
had to write. I had a series of writing assignments for myself. Every one of those little empty

675
00:50:57,961 --> 00:51:02,525
files in the scrivener thing represented a thing that I knew that I needed to write. I needed to

676
00:51:02,565 --> 00:51:04,726
write these two characters.

677
00:51:06,175 --> 00:51:10,445
playing truth or dare under this circumstance. I need to write these other two characters

678
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:15,396
playing truth or dare under this circumstance. I need to write them with this scene. There's

679
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:16,077
this ending.

680
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:18,981
This person freaks out in this ending.

681
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:21,904
What would this other character freaking out in this ending look like?

682
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:26,368
Because of all of this visual novels, because of their choice structure, it gives you all

683
00:51:26,388 --> 00:51:32,575
of this beautiful parallel structure that's really easy to kind of like see the connections

684
00:51:32,635 --> 00:51:34,537
between but also continuously.

685
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,480
inform each other so that you're not reinventing the wheel

686
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,401
every time that you open up a file. Otherwise I would have

687
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:45,702
been staring at blank pages every single day trying to

688
00:51:45,762 --> 00:51:50,503
decide what happened. Instead I had basically assigned myself

689
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:56,445
homework. I'm really glad that I did this even though you'd

690
00:51:56,465 --> 00:51:58,305
think, oh, she can probably write

691
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:03,933
30,000 words in a month then. But that's what if you miss a

692
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:07,336
day. What if you go on vacation. What if something comes up. I

693
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:10,218
have a full-time job. So there were a lot of reasons why I

694
00:52:10,258 --> 00:52:16,944
couldn't meet this goal. As we'll see. So we had that plan.

695
00:52:19,146 --> 00:52:20,086
And it didn't quite work out.

696
00:52:20,812 --> 00:52:27,257
But it didn't quite work out enough that we had a structure for the rest of this to follow.

697
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:34,143
I didn't hit all of my word counts. I had a lot of metaphors that I hadn't decided what they meant yet.

698
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:39,683
My approach to world building is that you write the characters

699
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,485
interactions and you decide why all that happened later.

700
00:52:43,606 --> 00:52:46,448
Because you don't need like a big wiki before hand.

701
00:52:47,008 --> 00:52:49,550
You get to invent the back story so you invent the back story

702
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:52,111
that makes most sense for the premise.

703
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:56,434
So let's go into these.

704
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:03,481
thing by thing. So it's impossible to not overreach is

705
00:53:03,521 --> 00:53:07,104
the first lesson. There's no idea that it's not more work

706
00:53:07,124 --> 00:53:10,848
than you think it's going to be. Like when I nearly died in the

707
00:53:10,868 --> 00:53:14,752
woods for those visible photographs. So the thing about

708
00:53:14,812 --> 00:53:18,356
film is that it needs a lot of light to work. And this wasn't a

709
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:21,279
thing that I was thinking about too hard. So I took

710
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:27,659
20 photographs, there were four usable ones. I had to send the

711
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:30,301
camera to New York because they live in this tiny town in

712
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:34,485
Washington to get the film developed and we had to do a

713
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:36,927
whole bunch of last minute scrambling to get the rest of

714
00:53:36,987 --> 00:53:39,869
our art assets. You think something is going to be easy

715
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:43,793
and low cost and it turns out to be very different. However,

716
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:49,337
because we had scoped at this particularly low level, filling

717
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:51,199
in those gaps was much, much easier.

718
00:53:55,121 --> 00:54:01,205
Character breakdown. So a lot of stuff didn't end up the same.

719
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:05,489
The characters, if you read the character descriptions now, they

720
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,870
don't feel very much like the actual characters that are in

721
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:11,473
the final game. But that was fine. It was useful for two

722
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:16,297
reasons. One, so that we had a starting place. And secondly, so

723
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:19,059
that when the characters started moving away from the things that

724
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:21,761
made them interesting, we had this ability to go back to

725
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:22,201
basics.

726
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:28,593
I'm going way over time. Is that okay? Somebody give me a

727
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:31,035
sign. I'm going to assume it is because you all are still here.

728
00:54:31,055 --> 00:54:42,223
All right. Thank you. Okay. So one of the things that I was

729
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:49,980
Structure. So I'm talking about this as a writer. So what do you

730
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,301
do after you hit the word count goal? Well, one of the things

731
00:54:53,321 --> 00:54:56,022
you can do is you can write more words. And I did in fact write

732
00:54:56,582 --> 00:54:59,802
‑‑ I found that the goals that I set myself made the

733
00:54:59,822 --> 00:55:04,624
visual novel too short. The final product was 25,000 words

734
00:55:04,684 --> 00:55:08,845
instead of 15,000. It's like around that. So we added about

735
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:13,466
10,000 words which was a pretty big addition. But more so than

736
00:55:13,506 --> 00:55:14,406
that, I spent ‑‑

737
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:20,748
So we tried to write it this month. We pitched it to date

738
00:55:20,788 --> 00:55:24,750
NIDO. We got all of their start up capital. We got zero minutes.

739
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:29,872
Are you kicking me off now? Okay. All right. Well, bye.

740
00:55:29,892 --> 00:55:31,033
See you next year.

741
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:47,403
I would say control what you can control and give yourself

742
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:48,224
enough room to fuck up.
