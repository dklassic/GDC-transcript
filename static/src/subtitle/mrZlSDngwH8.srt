00:00:07,197 --> 00:00:10,258
Hello and welcome to the diary of a modern PR campaign.

2
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:13,398
Today, we're going to talk about how

3
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:14,799
to plan your game's promotion.

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,199
I'm Thomas Reisenacher, and I'm also very happy that you're

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:18,579
here.

6
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,980
Thanks a lot for coming.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,420
As for every GDC talk, I've been asked

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,661
to remind you to switch your phone to silent

9
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:28,821
and also rate the session after it's over.

10
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,422
So before we dive into how we plan a campaign, something

11
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:33,902
a bit different, a little thought experiment,

12
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:35,263
but I think it will help you understand

13
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:36,463
the main point of this talk.

14
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:41,405
So we have here a blank space and we have you.

15
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,446
And that's you going to meet a friend at a coffee

16
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:47,227
and suddenly you see someone coming up to you,

17
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:49,988
poking his head out, he walks up, comes closer,

18
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:52,349
puts his hand up, has a cup of coffee,

19
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:54,250
then says, do you want to buy this cup of coffee

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,771
for three dollars, just made it, it's really good.

21
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:59,532
What are you gonna say?

22
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:00,932
Hell no, like I don't know who you are,

23
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:02,673
why should I buy a cup of coffee, this is weird.

24
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:07,390
However, this is I think one of the main 2 problems that a lot of games PR has this day

25
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,419
that there's a lot of literature and a lot of people are very good at getting the game

26
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:16,266
out there and get some awareness wants to be a website a big you to go right to the

27
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:16,606
end.

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,491
But without the right context and without the right build up,

29
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:21,711
that's probably a weird situation.

30
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:24,171
And that's something a lot of games face these days.

31
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:26,212
And a second problem, of course, is just

32
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,953
the sheer number of games, which makes PR and marketing

33
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:31,033
activities very necessary.

34
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:32,994
If you imagine the same situation,

35
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:34,694
but with a million people that come up to you

36
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,695
offering a coffee, it's probably even weirder.

37
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:38,695
And you're going to say a lot of, hell no,

38
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:40,696
I don't want your coffee.

39
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:40,836
So.

40
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:46,870
Within the first two minutes of the talk, we already found out that selling games is actually coffee.

41
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:57,736
And stick with me, that might sound weird, but throughout the talk, I'm going to explain to you more also how we can be that guy that sells the coffee, but actually makes a sale and actually gets people on board with it.

42
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,906
So topics for today, the first half is going to focus on what

43
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:04,886
really sells a game, and the second half

44
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:07,027
is going to focus on the 5 phases on a PR campaign.

45
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,768
So that's a bit more practical bit.

46
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,928
And in the end, there's going to be a short summary.

47
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:13,749
And obviously, this is a very broad topic,

48
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:15,410
how you plan a whole PR campaign.

49
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,211
So I can't go into detail into every aspect of it.

50
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:20,751
However, what I can do is try to show you the big picture

51
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:24,252
and then refer at points where I have some good literature

52
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:25,793
or some good links, refer you there

53
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:26,913
so you can look up details.

54
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:29,475
for the more detailed task within the PR planning.

55
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:33,197
A few words about me before we start properly.

56
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:35,098
I'm Thomas Reisenecker.

57
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:36,860
I founded Future Friends Games.

58
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,422
It's a small PR agency in Brighton in the UK.

59
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:43,604
And through my career, I've worked on over 40 games,

60
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,865
some bigger ones like League of Legends and Smite,

61
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,967
also some quite small ones, indie titles

62
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,609
like Anomalous Phono at the moment,

63
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:52,290
or well, Ignorance Dram for Watergolf.

64
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:58,755
Within the talk, you will only see my opinions and my learnings throughout the years, but also those from other people.

65
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:02,096
And most importantly, I also did something called the Indie Game PR Survey,

66
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:06,558
where I asked studios about their PR experience, and 128 of them took part.

67
00:03:06,558 --> 00:03:11,400
And a couple of those experiences and statistics you're going to see in the talk.

68
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,322
However, I couldn't fit all of it in, so if you want to get all the data, you can follow me on Twitter, and I'm going to post those after GDC.

69
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:22,563
And you can also write me a DM if you want, and I can email them to you.

70
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,213
So that the one what really sells games the question that was becoming more and

71
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:33,216
more important important in my field of work where I saw games doing really

72
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:36,198
well in terms of PR but suddenly they're not selling it obviously a big part of

73
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:40,061
that is because they just so many games now but even considering that they were

74
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:44,725
quite a bit of a lot of games that did well in terms of getting the name out

75
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,187
there, but then actually didn't perform in terms of sales so it was a bit like

76
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,409
my mission of the watch it like trying to figure out why this happens.

77
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:58,381
So I just tried to do it and I started looking up if I can find out what really moves the needle for a game.

78
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:04,309
So the first thing was maybe the most obvious one just looking maybe just the quality of the game maybe just about making a really really good game.

79
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,254
because whenever you give a PR talk, I'm sure there's people coming up to you afterwards

80
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:12,037
and say like, look, I don't need PR, just make the best game ever.

81
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:14,939
It is fair if you can do that, but just a very good game, is this enough?

82
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,564
There's a really good Gamasutra article on the topic that tried to find out how many

83
00:04:19,564 --> 00:04:23,687
Steam games are there that have extremely good reviews, but hardly any sales.

84
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:26,650
And the verdict of the article is, a lot.

85
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,472
Those hidden gems.

86
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:34,908
I like numerous so just making a game is definitely not a fact that that just get to get out there

87
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,088
and definitely makes it a hit.

88
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:41,790
Moving on thought maybe it's a brand maybe it's about having a good name, but then there

89
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,332
are lots of example like this prison architect very successful game.

90
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:50,134
So the 2 million copies for uptightness can assemble so 6,000 copies in the first 2 months.

91
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:55,556
So you can see that even with a big name a big brand it doesn't guarantee that you've

92
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:56,277
got to be successful.

93
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,700
Maybe it's the media I thought.

94
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,042
Maybe it's about being on a lot of websites.

95
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,103
There's an example I worked on.

96
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:03,124
It's called Blackboard Crossing.

97
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:04,586
It's a very nice narrative game.

98
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,127
It did extremely well in terms of PR.

99
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:07,008
It got nice reviews.

100
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,429
It got good coverage.

101
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:10,311
In the end, however, it didn't sell well.

102
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:14,395
It was selling, according to Steam Spy,

103
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:16,897
5,000 sales in the first six months.

104
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:22,362
You see, that's not nothing, but that's not impressive.

105
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,790
Moving on, maybe thought maybe it's YouTubers and streamers.

106
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,430
This is something that came up quite a lot.

107
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,991
I think you warned it two years ago that people said,

108
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,591
like, if one of the big ones covers you,

109
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:31,692
this is going to make it for you.

110
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:34,613
But then there were a lot of threats coming up like this.

111
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:36,413
Then Marshall made a game called Kick Man.

112
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:38,614
It was covered by a big YouTuber,

113
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:40,895
has 703 million subscribers, gets 70,000 views,

114
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,735
which results in 15 copies of sales.

115
00:05:42,735 --> 00:05:45,236
So you can see also a big YouTube video

116
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:48,397
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to sell a lot of copies.

117
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:52,928
And then look for maybe it's different platforms and in all

118
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:55,370
fairness to switch is doing quite well now, but probably by

119
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,992
the time that talk is over on you to is already hot of the

120
00:05:57,992 --> 00:06:00,413
silence which because it's such a gold rush now and also the

121
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,755
other platforms don't necessarily guarantee any sales

122
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:03,315
numbers.

123
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:06,417
The same is for social media will select a lot of examples

124
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:09,339
there even if they did well on the other doesn't mean that

125
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,560
would necessarily sell well.

126
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,264
What is the next step of the professional you just panic

127
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:18,725
because you don't know what you should actually do that make

128
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:19,366
the game sell.

129
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:33,065
But what you can do is next step was what I did is just turn to people that may be more clever than me and I just asked them and did the in the game. Piazza V and one of the question was what do you think I'm telling you again what helped a lot.

130
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:41,874
And the strongest answer was store features that was the thing that helped him a lot like 45 people out of 128. This is pretty good and it all of them got features.

131
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:44,177
They said sales for really good.

132
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:48,695
follow-up websites you to listen social media and then a bunch of other stuff

133
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:52,198
interesting deals and use that this is quite high up considering a lot of

134
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:54,900
people had actually is that this but those that had them said they were quite

135
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,945
successful and pretty much in the end you can also see print magazines but

136
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:02,387
it's big caveat that a lot of people were like I just don't know if I even

137
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:05,149
was covered in a print magazine because I don't pay attention so I don't really

138
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,691
know.

139
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:10,354
So as a follow-up question we also asked what what helped the bid this is the

140
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:11,375
things you see in blue here.

141
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:14,673
And suddenly you get a different picture.

142
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:19,315
You suddenly you see there's a lot of things that are quite strong.

143
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:19,455
The top 5.

144
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,176
Um, nearly equal up in the terms of how long the bar is,

145
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,717
which is probably also related that a storm feature for a sale,

146
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:26,878
you can actually see if you convert into an actual sale,

147
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:30,260
whereas for PR things and YouTube videos,

148
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,001
you can only guess if that would be a sale or not.

149
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:34,882
So if you look at the graph in the end of the day,

150
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:36,022
it doesn't tell you a whole lot.

151
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,704
It just tells you it's really different per game,

152
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:40,224
and there's a lot of factors to play together.

153
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:45,257
So my answer for myself was there is no magic bullet of the one thing that can tell you

154
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,538
game really well.

155
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:48,960
However, there is a couple of games with a magic bullet.

156
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,304
That's like Bob T did it with Twitch and Cuphead just looks really good and gets featured by

157
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:53,825
Microsoft.

158
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:55,927
But that's that's not that's not an average game.

159
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:59,730
If you talk about 99 percent of the other games, they're going to have to figure out

160
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,151
something else.

161
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:02,252
So what is that?

162
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:03,273
How can we figure that out?

163
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,861
So instead, the next step was, instead of looking at the different media, the different outlets you have,

164
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:14,382
maybe it's better to just look at games that did well and then figure out why they did well.

165
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:16,042
So here are four examples.

166
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:19,263
There's a game called Northgard that did extremely well.

167
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:23,244
It has over 500,000 owners on Steam, wasn't any big discounts yet,

168
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:26,084
so that's probably also pretty much the copies they sold.

169
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:26,944
So really, really good.

170
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:32,046
And there's a second called Open Journey, which

171
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,927
is regularly in the app charts.

172
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,028
It's doing extremely well.

173
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,990
It's also doing really well on Switch.

174
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,232
Within a week, it was refinanced to Switch port.

175
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:40,834
So why were they so good?

176
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:41,894
The answer for them were quite easy.

177
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:43,616
They got store features.

178
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:45,458
Northgard was doing really well in terms of Steam.

179
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,519
It's a strategy game.

180
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,459
It got really well reviewed.

181
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,761
And Steam just kept recommending it, kept recommending it.

182
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,423
And then it became very successful.

183
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,204
And after they've been very successful,

184
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:54,526
they got more PR feedback.

185
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:58,649
And Open Journey is a game that looks extremely beautiful

186
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,230
on an iPhone.

187
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,611
That's also what Apple knows.

188
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:03,652
They've been featuring this game a lot.

189
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:05,833
If you look at App Annie, it got over 4,000 features

190
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,074
over the last couple of months.

191
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:10,775
So I guess that's one way to go down the line,

192
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:13,257
is just make a game that plays really well in terms

193
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:13,977
of a store feature.

194
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:15,478
But obviously, this is not very secure,

195
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:17,799
because you're not controlling if you get a store feature or not.

196
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:23,276
So this is a risky option what are the options that to against the extreme the

197
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:28,158
well one is called niche and a Kickstarter had phenomenal community building

198
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:33,319
campaign and in the end of the day it had over 80,000 owners and steam again

199
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,961
without really big discounts anything so did quite well in terms of how big the

200
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:41,042
game was and another game called the first 3 by so the developer called it

201
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,783
really did also extremely well

202
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:47,324
and he did a really great postmortem that shows you how he did well.

203
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:50,833
And this is what I call a launch build up.

204
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,354
This is a second route you can go down.

205
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:55,377
This is a longer PR campaign where you really work it.

206
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,078
But in the end of the day, that usually,

207
00:09:57,078 --> 00:09:58,940
especially in the climate of today's PR,

208
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,980
really tends to pay off.

209
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,762
We look at David Whealy's post-mortem,

210
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:03,623
just very short here.

211
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:05,965
He just basically showed a graph how much website

212
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:06,365
wizards he gets.

213
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:08,727
And as you can see, he has loads of different spites

214
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:09,928
from little activities.

215
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:11,669
So this is like his stats he had for launch.

216
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:12,910
It's really good.

217
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,692
But he explains really well how he got there.

218
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:15,792
It was not one big thing.

219
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:16,113
It was.

220
00:10:16,568 --> 00:10:20,670
a couple of gifts going well it was a couple of ready post going well couple of into post

221
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,632
to really work at him with everything he did he got a more newsletter signups and really

222
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:29,454
build a community that helped him along the way also in terms of media which I would explain

223
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:29,774
it.

224
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:30,734
But.

225
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:33,916
So the area want to focus on today's to launch build up.

226
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,337
Not because of Amy for so feature is bad.

227
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,021
But you can build up for launch and still get a feature which is fine.

228
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:48,963
But you cannot just focus on the soft feature that what would give you the build up so it's a more risky way of the 2.

229
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:56,286
So in the end of the day why did those 2 games sell well and I think this is space explain with this graph this is called a sales funnel.

230
00:10:56,286 --> 00:11:03,848
And a lot of PR a lot of studios, I think a very focused and very good at the first stage getting awareness just getting that game in front of people.

231
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:08,088
This is something, there's a lot of literature on this topic.

232
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:09,569
However, if you only see the game once,

233
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,811
that's like the guy that just holds a coffee in front of you.

234
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:14,553
That probably doesn't convince you to buy it.

235
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:16,054
If you think about it, which games you buy,

236
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:18,256
it's probably the ones you see in an advert,

237
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:20,658
in a couple of articles, in a couple of YouTube videos,

238
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,039
and they keep coming up, and you're like,

239
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,520
oh, there must be something about this one.

240
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,801
It keeps coming up.

241
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:27,003
So that's what we call the consideration phase.

242
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:28,964
That's where we want people to get in the next step.

243
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,592
And after that, if they still keep seeing it,

244
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:33,334
or if they find the game is really cool,

245
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:35,155
they probably become your customer.

246
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:36,196
And that's your goal.

247
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,997
So it's not just getting the awareness,

248
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,319
because that's the first step, and it's very helpful.

249
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,260
But without the necessary means, you

250
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,102
don't get them to become a customer in the end.

251
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,583
And if they like your game, or you're

252
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,925
very good at even talking to them later on,

253
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,586
you probably make them into fans.

254
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:54,274
So if you know about that, one really important thing is,

255
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:56,659
if you have a small or mid-sized game,

256
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:59,024
whatever you do, you always have to think about

257
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:02,911
how you can get your audience to become a customer or fan.

258
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:09,248
And one way to do it would just be on website articles all the time, be on PC Gamer every day.

259
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:10,188
But this is really hard.

260
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:14,350
So what you want to do is, you want to find a place where you talk to people.

261
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:21,193
This could be a Discord, this could be a newsletter, this could be something where whatever you do, you try to get people there.

262
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:25,375
Because once you've signed them up, once you've liked their Twitter page, you can directly talk to them.

263
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,957
And you don't depend on outside sources that maybe feature your game or maybe not.

264
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:54,997
So this is a thing really important in the beginning to already figure out where do you want people to go a really good example was the send us from my gross. What did it was to meet a free pizza, but you could only get it if you sign up for the discord so they knew if you sign up for this cut they can keep talking to you. There was a really good kickstarter called new bottles and if you want to play the demo of the game you have to sign up for the newsletter. So again they already thought about how can we talk to people after they've seen this demo.

265
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,763
And another thing about the South on the which is a bit of fortunate is.

266
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:15,052
It only looks really nice here because it's up with the colors and actually the bit like that so it's it's way harder to transfer those people down those different ranks and through reminding them and through sending the different things.

267
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:18,254
And this was by the way made by a really good purpose by Chris to cross the.

268
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:22,815
So next up, we want to look at how we actually, knowing that,

269
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,055
how we do that PR campaign.

270
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:25,816
We do it in five phases.

271
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:27,776
And this is the power timeline.

272
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:29,077
It's probably something you've seen before.

273
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:31,038
And I think the big two important things on that

274
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:31,978
is the game reveal.

275
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,719
So it's not the announcement, but the reveal,

276
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:35,599
what I understand it is the first time

277
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,060
when you have a big trailer that you send out,

278
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,180
the first time you contact press about it.

279
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,801
So you can maybe talk about it before in a pub,

280
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,382
and you show it to make a couple of tweets,

281
00:13:42,382 --> 00:13:43,462
show it to some friends.

282
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:45,683
But the reveal is the timing you make it official.

283
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:46,883
And then there's the launch.

284
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,665
And as a PR person, most people come to me here.

285
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:54,088
This is a couple of weeks or a month before the launch.

286
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,810
This is usually too late.

287
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,631
You can make a game a bit bigger there,

288
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,833
but you can't really make it blow up

289
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,135
if it wasn't good before that.

290
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:03,376
This is the equivalent of someone.

291
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:08,881
If you'd a coffee guy that wants to sell the coffee and you just one day before you start selling it and you just like

292
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:13,525
Oh, take 50 flyers and just put them out somewhere. This is not gonna this is not gonna do it

293
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,687
So actually your whole PR campaign

294
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:20,291
It's just a whole thing game development is PR and it's marketing as soon as you start working in it

295
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:25,215
you actually make something you probably want to sell and every decision you make on the way is

296
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:28,317
Working on this goal to make that game selling get it out there

297
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,340
It doesn't matter if it's the name doesn't matter if it's website all of those things

298
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:36,656
So the first phase, five phases in total we're going to talk about, is the setup phase.

299
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:40,737
And this is, I think, by far the most important phase.

300
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:44,519
This is one a lot of people don't take as much time as they should.

301
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,260
And I think, as advice, if you can hire a PR professional, if you get some consultant,

302
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,901
if you have a friend, you can ask how did they do their PR, and they can help you a

303
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:53,622
little bit.

304
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:57,063
This is the phase when you want to get them on board.

305
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,533
because we actually do here if this when you learn to put a coffee to people

306
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,814
actually want to buy.

307
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:07,958
This is really important if you could hear if you make something that people

308
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,420
want and you can also describe it all the other way along the line is quite

309
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,443
easy, but it's really hot if you make a really bad coffee in the best thing says

310
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:16,364
him can't get it out there.

311
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:20,987
So the top 5 things you want to do in the setup phase.

312
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:25,451
The number one is you make it game that people care about and you learn to talk

313
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:25,671
about it.

314
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,241
And what I mean by that is,

315
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,023
there's a lot of very similar games.

316
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:32,045
If I've seen so many people contact me

317
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:33,587
with really good puzzle platformers,

318
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,809
and it's a shame because they're going to be good games,

319
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,052
they're going to be eight or nine out of tens,

320
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:39,814
but there are so many good puzzle platformers

321
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,075
that that is not enough.

322
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:41,796
You need to have a 10 out of 10

323
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,218
if you want to have a good one there.

324
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:47,137
Whereas on the other hand, they worked on a surfing game called Surf Alterius.

325
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:48,898
And let's just say it was not game of the year.

326
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,600
It was alright.

327
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,421
But it was extremely easy to PI it.

328
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:56,363
And the fact for that is just there wasn't any bigger surfing game in 10 years.

329
00:15:57,283 --> 00:16:01,465
So it really your PR starts here just picking someone that's going to be easy to promote

330
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:02,685
that people have an interest in.

331
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,626
This is called the difference between push and pull PR.

332
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:10,088
Push PR means you make something that people don't necessarily want that much and you just

333
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:11,929
push it on them, which works.

334
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,910
You can get on websites if you're good PR people.

335
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,672
You can buy advertisement, but you're always going to get stuck in the first phase of the

336
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:19,352
sales funnel.

337
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:22,533
You're always going to get awareness, but you never go into consideration because they're

338
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:23,714
not actually that into that game.

339
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,921
Whereas pull BI is something you make something quite exciting

340
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:29,443
that people want, and then it's quite easy to get it out there.

341
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,605
And that also plays along with press.

342
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:34,868
Press usually covers things that they

343
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,330
think are either big already or are going to be big very soon.

344
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,432
And then they cover it, and people click on it,

345
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,193
and press is excited.

346
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:42,974
And they cover it more, and people click on it more.

347
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:45,917
And this is the circle of the life spiral.

348
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,579
That's what it's called in the blog post I found.

349
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:50,441
And again, if you don't have that spiral that

350
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:52,743
keeps kicking off, you're going to have a really hard time

351
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:53,443
further down the line.

352
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:59,070
So once you figure out what game you want to make and what should have an appeal you want to learn how to talk about it.

353
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:06,232
Free things they used to do before I start working on a game all police. I make a friend says this is you go to a party you go to friends.

354
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:11,733
These have to be really good friends like the honest friends the friends that would tell you that they have a bad haircut.

355
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:16,105
And you go up to them and you just pitch them the game of one or two sentences.

356
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:20,668
They ideally should be in your target group, so more hardcore gamer, more casual gamer.

357
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:24,450
And if you tell them, hey, I'm going to make Super Mario, but you don't play Mario, but you play a cow,

358
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,050
you can look at it like that.

359
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,912
Because this is a really bad pitch, and they're going to tell you, and they're going to tell you in your face.

360
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:31,253
They have no reason to be polite.

361
00:17:31,962 --> 00:17:35,363
they just going to be like all right, this is this a bit with

362
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:38,484
and once you figure out this short friends test those one or

363
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:41,365
2 lines to describe the game on a really high level I usually

364
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:43,826
make something for the short text. This is just like a

365
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:47,207
couple of words that really described the games really

366
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:49,708
tight so people know immediately what it is and that

367
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,629
they usually make one key a key outbreak or a key gift

368
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:55,970
that you can lose use for the campaign.

369
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,790
I want to cut that nail down you want to move on to a longer

370
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,051
text which is described again.

371
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,213
And this is quite early to do those things.

372
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:04,954
This is still the preparation phase.

373
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:06,934
But if you nail that down here, quite good.

374
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:09,095
All the other things, all the press releases,

375
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:11,256
all the pitch emails, all the social media updates

376
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,916
you're going to write, they're going

377
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,737
to be extremely easy compared to when you do those things later.

378
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,597
You have to change things all the time

379
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,058
and adjust them all the time.

380
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:21,698
The second thing is, before we go into PR planning,

381
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:23,139
is picking your news feeds.

382
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:25,139
So news feeds are talking points that

383
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:26,340
should be interesting for press.

384
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:30,392
I've just listed a couple here just had a good which one I think a good or not

385
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:31,152
so good

386
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,935
game announcement looks pretty well what works with that I think it would be a

387
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:37,118
little which is usually the first trailer this is your your big chance to

388
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:40,561
get to get in front of people to the most common thing the most talked about

389
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,082
thing of the game

390
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:45,205
you can make a first game play video because it's quite easy to do

391
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:49,449
Pia stance can be really good if if you can pull them off also on the GDC what

392
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:52,732
you can find the talk about guerrilla marketing for me if you're interested in

393
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:53,112
that

394
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:56,284
Ports are quite a big news, especially like for switch to

395
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:58,987
Xbox sites, depending where you make a pot.

396
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:01,308
Different feature videos that just describe features of the

397
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,830
game, a release date is usually quite strong.

398
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,352
It's actually stronger than the release.

399
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,854
I think it also has to do with the SEO of websites, because

400
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,396
gamers are going to Google, when is this game coming out?

401
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,397
So that's the news that their website won.

402
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:15,640
There's also a bunch of news feeds that are not as good.

403
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,041
They're not absolutely terrible.

404
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,982
Like, don't bin them.

405
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,896
but they are not been a great day usually you have to find them up with

406
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:24,618
one of the other new speeds or a couple of them to make an interesting for

407
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:28,019
press just a demo alone today usually doesn't do it unless you can is really

408
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:28,380
really good

409
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,382
so you should figure out what talking points you have about you get

410
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,782
What you want to do next is you pick the right channels.

411
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:40,164
If you want to talk to press and influencers, usually email is the best, it's the easiest.

412
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:45,327
There's a couple of people who prefer social media, but in bulk, just use emails.

413
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:48,369
And also, if you get in touch with people, if they ever talk to you,

414
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:51,271
make a nice list of what people are interested in and keep emailing them.

415
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,694
And then you want to figure out how you talk to your players, how you talk to your audience.

416
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,717
It can be, again, it can be a newsletter, it can be Twitter,

417
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:03,121
Discord is very popular at the moment if your game where there's more discussion involved.

418
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:06,184
Also Imgur is great, image hosting platform, we just did that for what the goal,

419
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:09,908
had a post with over 200,000 views, although it did really hard with press,

420
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,612
it was really working well there, so I think it's worth doing some research in.

421
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,112
And again...

422
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:18,718
you have to pick your channels here and keep in mind which is the one channel that you want all

423
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,804
people to go to, which is like the end of the sales funnel. Should they all sign up to the

424
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:27,951
newsletter? Should they all end up in the discord? Just agree on one and then try to get all the

425
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:29,754
people there so you can keep them in the loop.

426
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:55,007
Next on this we make a PR plan it's quite straightforward it looks like that. Usually we do it per week and then also put a more detailed one. The important thing is you want to have a topic you want to make sure you have all the assets in there. So whoever makes the asset knows what is needed when and then we just usually stack that by different target groups. So there was a PR plan for a switch game and there was a.

427
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:59,462
a layoff for gaming press that covers all games and the just get really important news

428
00:20:59,462 --> 00:21:02,603
but then the Nintendo side to cut like small and use as well because they were just more

429
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:07,464
interested in the game and then also the different social channels when we want to talk to them.

430
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:11,005
Some tips if you want to be a plant because if you just sit in front of an empty

431
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:14,385
excel sheet it can be a bit scary usually it's easiest to start at the release date

432
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:16,846
and then work your way back.

433
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:19,206
I would always leave 2 to 3 weeks between those and

434
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:23,988
yeah, it's for especially for press because they need some time to recover during that

435
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:24,428
those P a P it's.

436
00:21:25,272 --> 00:21:31,402
There was an interesting study by Big Games Machine that found out that most press prefer

437
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:33,566
to get their review kits three weeks ahead of launch.

438
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:39,798
and also just be sure to double check dates something I think most people forget this

439
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,762
can be easily overseen especially to change things around but always just really look

440
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:49,646
up bank holidays look up different game releases that you don't launch the same day as destiny

441
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:53,068
and also look up different events and that's a couple events of the absolute no goes don't

442
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:56,691
do anything during those events unless you can stay obviously.

443
00:21:57,152 --> 00:21:59,135
which for me would be GDC and E3 and Gamescom.

444
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:01,440
There's loads of other local events,

445
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,063
but I think they're not as dramatic.

446
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:05,167
However, if those events take place,

447
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,529
that's an absolute no-go zone to do anything,

448
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:07,491
unless you're at the show.

449
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:12,817
And after we have the PR plan, it's just a short thing

450
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,158
to set up your monitoring.

451
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:15,998
There's a couple of good tools.

452
00:22:15,998 --> 00:22:17,719
Like you could set up alerts with Google Alerts.

453
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,160
TweetDeck is a really good Twitter app

454
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,561
where you can just set up an alert for your game.

455
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:23,181
And Promoter is a really cool tool.

456
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:25,202
It just costs a couple of euros per month,

457
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:27,223
but it basically sends you a little notification

458
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:28,864
every time a gaming website writes about you.

459
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,744
So it's really easy to stay up to date with that.

460
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:35,086
I was elected to similar weapons to go to crew, a group from plug-in and just so

461
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:38,808
it shows you how much website traffic is that website has really really helpful

462
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:43,269
because imagine you're again the Spain and you're going to write about the game

463
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,910
which one is the bigger one.

464
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,431
There's loads of the things that this website seems really big, but it's not.

465
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:54,574
So those of that type of top 5 to do is in the set-up face also keep as I said

466
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,655
before I think it's worth spending a lot of time on this faith and getting it

467
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:00,276
right and then the other things we get way easier.

468
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:06,580
So next up we have to pre really reveal before we show a first big trailer and this is like how you test and we find a

469
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,081
coffee.

470
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:13,230
So you want to set up those channels also be sure to sign up to the time on database so you can get linked to the twitch

471
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,793
database to stream it can take it in.

472
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:19,228
And this is the face with that community building very popular

473
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:21,608
is using screenshots at the day so every Saturday, you posted

474
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:25,050
a gift with the test act does a lot of press writing about it

475
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,010
it can get a couple of free tweets and you can just like

476
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,351
see what people like about the game.

477
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:31,612
Also going to local events is quite nice and that face to

478
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:32,532
just get some extra feedback.

479
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:36,273
And this is a good time to experiment with a game here

480
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:38,234
called overland and they had a buck with.

481
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,952
a dog that became very big and it was one of the most successful tweets.

482
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:42,812
So they keep making big dogs.

483
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:45,994
And this is not something you can predict or participate,

484
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,696
but this is something you can find out

485
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:50,017
when you do regular things in this warm-up phase.

486
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:55,024
And then we come to the reveal trailer which I think is that before but I think

487
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:57,326
it's one of the most important things you can do.

488
00:23:57,326 --> 00:24:01,008
So you prepare that a lot and the in the games Bell survey.

489
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:03,629
Actually there was a set of spit

490
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:04,049
shocking.

491
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:08,471
We asked who made your launch trailer and 82% of people said someone in the

492
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:08,772
team.

493
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:10,286
This is really not good.

494
00:24:10,286 --> 00:24:13,049
I think your reveal trailer and your launch trailer

495
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:14,910
should be something you should put a lot of effort,

496
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,653
a lot of attention, and also money in if you can.

497
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:18,714
Because if you think about it,

498
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:20,856
this is literally like if you make a coffee

499
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:22,337
and you try to sell it in a little bag.

500
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,079
This is the first and only thing

501
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,880
a lot of people are gonna see.

502
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,583
So really take your time and get those trailers right.

503
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:32,107
That's not a specific formula which trailers for great and

504
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:35,129
which weren't that always like guides like making one minute

505
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:37,490
to make it very short, but then the things like the goose game

506
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,413
that makes a 3 minute game play video which goes absolutely

507
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:43,215
viral mental so I think that the key role is just like it

508
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,376
really has to tell you game off really well.

509
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:49,919
And the last tip is like don't brush his face.

510
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,723
On the really finish it when you reveal trade is ready because

511
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:55,884
you can only really again wants.

512
00:24:55,884 --> 00:24:57,905
And you want to make sure that that hits.

513
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:17,215
So then you read again and then we go into the pre launch phase and actually if you if you do your cup campaign this is the launch build up and this is actually quite a long face we do a lot of things having those light it's quite short because it only means that you execute a lot of things that we planned already before.

514
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:27,013
What we want to do in the pre-launch phase is just keep pushing, keep getting those news feeds out, keep updating your community, keep building all your channels.

515
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:29,014
Sounds easy here, it's a lot of work to do.

516
00:25:29,014 --> 00:25:33,816
Store optimization is a thing you should at least look into here at the latest here.

517
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:39,278
For a lot of curated stores it just means trying to contact the platform holders and making a store page.

518
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:40,238
For Steam it's a bit different.

519
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:43,393
Steam is completely driven by algorithms.

520
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:45,414
And there's a really great talk on YouTube

521
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:47,975
from Matt Trobiano and Lauren Klinik

522
00:25:47,975 --> 00:25:50,996
called More Than Luck, Strategies to Success in Steam.

523
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:52,336
Definitely recommend watching it.

524
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:54,237
It really explains to you how the algorithm works

525
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:56,198
and what games Steam pushes out.

526
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:58,939
Basically Steam looks into how much money you make then per second.

527
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:01,000
So it's not so important how much money you make,

528
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,880
it's important how much money Steam makes.

529
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:06,499
A couple of notes just on that.

530
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:10,822
What is really good for Steam store optimization is also always keep in mind you don't want

531
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:12,364
to get as many people into your game to buy it.

532
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:15,447
You want to get the right people in because they should not leave bad reviews.

533
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:17,248
They should like your game.

534
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:20,731
A really good example is Superflight, a small indie game from Berlin.

535
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:24,274
And what they said in the short description is this is a great game to relax for half

536
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:25,916
an hour and chase the latest high score.

537
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:30,168
This is not something usually a PR person would recommend you to say,

538
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:34,314
because that doesn't sound great, that doesn't suggest anything major,

539
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:36,116
but it just really tells you what the game is,

540
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:38,339
and people loved it, they bought it, it got recommended,

541
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,320
more and more people bought it.

542
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,743
So it's quite good being really descriptive and really honest here.

543
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:48,199
In this phase, it's always a good time to attend shows and do different previews.

544
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:52,521
There's a really good blog post series on the website of icopartners.com that goes through

545
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:56,584
different events and explains to you what is what and what to do.

546
00:26:56,584 --> 00:27:01,767
There's a really great TDC talk about how you should build a booth at an event so you

547
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,448
get attention from people.

548
00:27:03,448 --> 00:27:07,871
And the one tip I can definitely give you, if you attend an event, make your press appointments

549
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:09,952
beforehand a couple of weeks if you can.

550
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
You won't catch them on the show floor.

551
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,733
It's really important to set it up before.

552
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:17,211
Also if you send out the new speech if you contact press try

553
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:19,834
to think and headlines help them right easy headlines by the

554
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:22,776
game. I did a to talk about the topic last year's if you want

555
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:25,478
to look that up that's on the to see what the most of you to

556
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,320
and surprise just a couple of little extra tips on the

557
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,983
pre-launch phase.

558
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,044
Never never never and not to release that before you pass

559
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:36,127
certification I did it for a couple of games. It doesn't

560
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:38,048
always work out great and then you have to postpone your

561
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:39,450
release date and this is really bad.

562
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,205
You can also use your community to get on board with streamers and YouTubers.

563
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,227
It's something you see in the tweet that Mike Rose did.

564
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:51,372
It was just like saying to his fans, do you have any YouTubers you like?

565
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,833
Just ping them and I can send them a key.

566
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,455
And actually that tends to work quite well.

567
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:57,599
If they get a lot of pings from people that say you should play that game,

568
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,981
they will pick it up after a while.

569
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:03,725
And to really good links to find contacts and that that I always if we

570
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:08,469
website we can look up press e-mails is really helpful and which is really hot

571
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:12,592
to find out which to stream us could cover your game and the cycle twitch

572
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:17,215
metrics which is great because it shows you different stream us per country and

573
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:20,098
you can feel to them by game is really helpful.

574
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:23,861
We come to launch face and dislike sound like a big thing but if you've done all

575
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:27,503
that but well actually launched a is not that crazy it's more like a launch party.

576
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:29,639
You obviously have to have a launch trailer.

577
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:32,482
You should launch your game, send out a press communication,

578
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:34,365
reach out to YouTubers and streamers,

579
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:36,107
and blow all your social horns.

580
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:37,408
But again, if you've set up everything right

581
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:39,411
and if you've worked on that game for a long time,

582
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:40,892
this is not actually the busiest day ever

583
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:41,914
in terms of PR marketing.

584
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,876
Obviously in terms of development, something different,

585
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:44,897
but not in terms of PR marketing.

586
00:28:45,827 --> 00:28:48,368
One important thing is I would definitely encourage they want

587
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:51,309
to use especially on seems really important to get reviews

588
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:53,930
there's a newsletter from my partners that shows how many

589
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,171
games came out each week on steam and how many didn't get

590
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:58,772
any reviews and there's loads of them so if you have a

591
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:01,714
community definitely try to get them to review a game or

592
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:04,055
get the friends to be with again.

593
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:07,316
So the last face is supposed to launch face.

594
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:09,837
This is a busing relevant as a game called a mellow

595
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:12,898
and it actually had a second biggest days after 2 and a half

596
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:13,618
years to tell.

597
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,048
But then in the Indie Game PR survey,

598
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,869
we actually saw that most developers, 60%,

599
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:22,392
stopped promoting the game two months after release.

600
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:23,733
So why does this happen?

601
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:26,795
It probably has to do with how successful the game is.

602
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:28,296
There's a really interesting.

603
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:33,327
uh... blog post that tries to figure out if you can predict steam sales from your

604
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:36,348
week one sales and basically the formula found out is

605
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:39,689
that whatever you're going to sell in week one if you multiply that by five this is what

606
00:29:39,689 --> 00:29:42,850
you're going to sell in the first year and it seems to be

607
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,851
obviously not super accurate but quite accurate

608
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:51,717
Obviously try to manage to use cost encourage players to review them and

609
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:55,860
also talk to them if something goes wrong for the present influences

610
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,623
built and keep your fan base for next games and the last point is plenty updates right if

611
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:05,046
you make an update and you can bundle up with a big little past and like you see here always move

612
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:07,928
for die get a little Rick and Morty crossover and bundle it for 60% sale.

613
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:14,352
Then you can actually make update updates after your game is already out still a little press story.

614
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:19,245
So that's the 5 points in for the post-launch phase.

615
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:20,626
And now a really quick summary.

616
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:23,487
It's just, if you're planning a campaign, keep in mind,

617
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,868
pick if you want to do a launch build-up or focus

618
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:26,629
on the store feature.

619
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:29,590
Keep the sales funnel in mind for whatever you do.

620
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,931
Keep collecting those people to places

621
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:33,192
where you can reach them again.

622
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:36,954
And the summary of the PR timeline is, first phase,

623
00:30:36,954 --> 00:30:38,415
make sure you have a game that's interesting,

624
00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:39,395
that people actually want to buy,

625
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:41,316
and to learn to talk about it.

626
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:43,617
Preview real phase, test a bit, really focus

627
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:45,238
on getting the trailer right.

628
00:30:45,238 --> 00:30:45,718
Reveal the game.

629
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:49,195
Thank you pushing it in the pre launch phase could getting it

630
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:52,477
out make the news piece make those updates in the audience

631
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:55,779
launch a game and in the end of the post launch phase which

632
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:59,141
probably have a look at how long and if you want to support

633
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:01,082
the game after thanks a lot for listening.
