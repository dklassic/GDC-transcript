1
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:07,877
so stressed right now, please be gentle.

2
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,318
I mean, yeah.

3
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:13,782
So yeah, let's start this thingy of mine.

4
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:17,205
My name is Patryk, and now the difficult part,

5
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:18,486
which is Grzeszczuk.

6
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:22,369
And it's an issue every time I check in at a hotel

7
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:23,470
outside of Poland.

8
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:25,988
because I am from Poland.

9
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:29,111
Yeah, and I am a part of 11 Beat Studios.

10
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:33,135
It is a studio responsible for This War of Mine,

11
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:34,677
among the other titles.

12
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:39,162
And today I wanted to tell you a bit about This War of Mine,

13
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:41,624
but from a marketing perspective,

14
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,426
as I have a pleasure and an honor

15
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:46,410
of being a part of marketing team at our company.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:54,934
But before I will get to the subject, I would love to start my presentation with a little twist.

17
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:59,436
So let's start with the results of what we have achieved.

18
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:20,498
This War of Mine, an amazing game.

19
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:25,842
I was a child, I was always wondering what happened to those people at war.

20
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:29,945
This War of Mine showed us the true face of the war.

21
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:35,930
In this War of Mine you can experience the many fates of affected victims in war.

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,452
We really feel the true meaning of being in war.

23
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:41,115
This War of Mine is a game I love playing.

24
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:45,658
Because it sets me in a vulnerable position that forces me to make hard choices.

25
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:46,379
It's not about suicide.

26
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,072
It's about how we survive.

27
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:51,594
Will you remain a human or you become an animal?

28
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:54,336
A game that will change your perspective

29
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:58,920
and make you appreciate that you live in a peaceful country.

30
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:10,383
Yeah, I'm gonna skip the rest of the video because it's not an important part.

31
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:13,368
So, this war of mine takes a special place in our hearts,

32
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:19,457
because we believe that it has allowed us to break through from kind of a niche.

33
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:28,307
space which is survival simulator thingy into the mainstream not only gaming wise but also

34
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:34,731
and maybe it's only our perception but we feel that right now we are in a we are a part of

35
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:37,913
kind of a mainstream culture but at the beginning

36
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:41,714
This War of Mine wasn't even about war.

37
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:45,534
It was a survival simulator, like post-apocalyptic survival

38
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:49,035
simulator, that took place in a shelter.

39
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,136
And actually, that was an internally used code name

40
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,256
for the game.

41
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,416
So it was shelter.

42
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:59,778
And while visually, as you can see, and even gameplay-wise,

43
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:02,658
to some degree, it was quite satisfying,

44
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:05,139
and we were happy about it, emotionally,

45
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,964
It just wasn't it, you know? We were looking for some...

46
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:16,295
solution to leverage the game, to bring it to the next level, but we were struggling. We didn't know

47
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:25,462
what exactly that should be that could allow us to make that happen until one point in which our CEO

48
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:31,467
Grzegorz shared an article with the whole team and the title of the article was One Year in Hell

49
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:37,272
and the article told the story about the longest siege of a city in modern warfare.

50
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:45,340
but written from a perspective of a civilian survivor actually living in that city at the time.

51
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,285
And once we read that article, we knew that this was it.

52
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:53,790
We could use it as a foundation and then build on it.

53
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,193
and then create something really meaningful.

54
00:03:57,193 --> 00:04:00,075
So we started this widespread research.

55
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:03,018
We used books as a source of inspiration

56
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:06,361
and we used other articles and stories

57
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:08,643
told by our parents and grandparents

58
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:14,288
because in Poland we have some kind of an experience

59
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,451
when it comes to being a part of a conflict,

60
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:18,772
not only on the winning side.

61
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,584
But we also used modern news as a source of inspiration

62
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:27,707
because you do not actually have to look very far

63
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:32,372
to find new information about warfare and conflicts

64
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:36,296
and how those not only affect modern societies,

65
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:39,379
but also reshape modern societies.

66
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,782
So we used all of those bits and pieces.

67
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:49,715
to create a new version of the game, which you know right now as This War of Mine.

68
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:53,180
And it worked. It worked very well, at least for us.

69
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:59,046
To know that it works actually, you had to play it.

70
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:01,347
And our objective as a marketing team,

71
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:04,928
as a marketing department, was to convince people

72
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,149
that it is a meaningful experience,

73
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:09,350
long before they actually had a chance

74
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,090
to play the game on their own.

75
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,072
So we were looking for some way to communicate that,

76
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:18,513
to pass the message, and at the moment, at time,

77
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:22,836
War was a very popular theme when it comes to video games.

78
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:26,539
And actually, I think it's the same right now, right?

79
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,923
So war is a popular thing when it comes to video games.

80
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:33,085
But at the same time, my perception is,

81
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:35,107
and our perception was at the time,

82
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:36,528
that most of those...

83
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,234
war-themed, war-based games share similar point of view.

84
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:46,599
So you usually play as a strong protagonist,

85
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,222
hero, running, gunning, blazing,

86
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:51,204
so there is no empathy there.

87
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:54,488
There is no reflection, there are no emotions there.

88
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:58,431
like deeper emotions, let's call them like that.

89
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:03,734
So we decided to use that as a foundation for our campaign.

90
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:07,697
We decided that we want to tell people that we are different,

91
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:09,818
that we stand in opposition,

92
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:12,961
that we want to question the status quo,

93
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,101
if that makes sense.

94
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:21,163
So we use the duality of the world as a starting point for our communication.

95
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:24,624
So the shift of perspective, if you will, right?

96
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:29,146
So we wanted to tell people that there are two sides to every story.

97
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:32,627
And when it comes to the conflict, every conflict.

98
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:35,610
Every war happens at someone's doorstep.

99
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,696
And this War of Mine is a game that allows you to cross that doorstep

100
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:43,199
and to see what lies on the other side.

101
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,064
So that was the foundation for our communication strategy.

102
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:51,049
But English is not our first language, so we struggled.

103
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:54,672
with bringing that strategy to life and converting that,

104
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:58,115
translating that into action, putting that in motion,

105
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,336
if that makes sense.

106
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,278
Even when it comes to the title itself,

107
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:03,840
the first title was War of Mine.

108
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,621
And we were quite happy with it,

109
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:07,843
till the point in which one of our friends

110
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:10,265
from the United States asked us

111
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:12,968
if we actually had mines in our game.

112
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:16,010
So we were like, okay, we have to change something.

113
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,971
And we did.

114
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:21,036
And we ended up with This War of Mine.

115
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:24,921
Actually, Guns N' Roses and their Sweet Child O' Mine

116
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:25,582
helped a bit.

117
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:30,067
So, yeah, so This War of Mine, that was the final title,

118
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,790
and it is a final title for us, and it works.

119
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,794
And my perception is that it works because of two factors.

120
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:40,880
It stands out because it's a kind of an unusual structure,

121
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,404
but at the same time, it's very descriptive.

122
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:47,587
It tells you that it is a game about war,

123
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:51,131
but at the same time, it's a personal point of view.

124
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:51,992
It's something different.

125
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:55,436
It gives you the emotional layer of the game

126
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:57,999
because you've got subjectivity here, right?

127
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,060
And it was the same case when it comes to the claim.

128
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,663
We knew that we have to explain to people

129
00:08:04,663 --> 00:08:07,304
what this war of mine actually was about.

130
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:09,325
So we came up with different claims,

131
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:11,266
with different sentences.

132
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:15,489
We wanted them to grasp the idea in a sleek, perfect manner.

133
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:19,591
So, but some of them were too long or too short.

134
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:23,492
too obvious or too complicated.

135
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:26,094
We ended up with the one that we liked the most

136
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:29,535
and it was in war, not everyone is a soldier.

137
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:32,836
And here you've got the same thing that you had in a title.

138
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:36,098
You've got the idea grasped in a short way

139
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,538
and quite obvious way.

140
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:40,159
So you know that it is about war,

141
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,701
but it is not about shooting, running, gunning.

142
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,201
It's about the shift of.

143
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:54,049
perspective. So when we had that foundation laid out, we knew that we have to define the identity

144
00:08:54,049 --> 00:09:01,656
of the game. We have to explain what the features are, but not gameplay-wise, but emotionally,

145
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:02,517
if that makes sense.

146
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:08,238
So we wanted to tell people that this world of mine is serious, it's non-military,

147
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:13,119
which was very, very important for us, apolitical, insightful and human-centric.

148
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:20,561
And the apolitical part was especially important for us, because when you get into politics,

149
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:26,062
you can way too easily divide people, you can make people angry, and we didn't want to do that,

150
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:31,963
actually. What we wanted to do was to provide people with meaningful experience they could

151
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:32,523
relate to.

152
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:37,505
to no matter what their beliefs or political views were.

153
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:39,406
That was our goal.

154
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:41,827
That was our objective.

155
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:44,108
And we did that, and we wanted to

156
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:46,428
and had to maintain the coherency

157
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,449
every time we did something,

158
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:50,050
every time we launched new.

159
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,797
activity and it paid off a lot because right now every time you see This War of Mine

160
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:03,465
and not only the game itself but also key visuals, trailers, videos, whatever it is,

161
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:07,349
you know This War of Mine is This War of Mine. You can recognize the game.

162
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:10,633
That's because we were consistent and every time we...

163
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:16,483
told people something about this world of mine, it was the same way of telling the story,

164
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:22,534
a political way, human-centric way, kind of an insightful way. At least we want to.

165
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:28,830
believe that. But being coherent and being consistent means that sometimes you have to say

166
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:35,612
no, you have to say no to your community. And in our case it was also like that. A good example

167
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:40,874
is the zombie mode. People wanted us to prepare a zombie mode for the game and I can understand

168
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:45,575
that because this World of Mines seems like a perfect game for that. You've got the shelter,

169
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:50,317
you've got all the mechanics there, you've got people trying to survive, so all the bits and

170
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,758
pieces are there actually. But

171
00:10:53,098 --> 00:11:05,932
While it could be quite entertaining to play that kind of a mode, we didn't want to do that because for us this War of Mine just wasn't the game that you should play in that kind of a way.

172
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:11,518
At the same time, internally, we played a bit with the game because when you deal with such an...

173
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:17,906
Tough subject, you have to release some steam at some point.

174
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:20,488
So we played with the color palette,

175
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:23,411
we had mutant rats at some point,

176
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:25,473
we had some additional elements,

177
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:28,155
but we never planned to release those elements.

178
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:31,197
That was just for an internal use,

179
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:33,219
but outside of the studio,

180
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:37,642
this world of mine was what it was and is what it is.

181
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:40,025
if that makes sense.

182
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,909
And what about the fun factor, you may ask,

183
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:47,134
because games should be fun, right?

184
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:48,235
Well, no, in my opinion,

185
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:51,419
because not every game has to be actually fun.

186
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,983
In the same manner, like, not every movie has to be fun,

187
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:57,566
and not every book has to be fun as well.

188
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:06,712
So our colleague from our studio, Paweł, who is a senior writer, and he was a senior writer at that point,

189
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:15,058
he explained that very well. He told in one of the interviews that we do not aim at the fun factor.

190
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:16,959
For us, it's all about the experience.

191
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,920
because the game should engage player

192
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,381
and the game should maintain the idea.

193
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:25,502
If the message is important and the gameplay is shallow,

194
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:27,462
that is devastating for the game,

195
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:30,663
such a game as this one of mine, at least.

196
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:32,464
So yeah, so that was the strategy.

197
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:35,885
That was our, and that was our approach.

198
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,845
But let's get to the media point

199
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:40,966
and to the touchpoint matrix.

200
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:44,047
So because of our budget limitations,

201
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,288
we had limited budget at that point.

202
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:57,071
We focused on digital communication, especially social media, PR related activities and event coverage.

203
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,871
Because that worked for us quite well.

204
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:06,393
And when it comes to digital communication, video trailers were very important for us.

205
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:11,575
Because right now, if you want to be efficient with your communication, you should use video.

206
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:16,257
a lot. Video is a thing right now, which is an obvious thing to say. So this is one of

207
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:21,884
the first trailers for This War of Mine. Maybe you have seen it.

208
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:07,287
you

209
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:30,634
So as you can see, bless you, as you can see we've got the same idea repeated over and over.

210
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:36,580
We are talking about the shift of perspective, we are talking about people, about their emotions,

211
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:42,565
their experience. Because please be aware of the fact that we had no track record at that point,

212
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:46,469
so people had to be aware, we had to build the credibility.

213
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,488
credibility for the game, we had to build the awareness.

214
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,490
I've got kind of an advertising background.

215
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,012
I come from an advertising agency,

216
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:56,633
bunch of those actually.

217
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:59,435
So I like those short videos very much.

218
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:03,637
I usually use those 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds

219
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:07,200
videos, so those short bits that can tell you the story.

220
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,683
quite well, I would say, quite well.

221
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:15,107
But designing, writing scripts for those videos

222
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:17,189
and then producing those videos,

223
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:21,593
we keep in mind three, like, important,

224
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:24,716
very important, crucial even, rules

225
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,577
that we have to keep in mind

226
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:29,780
to just be efficient with what we do.

227
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,762
And those rules are,

228
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:36,476
Maintaining the idea and always closing the story.

229
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:39,898
So I know that games are very complex,

230
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,939
that you have so many elements that are good

231
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:45,041
and engaging and fun about your games.

232
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:49,122
But you should still maintain the focus

233
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,844
on the most important thing, on the premise of your game.

234
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,425
Everything should follow,

235
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:56,686
but the premise is the most important part.

236
00:15:56,686 --> 00:16:01,368
The second thing is that you should keep the right pacing.

237
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:02,529
Even though.

238
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:06,472
those advertising videos, those trailers are quite short.

239
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:09,755
They still have this structure of a long story.

240
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:12,757
You've got this three to five act structure,

241
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:14,798
so you've got the introduction part,

242
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:18,481
you've got the tipping point and the resolution,

243
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:21,323
the punchline, if that makes sense.

244
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:24,386
And we are usually constructing our videos like that

245
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:27,428
because long story short, it works.

246
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:31,591
And the third part is the overarching narrative.

247
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:37,256
So we have defined a universe with our communication, a universe of this world of mine,

248
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:44,983
and we wanted every bit of content, no matter if it was video or key visual or an interview

249
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:48,687
or whatever it was, it had to fit that tonality of the game.

250
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:55,975
it had to fit all of those elements of the identity of the game, if that makes sense,

251
00:16:55,975 --> 00:17:03,944
because that helped and that defined what this War of Mine really was.

252
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,281
really is. And usually when we think about game marketing, when we think about campaign, we think

253
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:16,382
short term, we focus on the launch window and that makes sense because this is the most important

254
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:25,365
period in your campaign because how well your game is doing in the launch video highly influences

255
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,365
the overall

256
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:31,612
result of your campaign and the overall success of your game, if you will.

257
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:40,438
But at the same time, supporting your game long-term and preparing and running this long-term campaign

258
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:43,860
can help a lot and can get you a long way.

259
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:49,985
So because of that, maintaining the relationship with our community in social media

260
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,847
is also a very important part of what we do.

261
00:17:54,811 --> 00:18:00,054
we use social media and we perceive social media as a communication channel.

262
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:06,257
So we use paid media quite a bit, I would say, those paid posts and so on and so on.

263
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:13,560
But at the same time, social media as a channel is also a part of the universe of our game.

264
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,203
So we treat it in that manner as well. So we post all of those content bits that

265
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:22,565
could be interesting for those people who are very much into our game.

266
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:29,808
So, because of that, we treat social media as a part of the, let's call it, enhanced edition of the game.

267
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:36,150
So, if you like the experience, you can find additional bits and pieces of that experience in social media.

268
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,932
It's kind of a limited DVD, you know what I'm talking about.

269
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:42,833
So, yeah, and it works because...

270
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:48,696
Our community is very engaged and very active.

271
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:52,759
And we do not limit the activity of our community.

272
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,662
We value that part very much.

273
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:59,405
And right now we've got a board game happening

274
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,387
and we love the board game.

275
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:02,668
It's not our initiative,

276
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:04,669
but we support that initiative a lot.

277
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:10,157
We almost had an independent movie based on our game,

278
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:13,041
and for us it's okay, because we never perceived

279
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,605
This War of Mine as a beginning of the franchise.

280
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:18,008
We do not plan to make a sequel,

281
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:20,712
but at the same time, we like the fact...

282
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:26,757
that our community is active and co-creates the universe of this world of mine with us.

283
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:34,524
And we are happy about it. We do not limit the activities as I said before, but we do maintain

284
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:39,568
the coherency of the brand. So we have to make sure that every bit of the

285
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:41,848
content that is related to the game.

286
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,749
No matter if we are creating the content

287
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:47,850
or our gamers are, it should be in line

288
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,311
with the identity of the game, so everyone

289
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:54,272
would know that this World of Mine is what it is.

290
00:19:54,272 --> 00:19:56,733
And it works for us, as I said, because people

291
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,613
seem to like the game, even though.

292
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:07,803
Yeah, even though it can be a struggle, it can be exhausting and sometimes it's even exhausting for me.

293
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:14,268
And we had and actually we have good media coverage, not only gaming wise, not only in gaming media,

294
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:19,832
but in let's call it mainstream media as well. And I strongly believe that we achieved that because

295
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:27,774
We are focusing on emotions, we are focusing on that mind premise and tech, gameplay, all of those

296
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:35,656
features as important as those are, those only follow and those support our communication,

297
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:38,356
but our communication is focused on the big idea, right?

298
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:43,899
And we won some awards and we had good sales.

299
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:46,920
And when it comes to sales,

300
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,621
I strongly believe that the first part,

301
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:52,563
meaning the sales within the launch windows,

302
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:55,284
those are mostly based...

303
00:20:56,365 --> 00:21:01,950
on the fact if your campaign, if your marketing campaign is good or not.

304
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:09,737
But at the same time, long-term sales rely mostly on the quality of the game itself.

305
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:17,179
You can have an exceptional campaign, but if you have a mediocre game, you won't have good sales,

306
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:24,921
which is kind of an obvious thing, but my point is that your marketing campaign is an integral part of your game,

307
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:28,422
not something that is next to it or whatever.

308
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:32,303
You have to make it a coherent thing, and those elements...

309
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:36,266
should support each other very strongly.

310
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:39,569
And yeah, we learned a lot in the process,

311
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:42,652
not only designing, but running the campaign.

312
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:44,733
Early into the campaign,

313
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:47,195
just after we have released the trailer,

314
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:47,896
I played.

315
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:53,558
A while ago, Emir, a survivor from Sarajevo, reached us

316
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:56,099
and we were very happy about it because he told us

317
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:57,179
that he liked the game very much.

318
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,140
And we're like, okay, so it works.

319
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,641
So we are up to something.

320
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:03,242
This is it, we've got it.

321
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:05,703
So we invited him to share the stories.

322
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:08,223
He came to Poland, he came to Warsaw,

323
00:22:08,223 --> 00:22:10,985
and together we have created a launch trailer for the game.

324
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:17,028
And that launch trailer combined his memoirs with our gameplay,

325
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:20,611
so we cooperated and we achieved a great result.

326
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,012
We love the trailer very much.

327
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:24,833
It's kind of a live action mix with gameplay.

328
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,095
You can Google it up because I don't have,

329
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,496
unfortunately, time right now to play all the bits.

330
00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:32,338
but we were quite happy about it.

331
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:34,799
And the lesson here is that sometimes

332
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,200
those opportunities emerge.

333
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,141
And you have to push things forward

334
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:41,862
just to chase those opportunities and use them

335
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:46,544
because they can get you really, really far.

336
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:49,585
But at the same time, when it comes to the cooperation,

337
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:53,067
you will cooperate with some external partners,

338
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:56,788
some agencies, some video production houses and such.

339
00:22:57,088 --> 00:23:00,311
And those cooperations can be good or bad,

340
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:03,513
or they can fall somewhere in between,

341
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:06,696
but you have to maintain,

342
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:09,898
no matter how much you trust your partner,

343
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:13,041
you should always, always maintain the art direction.

344
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,542
You should keep it under your control.

345
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:17,964
Because at the end of the day, it is your game.

346
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:22,507
And at the end of the day, it is your communication,

347
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:26,369
your campaign, and your results that you want to achieve.

348
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,971
And no one from outside of the company actually

349
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:33,294
can feel the matter of your game as well as you do.

350
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:36,275
So you should be the one making those decisions.

351
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:38,957
Because even if you have a poor partner,

352
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:44,020
if you have a good control over the art direction,

353
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:47,122
you will be just fine.

354
00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:51,445
And yeah, and the piracy, which is a fun topic, isn't it?

355
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:55,648
So we encountered that problem at one point,

356
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,991
but we decided not to fight with the piracy

357
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:01,373
because we are not Metallica.

358
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:06,837
But instead of that, we decided to show some empathy.

359
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:14,543
So Karol, a colleague of mine from our team, he posted a message on Pirate Bay thanking,

360
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:21,649
actually thanking people for liking the game and for showing interest in our game.

361
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:27,393
He encouraged them to buy the game, but at the same time he told them, okay guys, I know that

362
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:33,198
for many reasons maybe you cannot buy the game, so I'm gonna share some Steam codes with you.

363
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:36,480
And PR-wise it was a very good move because

364
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,530
it didn't cost much, you know, it was, those were just few codes, but at the same time we have gained

365
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:51,461
good media coverage, we have gained good feedback from our gamers, from our players, but honestly...

366
00:24:52,062 --> 00:24:55,364
while it was a PR move, at the same time it wasn't.

367
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:58,266
Because this is what we believe.

368
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:01,449
All the people that play your game

369
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:02,729
are part of your community.

370
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:05,371
And OK, maybe they didn't pay for your game,

371
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:08,834
but they can contribute in so many different ways.

372
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:09,654
They can.

373
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:16,850
give you good feedback. They can enhance your reach, the reach of your communication. They can

374
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:23,152
build awareness for your game. So maybe they won't give you their money, but their friends may,

375
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:28,934
or friends of their friends, and so on and so on and so on. So fighting with people, you will gain

376
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:34,936
nothing. You will lose energy, you will lose time, and you will lose money. But supporting each other

377
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:38,036
and maintaining good relations with your community, you can...

378
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:42,116
win something at the end of the day and probably you will.

379
00:25:42,116 --> 00:25:45,518
And yeah, and last but not least,

380
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:49,781
because our game is about casualties of war

381
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:53,804
and the expansion pack titled The Little Ones

382
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:57,586
is about kids, it's about children during the time of war,

383
00:25:57,586 --> 00:26:01,669
we decided to start the cooperation with War Child.

384
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:03,610
And that was amazing for us because

385
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:10,873
We not only helped a lot because we have gathered a significant amount of money for them,

386
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:15,294
but it allowed us to reach mainstream media once more.

387
00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:19,316
But our learning was that no matter how good the initiative is,

388
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:26,258
no matter how good your idea for an activity, for an activation or a short campaign burst is,

389
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:34,021
Usually it's a one-shot and it was like that even in terms of our cooperation with War Child,

390
00:26:34,021 --> 00:26:40,763
because it's a long-term cooperation, we are cooperating still, but even after we gathered

391
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:47,606
a significant amount of money, it was hard for us to gain interest of media once again.

392
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,227
So they covered the story once, but then it wasn't.

393
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:59,512
hip enough maybe. So I think that while maintaining coherency and consistency is crucial when it comes

394
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:05,435
to the efficient campaign, at the same time you should diversify your activities

395
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:08,117
and keep them fresh to maintain the hype simply.

396
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,541
Okay, so just to wrap things up,

397
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:13,463
as I have like three minutes more,

398
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:17,606
these are the key takeouts, at least from my perspective,

399
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:20,809
when it comes to this World of Mine and its campaign.

400
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:24,271
So first and foremost, we worked on our strategy

401
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:25,852
quite a lot, I would say.

402
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,534
We iterated and iterated.

403
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:29,295
We wanted to polish it.

404
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,336
as well as we could.

405
00:27:31,336 --> 00:27:34,998
So working on your strategy as long as necessary is crucial,

406
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:37,979
but once you have it, you should stick to it

407
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:40,380
and use it as a foundation,

408
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,861
not only for the first part of the campaign

409
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,202
or the first trailer, launch trailer,

410
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:46,562
however you want to call it,

411
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:50,524
but for the whole thing, for the long-term activity.

412
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:55,346
Everything you do, everything you treat as a follow-up.

413
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:59,767
for the first hit should be in line with that strategy.

414
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:02,649
And start your marketing work early

415
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:05,069
in the development process, I would say,

416
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:07,510
because you should, at least we do,

417
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,311
but I think that you should as well

418
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:12,692
treat your marketing campaign as a part of your game.

419
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,553
It is the same universe.

420
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:17,374
It should be made from the ground up

421
00:28:17,374 --> 00:28:21,495
in close cooperation with your dev team.

422
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:24,437
Make your media planning adequate.

423
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:27,059
I mean, of course, it is about reach,

424
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,560
it is about awareness,

425
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,862
and it is about feedback from your community,

426
00:28:31,862 --> 00:28:32,842
if that makes sense.

427
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:35,764
But at the same time, the reach and awareness

428
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:39,047
and all of those factors are important

429
00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:42,809
as long as you use them in the right channels.

430
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:44,750
Otherwise, it's just buzz.

431
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,433
You do not want to spend all the money to be on TV and on in the radio or whatever.

432
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:52,734
You want to be where you want to be.

433
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:57,217
Those specific channels in which your gamers, your gamers are.

434
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:59,938
Not some people, your gamers, your gamers are.

435
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:05,153
And while you should plan ahead, you should also be prepared for changes,

436
00:29:05,153 --> 00:29:08,177
because our market is dynamic as hell.

437
00:29:08,177 --> 00:29:10,320
Everything changes.

438
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,623
And you're going to have to adjust your campaign.

439
00:29:12,623 --> 00:29:15,146
You're going to have to adjust your strategy.

440
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:23,265
This balance between keeping things as they should be and adjusting them on the go,

441
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:29,150
this is the perfect thing that you should grasp. And I am happy to tell you that I think that

442
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:37,117
we have grasped it and it worked for us a lot. And last but not least, good marketing is important,

443
00:29:37,117 --> 00:29:43,682
but good game is a must. Because good marketing can build you kind of a foundation for the launch,

444
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,343
can build the hype.

445
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:49,389
but you have maintained the hype with your game

446
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:53,595
and maintained the hype with all the things that you do

447
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:56,058
around your game in the long run.

448
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:59,543
So yeah, so that is all from my side.

449
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:00,965
Thank you very much for your time.

450
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,906
It was a pleasure for me.
