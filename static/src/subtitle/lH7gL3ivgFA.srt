1
00:00:06,622 --> 00:00:07,363
Okay, good, we're live.

2
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:09,984
Hello, my name is Zach Barth.

3
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,745
I work at Zachtronics Industries,

4
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:13,266
and we made a game called Spacechem.

5
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:18,029
My part in particular was just design and production.

6
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,150
But today I'm gonna tell you about things

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,791
that went right during the development of Spacechem,

8
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:23,492
some things that went horribly wrong,

9
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:26,133
and if I'm fast enough, some questions from you guys.

10
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:26,873
So, you ready?

11
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:27,914
Yeah.

12
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:29,775
First, we're gonna talk about Spacechem.

13
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:31,616
So raise your hand if you've heard of Spacechem.

14
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:32,757
Yay.

15
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:35,578
Keep your hand up if you've played Spacechem.

16
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:39,524
Keep your hand up if you have a love-hate relationship with SpaceChem.

17
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:41,805
Yes. Exactly.

18
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:44,327
So, for those of you who have never heard of SpaceChem before,

19
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:47,468
this is a screenshot of SpaceChem, and it's pretty self-explanatory.

20
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:48,809
I don't really need to say anything else.

21
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:51,790
So, a question we get asked a lot is,

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,191
what inspired SpaceChem?

23
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,912
And so, some of you may be familiar with some of our older games.

24
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:58,693
It's kind of a, it's a direct descendant of a game called

25
00:00:58,713 --> 00:00:59,934
The Codex of Alchemical Engineering.

26
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,737
which is a lot like Space Camp, but harder. It's kind of hard to believe.

27
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:08,063
That game was an easier version of a game called Manufactoid,

28
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,625
where you programmed a factory in Lua.

29
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:12,668
Not very accessible, which is funny, because I made Space Camp.

30
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,673
And that's actually based off of a television show called How It's Made,

31
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:17,874
which is awesome.

32
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,765
SpaceChem is also inspired by a park in Seattle called Gasworks Park. I don't know if anybody

33
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:25,867
from Seattle is here, but if you go here it's like being in a SpaceChem level.

34
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:30,171
And it's a really cool park. It was a super fun site, super polluted. They cleaned it up and made it into a park.

35
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:35,777
Another question we get a lot that's actually really hard to answer is what kind of game is SpaceChem?

36
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,779
And so we invented a term called design-based puzzle games.

37
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:42,612
And it leads to a follow-up question of what is a design-based puzzle game?

38
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:43,734
So we just made that term up.

39
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:46,258
And so we're going to explore that right now.

40
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:49,242
The first answer I will give you to that question is a definition.

41
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:52,067
So a design-based puzzle game is a puzzle game where

42
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:53,769
solutions take the form of a design.

43
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:55,769
What is a design?

44
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,251
This is a definition that I found on Wikipedia

45
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:00,253
that I think is really great, because it's kind of complicated,

46
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:01,134
but it covers all the points.

47
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:04,356
So a design is a specification of an object that

48
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:07,159
accomplishes goals in a particular environment using

49
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:08,840
a set of primitive components satisfying

50
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,022
a set of requirements subject to constraints.

51
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,704
Or in normal people talk, a plan for a thing

52
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:16,387
that does stuff in a place using parts with constraints.

53
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:21,249
Yeah, another way to look at what a design-based puzzle game is,

54
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,030
is that you kind of know it when you see it.

55
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:26,772
So a traditional puzzle has usually just one solution

56
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:29,553
with very little replay value, because most of the game play

57
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:31,554
is in trying to either figure out what that state is

58
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:32,475
or figure out how to get there.

59
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:35,276
So portal, crossword puzzles both have a single solution.

60
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:36,657
On the case of a crossword puzzle, it's

61
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,097
very important that it has a single solution.

62
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,578
That kind of was part of it.

63
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:42,459
On the other hand, a design-based puzzle game

64
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:43,960
has many possible solutions.

65
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,144
Because people, you're not looking for a state, you're looking for a, you're trying to build a design that does something.

66
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:52,366
So there's many possible solutions, and in the process has replay value,

67
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:57,390
because often times that involves optimization and other sort of fun things that make it, you know, add replay value to puzzles,

68
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,391
which usually don't have them.

69
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:03,375
There's another game, Manufactoria, is a Turing machine game that's awesome, and it's kind of similar.

70
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:06,937
And then you have games that are puzzle games that are not remotely close to being puzzle games,

71
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,541
like Bejeweled and Tetris, and they actually have a lot of replay value because they're not puzzles and you can't solve them.

72
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:12,421
So, whatever.

73
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,419
So in our process, we've made a lot of puzzle games that ended with Spacecam, and most recently.

74
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,085
And there are four aspects that we found in design-based puzzle games that are...

75
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:24,151
common.

76
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:27,652
Emergent tools are one, and this sort of fits back into the definition.

77
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,852
So a design is built out of primitive components.

78
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,593
For us, these are emergent tools.

79
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,133
The difference between a non-emergent tool and an emergent tool

80
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,794
is that non-emergent tools do something, and then it's done,

81
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:37,574
and then it did it.

82
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:39,395
You can have a bunch of tools, but you just

83
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:40,815
use them individually, like a hammer.

84
00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:42,535
I guess we don't have to go there.

85
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:47,117
But emergent tools, like in SpaceChem, you can combine them together,

86
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:49,937
and you get really crazy results by combining.

87
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,838
The whole is more than the sum of the parts.

88
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,919
And that's true in SpaceChem.

89
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,000
And you've got reactors.

90
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,820
You've got instructions.

91
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,142
Some of our older games, we had steam valves and integrated

92
00:03:58,182 --> 00:03:59,422
circuits and all that.

93
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:02,064
So emergent tools that have emergent behavior as a result.

94
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:04,105
Also having precise goals.

95
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:06,827
And this fits into a design also that it has a specific purpose

96
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:07,888
of something it's trying to solve.

97
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:09,909
So SpaceChem, you have to build molecules

98
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,170
from specific inputs and outputs.

99
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,151
Codex Electromechanic had to do a similar thing.

100
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:16,974
Constructor, you had to match little circuit diagram, timing

101
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:17,454
diagram.

102
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:18,515
So it's all very specific.

103
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:19,795
So that way, players know exactly what they have

104
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:21,036
to do, which makes it.

105
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:24,578
They can build lots of possible designs because they know what they're trying to do.

106
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:27,199
You can also add canvases and constraints,

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,641
which matches into the definition of particular environment with constraints.

108
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,883
In SpaceChem, those are reactors, monsters trying to kill you.

109
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:37,365
In Bureau of Steam Engineering, they're steam robots, you had to fit everything inside.

110
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:42,307
And another aspect is that design-based public games should have many solutions.

111
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:44,748
And this sort of fits into the specification of an object that

112
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:47,730
if you have a design space, you can create many designs in it.

113
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,271
So, there's many possible solutions.

114
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:50,871
And this is definitely present in SpaceChem.

115
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,113
So we've got these three sort of ingredients and maybe a lofty goal.

116
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:57,414
This isn't really a good hierarchy because it doesn't fit in neatly.

117
00:04:57,735 --> 00:04:58,415
But what happens?

118
00:04:58,475 --> 00:04:59,536
So what's the point?

119
00:04:59,576 --> 00:04:59,956
What is this?

120
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:03,058
Well, it turns out that if you add all of these things together,

121
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,460
you basically get what we call crack for engineers.

122
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:08,583
It turns out there's a huge portion of the population

123
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,464
that their jobs are solving problems.

124
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,105
They go to school to learn how to solve problems.

125
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:14,887
And then you get to real life and you're filling out TPS reports and stuff.

126
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:15,688
You have to go to meetings.

127
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,769
And that's not problem solving.

128
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:17,489
That's politics.

129
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,713
But then you play Spacechem and it's just pure, unadulterated problem solving.

130
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,915
And a lot of people really love that, and that's awesome.

131
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:27,118
And another aspect of this is that because everybody's

132
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:30,221
creating their own design, as opposed to just finding the one solution,

133
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:34,185
people have a really strong sense of ownership, which makes this very likely

134
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:36,568
to be a favorite game of theirs, which is something I've heard from a lot of you,

135
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:37,328
which is fantastic.

136
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:42,584
One of the other cool side effects of this is that making these kind of puzzles is really easy.

137
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:47,647
So we did the first ever that I know of space chem, like in-person space chem tournament at PAX.

138
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:51,049
And this is our Ironclad Tactics booth, but we had a bunch of people there playing space chem.

139
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,251
And 30 minutes before I realized, oh, I did not make a puzzle.

140
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:55,392
We should make a puzzle for this.

141
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:59,154
So I went on Wikipedia, found some cool hydrocarbons, found acetone,

142
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:03,277
and kind of mocked that up in space chem in the level editor and figured out that.

143
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:05,258
oh yeah, that's mostly methane with a little bit,

144
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,539
so if we subtract out some methane,

145
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,780
we've got a carbon and oxygen.

146
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,103
And it turns out that the oxygen is too above carbon

147
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:12,384
in the periodic table,

148
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:13,705
so we could take those extra hydrogens,

149
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:15,146
and fusion, there we go,

150
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:16,767
and add in some bonders, that's probably enough.

151
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:18,609
And bam, it's a puzzle!

152
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,070
Is it playable?

153
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:22,072
Sure, maybe, I don't know.

154
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,913
And that's sort of the great thing about SpaceChem,

155
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:25,354
is that, and that's how we made all of our puzzles

156
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:26,916
for SpaceChem, was just making something

157
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,097
that looked like it was playable,

158
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:29,598
but because there's such flexibility

159
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:30,458
in how these are solved,

160
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,780
that you can just do whatever you want

161
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,540
when you're making the puzzles.

162
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:37,340
uh... something that falls out of a lot of these these design-based puzzle games

163
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,821
are some really awesome community features

164
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:42,283
when we did the codex we put it on uh...

165
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:44,144
flash game website, can't think of the name

166
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:46,925
uh... it's a big one, you guys probably know what it is

167
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:49,767
uh... and they have forums and a congregate, is that it?

168
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:53,129
A lot of people posted in the comments, and they're like,

169
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:54,089
this is my solution.

170
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:55,850
Here's the crazy code for it.

171
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,551
And somebody else would load it up, and they say, you know what?

172
00:06:57,631 --> 00:06:59,311
I shaved two cycles off your solution.

173
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,673
Somebody's like, oh, I shaved another five cycles off.

174
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:02,793
And so what's going on?

175
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:03,754
What is happening here?

176
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:04,434
This is kind of weird.

177
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:05,755
This doesn't happen in a lot of other games.

178
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,076
because a lot of games aren't like these.

179
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:10,038
And we realized that players like to compete,

180
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:11,720
they like to optimize their solutions,

181
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,081
and they like to share them with other people.

182
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:15,564
So when it came to SpaceChem, instead of letting people

183
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:17,125
just kind of duke it out in the forums of Kongregate,

184
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,346
which is not the best place to do anything,

185
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,549
we started adding these all as first-class features.

186
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,291
So starting with histograms.

187
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,832
I'm sure all of you who have played SpaceChem

188
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,214
know about the histograms and hate them.

189
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:32,396
Histograms are awesome because they're basically like an egalitarian leaderboard.

190
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:35,276
When you have a game with an actual leaderboard, you know, you're going to be like

191
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:40,558
50,000 maybe, like slightly behind like xxxpantherfanxxx

192
00:07:41,118 --> 00:07:43,458
and somebody who just like slammed on the keyboard, you know?

193
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:46,299
And it doesn't really tell you like, did you do well? Did you not?

194
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,459
How many people are hacking? Like leaderboards are awful.

195
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:52,520
In Spacechem, you've got this leaderboard, kind of, but it shows you the distribution,

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,881
it shows you like where the average falls, it doesn't have any asshole's name on it,

197
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:57,781
you know, it's very egalitarian.

198
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:03,666
It also encourages optimization, because you see that when you're to the right of the average,

199
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,627
that you can probably go to the left, and it wouldn't be that hard.

200
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:08,589
It also has the side effect that everyone is a winner.

201
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,112
And what we mean by this is that when you solve a level, when you optimize for cycles,

202
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:16,015
you probably are not doing well with symbols, but we are logging all of those into the graphs.

203
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:18,237
So every time you do really well on one, you're doing really bad on another,

204
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:20,038
and you're padding out the bad side,

205
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:24,321
and it kind of increases the ability of everyone to do better than average at something,

206
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:25,182
which is fantastic.

207
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,527
One problem, though, is that these are not good for every game.

208
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:30,628
And actually, the portal, there's a lot of fans that like it,

209
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:32,469
there are a couple of fans at Valve of SpaceChem at least,

210
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,730
and who wanted to add histograms to Portal 2.

211
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,250
So they did.

212
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:39,833
And their histograms are, the axes are time to beat the puzzle, I think,

213
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:42,214
and number of portals shot, both of which are terrible,

214
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:45,515
because, you know, Portal's a performance game, SpaceChem's a design game,

215
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,236
if you mess up, you have to go back over and do it again.

216
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:50,418
I don't think anybody, I tried searching for pictures of the histograms on Portal 2

217
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,699
and could not find them on the internet, which is saying something.

218
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,982
So it doesn't work in every game, but for some games like SpaceChem it is amazing.

219
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:59,666
The funny thing though, we tried to push, we're like, no, we don't want leaderboards.

220
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:01,248
So people went and made their own leaderboards.

221
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,171
If you go to SpaceChem.net, which is probably the domain we should have bought,

222
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:09,698
there's a SpaceChem leaderboard where they reverse engineered our file format

223
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:12,841
so that people can upload their saved files and put it into a leaderboard that we didn't make.

224
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,585
So, and honestly, that's probably better than us making our own,

225
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,448
because if it gets gamed, whatever, it's not ours.

226
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:18,510
You know, that's their problem.

227
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,712
But these are awesome.

228
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:21,935
One of the great things about a hardcore game like Spacechem

229
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:23,418
is that you've got hardcore awesome fans,

230
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,162
who make their own leaderboards and reverse-engineer your file formats.

231
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,023
It's awesome.

232
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:30,519
Another cool community feature we did were videos.

233
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,121
We realized that people were sharing the little codes for saving,

234
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:35,683
and that was actually only because we didn't even know how to make games

235
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:37,204
that save stuff in Flash, but, uh,

236
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:39,666
people were sharing these codes and sharing the designs.

237
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:40,786
So we realized, you know what we're gonna do?

238
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:42,988
We're gonna make it so you can press a button in SpaceChem

239
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,210
and it'll export, like, uh, it'll take you to a website

240
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,371
where it uploads, uh, like, images of your solution.

241
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:49,212
You can click on reactors and view inside.

242
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:52,314
And really quickly we realized, wow, this is a terrible feature.

243
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:54,036
Because if you look at that, is that a good solution?

244
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:54,816
Is that bad?

245
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:55,476
Is that clever?

246
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:56,077
Is it awful?

247
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,298
I have no idea.

248
00:09:57,918 --> 00:10:00,400
So we realized really quickly that as cool as this feature is,

249
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,581
it really needs to be a video because otherwise it's useless.

250
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,163
But then we realized, oh god, where are we going to put those videos?

251
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,483
That's going to take up so much more space.

252
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,365
It's going to just, ah, put them on YouTube.

253
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:09,085
That's where you put them.

254
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:11,046
Because they are glad to host your videos for you.

255
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:11,867
And so we did.

256
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:14,668
So we built a recording, uploads to YouTube.

257
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,708
It goes on their dime.

258
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,169
All of it links back.

259
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:19,329
There are 11,000 SpaceChem videos on YouTube.

260
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,110
That's kind of awesome.

261
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,631
This is normally where I would talk about how to do this, but

262
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:25,192
that's going to take way too long to talk about now.

263
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:26,352
So I'm not going to talk about that.

264
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:28,173
But you guys can talk to me later about that if you care

265
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:28,533
about that.

266
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,253
So we did it in a cross-platform way.

267
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:32,814
Super cool, super simple, super reliable, and

268
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:34,915
potentially open-sourced to anybody who's interested.

269
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:38,337
Another community feature we had were custom puzzles.

270
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:41,400
This is our kind of gaudy looking level editor for Space Game

271
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,585
that's ugly but highly functional, and allowed us to do something really cool.

272
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,707
This part's kind of conventional. A lot of games have level editors.

273
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:51,792
What a lot of games don't do is have level editors that feed into a thing

274
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,435
that the designer picks the levels that get published

275
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:57,578
instead of just having them go in so they all get rated and there's terrible stuff.

276
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,721
Like, I think Super Meat Boy, they have a bunch of user levels,

277
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:01,962
but users had to filter through them.

278
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,503
So instead, we did something called the journal,

279
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:04,724
so it looks like a scientific journal,

280
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,126
and kind of fits in the universe of the game.

281
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,868
And I went through for months and hated it,

282
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:11,370
but it was cool, picking out all the puzzles that looked like they were good,

283
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,252
because I didn't play them, because I didn't have to, because it's Space Chem.

284
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:16,515
And then published ones in volumes that looked cool.

285
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:18,637
So, and there's a lot of actual pros to this.

286
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,559
There are no trash puzzles.

287
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,181
Like, anybody who made up, like, my first puzzle, ASDF,

288
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:24,582
like, did not see the light of day.

289
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:26,905
There are no puzzles that broke the spirit of the game.

290
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,689
Anybody who didn't know, like, a thing about kind of making fake chemistry,

291
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,530
not going in.

292
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:33,074
Themed issues made it feel cohesive.

293
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:35,577
That, you know, the first, the one on the top, issue nine that you see,

294
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:36,639
is actual science.

295
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,283
These are all reactions that are based on actual reactions from real life.

296
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,825
So we could do that kind of theming stuff like that.

297
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:41,486
It's super awesome.

298
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,628
And getting published is really cool.

299
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:46,129
And having a game, kind of, you do something for the game

300
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,051
and it recognizes you and puts your name up there.

301
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:49,532
When I got really lazy at then, I just

302
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:51,553
started doing research anthologies that were just

303
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:53,775
based on a, like, the common theme was that a person made them.

304
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:55,176
So, and that's cool.

305
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:56,677
Like, it was easy for me and it was cool for them

306
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,258
because the game recognized how awesome they were.

307
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,640
The downside of this is that it's a pain in the ass.

308
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,102
So, surprise, surprise.

309
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,563
So, those are all some good things from SpaceChem.

310
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,684
Now we're going to talk about the bad things

311
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:09,226
that we did terribly, terribly, poorly, bad job.

312
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:11,327
Cautionary tale number one is a peel.

313
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:13,844
Everybody loves science, right?

314
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:15,986
No, everybody loves Portal.

315
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:21,493
You would not believe how many people played, they took a look at Space King and they're like,

316
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,295
oh, I'm not good at chemistry, I'm not gonna play your game.

317
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,858
And the funny thing, you guys all know, is that it's not even about chemistry,

318
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,360
it's a game about programming. God.

319
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:31,745
So, but what happened? I mean, is science really that unattractive?

320
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:33,979
No, but Spacechem is.

321
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:36,320
Here's a screenshot from Spacechem.

322
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,101
And Ryan, if you're here, we love you, and you did a great job.

323
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:41,741
But this is me making a game that is like, oh yeah,

324
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,102
there's going to be lines and circles,

325
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:45,062
and we're going to have to make this look as pretty as possible

326
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:45,783
on an indie budget.

327
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:46,943
Like, this is Spacechem.

328
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,024
Battlefield 3 also came out that year.

329
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:50,284
It looks like this.

330
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:51,925
Like, which one do you want to play?

331
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:53,205
Like, if somebody showed you screenshots,

332
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:55,086
they're like, you can buy this, or you can buy this.

333
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,446
And given this one's a little bit cheaper,

334
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:57,587
but this one has guns in it.

335
00:12:59,287 --> 00:12:59,407
So.

336
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:04,133
But the truth of it is that SpaceCam, you know, like these kind of games can be attractive.

337
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:06,135
Here's a game called Splice, which looks beautiful,

338
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,537
and it's a puzzle game, and it's kind of programmery.

339
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:10,839
It's about like binary trees and stuff, and it looks really good.

340
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:11,960
And it even looks science-y.

341
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:15,844
And people are like, wow, that looks like awesome science, as opposed to that science.

342
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:21,280
So, appeal is important and we sort of didn't realize that until it was far too late.

343
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,162
But fortunately for us, Spacechem is addictive.

344
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:28,385
And like all addictive substances, it is up to your questionable friends to get you hooked

345
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:28,666
on it.

346
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:32,929
And I think that's really why Spacechem was successful and I'm allowed to be here today

347
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,171
is because all of you who played Spacechem and everybody who played Spacechem told their

348
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,173
friends about it and they're like, you should try this game.

349
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:38,993
And they're like, but it looks like...

350
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:42,535
and I'm like, no it's really fun, I will buy you a copy.

351
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,497
And because of pushy people who really enjoyed the game,

352
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:48,639
it really had an awesome viral reach, outbreak, whatever you call it.

353
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,580
That has negative connotations, I don't know.

354
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:53,221
Cautionary tale number two, difficulty.

355
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:58,299
When we designed Spacechem, we were designing for our previous games for engineers audience.

356
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:01,580
We made a game about, called Constructor, about integrated circuit design.

357
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,901
You're placing silicon.

358
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:03,621
It's, uh, yeah.

359
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:07,003
So it was, these are people who really liked hard games and, you know, played our old games

360
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:08,283
and were like, oh, where's the challenge?

361
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:08,983
These are easy.

362
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:12,885
It turns out that is not the same thing as the games for normal people audience,

363
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:16,807
who like things like Portal that are very approachable and palatable and well, you know,

364
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:18,267
they, they, they're easy to play.

365
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:18,708
It's nice.

366
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:20,488
Even when they're challenging, they're still easy to play.

367
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:24,934
In SpaceChem, you have to beat over 50 puzzles to complete the story.

368
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:27,975
It takes up to like an hour, if not more, for a puzzle.

369
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:29,976
I talked to somebody who played the last puzzle for like a week.

370
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:32,537
Not straight, but in pieces.

371
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,319
And then on top of that, there are seven defense missions,

372
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:37,140
which are super vague and are like harder than average.

373
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:43,673
Okay, so this is the difficulty percentages of SpaceChem levels,

374
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:45,935
and you can see that some of them are like 50% or lower,

375
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,977
people who boot them up complete them,

376
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:51,079
which comes out to a bottom rating of like 2%.

377
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,022
And if you compare this to other games, it's actually...

378
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:58,265
It's more on par closer to Meat Boy than games like World of Goo or Bastion,

379
00:14:58,285 --> 00:14:59,827
which have like a 15% completion rate.

380
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:03,109
Which kind of leads to an open question. Is this a bad thing? Is this acceptable?

381
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,590
Spacechem is really hard.

382
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,493
It's kind of cool being able to say you've made one of the hardest puzzle games ever,

383
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,395
but I think next time wouldn't make it so hard,

384
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:12,577
because then more people can play it and more people can like it.

385
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:14,859
Cautionary tale number three, and we're running out of time,

386
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,240
so I'm going to blast through this. The tutorials in Spacechem suck.

387
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:17,961
Like, I...

388
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:22,345
So...

389
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,545
You guys know why! I don't really...

390
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:32,329
The most important rule of making games is you have to ship it.

391
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:35,531
So, which in this case is finishing the presentation.

392
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:40,414
So, our theory about tutorials, because we all know why the Space Chimp tutorials suck, is that...

393
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:44,144
When we did the SpaceChem tutorials, we put a lot of text. We tried to explain it.

394
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,886
Kind of like, you're in school, you're reading stuff, and everybody in school reads everything

395
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:48,207
and thinks about it, obviously. No.

396
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,929
People learn through trial and error. They're gonna click stuff, and they're gonna click it again,

397
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:54,271
and they're gonna click it like five times, just in case two clicks aren't enough.

398
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:55,832
People learn through trial and error.

399
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:59,014
So, in order to make a good tutorial, just make a little like bumper padded room

400
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:00,795
where people can just bounce around and click on everything,

401
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,497
and ultimately find their way to the door and like move on to the next one.

402
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:05,559
So, that's how all your tutorials should be.

403
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,796
More simply, you could just playtest your game until people get it right, and then just keep tweaking stuff, and then play...

404
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:12,919
We didn't do enough playtesting with SpaceChem, but, yeah.

405
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,040
Okay.

406
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:18,626
We're gonna finish up. RapidFire post-launch secrets. These are the parts that you guys are gonna love!

407
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:21,429
Steam! Great platform or greatest platform?

408
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,754
Greatest! Over 90% of our sales come from Steam.

409
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,080
Mac and Linux, is it worth it?

410
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,660
That was the question at the end of the last talk.

411
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:29,481
Kind of.

412
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:32,402
Like, 10% of our sales came from Mac and Linux.

413
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:37,924
And the split was probably like 90%, 8% on Mac, and then 2% on Linux.

414
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,105
And then it lets you get on the Humble Bundle, which is amazing.

415
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:41,165
What about iOS?

416
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:42,206
Kind of.

417
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:43,826
Even SpaceChem did OK on the iOS.

418
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:45,887
Although I think it was mostly PC customers just

419
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:46,848
buying it again on their tablet.

420
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:48,609
What about Android?

421
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:52,012
The iOS sales were pretty low compared to PC.

422
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,353
Android sales were one-fifth of that.

423
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,135
Not worth it, unless you count the Android Humble Bundle,

424
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,577
which is amazing and did way better than iOS ever did for us.

425
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,738
So, something to consider.

426
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,000
Funding. How did we make SpaceChem?

427
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,702
We worked nights, we worked weekends, we did profit sharing,

428
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:07,864
cost very little out of pocket, and we all profited wildly from it.

429
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:08,245
So, yay.

430
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,180
uh... speaking of how much yes so we made like seven hundred thousand

431
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,641
dollars on space camp and that includes humble bundles team sales private store

432
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:16,062
sales

433
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:20,163
on the long tail we still sell a little bit stick starters for physical copies

434
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:22,284
just a stretching out of what you know looking as much as you can

435
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:24,284
but uh... that's that's the name of the game right

436
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:26,345
how do we have a support

437
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:29,726
and that is i do that personally and this is awesome because when people

438
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:32,167
email me they buy the gary debate by copies based on

439
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,869
we put on fifty percent off the next day

440
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,153
and uh... and they asked for poetry or something i don't know if you guys are

441
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:37,854
that good enough but

442
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:38,555
he wanted me

443
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,576
you want to get one sale

444
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:43,160
the air but the important sale and i want to sell any felt on the as for

445
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,221
palms i wrote a poem

446
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,484
and i will just i think i got off on it okay

447
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:48,266
so once was a bloke on the net

448
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:49,688
but space camp but that was upset

449
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:53,972
This game is on sale, but I'm full of fail, so I think that it's time to make threats.

450
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:59,355
I've been wronged and I'm plagued with frustrations, and demand poetry as reparations.

451
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:03,077
Although I thought twice, in the end I was nice, you can't beat my customer relations.

452
00:18:03,097 --> 00:18:04,377
So...

453
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,719
So, the future.

454
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:10,180
What are we working on now?

455
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,540
Ironclad Tactics.

456
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,281
Check it out online.

457
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:13,021
We'll talk about it later.

458
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,142
Thank you so much for coming out.

459
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:17,883
Thank you, CAs, for being awesome.

460
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:19,664
Thank you, GDC, for having me.

461
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,567
So, how much time do we have left?

462
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:24,510
I'm kind of exhausted.

463
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,472
Do we have like five minutes?

464
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,415
Okay, question time.

465
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:29,839
Rise, ask questions.

466
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,883
You guys have to talk as fast as me if we're going to get through this.

467
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:37,930
uh... there's a microphone there, there's a microphone, you gotta get to the mic, oh there's a microphone there, yes, go!

468
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,773
okay uh... you had an article at one point about how you thought the demo

469
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:44,355
was a failure, oh god yes, but

470
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:48,018
but i personally found the demo completely convinced me to play the game

471
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:51,020
uh... if it was half as long would it have also convinced you to play it?

472
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,563
i don't know if that's true because i liked that it was longer than most

473
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,244
demos, i think you would have bought it anyway

474
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:59,026
you think so? i think so, it's space cow, yes!

475
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:00,067
so so quick

476
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:08,629
So, for your next game, are you going to spend more time refining the demo first, rather than like the final ship thing?

477
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:15,611
I've been told that a game with a compelling gameplay trailer and no demo will do better than the demo, or at least equal.

478
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:17,632
Please demo your game.

479
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:21,133
I'll just give you a free copy. How about that?

480
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:22,913
You can be in the beta.

481
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,714
Thank you.

482
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:26,294
Next.

483
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,991
Um, how do you know that a puzzle is solvable?

484
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:30,252
And also, do you know...

485
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:31,132
You give it to a play tester.

486
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:34,513
You can also...

487
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,574
With SpaceChem, there are two stages of solvability.

488
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:38,555
The stoichiometry phase, where you make sure that there's, like,

489
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:39,915
the right atoms and the right combinations.

490
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:42,416
And then there's the does-it-fit-without-losing-your-mind

491
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:44,077
inside the little box of the reactor phase.

492
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:45,597
So I did the first part on paper.

493
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:47,678
And so I've never beaten the last level of SpaceChem.

494
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:48,378
I can be honest.

495
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:52,048
I have had enough space cam, I think I deserve a pass.

496
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,230
I never beat the last level, but I designed it,

497
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,771
I spent like a week proving on paper that it was possible,

498
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:58,512
passed it off to some playtesters, they beat it,

499
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,813
or they didn't beat it, they said it was too hard,

500
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:02,034
went back, refined it to make some of it simple.

501
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,535
Instead of hydrogen, it used to be methane

502
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:04,475
that powered everything at the end,

503
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,596
which is way harder to break apart.

504
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,158
So, and then, they're gonna re-do the stoichiometry,

505
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:09,458
pass it back, some people beat it,

506
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:10,959
not enough people, obviously, but that's,

507
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:12,180
we've been through that, so.

508
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:14,601
So you proved it on paper?

509
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:16,783
I proved it on paper and then gave it to playtesters.

510
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:22,110
thank you. I'm not saying that's the way you should do it, I'm just saying that's the way we did it.

511
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,971
This is not advice, these cautionary tales are indeed cautionary tales.

512
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:32,572
I actually played through the game and beat it and thought it was awesome.

513
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,592
Something you didn't talk about,

514
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:38,353
was the story, was that like an afterthought or was that something you had

515
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:41,114
conceived of from the beginning? Like the writing was actually really good.

516
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:44,515
So we start all of our, and you should be careful because my wife writes the stories.

517
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,835
But we start every game with a story.

518
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:50,536
And there was a talk at PAX Dev last year about board games,

519
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,717
where a lot of German board games, they make a game and

520
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:55,177
then they slap a story on the back of the box and hope it

521
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:56,178
made it into the printing of the game.

522
00:20:56,618 --> 00:20:59,678
And we start every game with a well thought out story.

523
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,599
Because eventually we get to a point and say, what do we add

524
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:02,999
now, or how should this work?

525
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,340
And you can turn to the story and say, how would it work in

526
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,860
the story?

527
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,040
That's a big part.

528
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,781
All the levels in Spacechem were inspired thematically by

529
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:12,602
the story and where they fit in, and the career path of

530
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,102
the protagonist.

531
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:16,765
and so for us story is very important

532
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:20,229
production wise the story in Spacechem was very simple and very limited because

533
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:21,831
everything about Spacechem was honestly

534
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,693
so Ironclad Tactics the game we're working on now

535
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:27,417
for contrast is a seventy page graphic novel that we have way too many people working on

536
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,600
and uh... but it's going to be amazing because it weaves in with the game and it's

537
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,963
not quite the same as like a world that has the story in it but we're

538
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:34,765
still pushing that way because it's very very important to us

539
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,910
you to feature was super cool thank you

540
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:43,954
how long did you spend getting that in the game just roughly one of the

541
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:47,076
programs right it's uh... yeah yeah it's it's like three

542
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:50,479
but i guess that's how much program but uh... it's it's pretty it's it's

543
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:52,320
surprisingly not hard once you figure out how to do it

544
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,484
the across platform yet cross platform we use a c sharp for everything

545
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:59,646
exclusively so we we have a way to do it if i'll tell you i later how it works

546
00:21:59,746 --> 00:22:00,827
and like that that would be the code

547
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:06,832
I know for a little while you gave out the game to schools for free.

548
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:07,353
It's still.

549
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,194
Oh, it still is.

550
00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:08,675
Still.

551
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:11,120
Anybody here who has a school who wants Space Chem, it's yours.

552
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,486
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that.

553
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,646
are there any cool again it goes again from like professors or anything about

554
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:23,328
what it's a the one and i don't know if this is going to pressing but uh...

555
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:26,550
so so we've been at the schools all over the world and it's not like a lot

556
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,073
really like a hundred but on so uh... typical school in america will say oh

557
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:33,034
yeah we want to have a space comes when it is his chemistry

558
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:35,115
And that's where you guys all laugh, because yeah.

559
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,475
In the schools in the UK, however, there's

560
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:39,236
apparently some sort of strong computing in schools thing,

561
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:40,676
where they say, oh, we want to use SpaceChem

562
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:42,877
to teach kids programming familiarity, which

563
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:43,357
makes more sense.

564
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:44,898
You give it to the schools in Eastern Europe,

565
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:45,998
and they say, oh, we want to teach kids

566
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:48,919
how to be problem solvers, and how to just approach a problem,

567
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,899
break it down, and use problem solving logic.

568
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,340
And I think that shows differences,

569
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,881
the different ways in how they use the tool

570
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:55,901
reflects their culture.

571
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:58,742
But those are also just total anecdotes.

572
00:22:59,102 --> 00:23:00,882
Anecdotal evidence is the best kind of evidence.

573
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:01,443
I agree.

574
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:01,823
Yeah.

575
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:03,405
Do we have time for more questions?

576
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:04,505
One more.

577
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:04,565
Hi.

578
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:09,127
Great talk, by the way.

579
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:12,488
By going off of the subject about bringing the game to schools,

580
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:14,229
some games in the past have given to schools

581
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:16,990
have also have bundled with lesson plans or things of that sort.

582
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,951
When you give the game to schools, do you

583
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:20,292
usually give any kind of suggestions of how

584
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:22,192
you've seen it effectively used in the classroom, where you just

585
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:23,253
kind of let them have at it?

586
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:25,554
Or have you had any ideas yourself of how you would want to see it used?

587
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:28,575
We have a two-page document on ways you could possibly use it,

588
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:29,796
but that's really why we're giving it away for free.

589
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:32,968
no school's gonna buy Space Cam. Like, it's just not happening.

590
00:23:32,988 --> 00:23:33,829
Well, I don't buy it, but rather than...

591
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:36,551
It doesn't... it really doesn't fit into a curriculum, and that's the thing.

592
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:38,573
Like, and it has, like, there's, like, people's heads exploding,

593
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:40,835
and, like, we described the nostrils sliding down his cheek, you know,

594
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,016
and little touches like that, that...

595
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:43,857
that's not exactly what schools are into.

596
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:45,779
And, uh, and it definitely doesn't fit into curriculums,

597
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,400
because it's nothing like real life, and that's sort of...

598
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,462
I mean, we can talk later, like, we do a little bit of educational games on the side,

599
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,045
and, uh, and that really fits into our philosophy of how we make educational games,

600
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:56,968
is that, like, try to make it as, like...

601
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:01,076
weird and different as you can right

602
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:01,718
mistake

603
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:07,234
and i think that's all the time we have so thank you guys so much for coming up
