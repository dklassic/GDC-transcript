1
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:10,634
Can you hear me okay? I tend to talk too loudly, so I'm going to try to gauge this in real

2
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:18,816
time. Yes, I am going to talk about the Banner Saga but I'm basically going to use it as

3
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:18,856
a...

4
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:26,729
sort of stand in to discuss this sort of subtitle, this should probably be reversed,

5
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,397
Own Your Choices. Out of curiosity, who here was at the Game Sound Con?

6
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,047
Okay, good. Most of you were not. That's what I was hoping.

7
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:43,613
Because I am going to dovetail a little bit with comments that I made there.

8
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:48,658
Of course, I guess I should say who was at my talk at GameSoundCon.

9
00:00:48,678 --> 00:00:50,940
Because those don't necessarily correlate.

10
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:58,890
The fundamental takeaway then, as today, was all about owning your choices.

11
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,851
So much of what we do as composers is about making decisions.

12
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:10,434
I'm a big fan of the notion that basically all technique, musically, whether you're talking

13
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:13,955
compositionally or production or anything like that, that's all very learnable.

14
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,902
And so the thing that separates me from you and you from each other and everybody,

15
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,542
and not in a better or worse sort of way,

16
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:26,283
but just what literally makes us not the same person,

17
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:27,463
are the choices that we make.

18
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:30,384
And generally speaking,

19
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:34,705
I don't know if you want to call it the system,

20
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:37,125
or just kind of the environment, the competition, whatever it is,

21
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:40,106
makes it sort of daunting and scary.

22
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:49,338
to actually make those choices. So, that is, I think, my assessment of what it is that we actually do.

23
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:59,287
I'm a big fan of that picture, by the way. There's usually only semi-relation of the images to what I'm talking about.

24
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:05,692
In this case, it's fairly on topic, but I figured, you know, someone cosplaying Metal Gear Solid, I have to put that in my talk somewhere.

25
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:09,655
Weirdly enough, I don't, I think I typed...

26
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,782
like mystery or something into Google image and it took us right into our own backyard.

27
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,462
I was very happy about that.

28
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,864
So in other words, the idea is I want to talk about the philosophy.

29
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:22,065
What is the composer's actual role?

30
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:25,227
Because I don't believe it's actually writing music.

31
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:27,549
We are storytellers.

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,011
Much like LeVar Burton.

33
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:36,006
And storytelling is about interconnectivity.

34
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:40,609
Storytelling works when you connect with the person you are telling a story to.

35
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,992
And at the end of the day, that's all music composing is about.

36
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:50,356
It's about meaningfully creating these connections and tapping into some core truth,

37
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,217
which I would spell with a capital T.

38
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,598
Something that feels universal, something that feels very powerful.

39
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:59,234
Even if it doesn't... genre, all these things don't matter when you're talking about that.

40
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:04,598
It's just the idea that I have connected with you in a very sort of primal way.

41
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:08,421
But in a way, that's sort of a whole other talk.

42
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,943
And so today, the whole notion of owning your choices

43
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:15,466
is really more about how we go about doing that.

44
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,506
How does one...

45
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:23,573
make those choices, or another way to put it is, how does one sort of create, how does

46
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:24,013
one create?

47
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:27,374
How does one synthesize creative ideas?

48
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,775
And I don't think that we do.

49
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:33,795
I think creativity is an act of discovery.

50
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:39,376
That's a very lame and on-the-nose image for that, by the way.

51
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:49,647
But, point is, the greatest ideas musically, and in all creative acts, what makes them

52
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:55,968
great is that they have that very magical quality that we call inevitability.

53
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:05,450
And I think another way to put it is that we need to be seeing what we do as not so

54
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,451
much making ideas, but getting out of their way.

55
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:14,145
And letting them kind of be created as they want to be created on their own.

56
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:18,608
Which is a bit antithetical to the notion of owning your choices, and I understand that.

57
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:20,410
You will embrace my mixed metaphors.

58
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:27,435
But the idea is, you know, if you are getting out of its way, it's because what's happening

59
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,738
is embracing archetypes we all know and understand.

60
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:35,161
It's about understanding basic psychology and understanding what the listener's takeaway

61
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:35,722
is going to be.

62
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:38,464
What aspects of the music are they actually going to latch onto?

63
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,470
And I think that the way that we do that is simple.

64
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,576
And this was kind of my big point at the GameSoundCon talk,

65
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:51,908
was to say that creative courage is basically the only thing that separates people from...

66
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,901
The presuming technique to be a level playing field,

67
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,162
that if you feel like you have less technique, say,

68
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,742
in orchestration, that's very improvable, that's learnable.

69
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:03,563
So assuming all people are equal on the front of technique,

70
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,443
what often ends up being the separating point

71
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:07,364
between those who are the most successful and those aren't

72
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:09,084
is the act of creative courage.

73
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:11,425
And that's what owning your ideas is all about,

74
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:13,085
is actually finding something.

75
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:13,965
And no matter how.

76
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:19,165
Weird and novel it might seem, owning it and fully committing to it.

77
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:23,106
A way that I like to think of it is that every decision we make, especially when it comes

78
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:27,227
to composing, but every decision we make period, whether I sit here and I keep fiddling with

79
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:31,468
this deciding at what point I'm actually going to drink some of it, that is no different

80
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:38,050
than a compositional decision in that every decision we make separates reality in that

81
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,410
moment from all others.

82
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,411
based on other decisions we might have made.

83
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:47,213
So if I, you know, decide to just randomly walk off the stage and leave

84
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:48,953
and everyone sits here in silence saying like,

85
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:51,934
what kind of weird performance art did we just come here to

86
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:52,895
and do we get our money back?

87
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,416
I would have separated my reality and all of yours

88
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,697
into a slightly different one than if I actually give my talk.

89
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:02,098
And every compositional decision,

90
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:06,139
bear in mind I understand that it's on these tiny little microscopic levels where, you know,

91
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:12,836
Writing that C sharp in this octave versus that octave is not necessarily going to change

92
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:18,541
the future of history, but it is a different reality than if you had chosen the other one.

93
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,996
And the people that I think run into trouble,

94
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,980
and whose music ends up being creatively somehow never quite there,

95
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,043
are the ones that are so paralyzed with fear by having to commit to that choice,

96
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,385
that they try to straddle multiple realities.

97
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:37,147
And it ends up being basically bland and generic,

98
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:40,029
and it has no commitment, has no creative courage.

99
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:43,632
And I understand that if you take this idea down the rabbit hole,

100
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,173
it becomes very terrifying very quickly.

101
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,475
But that ultimately is...

102
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:52,938
What separates people. So, I'm going to use that to talk about this game that I just finished

103
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,821
that I had a really wonderful time to work on, a really wonderful time working on rather,

104
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:03,085
called The Banner Saga. I am in no way trying to proclaim that I made good choices, or that

105
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:07,327
the music is great, or that you'll like it, or anything like that, but I do feel proud

106
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,871
that I did commit to those choices.

107
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:11,732
And that's why I like to use it as an example.

108
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,533
So hopefully there might be some things

109
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:17,875
that interest you about the actual process itself,

110
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,897
but the idea behind presenting this score

111
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:23,039
in addition to the fact that it's just brand new

112
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,961
is that I do actually feel really good

113
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:30,123
about the commitment to the choices made.

114
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:33,905
So I want to give you a bit of a rundown.

115
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,927
I see I have at least one of my photographed gentlemen here.

116
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:37,888
Are you the only one here right now?

117
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:43,852
Well this is John Watson, one of the three sort of core members of what we call Stoic.

118
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:51,757
He's very worthy of your applause. As you can see, they had a very successful Kickstarter.

119
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:57,640
There's no time left though, I'm sorry to say. So you have to put your wallets back

120
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,503
in your pocket. But 20,042 people beat you to it, so that's okay.

121
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:05,825
Actually did anyone here back the game? Yeah, alright, awesome.

122
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:11,063
I didn't even occur to me to ask, but that's really cool.

123
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,784
Out of curiosity, why did you?

124
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:14,985
I know you.

125
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:15,725
Why don't you tell me?

126
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,885
I really liked the setting.

127
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:27,310
The art was really impressive.

128
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,810
And I kind of felt like I had a little bit of a personal stake

129
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,350
in it becoming really cool.

130
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,011
Well, I couldn't agree more.

131
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,131
The visual style of this game is extremely.

132
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,901
engaging and striking and unforgettable the instant you see it.

133
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:41,111
And that was, which, that little screen grab only gives you the tiniest sense of.

134
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:42,234
But, um...

135
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:46,329
Just a quick overview on the game itself.

136
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,731
For me, the most important takeaway is actually the right half of the frame there, which is

137
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:54,674
Alex Thomas John Watson and Arnie Jorgensen.

138
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:59,336
And for me, the takeaway there, I know this is slightly on a tangent from the point of

139
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:03,919
my talk, but when working with people, for me, who I'm working with is always by far

140
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:04,699
the most important thing.

141
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:05,940
It doesn't matter what kind of game they're making.

142
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,422
It doesn't matter what genre it is or what genre, inevitably, the music will then be

143
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:10,602
in.

144
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,463
These are people that I want in my life.

145
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,487
Then I'll go off the edge of a cliff for them.

146
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:17,872
And I feel like I do my best writing in that situation anyway.

147
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:20,577
And of course one would if you actually care about the people.

148
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:24,263
So at some point I just made the career decision of that's actually going to be

149
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:30,637
That's going to be how I make all my career decisions, is what do you mean to me as a

150
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:31,057
human?

151
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:36,822
Because, you know, it's not like you are going to date every person you meet or marry every

152
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,084
person you meet, and we don't see that as a problem.

153
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:45,307
We're like, no, no, you choose people because of what they mean to you, and they choose

154
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:46,348
you for the same reason.

155
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:51,212
And when you're collaborating with someone, especially on a thing like this, a Kickstarter

156
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:52,432
totally independent game.

157
00:09:53,309 --> 00:10:00,518
Where there is no lifeline from a publisher or somebody to give you money when you're over budget and over schedule and all those things.

158
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:03,162
You're in it with people. You're not in it with an entity.

159
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:05,745
And it's really important. So that's a side note.

160
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:09,014
But that gives you a sense of why I immediately jumped on board.

161
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,535
It was the same response that you had.

162
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:11,416
I saw what they were making.

163
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:12,697
They called me out of the blue.

164
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:15,299
And they said, they were halfway through their Kickstarter

165
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,522
and said, we're interested in working with you.

166
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:19,763
Take a look and see what you think.

167
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:22,485
And what got me was learning their story

168
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:25,969
of quitting their jobs to make their dream game

169
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:28,631
and completely just diving off into unsafe waters.

170
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:34,838
It's responded to me because that's commitment to creative ideas, that's owning your choices,

171
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:39,039
and that's having a huge amount of creative courage, and I really, really respond to that.

172
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,641
So here's a little bit of a look at the game, but the first question I always have to ask

173
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:47,382
is what is this about in a fundamental sense?

174
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:50,563
Not what is the story or the narrative or who are the characters, what are their names?

175
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:51,283
I love all of that.

176
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:56,568
But the key thing is to say, what is the actual emotional idea that matters?

177
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:02,714
And in this case, what I really responded to was that it was this wonderful combination of sort of desolate lonesomeness

178
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:06,677
with kind of proud warrior's regal courage.

179
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:13,163
And it was a wonderful blend of that kind of wistful look at the world ending.

180
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:17,695
is normally treated with a frantic hysteria of like,

181
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:18,776
how do we save the world?

182
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,496
And this game said, no, no, no, you can't.

183
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:21,657
And you're not even going to try to.

184
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:23,077
You're just going to try the weather of the storm.

185
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:25,598
And you're sort of powerful Viking inspired characters,

186
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,839
Viking mythology inspired characters,

187
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,820
and you're basically taking it in stride.

188
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,401
And I thought, that's a hell of a thing.

189
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,723
And it reminded me in a way of Battlestar Galactica's

190
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,324
emotional landscape, which I really loved as well.

191
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,805
And so I wanted to play for you

192
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,886
from my giant speaker there.

193
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,600
Um, I always end up screwing this up.

194
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:48,682
Oh, great.

195
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:50,143
Um,

196
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:53,505
I, I, this was the very,

197
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,006
essentially the first thing I wrote,

198
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:56,767
which was a theme

199
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:58,088
trying to capture

200
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,071
everything I'm saying.

201
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:03,032
Um,

202
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:05,974
so you can hear it's very,

203
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:07,275
you know, even though it's a,

204
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:08,856
it's a turn-based strategy game

205
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:10,377
that has very much a kind of adventurous

206
00:12:10,637 --> 00:12:11,918
quality to its narrative.

207
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:16,075
But like I said, the question is always, what is this actually about, though?

208
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:19,677
And it's about something very kind of quiet and lonely, but proud.

209
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:35,886
And that's what I was trying to capture with this. ♪

210
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:37,546
See, it's nothing crazy.

211
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:46,994
So this was one of the very, very first things that I wrote in the immediate aftermath of

212
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,276
their Kickstarter ending.

213
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:54,063
The next thing, of course, before figuring out, you know, this is all just me laying

214
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:57,767
the groundwork before I start making these choices that I'm then going to have to really

215
00:12:58,588 --> 00:12:59,950
firmly commit to.

216
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,314
The next thing, of course, to think about, in a big way, is a game.

217
00:13:04,514 --> 00:13:07,276
What are the game's mechanics? How do you actually play the game?

218
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:11,239
And not in a sense of what does the genre imply.

219
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:16,062
For example, this is a turn-based strategy game, and they're very deliberately kind of

220
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:19,744
paying homage or drawing inspiration to games like Final Fantasy Tactics.

221
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:24,665
But to me, looking at things like that is not really about musical inspiration.

222
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:28,626
It's about knowing what the interaction is like with the game itself.

223
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:32,487
Which is something that for those of us, those of you,

224
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:34,488
I like of us better,

225
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:38,329
who work in film as well, that's a question that never comes up.

226
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,549
Because you have basically one way to interact with a film,

227
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,070
which is to sit and watch it happen.

228
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,090
And, you know, sometimes you're in a theater and you're really engaged with it,

229
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,971
and sometimes you're like doing dishes and kind of occasionally looking over your shoulder,

230
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:50,932
and then like the toilet paper commercial comes on,

231
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:55,553
and you, you know, that's when you like go get your drink or whatever.

232
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:59,494
And it's like, but bottom line is the fundamental relationship is the same.

233
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:03,976
With games, the way in which you interact with it varies tremendously from one game to the next,

234
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,796
and that's obviously what mechanics are all about.

235
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:08,437
Knowing that, because it informs...

236
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:11,579
The emotional experience that you're going to have is really important to me.

237
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:18,164
So this game has a few different kind of modes within it,

238
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:22,147
but the big kind of cornerstone of it is this turn-based strategy,

239
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:24,809
which you can see is very much kind of almost like a chessboard,

240
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,133
you know, superimposed onto these gorgeous paintings, basically.

241
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:36,037
And all using traditional 2D animation and, you know, the art.

242
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:38,319
It's a shame Arnie's not here, because it would be awesome to...

243
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:43,230
I'm not going to make him listen to me gushing about what he did with this game because it's really amazing.

244
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:54,713
The turn-based mechanics have a very specific kind of emotional feel all their own, just as mechanics.

245
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:58,434
For example, it's not a very fast-paced game by design.

246
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:01,875
They were looking for something that felt very kind of mature and methodical, like playing chess.

247
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:03,936
And so to me that said a lot.

248
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:07,497
And if I had just looked at the mechanics in a sense of what the genre means,

249
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:09,818
you know, XCOM is also a turn-based strategy game.

250
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:12,439
But that's the exact opposite way I would describe XCOM.

251
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,900
XCOM is all about trying to make you feel like...

252
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:24,851
My personal opinion on the newest XCOM was that it was almost trying to be turn-based while pretending it wasn't,

253
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:33,395
because it was so energetic, and this was owning its chess-like quality in a way that I really responded to.

254
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:38,857
Where sitting there and contemplating your move for 10 minutes might be what you do.

255
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:43,819
And as it turns out, it's a son of a bitch to figure out how to score this.

256
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,758
Especially when games like XCOM are the big comparisons happening at the moment.

257
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:55,639
Which is like, if you do this, you'll just vaporize because there's so much sound and

258
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:58,700
energy coming out of you, out of the speakers and whatever.

259
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:06,483
So understanding, you know, first, what's the core underlying idea emotionally in terms

260
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:11,744
of what's this game actually trying to achieve in a narrative sense or an emotional sense?

261
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,485
And then how is it going about pursuing those?

262
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:17,846
So I have a video.

263
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:20,623
Hopefully that's muted.

264
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:25,765
Yeah, there's music in the video and I didn't want you to hear that.

265
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:26,305
You're not ready!

266
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:29,326
But I wanted you to just see what I mean.

267
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:33,707
This is just a random capture off of YouTube from someone's playthrough, I believe.

268
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:36,188
Or it might have been one of the tutorials, I can't remember.

269
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,469
But it's, you know, you can get a sense of how it moves.

270
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,070
And there's a lot of implications that come from that.

271
00:16:45,478 --> 00:16:50,922
And there's ways to approach this that might make it feel slower, that might make it feel

272
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:54,844
faster, and neither of which are necessarily better or worse than the other.

273
00:16:54,944 --> 00:16:57,026
It's just sort of a decision you have to make.

274
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:05,503
But I can tell you that I was afraid of the score making it boring,

275
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:11,049
because I think on its own it's not, but it is definitely very introspective and methodical,

276
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:17,656
and if the score kind of gets too excited by that fact, we might make something that's just...

277
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,538
That's, you know, has an audience of a quarter of the size of this room.

278
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:28,860
And I, you know, so that's where, again, me as an investment in the developers of the game,

279
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,542
I care about them as people, which means that I don't just want to write music that I think works,

280
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:35,923
but I want to make sure that I do my part to contribute to their game doing well.

281
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:40,665
I don't want to screw them as like family men and parents and humans.

282
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:45,347
And so doing justice to the game stems from just a belief in investing in them personally.

283
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:46,247
And...

284
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:48,268
And that ends up weighing in.

285
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:51,791
The other challenge, by the way, that you can probably guess just from looking at this,

286
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:55,294
and this is a very simple battle to excerpt from,

287
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:58,476
is that they could be like five minutes long or they could be an hour long.

288
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:02,059
And that can be tricky.

289
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,123
So here's kind of a crash course in the evolution that the music went through.

290
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:13,809
This was the first thing I wrote, which is the worst thing ever.

291
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:16,291
I didn't realize it was the worst thing ever at the time, of course.

292
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:20,140
This might be a touch loud.

293
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:25,303
That's my warning to my friends in the back on the console.

294
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:29,966
This first part is okay, because it's, you know, it's sort of tense,

295
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:31,847
but it's not...

296
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:34,328
These are mock-ups, by the way, so apologies.

297
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:36,869
They're not necessarily great.

298
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,631
But it kicks into a lot of it, because actually,

299
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:42,732
to me what's really obvious about this first version

300
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:44,413
is that I had not yet played the game.

301
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:51,776
Cause I was like, let's just see what happens if I go all out with some like crazy sort of like, you know...

302
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:55,138
I don't even know what inspired this.

303
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:56,919
Yeah, the theme's in there.

304
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,501
But it's not totally horrible, I can see.

305
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:15,616
Funny enough, slow-paced turn-based strategy, this really doesn't work because it reminds

306
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:17,077
you how slow everything's moving.

307
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:21,580
But strangely enough, when you put this on the loading screen when nothing's happening,

308
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:28,226
it works great because everyone's super excited to like, launch into their slow-paced battle.

309
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:33,490
But I'm- but truly, that was a nice- that looked like it was there and that actually

310
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,611
seemed to work.

311
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:35,792
Um...

312
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:36,212
Okay.

313
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:36,432
Okay.

314
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:36,712
Okay.

315
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:37,253
No more.

316
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:38,013
Um...

317
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,611
So I thought, OK, what if I went the hard opposite?

318
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:46,333
And so actually, we tried that initial test of the theme.

319
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,234
But what if we put that in?

320
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:51,315
And so I basically did some elaboration on that

321
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,518
and went as far the opposite way to go as possible.

322
00:19:56,538 --> 00:20:02,241
I'm going to skip ahead here.

323
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:06,423
You can see it's just sort of generally orchestral,

324
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:06,983
which is another.

325
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:13,400
I'll get to it in a little bit, but sort of deciding what your instrumentation and that should be.

326
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,441
But I just started presuming something kind of vaguely orchestral.

327
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:21,403
But I think it's a false assumption that we should just default to that, which we often do.

328
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:24,704
But in this case, I definitely did.

329
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:30,586
And so I was trying something that's very kind of, you know, gentle.

330
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:33,547
And I quickly decided I hate that too.

331
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:41,369
And part of it was that even though I like that it's not really about battle,

332
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:44,730
these characters, as I really dug into the heart of the game,

333
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,971
the idea that came up through conversation with the developers at Stoic Studio was

334
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,893
these are warriors who fight because they have to, not because they want to.

335
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,973
They are extremely badass at it.

336
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:59,514
They are big vikings and giants and mythical creatures,

337
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:02,375
but they don't actually have a bloodlust.

338
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:05,296
And that was very intriguing to me to try to really capture in the music,

339
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:05,876
how they fight.

340
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,747
with a sense of reluctance.

341
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,790
And that first piece kind of embraced that a little too much, or it didn't interpret

342
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,890
it the right way, I should say.

343
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:18,193
So here's something a little further down my...

344
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:22,496
But man, I wrote this score for two years, by the way, so that's why there's like lots

345
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:23,856
and lots of trial and error happening.

346
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,098
Which I'm a big fan of, by the way.

347
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:30,941
You get on as early as you possibly can so that you can actually explore ideas and make

348
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:33,983
something that's not just top shelf, you know.

349
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:43,812
So here was something where I thought, okay, it's a lot sparser, and there's a definite

350
00:21:43,873 --> 00:21:48,054
tension to it that was absent in the previous version, but it's still nowhere near the energy

351
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:48,515
level.

352
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:50,856
And this was fine.

353
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,817
Honestly, this just felt very unspecialty.

354
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,117
It's just percussion.

355
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:54,837
It's noise.

356
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:02,761
But I did kind of like the sense of angst that it was landing on.

357
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:03,381
So to the next.

358
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:11,792
I was exploring the game, the actual sort of moment-by-moment mechanics within a battle,

359
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:16,533
and there's a moment at the end when either you or your opponent has one guy left,

360
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:18,273
and it launches what they call pillage mode,

361
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:21,514
and it's kind of like bells and whistles go off in a Vegas casino that's like,

362
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:22,354
it's almost over!

363
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:28,596
And so I, as an experiment, tried some music that would kick in for that moment only,

364
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:30,136
which was this.

365
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:36,837
And it had kind of a lumbering quality to it, and that instantly seemed to feel pretty close.

366
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:42,838
And there was a big takeaway that I got from this also, where I thought, you know, this

367
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:47,061
gameplay actually can support more energy, more activity.

368
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:51,923
But I realized, and I don't like to be overly sort of musically technical in situations

369
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:55,245
like this, but there's a very low harmonic density.

370
00:22:55,365 --> 00:23:01,249
I said, if I kind of hold in one place harmonically, I can actually build up a lot of activity,

371
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:05,771
and it doesn't feel distracting and annoying and horrible the way that first piece did,

372
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:06,932
which was zooming all over the place.

373
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:10,972
You know, when we're sitting here like low-tinnies, we're almost like a pedal.

374
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:17,813
Um, seemed to suddenly let me widen my sense of energy.

375
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,354
So then I tried to apply that back to...

376
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:25,975
Because remember, this was written specifically for the end of maybe an hour-long match.

377
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:30,956
And so I thought, what if I take that same mentality and apply it to earlier moments?

378
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:34,417
And so this was what I came up with after that, which is...

379
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:38,955
There's movement, but you can hear it's very kind of musically stable.

380
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:43,798
And that seemed to be the sweet spot, which I would never have tried this first.

381
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,941
And this is super quiet for some reason.

382
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:58,087
It's so tiny on my screen, I can't aim accurately enough.

383
00:23:59,368 --> 00:23:59,949
But you get the idea.

384
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:03,311
Very slow progressions.

385
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:12,390
So, that of course is only half the struggle.

386
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,892
How it's actually going to be implemented is a really big part of it.

387
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:19,133
And that, in this case, it was much trickier.

388
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:23,936
Because I didn't just want to like make a five minute piece that loops or something

389
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:29,518
like that because that's, that's, it's too easy and it also misses the point of, it misses

390
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,239
the opportunity to tell a story within...

391
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,521
the game within an individual match, where especially if you're playing online against

392
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:40,322
somebody else, there's a really direct attempt being made to outwit and defeat the other

393
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:45,283
person. And to just have some piece that sort of loops through that is missing the opportunity

394
00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:48,484
to sculpt the emotional experience that you, the player, are going through, which is true

395
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:49,064
of all games.

396
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:49,945
And so...

397
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,086
But the question was how do we implement this?

398
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:54,448
Well, we had one huge thing going for us, which was really awesome.

399
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:56,729
And I have that screenshot up there to show,

400
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,072
because the person has clicked something on the UI

401
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:01,633
that shows you the stats of all the units.

402
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:03,174
And one thing that I really loved about this,

403
00:25:03,775 --> 00:25:05,216
from a turn-based strategy standpoint,

404
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:06,937
is there's no random roles, really.

405
00:25:06,977 --> 00:25:09,179
This is 100% stat-driven.

406
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,159
And it's very simple.

407
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:14,403
You know, the blue number is what we called, like, armor, basically.

408
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,024
And the red number is strength.

409
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:27,014
And so, you know, like the guy in the top there that has eight armor could be dealt four damage by the guy down to the right that has twelve strength.

410
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:29,257
So it's very just simple and arithmetic.

411
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:34,201
Which means there's a lot of data under the hood to potentially create hooks to attach...

412
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:37,865
score variables to, to drive the implementation of the music.

413
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:43,730
So there was a real opportunity to get very, very granular with the music and chase, in

414
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:49,193
a very specific moment-to-moment, incredibly accurate way, what's happening in the game.

415
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:51,435
So we created a...

416
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:56,309
a sort of formula for a thing we call vitality, which is basically just

417
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,092
weighting the individual stats. There's also a third number you can see in the little star

418
00:26:01,652 --> 00:26:04,353
above there, two main ones that we call willpower.

419
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:07,955
And we basically came up with a way to weight the individual value of those three,

420
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:12,637
and then stack the two teams up against each other, and whichever team is losing

421
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:16,039
that vitality number fastest,

422
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:20,341
the system basically says is losing, and we can track that all in real time because

423
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:22,902
It's very easy, it's very simple.

424
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:24,784
And so the initial idea was,

425
00:26:25,164 --> 00:26:27,005
oh this is great, I can really make something

426
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:29,867
really intensely branching and with a lot of layers.

427
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:31,729
And almost instantly

428
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:34,411
discovered that is a god awful idea.

429
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:37,053
Because, if I sit there

430
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:38,394
and I'm playing like this,

431
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:41,796
and the music is, you know, like these bassoons going

432
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,397
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

433
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,916
And after 10 minutes of careful consideration,

434
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:49,117
I make one mouse click, and then the music is like, no!

435
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:51,358
Because the stats changed.

436
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:53,258
Suddenly, I'm like, Jesus, what did I do?

437
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:58,939
And so on mechanics of this nature,

438
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:02,960
something that synchronous was actually hugely distracting.

439
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,461
Which is interesting, because I'm always

440
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:07,641
exploring ways to how to make the music more adaptive,

441
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:08,361
more adaptive.

442
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,942
And here, that actually was a big problem.

443
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:12,362
So this is essentially.

444
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:16,245
what we ended up with, where it's, this is just, you know,

445
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:20,208
sort of a DP screen grab, but this is conceptually the way it works, is that

446
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:24,171
we have sort of sections based that

447
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:28,655
the system is essentially listening for a percent drop

448
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:31,617
in that vitality amount, and as soon as you hit it,

449
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:37,482
it allows, whenever the loop reaches its end, to then proceed to the next one.

450
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,624
So I basically write like a 10 minute or 12 minute piece,

451
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:41,625
more or less.

452
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:45,329
and then accordion it into individual sections,

453
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:48,772
and the way it's implemented means that

454
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,135
if I, you know, attack my opponent,

455
00:27:51,715 --> 00:27:54,438
and therefore have done the damage necessary

456
00:27:54,478 --> 00:27:58,783
to kind of take it to the next segment in this scheme,

457
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:03,849
It will only actually advance once the music reaches that on its own organically anyway,

458
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:07,130
which will be at some point after that has happened.

459
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:11,312
It's as soon as one second if they happen to have done it at the end of the loop,

460
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:13,612
or it could be the full duration if they happen to have done it at the beginning.

461
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:16,013
But either way, they won't actually really notice,

462
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:20,715
because it proceeds into the next phrase and idea of music,

463
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:22,335
which is already a natural consequent.

464
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:24,636
of what you were hearing as it was.

465
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,677
And so that the emotional arc of all of these in total

466
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:30,398
is actually very gradual.

467
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:34,379
So you don't really feel these stark changes,

468
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:35,699
but it's able to track.

469
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:36,900
And then you can see it splits,

470
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,980
so that you have kind of the winning,

471
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,641
if your team is losing that vitality amount.

472
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:45,063
less quickly than the other, then you are winning.

473
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:47,764
And so it takes you on, like, the upper path,

474
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:51,006
and it takes you onto the lower path if you're losing.

475
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:53,827
And then occasionally, if it's really a long game,

476
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:56,048
you know, we put caps on the number of loops

477
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:57,729
so that the music just has, like you can see,

478
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:58,910
there's a little insert ending

479
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,771
that I have a couple examples of in there,

480
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:04,393
where it might just end and then wait to come back.

481
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:06,994
So that there's just kind of a nice rhythm

482
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:10,576
and it just feels very organic to the gameplay.

483
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,346
So all of this doesn't address what's the palette?

484
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:16,828
What should it actually sound like?

485
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:20,832
What choices do I make in terms of instrumentation

486
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:21,533
and orchestration?

487
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:22,434
And like I said at the beginning,

488
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:25,217
I kind of hinted at this qualm because I

489
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:29,361
think assuming it should be orchestral is actually bad.

490
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:31,643
If we do that, everything will sound the same.

491
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:35,566
So I had kind of started that way.

492
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:37,646
I was playing around with some electronics.

493
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,947
I was really excited about this particular kind of distortion,

494
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:42,767
and every time I put it in, all the guys on the other end would say,

495
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:44,908
I think our speaker is broken.

496
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:47,348
And then they realized, no, that's just a sound he's using.

497
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,089
And I got a very polite, yeah, don't ever use that again.

498
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:52,769
But otherwise, it was fairly orchestral.

499
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:57,330
I did notice that I was not really using the strings much, though.

500
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:00,762
And that was interesting to me.

501
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:02,965
Especially, I think that might have been just reactionary

502
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:05,568
to having just come off Journey, which is like string bonanza.

503
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:08,191
And so I thought, you know, I just

504
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,574
happened to notice that it was very centered around the brass.

505
00:30:11,214 --> 00:30:12,175
So then the thought occurred to me,

506
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:15,019
what if I just committed to that?

507
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:16,380
I've never done that before.

508
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:18,483
And I remembered an experience that I had.

509
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:23,332
At Carnegie Hall about 10 years ago, on the left is Jerry Junkin, who's basically the

510
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:26,694
most famous wind ensemble conductor in the world, and he's the best.

511
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:30,337
And he commissioned a piece that when I heard the premiere of it at Carnegie Hall, it completely

512
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:34,460
changed my life, which is John Corleano's third symphony called Circus Maximus, which

513
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,541
sounds like this.

514
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,063
And this is a loud motherfucker for you on the console.

515
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:45,709
And the final note of this piece, as demonstrated by this photo of a performance of it, is

516
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:47,570
a percussionist firing a shotgun.

517
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,985
It's a fully surround, like what you're hearing right now is 16 trumpets in a circle around the audience.

518
00:30:57,805 --> 00:30:59,447
And then percussion back behind you.

519
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:06,252
And it's, it's, it was the largest wind ensemble commission in history at the time.

520
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:06,893
It may still be.

521
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:12,998
And they're like up on these balconies just doing this Haley Torch sort of fanfare.

522
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:15,480
None of the band on stage is playing yet.

523
00:31:24,322 --> 00:31:28,985
Whoever I was walking into Carnegie Hall before hearing this piece was not who left that day.

524
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:32,248
I've never been hit. It was like a sledgehammer to the face, this piece.

525
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:38,272
It's 40 minutes long. Here's the full band.

526
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:42,555
Yeah, I decided not to spend the rest of my talk just letting it play out.

527
00:31:43,796 --> 00:31:45,057
But it's worth seeking out.

528
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:48,400
And so I thought, what if I did...

529
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:51,439
A wind ensemble score.

530
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,360
And then my brain went to the next sort of ludicrous conclusion of

531
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,962
what if I called this guy and got his wind ensemble to play it?

532
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:03,044
And amazingly, when I just cold called him out of the blue,

533
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:05,965
he said, that sounds super cool, let's totally do this.

534
00:32:06,405 --> 00:32:09,106
It helped, by the way, that this game was being developed in Austin, Texas,

535
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,267
and he happened to live there.

536
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:13,708
And so there was a sort of hometown pride thing, I think, that played into that as well.

537
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:20,773
So even after arriving and saying, OK, I'm just going to commit to wind ensemble,

538
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,114
I've never done that before, especially coming off

539
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:26,175
of such a strong string music-based background.

540
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:28,355
That was a little bit daunting.

541
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:31,576
But there was also something missing inherently from that.

542
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,077
Because as you can see here, at the core of this game,

543
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:35,417
as well as everything else I've said.

544
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:38,919
It's a father-daughter story. And I needed something very intimate,

545
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:45,381
something with a lot of heart, a lot of soul, to capture this notion of a father-daughter story.

546
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:47,482
I mean, you can really see it beautifully in just this one image,

547
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:51,264
that there's a big story happening, but there's kind of an intimate gateway to it.

548
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:54,265
And that was important to figure out, how do I tap into that?

549
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:58,947
I have no idea why this shows up that way, but isn't that super awesome?

550
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:01,168
That's super strange.

551
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:04,629
Around the time that I was grappling with this, this showed up on YouTube.

552
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,030
Hey!

553
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,032
This showed up on YouTube.

554
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:31,253
I'm going to play my music.

555
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:35,574
This was like the most humbling and awe-inspiring thing I'd ever seen in my life.

556
00:33:35,594 --> 00:33:36,535
She could exhale herself.

557
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:37,455
She was totally speechless.

558
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:38,495
If you're not familiar, this is Taylor Davis.

559
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:39,436
She's incredible.

560
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:41,196
I think I spent the rest of my talk talking about her.

561
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,937
But I saw this and I thought, I just want to work with someone that does cool shit.

562
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:44,938
And this was mind-blowing to me.

563
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:45,918
I couldn't believe it.

564
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,478
So I thought, okay, I'll have one string instrument.

565
00:33:47,578 --> 00:33:48,539
And I'm going to play this.

566
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,259
And I'm going to play this.

567
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:50,199
And I'm going to play this.

568
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:51,060
And I'm going to play this.

569
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,100
And I'm going to play this.

570
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,100
And I'm going to play this.

571
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,961
And I'm going to play this.

572
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:54,821
And I'm going to play this.

573
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:55,761
And I'm going to play this.

574
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:56,822
And I'm going to play this.

575
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:57,422
So I thought okay.

576
00:33:57,542 --> 00:33:58,482
I'm going to play this.

577
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:04,656
That will be my, that's the soul, that's the thing that I pit this like 60-piece wind ensemble

578
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:11,464
of 10 French horns and 5 trombones and just 7 percussion, big group, I'll pit that against

579
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:13,306
the one violin.

580
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:19,499
Of course, we do not record them simultaneously, so we do not have the acoustical issue faced

581
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:19,939
with that.

582
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,302
She actually lives in Detroit and recorded all of it from there.

583
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:27,526
But it gave me something to help really separate all of this apart.

584
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:30,149
And so you can hear a couple of different ways that that manifests in the score.

585
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:47,965
So you hear it's a window ensemble.

586
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:55,369
I also wanted her to play with how the violins sound.

587
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:59,070
I said, I said you probably have a nice one that you've invested all this money in,

588
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:02,212
but you probably also had one you played as a kid that's like a crappy practice one.

589
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:06,574
I want that one. I want one that sounds rustic and worn in.

590
00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:11,296
And I also want you to give the tuning pegs just a little bit of a tweak before you play it.

591
00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:17,276
And so I ended up with something very kind of rustic and naturalistic sounding.

592
00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:26,080
It almost sounds like an accordion as a result.

593
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:31,083
But I also thought, you know, this is going to be very important for keeping, especially in the narrative,

594
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:35,365
the combat can be grounded in that father-daughter story as well.

595
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:36,766
So here's an example of how that plays out.

596
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:59,021
So it has a peculiar effect of making a big group sort of intimate.

597
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:07,368
And to me, it seemed like, it felt like sort of, uh, combat with purpose in a way.

598
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,749
In a strange way. I hope it is. That's how it felt to me.

599
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:25,815
And obviously I'm really committing to this notion of her as an overdub, because you're hearing her very up front in the mix, in a very present and strapped, obviously strapped sort of way, which is by design.

600
00:36:25,855 --> 00:36:34,745
She does not sound like she's on the stage with the rest of the group, whereas there's a very live sound intentionally, and that's by design, so that you really feel this like one against the rest.

601
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:45,018
That gives you a taste of that.

602
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:48,459
So on this last slide, you'll notice

603
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:50,900
there's a whole shitload of crazy looking dudes.

604
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:54,742
That's one of these guys, which was

605
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:56,363
the last sort of major consideration

606
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,484
to take into account here.

607
00:36:57,544 --> 00:37:00,765
Like, what can I do to kind of force myself down

608
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:02,026
some kind of interesting path?

609
00:37:02,566 --> 00:37:04,507
Again, everything here is all these choices

610
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:07,588
that I'm feeling compelled to commit to hard and fast

611
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:10,050
are organically stemming from the game.

612
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,450
I'm not just arbitrarily making them.

613
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:22,550
And so, the sort of the enemy, the sort of lurking specter that's hounding you in this game within the narrative is these big, sort of biomechanical guys they call the Dredge.

614
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:32,033
And I thought, you know, they bring a very otherworldly, an alien, not in the Geiger sense, although kind of, vibe to the game.

615
00:37:32,173 --> 00:37:34,313
And I wanted to have that represented some way in the score.

616
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:38,134
Now, I say that hesitantly because I don't actually really like or advocate for...

617
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:44,384
These very sort of direct, on-the-nose corollaries, musically, where it's, you know, like an obvious

618
00:37:44,444 --> 00:37:47,824
one would be, I'm scoring a film that takes place in China, the music should sound Chinese.

619
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:49,145
I'm like, but why?

620
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:51,825
We already figured out the whole China part on account of the movie taking place there.

621
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:54,466
So what does that actually do?

622
00:37:54,586 --> 00:38:00,388
Like, if there's something inherently, emotionally about Chinese music that is going to bring

623
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:01,808
that thing that you need, that's great.

624
00:38:01,828 --> 00:38:05,069
But then that also means you could be doing a romantic comedy, and that's the perfect

625
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:05,689
thing for there.

626
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,051
And that's the way I tend to think, is to say,

627
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:10,651
okay, there is another worldly vibe.

628
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:15,214
Can I help bring it in the music in a way that actually

629
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:17,695
feels complementary and isn't just layering redundancy?

630
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:20,196
And so I started to think about that.

631
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:24,038
And that led me to a couple of friends of mine.

632
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:27,900
Randon Graves, a composer, and Viking Jesus.

633
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:40,403
And Randon, in addition to being a great composer, he's a really talented and acclaimed didgeridooist.

634
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:42,385
Didgeridist.

635
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:48,391
And Viking Jesus is, he does like video game, metal video game covers.

636
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:51,073
And I met him on a video game's live performance.

637
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:52,955
And so I thought...

638
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:57,144
Uh, didgeridoo seems somehow perfect.

639
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:01,407
And this is where my intellectual justifications for things just completely vanishes,

640
00:39:01,427 --> 00:39:04,029
and I'm like, I don't know, it just, I just think it needs it.

641
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,533
And also, not so much metal guitar, but prepared electric guitar.

642
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:12,056
And I thought he would particularly enjoy that, because one of the ideas I had was,

643
00:39:12,457 --> 00:39:14,058
I said, do you own a guitar that you never use?

644
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:15,599
And he said, well, no, not really.

645
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,760
I said, do you have a friend who would?

646
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,822
And he said, uh, I can get a hold of one, but why?

647
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:21,864
And he said, I'd really love to sample the sound of it being sawed in half.

648
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:28,166
Um, like an electric guitar that's mic'd and ready to go, and you're recording the amps

649
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:30,908
take away from that experience.

650
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:35,231
Um, it's like putting your ear to the window as you listen to someone be murdered.

651
00:39:35,671 --> 00:39:37,953
It's like, I don't want the sound of what's going on in the room, I want to hear what

652
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:39,053
it sounds like on the outside of the room.

653
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:40,995
And he was like, sure!

654
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:46,478
And so that's, here's what kind of all that added together sort of sounds like.

655
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:52,380
Also what was cool was the Dallas Wind Symphony, which is Jerry's ensemble,

656
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:58,587
and we recorded in their concert hall in Dallas, which was awesome and terrifying.

657
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:00,308
It's not wired for headphones or anything.

658
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:02,871
We had to do all of it without click tracks. It was insane.

659
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:19,638
So we're going to be able to quit on some of them.

660
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:22,781
And now you can hear the actual produced live version

661
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:23,923
of my chattering bassoons.

662
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:25,444
So in the interest of time, there's

663
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,006
still something else missing.

664
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,584
And a big component of the Kickstarter campaign had been these things they call the Godstones.

665
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:45,549
And which is a brilliant move on Stoic's part, where basically as a way to offer a very cool

666
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:50,834
tier to really high paying backers, they said throughout the game your caravan is going

667
00:40:50,854 --> 00:40:53,477
to go wandering by these giant sort of...

668
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:57,913
almost like gravestones to the now dead gods.

669
00:40:57,973 --> 00:41:02,516
That's part of the kind of mythology of the game, is that this sort of polytheistic world,

670
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:08,420
sort of like ancient Greece or obviously like sort of the Viking lore, the gods had all

671
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,003
killed themselves in this giant sort of war and everyone left on earth survived and basically

672
00:41:14,063 --> 00:41:14,383
were left

673
00:41:14,693 --> 00:41:17,474
And so they're alone and realize, oh, life I guess just goes on.

674
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:22,315
So that kind of forms the emotional framework of like, we're all that there is.

675
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,856
There's no one coming for us, there is no one going to help us,

676
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:27,096
because they're facing this new sort of doomsday scenario,

677
00:41:27,877 --> 00:41:29,797
and there is no sort of higher power to whom to turn,

678
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:31,317
which is very important for the emotion of the game.

679
00:41:31,337 --> 00:41:34,238
And so they said, we want to have reminders, though, that that is the case,

680
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:36,779
by putting these tributes.

681
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:39,800
And so they said, if you give us whatever it was, like a thousand bucks,

682
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,420
we'll make you a hero, and we'll make you...

683
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,941
A Godstone.

684
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,564
And you can name it, and you can come up with its backstory, and we'll fit it.

685
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:48,225
We'll make it work.

686
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:52,248
And it was brilliant, and who would have guessed that there were all these, like, bearded people

687
00:41:52,288 --> 00:41:53,229
who have a lot of money?

688
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:59,114
And because they all, like, all these Vikings came out of nowhere, basically.

689
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:05,852
And so the game has almost no spoken dialogue in it.

690
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:07,433
It has very interstitial VO.

691
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:09,214
And I always felt like there needs

692
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:10,876
to be something special and unique that

693
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:13,477
happens that's proximate to these.

694
00:42:13,638 --> 00:42:15,019
And so I pitched this idea.

695
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:17,480
I said, what if your caravan kind of bursts into song,

696
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:19,722
and there's almost musical tributes,

697
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:23,765
almost like source music threaded into the game's score?

698
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:25,687
What if we tried something like that?

699
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:29,850
So that led me to start thinking about, well, I need singers.

700
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,861
Shortly before the game's kickstarter, this video...

701
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:38,242
Please tell me all of you have seen this.

702
00:42:38,902 --> 00:42:39,602
Everyone has seen this?

703
00:42:39,842 --> 00:42:41,262
Raise your hand regardless of anything.

704
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:44,303
What the hell's wrong with you? No one does anything.

705
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:47,164
All of you... Well, you're watching it now, so you've all seen this.

706
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:50,645
This is Maluka. Are you here somewhere?

707
00:42:50,665 --> 00:42:52,165
Yes! Okay, she is among us.

708
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:10,529
So this is obviously Skyrim done in a way that's just staggeringly beautiful.

709
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:15,590
And this showed up on YouTube a few months before the Kickstarter,

710
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,170
and people were talking about it in all the comments, and I went and watched it,

711
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:24,431
and I was like, oh my god, I have no idea how I'm going to incorporate vocals,

712
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:25,752
but I clearly have to.

713
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:30,633
And part of the motivation behind reaching out to someone who had put something on YouTube

714
00:43:30,713 --> 00:43:31,273
was that...

715
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:36,017
The whole game was born through the online world.

716
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:38,459
And I like the idea of committing to that as well.

717
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,144
The idea that people who have earned their livelihood and built their reputations as

718
00:43:44,184 --> 00:43:47,587
musicians on the internet would participate in a game that was also launched from the

719
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:47,947
internet.

720
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:50,910
And that to me just felt like a sort of spiritual alignment that I really liked.

721
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:55,154
And so as soon as this notion of what if I wrote sort of folk songs for these...

722
00:43:56,475 --> 00:43:57,915
for these Godstones.

723
00:43:58,796 --> 00:44:02,137
And I got these amazing singers

724
00:44:02,597 --> 00:44:04,918
who I had not... I didn't know them,

725
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:07,299
I just knew their YouTube videos.

726
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,620
So Maluka was the first,

727
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:14,883
and then shortly thereafter I met this fine fellow.

728
00:44:25,102 --> 00:44:30,807
This is from The Hobbit, The Misty Mountains, and this is Peter Hollins is his name.

729
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:36,872
And he likewise, he puts, like Taylor and these others, he puts content on YouTube as

730
00:44:36,912 --> 00:44:37,513
his livelihood.

731
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:40,976
And he's a phenomenal singer, incredible vocal producer.

732
00:44:41,256 --> 00:44:45,220
And so I basically reached out to him and said, I need, I need like manly vocals.

733
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:49,363
And also, there was another singer who I don't have video of, unfortunately,

734
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:51,966
named Johann Sigmundsson, who did the VO for the game.

735
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:53,607
And he just sounds like a Viking.

736
00:44:53,688 --> 00:44:54,528
And so I called him and I said,

737
00:44:54,548 --> 00:44:56,290
please tell me he's not actually a singer.

738
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,412
Because I want, like, a Viking singer.

739
00:44:58,472 --> 00:45:01,515
I don't want this guy that's gonna try to sing-sing.

740
00:45:01,595 --> 00:45:03,577
I got that covered in a way that's very authentic.

741
00:45:03,637 --> 00:45:05,879
As you can see, there's five of Peter.

742
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,662
Uh, some spoil- uh, spoil of riches.

743
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:09,142
Um...

744
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:17,230
So I had basically a trio of singers and we add it all up.

745
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,531
Here's kind of the aesthetic.

746
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:21,874
This is Johann.

747
00:45:34,662 --> 00:45:42,986
And then how Peter and Johan together...

748
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,787
Singing in Icelandic, by the way. My apologies once again to Miljko.

749
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:51,149
Johan speaks Icelandic, Peter and Miljko not so much.

750
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:53,590
And it is a bizarre... Does anyone here speak Icelandic?

751
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,471
That's what I thought.

752
00:45:56,991 --> 00:46:01,033
It is mind-blowingly complicated from a syllabic perspective.

753
00:46:02,314 --> 00:46:04,876
You didn't realize that your tone could make these moves.

754
00:46:07,758 --> 00:46:10,080
So then here's all three of them plus Violet as well.

755
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,082
So it's sort of like folk music.

756
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:25,572
It's an invented folk music, but it's very much informed by that general aesthetic.

757
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:42,781
And of course, this particular musical excerpt is sort of, I'm not going to say what it is,

758
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:46,904
avoid spoilers, but it's of central importance in the game, so of course I also add in the

759
00:46:46,924 --> 00:46:48,505
full wind ensemble as well.

760
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:42,255
So by the time I got to the end of this, and I started playing it for people, they were

761
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:44,998
like, wow, this music is really weird.

762
00:47:46,286 --> 00:47:48,547
And this doesn't really sound like what we were expecting.

763
00:47:48,987 --> 00:47:51,808
And I didn't even really notice.

764
00:47:51,848 --> 00:47:56,271
It had been almost two years of work of just sort of finding things and seeing what felt

765
00:47:56,311 --> 00:47:56,471
right.

766
00:47:56,491 --> 00:48:01,533
And by the time I end, I just realized I had been sort of committing to all these choices

767
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:02,154
along the way.

768
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:07,136
And in the aggregate, a million of these kind of odd choices, but what firmly believed in,

769
00:48:07,496 --> 00:48:08,477
culminated in something...

770
00:48:09,337 --> 00:48:11,799
That seems to be a bit different.

771
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,841
And again, I make no claims of if it's good music

772
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,322
or anything like that.

773
00:48:16,382 --> 00:48:17,543
That's not up to me to decide.

774
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:19,204
That's up to you guys and to whomever else.

775
00:48:19,544 --> 00:48:23,147
But I did feel confident that I did not waffle

776
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:25,248
on these decisions as we went.

777
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:31,333
Which is just, again, the reminder of how we actually go about doing this.

778
00:48:31,513 --> 00:48:36,455
This is, in my GameSoundCon talk, I mentioned a guy who the economists referred to as

779
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:38,915
the Feasting Vicar in a wonderful obituary I read.

780
00:48:38,975 --> 00:48:44,517
His name is Robert Capon, and he was a sort of minister slash food critic?

781
00:48:45,537 --> 00:48:47,518
And he wrote very eloquently about...

782
00:48:48,536 --> 00:48:50,937
food as sort of like a way of life.

783
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:55,319
And it was very tied into his Christian beliefs.

784
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:56,239
And he was an incredible...

785
00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:58,380
I never heard of this guy, and then I just read his obituary

786
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,061
and I found him to be a wealth of inspiration

787
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:02,202
for how to be a composer with integrity

788
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:03,543
because he basically said,

789
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:05,683
perfection should never be your goal

790
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:06,944
because it's not even possible.

791
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:08,185
There's no point in trying.

792
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:12,006
So the whole idea is to basically just commit to the choices that you make.

793
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:15,469
Believe in them fully and know that some are going to fail.

794
00:49:15,729 --> 00:49:17,891
Some are going to fail spectacularly.

795
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:20,233
But if you're going to fail, fail like the Hindenburg.

796
00:49:20,253 --> 00:49:22,094
Don't fail in some way that doesn't even matter.

797
00:49:22,675 --> 00:49:24,676
And this was what he fully believed.

798
00:49:24,716 --> 00:49:28,239
So much so that he would intentionally eat and make things that he knew were terrible.

799
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,762
Because he wanted to experience something that tastes truly shitty.

800
00:49:32,142 --> 00:49:34,304
And then when he makes something that's really special,

801
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,626
suddenly he really appreciates that all the more.

802
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:40,930
And I thought that was really actually quite beautiful.

803
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:48,239
And so it can be summarized, there's a Samuel Beckett quote from Worst Word Ho, where he says,

804
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:52,542
ever tried, ever failed, no matter, fail again and fail better.

805
00:49:56,985 --> 00:49:59,446
Because you have to remember, we are our choices.

806
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:05,690
That is what makes us one composer versus another composer.

807
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:11,914
If you see this as sort of your first instinct, is that very first...

808
00:50:13,129 --> 00:50:18,792
box or whatever, I guess it's a diamond with the way I've oriented this, on the left.

809
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:24,875
Every single person in this room and every other composer ever in history can think of

810
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:25,175
that.

811
00:50:25,895 --> 00:50:31,058
Which means that if we all start there and we stop there, the art dies immediately.

812
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:33,199
And it's all of our collective faults.

813
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,701
Not to mention the fact that it's extremely hard to have a career where everyone is the

814
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:37,941
same.

815
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:41,623
You know, at that point, one entrepreneurial person says, oh, well, what if I just...

816
00:50:41,828 --> 00:50:46,073
I'm going to make a music library and then everyone can just buy that because it doesn't matter who you hire anymore.

817
00:50:46,534 --> 00:50:51,860
And that person, who we'll refer to as HZ, can profit enormously.

818
00:50:53,261 --> 00:50:54,683
And I say it with love.

819
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,521
Now actually, but there is truth to that.

820
00:50:58,561 --> 00:51:04,104
If you create something that becomes so de facto norm, and then everyone does the same,

821
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:07,105
then whoever basically figures out the best way to package it is going to do the best.

822
00:51:07,185 --> 00:51:08,826
It's not about the music anymore.

823
00:51:09,206 --> 00:51:13,628
Which means the only way to penetrate to the right side is to just make a series of choices

824
00:51:13,968 --> 00:51:15,069
from which there's no coming back.

825
00:51:15,938 --> 00:51:17,559
And some of them are going to work better than others.

826
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:21,221
But you end up somewhere that's a spot that only you occupy.

827
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:22,822
There's a Steve Martin quote where he says,

828
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:26,705
be so good that no one can ignore you.

829
00:51:27,145 --> 00:51:30,928
And I actually don't think that that really applies in our world,

830
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:32,669
where technique is so learnable and where...

831
00:51:33,069 --> 00:51:36,111
sample libraries and the ability to hire orchestrators and all that means that

832
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:40,173
that from a skill level everybody's capable of being the same. We've kind of

833
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:41,333
Harrison Bergeron'd

834
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:45,635
music. I actually think that's wonderful in this particular instance so that what

835
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:46,235
separates us

836
00:51:46,596 --> 00:51:49,777
is you. So I would say be so you that there's just no one else.

837
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:53,279
That you're the person that does that thing. You're the only person that would

838
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,600
make those choices. And it's not about them being better

839
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,681
or being worse. It's about the fact that you're the only one that would do them. And

840
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:00,782
there's gonna be people that respond to that. Never mind

841
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:04,344
liking working with you and all of the wonderful lovey-dovey details.

842
00:52:05,544 --> 00:52:08,125
So in other words, our choices is what we sell.

843
00:52:08,205 --> 00:52:09,325
That's what we charge for.

844
00:52:09,385 --> 00:52:13,126
It's not actually music in some other sense.

845
00:52:13,526 --> 00:52:18,447
Thus, it's always very important to just own those, know that those are all that matter.

846
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:21,968
And in what few minutes I have left, I would be happy to take questions.

847
00:52:23,669 --> 00:52:27,010
And I will, I think you should probably run up to the mic for the sake of the recording,

848
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,510
but I will also restate them.

849
00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:32,060
And I've failed if no one has a question.

850
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:32,421
All right.

851
00:52:32,621 --> 00:52:33,021
Beautiful.

852
00:52:35,223 --> 00:52:35,463
Awesome.

853
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:39,926
You got a lot of brave decisions as far as, um, you know, having the violinist

854
00:52:39,966 --> 00:52:45,070
bring in her oldest violin against the whole stage, um, the didgeridoo, a lot

855
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,612
of cool ideas, and I love how they came together.

856
00:52:47,812 --> 00:52:50,094
Are you doing the mixing?

857
00:52:50,154 --> 00:52:53,696
Are you making those decisions or do you have someone that you work with on a

858
00:52:53,756 --> 00:52:57,699
very intimate relationship to make sure that those ideas come through the way

859
00:52:57,719 --> 00:52:58,160
you intended?

860
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:01,800
Everyone hear that? I assume. Yeah?

861
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,843
So, I, on this particular score, because we recorded the wind ensemble in kind of an unusual way,

862
00:53:08,863 --> 00:53:15,485
I essentially mixed it myself. Normally, I don't like to. I don't consider myself a mixer.

863
00:53:15,685 --> 00:53:18,987
You know, I'm kind of an idealist who thinks of my job as putting dots on paper.

864
00:53:19,787 --> 00:53:22,708
But, you know, in this world, in this economy, sometimes you have to...

865
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,741
To be able to hire so-and-so, you can't hire X.

866
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,782
But in this case, we actually had the budget, and I did hire my mixer,

867
00:53:30,022 --> 00:53:31,763
but what he did was actually more like mastering.

868
00:53:32,783 --> 00:53:34,884
And the biggest reason why was actually not so much

869
00:53:35,264 --> 00:53:39,625
the weird combinations of solo, tracked, shitty violin, played beautifully,

870
00:53:40,085 --> 00:53:41,386
and didgeridoo, and things like that,

871
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:46,527
but because we hired this mad scientist of a recording engineer named Keith Johnson,

872
00:53:46,547 --> 00:53:50,909
who's a Grammy-winning engineer who's worked like a hundred times with that wind ensemble,

873
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:51,969
and he's like...

874
00:53:53,048 --> 00:54:00,936
This maniac, who, he, he, we, when we record into Pro Tools, we're not getting, uh, stems

875
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:04,880
of, of, you know, of, we're not getting basically the feed off of every mic. We're getting these

876
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,105
submixes that he makes that we can't open up. He has this weird custom box that looks

877
00:54:10,145 --> 00:54:12,287
like something from the Apollo program that he made.

878
00:54:13,227 --> 00:54:17,968
Um, and he's sitting there, we were recording, you know, he sets all the levels, he won't

879
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:22,229
let anyone touch his gear, so setup takes like two days because he's like 85 years old

880
00:54:22,269 --> 00:54:28,191
and putting up all the mic trees himself and won't let anyone touch his stuff, and so he,

881
00:54:28,511 --> 00:54:33,672
he sets it all up, he, and he has this, literally, like there's no faders, there's no, it's,

882
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:37,153
it's literally like knobs, and it's, it's the size, you could fit it on this podium,

883
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:41,554
and I'm looking at it and I'm like, you've got like 50 mics going into this thing.

884
00:54:42,785 --> 00:54:45,188
And he's got pre's and he records everything at like 192k.

885
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:49,153
He does these really high resolution digital recordings.

886
00:54:49,234 --> 00:54:53,439
And like I said, he's a Grammy winner for surround sound mixes.

887
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:57,164
And so, but it's funny because they said, you know, normally rule of thumb is

888
00:54:57,424 --> 00:55:00,288
you set your levels, you fool around with things, and then you set it.

889
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,810
And you only change things as problems arise,

890
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,772
or as you try to achieve a certain kind of effect.

891
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,233
And I'm watching him, and every single take,

892
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:10,476
he's doing this, moving all of his things around.

893
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:12,197
And they're like, they warned me ahead of time.

894
00:55:12,217 --> 00:55:13,798
They said, you're going to have a heart attack when you see him

895
00:55:13,818 --> 00:55:14,839
working, because you're thinking,

896
00:55:15,299 --> 00:55:16,500
because we don't have stems.

897
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,782
We don't have the individual mics in Pro Tools.

898
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:20,583
So they said, you're going to freak out.

899
00:55:20,643 --> 00:55:23,845
But what it is, he has a photographic memory

900
00:55:23,965 --> 00:55:25,727
and has memorized the conductor's score,

901
00:55:25,807 --> 00:55:27,688
and he's changing balances, like one bar

902
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:28,669
before they're about to happen.

903
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:30,829
And I was like, that's bullshit.

904
00:55:32,852 --> 00:55:36,918
And then we record it and sure enough, like I'm sitting, you know, like Jerry's conducting

905
00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:40,284
and I'm sitting there in the booth and I look and I see there's like a giant thing about

906
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:43,709
to come and I watch him like reach over and make an adjustment and then bam in the orchestra

907
00:55:43,729 --> 00:55:44,971
and I was like, my God.

908
00:55:46,826 --> 00:55:52,609
So for that reason, because there was still six months of work on my end after the recordings

909
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,970
of the big orchestra, and I was still writing a lot of those folk songs and things like

910
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,831
that, there was still a lot of implementation that had to be done, so I needed to be able

911
00:55:58,871 --> 00:56:00,192
to work on those mixes immediately.

912
00:56:00,552 --> 00:56:05,814
And so I basically, we ended up, we had four stereo mixes that were basically like four

913
00:56:05,955 --> 00:56:08,416
subjective perspectives of the orchestra.

914
00:56:09,296 --> 00:56:10,698
that he created as submixes.

915
00:56:10,898 --> 00:56:12,300
So it's not really a traditional mix.

916
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,382
I basically had to do it myself, which was fun.

917
00:56:15,443 --> 00:56:16,164
But, you know, you're...

918
00:56:16,465 --> 00:56:17,486
Talk about owning your choices.

919
00:56:18,147 --> 00:56:19,328
There's no backing out of that.

920
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:20,630
Yeah?

921
00:56:22,452 --> 00:56:23,413
Great presentation, by the way.

922
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:24,094
Thank you.

923
00:56:24,574 --> 00:56:25,235
I hope it's helpful.

924
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:26,857
I hope so, too. I think so.

925
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:29,180
I'm glad you hope so.

926
00:56:30,274 --> 00:56:32,757
That is in no way comforting to me, but thank you.

927
00:56:32,777 --> 00:56:34,119
A lot of notes.

928
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,022
So when scoring games as opposed to films,

929
00:56:37,463 --> 00:56:40,827
do you still try to approach creating an overarching structure,

930
00:56:40,907 --> 00:56:41,889
or do you think it's different?

931
00:56:41,909 --> 00:56:42,169
Pat it out.

932
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:45,415
No, absolutely. In fact, I think it's even more important in games

933
00:56:45,675 --> 00:56:49,638
because the natural structure of games tends to splinter apart the music so much

934
00:56:49,918 --> 00:56:54,141
that it's very easy for each cue to kind of be its almost individual little musical universe.

935
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:58,764
And I feel that that's not... I mean, you know, if you're familiar with Journey,

936
00:56:58,784 --> 00:57:03,567
Journey is like kind of manic, depressive, obsessive about this idea of a single structure.

937
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:09,431
But truthfully, everything I do is, you know, I tend to have, you know, one theme...

938
00:57:09,912 --> 00:57:13,315
that is written to carefully be able to map the trajectory of the whole game.

939
00:57:13,335 --> 00:57:17,018
Which means that I can't really start writing until I know what all the main story beats are going to be,

940
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,721
what all the main... bear in mind I'm talking about narrative games,

941
00:57:19,741 --> 00:57:23,404
although non-narrative games this would potentially apply to as well,

942
00:57:23,444 --> 00:57:25,706
if there's any kind of sense of, like, difficulty.

943
00:57:25,786 --> 00:57:27,327
Like, even like Tetris, for example.

944
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,010
But, anyway, yes.

945
00:57:31,551 --> 00:57:33,652
Overall sense of structure, hugely important.

946
00:57:33,692 --> 00:57:37,656
And hopefully, you know, if you play the game, you can feel that.

947
00:57:37,696 --> 00:57:38,456
You can sense that.

948
00:57:39,798 --> 00:57:42,159
Just an intuitive sense that the tension is rising,

949
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,642
that the overall sense of stakes and scope

950
00:57:47,022 --> 00:57:49,664
are increasing in tandem with the game itself.

951
00:57:50,244 --> 00:57:52,105
And the way you do that is by controlling your parameters,

952
00:57:52,646 --> 00:57:58,569
is by saying, what am I choosing not to use now

953
00:57:58,629 --> 00:58:01,611
that I'll then use later as a way to add more oomph?

954
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:03,152
And so definitely.

955
00:58:03,712 --> 00:58:03,972
Thank you.

956
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:04,553
Thank you.

957
00:58:07,346 --> 00:58:16,173
When you talk about owning your choices, I'm curious as to know, like, how do your meetings go when you get revision requests, or do you not even entertain revisions?

958
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:22,999
Of course! No, no, no, no, yeah, absolutely. You will like it! Please don't let the checks stop coming.

959
00:58:25,015 --> 00:58:29,441
Oh, of course, no, for me, those are not antithetical concepts.

960
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:35,729
In fact, they are very mutually supportive concepts because someone will throw out an

961
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:38,873
idea – bearing in mind that owning your choices is all about going down some path

962
00:58:39,113 --> 00:58:41,716
that you've really never been down before, and it's about creating something that you

963
00:58:41,736 --> 00:58:44,179
feel like, I didn't know I knew how to do this.

964
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:48,628
When someone offers you a suggestion, you know, like if I'm writing a piece for Wind Ensemble

965
00:58:48,668 --> 00:58:50,810
and the note I get is, make it more orange,

966
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:54,535
I have no idea what the hell that means, but it does make me think

967
00:58:55,015 --> 00:58:57,598
and rewrite and revise in a way that I wouldn't have on my own.

968
00:58:57,938 --> 00:59:00,521
And so then I end up going down an even more of an interesting path.

969
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:03,545
So yeah, to me, I actually think writing is in the rewriting.

970
00:59:04,225 --> 00:59:04,666
I love...

971
00:59:05,347 --> 00:59:09,831
Throwing things out because then I feel like, because I just always assume that my first instinct is terrible.

972
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:15,576
What I like to tell people is, what most people don't realize is I am a god awful composer.

973
00:59:15,736 --> 00:59:20,861
I really am terrible, but you just haven't heard 99% of what I wrote because I'm fairly good at curating.

974
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:25,865
So, and the notes are a helpful way to actually be able to do that.

975
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:28,207
All right, let's lightning round through the last two of you guys.

976
00:59:28,227 --> 00:59:31,290
All right, fight to the death between the two of you.

977
00:59:34,315 --> 00:59:34,915
It's on you.

978
00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:38,117
Thank you for your presentation.

979
00:59:38,377 --> 00:59:43,261
And my question is, usually, at which point

980
00:59:43,301 --> 00:59:47,263
do you bring live instrument and live musician?

981
00:59:47,563 --> 00:59:52,226
Because I have heard that you have somebody record it

982
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:58,390
right after you came up with the main theme melody of Journey.

983
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:11,651
Yeah, no, it's true. Journey I recorded on day one. Tina Guo, the cellist, and Amy Tatum, the bass flute player, were recorded on day one before there was even concept art or a remotely playable prototype for Journey as well.

984
01:00:14,385 --> 01:00:18,649
If you're tracking a soloist, I mean these are friends of mine, if I just call them and I say,

985
01:00:18,669 --> 01:00:20,090
will you come over and read this, they will.

986
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:25,114
Or I'll give them 50 bucks to just sit in front of a microphone, even if I end up throwing it out.

987
01:00:25,174 --> 01:00:29,598
But I would much rather the developer hear something that sounds the way it's supposed to sound

988
01:00:29,618 --> 01:00:30,519
and feels the way it's supposed to be.

989
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:32,340
Especially when you're talking about, like in the case of Journey,

990
01:00:33,001 --> 01:00:34,843
there's cellists and then there's Tina Guo.

991
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:40,590
She does not, I don't know what she does, but it's sorcery, which means that if, if,

992
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:45,152
if I cannot be sending them mock-ups, and you'll have a stroke if you're like, oh, I

993
01:00:45,172 --> 01:00:48,632
get used to the mock-up, and then you hear her, no brain should have to make that leap.

994
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:49,853
You gotta start with her.

995
01:00:49,873 --> 01:00:50,933
It's the safest thing.

996
01:00:51,513 --> 01:00:56,134
And so, obviously you can't do that with a full orchestra, so mock-ups are pretty key

997
01:00:56,175 --> 01:00:56,335
there.

998
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:59,835
So in that case, I tend to try to wait until the last possible second so I can keep changing

999
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,016
the music over and over and over again.

1000
01:01:01,776 --> 01:01:03,637
But for soloists, early and often.

1001
01:01:06,518 --> 01:01:10,399
Don't break the bank, but they'll work with you because it's just a one-on-one thing.

1002
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:12,720
Thank you.

1003
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:19,703
All right, thank you.

1004
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:20,484
Nice work, man.

1005
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:20,864
Nice work.

1006
01:01:20,884 --> 01:01:21,284
It's all yours.

1007
01:01:22,144 --> 01:01:22,444
Cheers.

1008
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:22,865
Good man.
