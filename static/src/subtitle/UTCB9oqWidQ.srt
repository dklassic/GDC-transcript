1
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:16,191
My name is Greg Lebonov, and I'll be giving a talk today about gamifying creativity and

2
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:19,252
chicory, a colorful tale.

3
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,452
So just introduce myself really quickly.

4
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:22,573
My name is Greg Lebonov.

5
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:25,774
I'm a game designer, indie game designer living in Vancouver from Philadelphia.

6
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:28,015
I've done a bunch of indie games before.

7
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:31,056
The last couple I've done are like particularly relevant to the subject.

8
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:34,038
So one I did in 2018 was called Wandersong.

9
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:36,159
It was like a musical adventure game

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,040
where you play as like a bard.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,062
It's a platformer where you can make music at any time.

12
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:41,943
You're sort of a walking musical instrument

13
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:44,204
and things interact with your music in different ways.

14
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:45,265
And there's sort of like a story

15
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:47,587
and puzzle solving element with that as well.

16
00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:51,589
And then the most recent game I released was called Chicory,

17
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:53,191
a Colorful Tale, which came out in 2021.

18
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:56,893
This one is a top-down sort of Zelda-like

19
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,474
painting adventure game where

20
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:02,176
the player explores this world, like a kind of Zelda-like world,

21
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:04,637
and then they have this magic brush they can use to color things in.

22
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:08,199
So the world is black and white, but the player can draw anywhere, anytime,

23
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:12,881
and there's sort of like puzzle-solving and adventure aspects with that brush.

24
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:14,102
So both those games kind of mix.

25
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:17,963
creativity mechanics with like adventure game mechanics.

26
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:19,603
And after working on both of those,

27
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:21,783
I have quite a lot of experience in working with

28
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:24,784
mixing creative mechanics with adventure game stuff.

29
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,424
And that's why I wanted to talk about

30
00:01:26,424 --> 00:01:28,004
sort of the classic problem of,

31
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,945
well, what's sometimes called quantified creativity,

32
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:33,945
which is known as a like curse problem.

33
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:37,446
I got really interested in the subject of curse problems

34
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:40,087
from this talk by Alex Jaffe in a previous UDC

35
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:42,167
called Curse Problems in Game Design.

36
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:42,907
It's really, really good.

37
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:43,827
I highly recommend it.

38
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:49,532
But yeah, specifically he talked about examples in this sort of like creativity thing.

39
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:52,735
I'm going to now like kind of summarize what he summarized with it.

40
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:58,079
So basically the idea is that you want to make a game that encourages people to be creative,

41
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,220
right?

42
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,944
But games also like sort of presuppose to introduce some kind of structure, right?

43
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:07,387
They promise some sort of structure to a player, like that's like what a game sort of is.

44
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:10,209
And those things come into conflict almost right away.

45
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,290
Because

46
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:16,794
Like things like advancing through levels or earning points or like leveling up,

47
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:20,597
progressing a character, whatever. These are all examples of extrinsic rewards,

48
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:25,480
right? Like rewards you get for doing stuff from the game. But following your heart and

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,443
expressing yourself and being creative, that is an intrinsically motivated activity,

50
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:34,026
right? Something that people do when they are intrinsically motivated, right? Something you

51
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:37,788
do to satisfy an internal need and it's supposed to be fun for its own sake.

52
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:45,100
In fact, it's been found through study that if people are doing creative tasks and they're

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,003
expecting a reward for it, they will tend to enjoy it less and they'll be less motivated to do it,

54
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:55,327
and they'll just be less creative in general. And I've found, a lot of game designers have found,

55
00:02:55,327 --> 00:03:01,212
maybe you've probably found, that when players are offered both extrinsic and intrinsically

56
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:06,816
rewarding activities, they will tend to pursue the extrinsic rewards. Those will tend to subsume the

57
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:07,276
intrinsic ones.

58
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:14,598
So like one example I can think of that is common to a lot of games are like clothes that have stats on them like in RPGs.

59
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,119
So often players will, you know, come into conflict where they have clothes that they like the look of better

60
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,600
and there's clothes that give them better stats and have to pick between them.

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,841
And almost always they're going to pick the ones that give them better stats,

62
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:28,542
especially if the game is like challenging or like the stats are kind of the point of the game, right?

63
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,643
It's like the aesthetic ends up just totally not being important,

64
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:34,663
even though there are some players that really would enjoy wearing clothes that they like.

65
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:40,825
So yeah, so this is like the paradox that I've dealt with a lot in my games.

66
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:46,348
And the way that I've kind of learned to frame it for myself is basically that I think that

67
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:51,571
creativity can't coexist with logical problem solving, or they just can't be mixed.

68
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:57,854
So one example that showcases this specifically that I think is really interesting was in

69
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,155
a game called Crayon Physics.

70
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:04,121
This is not meant as a rag on that game, because this is a really, really sweet game from a few years ago.

71
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:08,265
But the idea of this game is that it's like a physics puzzle game.

72
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:15,874
The player can draw whatever they want, and the things they draw become like kind of physics shapes that they can use to solve these puzzles where they're trying to get this ball to the star.

73
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:17,795
It's really, really fun.

74
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:21,398
But the thing is that players, even though they can draw whatever they want,

75
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:25,580
what they will tend to do is draw, like find one thing that they can draw that kind of

76
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,401
solves the problem.

77
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,882
In this case, like they're just like, they'll just draw boxes at every level.

78
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:33,385
And they'll just do the same thing over and over again, because they figured out like that's,

79
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,566
you know, how to get to the, how to beat the game basically.

80
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,607
Right?

81
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:39,629
And so the game like doesn't, even though they can do whatever they want, they're not

82
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:40,929
motivated to do whatever they want.

83
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:44,512
So even though they can draw anything, they're just going to draw stuff that solves the problems

84
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:45,032
in front of them.

85
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:56,117
Whereas what I was interested in was trying to find games that like motivate players to actually be creative and come up with stuff and self-express.

86
00:04:56,117 --> 00:05:00,299
So, but anyway, yeah, I mean, this is all a problem, but don't worry, because I fixed it.

87
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:09,423
And you can too. So the rest of this talk is going to be me talking about some of the ways that I found basically to work around or solve some of these conflicts that come up with this stuff.

88
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:16,725
And the first one is to just have both things there and you don't let them touch.

89
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:22,447
Or in other words, you separate all creative tasks from things that give you progress.

90
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,908
So using my own games as examples, in Wandersong and Chicory,

91
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,930
they are adventure games with stories. There's a beginning, middle, and an end.

92
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,952
There are places you explore and visit. There are puzzles you solve along the way.

93
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:39,334
There are characters you help. All this stuff are like, you get clear objectives step by step

94
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:43,516
that get you closer from the beginning of the story to the end of the story. And at no point

95
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:48,339
in there do you have to do anything creative at all. It's actually all really standard adventure

96
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:53,161
game structure stuff. Like if you played any Zelda game or Mario or something, you know what this is

97
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:53,401
like.

98
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:58,563
But there are tons of optional side activities.

99
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:01,183
There are characters that will ask you to make art for them.

100
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:05,325
In Chicory, there's like art classes you can go and do.

101
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:08,525
There's just like lots of other stuff that is not actually part of the critical path.

102
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:11,686
All of those are fully creative tasks.

103
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:12,186
And

104
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:13,788
Yeah, so they just don't touch.

105
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:14,369
They just don't touch.

106
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:19,175
You have stuff you do to progress the game and you've stuff you do to be creative.

107
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:24,281
And I actually think it's really good that both exist, because I found that players

108
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:29,688
generally need agency in how and when they engage with creative tasks, because doing

109
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,410
creative stuff is really exhausting.

110
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,652
And, you know, like I point out,

111
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:37,474
like when people are forced to do creative stuff,

112
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:38,735
they will not enjoy it.

113
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,817
Like if anyone who has played Tickery,

114
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,877
if you can imagine, right?

115
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,158
If there had been a requirement,

116
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:44,940
like, oh, to get to this next area,

117
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,481
you have to color in 10 screens or something, right?

118
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:49,543
I mean, people just wouldn't enjoy it.

119
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,584
They would hate it.

120
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:51,024
They resent it.

121
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:51,925
They wouldn't enjoy doing it.

122
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,346
They wouldn't enjoy creating that stuff, right?

123
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,667
They would just be like checking the boxes.

124
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,689
Whereas if you present them creative tasks

125
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:58,709
that they, that are like,

126
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,631
fully framed to them as being an optional thing.

127
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,252
They know that they are choosing to do this optional thing.

128
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:05,312
They feel their agency,

129
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:07,453
like they know they have the choice to do that or not.

130
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:08,854
They'll enjoy the task way more.

131
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,734
They'll be more creative and expressive too,

132
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,375
because they know that like their progress in the game

133
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,976
doesn't hinge on their ability to do this or not.

134
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,477
And that actually makes it way more enjoyable for them.

135
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:19,966
The option, like, so like, I mean,

136
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,667
so problem solving, typical game structure tasks,

137
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,268
basically, I think, inhabit a really different part

138
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:28,169
of the brain than creative things do.

139
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:29,890
So like in a standard game structure, right,

140
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,010
you're offering the player clear goals,

141
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,571
you're giving them progress,

142
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,951
and these are things that like stimulate them mentally

143
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,112
and then exhaust them mentally,

144
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:39,713
like solving puzzles and, or figuring out the simulation

145
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:41,753
or whatever, you know, navigating like a space.

146
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:45,496
Whereas creative tasks, they're best when they're freeform and expressive.

147
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:48,619
You give them as few guidelines as possible and let them make stuff up.

148
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:53,384
It's really fun and it's engaging emotionally, but also exhausting emotionally.

149
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:57,227
And when you give them the option to have both and switch between doing both

150
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,211
types of tasks, basically whenever they want, that is like ultimate power.

151
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:07,999
It actually, I think, makes players enjoy both of those individual tasks way more because

152
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:11,824
they are always engaging with problem solving when they have the energy to do it. And then

153
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,769
when they get tired of it, they have a different type of activity to do instead.

154
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:19,213
And so sort of the flow back and forth between both gives.

155
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:25,017
games this like really exciting energy to them. And they're like, you know, when you generalize

156
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:28,318
it this much, there are a lot of games that do stuff like this. So these are just some

157
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:34,061
examples of games that, you know, they incorporate some type of freeform creative mode where you can

158
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:38,984
sort of make stuff. And then they have sort of an adventure, progress, simulation, puzzle solving

159
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:44,106
mode or something. Both modes exist in these games and they are both part of the standard

160
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,108
experience. So like a player will engage with both along the way.

161
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:49,030
And I think it works really great.

162
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,356
Like, but so my like little like Greg's secret sauce is that for

163
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:57,980
Wandersong and Chicory, the starting point was designing the creativity

164
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,046
mechanic, and then the puzzle solving adventure stuff was sort of like made

165
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,088
using those as like the puzzle solving mechanic.

166
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:07,949
So basically you're always doing creativity stuff.

167
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:11,770
And even when you're not, so that even when you are not actually doing a creative thing,

168
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:16,972
like solving a puzzle in a dungeon, it actually still sort of feels like it is creative.

169
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:20,333
And the line between these two things gets blurred a lot because you're using the same

170
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,153
thing.

171
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:21,393
Um.

172
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:25,497
So yeah, I think it actually tricks players into feeling creative and it changes their impression

173
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:30,121
of the game overall, right? Because they feel more like it is a creative game.

174
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:34,505
Something that happens all the time when I have watched people play Chicory

175
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:39,389
is they'll be exploring around, they're solving a puzzle, they're on their way to something,

176
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:44,593
and then for some reason their attention gets caught. And maybe they notice that there's some

177
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:48,598
colors in an area or they just like to look at a particular scene or something, they'll

178
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:50,400
just hang out and they'll start drawing.

179
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,863
And they'll spend a lot of time drawing and like, you know, almost like completely by

180
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:57,527
accident, suddenly they're just doing creative stuff when they were supposed to be solving

181
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:58,849
puzzles in a dungeon.

182
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,952
I think the fact that like you can just, these switches can just kind of happen anytime.

183
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:04,675
It really does make the game really fun.

184
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:06,877
It works really, really well.

185
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:10,560
And I think people should steal this idea straight up.

186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,062
I think if you own a AAA game studio or if you can pitch to one

187
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:17,365
and someone made like a big budget version of like this kind of game structure,

188
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:19,666
I think you would do really, really well.

189
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,487
But even if you don't have a big AAA game studio

190
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,229
and you're just like a small indie person looking for some cool ideas.

191
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,653
I gave you permission, you should just take this. I think there could be a whole genre of games

192
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:34,859
that just do this. But anyway, okay, moving on. So you might be wondering, if doing creative stuff

193
00:10:34,859 --> 00:10:40,585
doesn't give players progress in the game, then how do you motivate them to be creative?

194
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:47,151
And my favorite answer to this question is with storytelling and role-playing. So

195
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:55,349
Basically what we do in Chickory and Wandersong is we create setups where players get to deliver

196
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:56,909
or give the punchline.

197
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:00,710
So we give them an open-ended prompt, we ask them to draw something, they draw something

198
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,970
or make something, make a song, whatever, and then we give them a really fun reaction

199
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,171
to the thing they did, or we reuse the thing they did in a different context.

200
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:13,392
We give them some kind of fun interaction between those things.

201
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:19,754
And so, yeah, basically the players feel like they're in this really fun conversation with

202
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:24,555
the game, right? And it gives them this opportunity to sort of role play, to insert themselves into

203
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:29,816
the world, right? To see themselves reflected in the game space. And that is just really fun.

204
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:34,257
All of the... Like Chikorita and Wandersong, both, they're basically built out of these

205
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:39,258
little... Tons of little opportunities where players get to express themselves, like that

206
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:41,098
example. And...

207
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:47,605
I think it's never mandatory, but when you give people the opportunity over and over

208
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:52,448
again to express themselves, even the most curmudgeonly person will end up doing it.

209
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:58,713
And I think that's great because my goal is to give people that fun satisfaction of being

210
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:02,616
creative and getting to do that in a game context.

211
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:07,580
So yeah, I just think this sort of conversational back and forth between players and the game

212
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,102
using their creativity is just a really fun part of it.

213
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:16,645
So in Chicory's 10 hour runtime, there are actually two places I broke my own rule where

214
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:21,207
there are there is a creative task that is part of like the mandatory goals to get to

215
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:21,788
the end of the game.

216
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:26,550
But both of them are like, like very deeply contexted with a story and roleplaying

217
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,872
situation. So like one of my favorite parts of the game is a bit where Pizza, the main

218
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:32,113
character on the left.

219
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:37,136
And Chicory, the mentor character on the right, they sort of have this like,

220
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:41,838
like, so your, your character asks Chicory, her mentor, to like draw a picture of her.

221
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:45,581
And so Chicory is drawing a picture of you and the two characters are having this sort of like

222
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:51,224
heartfelt conversation with one another. And then when the conversation is over,

223
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:54,446
when Chicory's finished drawing you, she doesn't show you the drawing she did of you.

224
00:12:54,446 --> 00:12:56,887
Instead, she asks you to draw a picture of her first.

225
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,269
and then you show the pictures to each other.

226
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,751
And I think this is like, it's for me, one of the coolest parts of the game,

227
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:07,133
because it really puts the player in the character's shoes

228
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,774
where they are drawing a picture of someone else

229
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:13,176
and then having to sort of share and compare their art with someone else,

230
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:16,458
which is a really like, I don't know, like fun activity.

231
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,900
It makes the players feel like a lot closer to Chikorita the character

232
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,641
because they sort of done this like mutual study with each other.

233
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:26,103
And then, of course, the drawing that we they do of Ticker Ace,

234
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:27,784
and we get to bring back later in the story.

235
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:31,766
So we get lots of value out of doing things this way.

236
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:35,549
And, you know, like it's yeah, I only I only think it's basically only works

237
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,271
like as a creative mandatory task because it is something that has

238
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:40,752
all the storytelling context to it.

239
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:46,174
And of course, also, we give players total flexibility to put as much effort into it

240
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,915
as they want. There's no objective, like, you have to fill in this much of the picture,

241
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:54,957
whatever. Players can literally submit it on Canvas if they want, right? So there is no

242
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:59,099
actual mandatory amount of work to it. It's just about being in the moment and being in

243
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,099
the character's shoes.

244
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,543
Actually, all of the drawings that we ask players to do, or almost, yeah, most of them are,

245
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:11,707
they're basically presented as a request from a character. And this sort of format actually

246
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:16,991
works really well, I find, because when you are making a drawing for another character,

247
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,494
you have a comfortable amount of distance from the piece where you have this opportunity to

248
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:24,997
express yourself. But you also have sort of a goal in mind of trying to make something that

249
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:29,901
will make that character happy, which is an ambiguous sort of goal or structure, but just

250
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:34,106
players basically get to decide how much they want to insert themselves into it

251
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:38,391
versus like just follow exactly the guidelines they feel like the game wants from them.

252
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:40,674
So they get agency there.

253
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:44,078
But in doing all these tasks, they also just engage more with the story

254
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,002
and the characters, like they always feel more connected to a character

255
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,123
drawing something for them.

256
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:49,365
Like, I think that's just cool.

257
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:56,069
Another side note, so I think this is a good example of something where narrative design

258
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:59,612
works really, really well to solve a problem that occurs in game design. And I think there's

259
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:04,955
actually a lot of really cool potential things for this and lots of different genres of games where

260
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:08,258
things that are generally accepted as like really tough game design problems could actually be

261
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:13,201
solved by like a really cool storytelling idea. And there are a lot of great examples recently

262
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:16,083
of games that do this. So like I think of the way that Celeste

263
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:20,607
is a platformer that riffs on classic platformer design with its story,

264
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:26,733
or the way Inscription riffs on Slay the Spire or Rougelike Card Games with its storytelling as well.

265
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:32,920
These are both just really exciting examples that elevate a classic known game design with a storytelling context.

266
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,706
And yeah, I think if narrative designers are given an opportunity to direct design stuff, it would be really cool ideas.

267
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:42,888
Anyway, moving on.

268
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:49,432
So if you are making a game that requires the player to make creative stuff, like one

269
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:54,314
very obvious way to gamify that is to evaluate their art, right?

270
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:59,797
So you give them prompt X and then deliver their piece Y, and then you give them score

271
00:15:59,797 --> 00:15:59,817
Z.

272
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,640
makes sense, right? But I think that this is actually like really not fun at all, or definitely

273
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,741
not as fun as people think it is. I think it's actually really degrading because it subconsciously

274
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:18,003
encourages a player to basically change, like adjust their piece to improve their score, right?

275
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:21,084
Generally by changing a superficial element. Because the way they're going to be thinking

276
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:25,786
about this is like, oh, I got this score. Could I get a better score? Right? And then they're

277
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:30,948
thinking about, okay, well, how do I adjust this to better meet whatever algorithm is deciding

278
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:35,210
how my art gets rated. And then they're not thinking about expression anymore, right?

279
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:43,654
They're thinking about logical problem solving. But actually, even more importantly than that,

280
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:49,557
yeah, I think it's just not fun. It's not interesting or challenging or subversive.

281
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:53,299
If a player makes something they care about and the game just tells them that it's bad,

282
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:56,881
it's just not enjoyable. I think it actually just makes people not want to try.

283
00:16:57,742 --> 00:17:02,023
And the thing is that you never know how a player feels about something that they've made for you.

284
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:05,265
Right? You don't know whether they maybe they thought it was a total joke, but maybe they took

285
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:09,066
it really seriously. Like maybe they really put their heart into this piece. You don't know that

286
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:13,608
you have no way to evaluate that. And so there's just never a good reason to tell them they did a

287
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,769
bad job. I think you should just always be nice.

288
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:17,592
But there is something interesting here, right?

289
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:21,118
Because they're like the thing that I think that is appealing about this

290
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:24,925
experience that actually interests players is this idea that the game is like

291
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:29,092
seeing what they did and then making like an observation about it.

292
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:31,280
So we push into that a lot.

293
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,661
I think you actually can get a lot of,

294
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:36,245
like a lot of like good interaction by giving players

295
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:39,168
like kind of interesting observations about stuff they did.

296
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:41,491
So to use Chicory as an example,

297
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:43,013
like Chicory has art classes in it.

298
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,654
And the basic format, right?

299
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:46,837
Is that, you know, we give them a prompt,

300
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:48,258
players draw sort of whatever.

301
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:49,879
And then we give them like an evaluation,

302
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:50,979
like an art critique afterward.

303
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:52,219
And the way that it works is, right,

304
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:55,220
the players submit this drawing and the game sort of like

305
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,140
does this critical analysis internally of it.

306
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,061
Like it divides it up into sections and just looks for,

307
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,541
like it makes a prioritized sort of list

308
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,662
of just observations about it.

309
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:05,862
So it might say like,

310
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,382
ooh, this green color is the color you use the most.

311
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:12,243
And like, this area is darker than other areas

312
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:13,083
on this drawing.

313
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,163
And this area,

314
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:19,587
is lighter than other areas on the piece or whatever, right? These are all just like objective

315
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:23,991
things the game can like measure about the artwork. And then it turns those, like it adds

316
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:28,354
like a little bit of judgment or evaluation to it and then like turns it into these kind of like

317
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:33,679
statements about the piece that are like framed as an art critique. And things like this are really

318
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,902
like gratifying and fun to hear as a player because, right, it makes, really makes you feel

319
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:41,705
like the game is noticing what you did and is reflecting that back to you. And that is what

320
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,287
is really, really fun about it.

321
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:46,594
I'll also mix, so like, I'll mix comments like this

322
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,875
that are like algorithmically generated

323
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,837
with completely handcrafted comments

324
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:54,059
that are like, like based basically

325
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,660
on the prompt the player was given.

326
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,681
So a character might say like,

327
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:58,562
oh, like my joy looks different from this.

328
00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:00,743
Or like, I don't understand what's going on in this piece,

329
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:02,845
but I like that, you know, whatever, right?

330
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:04,786
So you kind of mix and mix those things together.

331
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:07,968
And the illusion all together is something that,

332
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:09,529
yeah, it really feels like the game is reacting

333
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:10,890
to what the player is doing.

334
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,151
It's really satisfying.

335
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:21,671
So last thing that I want to talk about in this subject is about creating constraints for players.

336
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:28,237
So like it's giving a player a constraint or like a goal with their piece can be really fun,

337
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:32,881
but if you're scoring the player based on how well they meet your, the constraint you give them,

338
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,583
then it basically leads to all the same issues I was talking about with like evaluating their art,

339
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,747
where, you know, then they're thinking about how to maximize their score for this evaluation,

340
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,129
and they're not thinking about like how to actually express.

341
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:49,050
So just like the twist that I make this always is that rather than giving them like a constraint

342
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,711
with like a goal to meet, we basically change their toolkit. We change what's actually possible

343
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:57,812
for them. We make that the challenge, right? Because then it turns instead of a, like the

344
00:19:57,812 --> 00:20:02,773
constraint is like part, it's baked into the prompt. There's no way for them to fail at that,

345
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:06,774
right? They're just given a box to work in. They get to creatively problem solve how to do

346
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:11,836
something creative in that space. And I am generalizing a lot, but like an example that

347
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,036
might be in chicory is...

348
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:17,697
you know, like, you know, you have to draw me a picture, but there's something on the

349
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:22,359
canvas already. Or, or yeah, you only have these certain colors, we're drawing on a weirdly

350
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,200
shaped surface that like doesn't, you know, isn't a canvas or whatever, right? Like there

351
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,262
are tons of these. And also what I really enjoy about this too, is that like, when you

352
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:35,324
give players really weird constraints, that's always a really fun storytelling opportunity

353
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:36,224
where like, you can be like.

354
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:40,167
okay, so there's a guy in the game. You might, as a designer, say, oh, there's a guy in the game who

355
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:44,290
wants you to draw a picture that's blue. And then you get to wonder, why does this guy want a thing

356
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,174
that's only blue? And then you get to tell a story about who this weird guy is that wants

357
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:52,017
things that's only blue. Maybe there's something nefarious going on. I don't know. The interaction

358
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:56,841
between just weird game prompts and the storytelling opportunities, and also just

359
00:20:56,841 --> 00:21:01,044
creating lots of different constraints for different sorts of art projects, there is just

360
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:04,007
so much depth in that type of gameplay.

361
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:11,375
Whoop, I just went too far ahead. Sorry. There's so much depth in that type of gameplay.

362
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:16,261
It's a really fun way to make games and a really great way to basically give players lots of things

363
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:21,327
to do that feel more meaningful. So, I don't know. Yeah, free game design tip.

364
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:26,531
And in Chicory, so we had a really good, we had a lot of good outcomes, basically giving players

365
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:30,393
very open-ended prompts, right? There are actually no constraints. We would just give them an open

366
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:35,757
ended prompt, like express joy or draw like a cute creature or something. And this is really

367
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:39,679
fun because again, players get to decide like how much to engage with the prompt and what they think

368
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,782
fits that prompt. And they can't be evaluated on these. They're like not objectively evaluatable,

369
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:48,045
but that sort of makes it fun. And yet it is fun, right? Like you would think.

370
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,429
oh, like, there's no, like, you're just giving players space, like, why would they be motivated?

371
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:57,434
But it is motivating because it's actually just fun to make stuff and to express yourself.

372
00:21:57,434 --> 00:22:03,860
So yeah, I, that's, that's, that's the gist. And then, so I'm just going to summarize.

373
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:07,643
Separate creativity from logical problem solving

374
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:10,065
and game progression.

375
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:12,487
Use story and characters and role-playing opportunities

376
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:15,970
to motivate player self-expression.

377
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,851
Never score or evaluate art, but do

378
00:22:17,851 --> 00:22:23,196
provide specific observations of choices that players have made.

379
00:22:23,196 --> 00:22:26,118
And create constraints by varying the player's toolkit.

380
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:27,379
That's the summary.

381
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,920
So thank you, everybody.

382
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,400
I was Greg.

383
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:36,080
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I mean, I, I know I finished a little bit fast, but I'm going to, I have,

384
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,123
yeah, so there's time now for questions and stuff if there are any.

385
00:22:39,123 --> 00:22:58,179
Sweet. I don't know if I can, I don't know if I can see the room or anything,

386
00:22:58,179 --> 00:22:59,740
so I'm just going to like listen for.

387
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,434
Um, hi, great talk.

388
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:11,980
I was wondering, uh, uh, I assume that you had some very interesting player

389
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,843
feedback from this game, given like the completely open-ended portions of some

390
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:22,387
of it, and I was just selfishly wondering if you had any like really favorite

391
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:24,828
quotes that you've had from playtests.

392
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:33,886
Huh, really favorite quotes? I don't know about quotes. I definitely have a lot of really fun...

393
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:38,269
I mean, people who... If I look at our Steam reviews, which is a pastime of me

394
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:41,070
murdering down about myself, I'll look at our Steam reviews. There's always tons of

395
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,093
really good comments. People will be like, oh, I didn't think... I'm not an artist. I thought I

396
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:48,175
would hate this game because I don't like to draw. But it turns out I have a lot of fun drawing,

397
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:51,878
and I actually got in touch with that part again. And now sometimes I'm drawing for fun,

398
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:55,000
on the side. That kind of stuff is really gratifying for me to hear.

399
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,246
That comes in lots of different flavors. I can't think of a really specific quote about it,

400
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:04,593
but that kind of flavor comes up a lot. And I do really appreciate hearing stuff like that because

401
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:07,638
yeah, I'm excited to get people in touch with that part of themselves

402
00:24:07,638 --> 00:24:09,701
through games. I think that part is really cool.

403
00:24:10,502 --> 00:24:13,725
But yeah, I mean, everyone, like, the thing with it being open-end is that everyone who

404
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:16,608
plays these games, they have like a really different experience.

405
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:20,311
Some people really just don't engage the creativity stuff, like at all, or like a very minimum

406
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:21,873
amount, a very minimum amount.

407
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:25,296
And I think that that's okay, because they still are exposed to it.

408
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:27,178
I mean, they get a game they really enjoy, right?

409
00:24:27,178 --> 00:24:29,360
They play like a cool adventure game, they get to the end of.

410
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,882
and they just do some creativity along the way.

411
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:34,604
And for some people, that is the most they want out of it.

412
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:36,365
And I think it's great that they can get that.

413
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:38,166
Some people just forget to even finish the game,

414
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,547
and they just hang out drawing all day.

415
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:42,169
And that's really cool too.

416
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,670
So I think both are great.

417
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,093
And I think appealing to both is also great and helps lots of people.

418
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:55,521
And hi, I just wanted to ask, I love Wondersong and with a game like you said, like some people

419
00:24:55,521 --> 00:25:01,704
don't finish the game, there's so much to do in each area and how you play around with the

420
00:25:01,704 --> 00:25:06,546
main mechanic. How do you pace the content of the game? Because I remember in Wondersong there

421
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:12,488
were like worlds and how do you decide like this is enough and the player can move on?

422
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:19,170
I usually use story as kind of my grounding framework for deciding stuff like pacing,

423
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,556
how to move people through stuff. So we think about what's going on in the story.

424
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:27,100
How long has it been since the last major story beat? How long do you want to be until the next

425
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,044
one? And that's basically how we think about pacing things out.

426
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:35,969
So yeah, we want players to spend like a comfortable amount of time in each space,

427
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,192
or as much time as they want. But then there's always like the drive, the thing that actually

428
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:43,415
makes them move towards the ending is always like wanting to know what happens next. So you sort of

429
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:49,100
like dole out like the story information at a good pace. And that's like a whole other subject.

430
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,084
That's not really game design exactly. But yeah, like I think the story helps guide basically

431
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:58,028
players to this like emotional journey through the game. And that guides how we pace the

432
00:25:58,028 --> 00:25:59,789
size of like different areas and stuff like that.

433
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,280
Thank you.

434
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,363
Yeah.

435
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:10,726
Hi, so if you could do away with every reason you had to keep the

436
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:13,227
story at its current length and level of detail, what do you think

437
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:13,847
you would add to it?

438
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:15,248
I just like love the story so much.

439
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:15,549
Wait, okay.

440
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:18,710
So if I could if I could do whatever I want, like if I could just

441
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,512
do whatever I want with story and I'm not thinking about game

442
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:22,253
design at all.

443
00:26:22,253 --> 00:26:23,033
Is that what you mean?

444
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:29,642
Huh. It's actually a hard question for me because, well, so I think like, I don't know if you are

445
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:34,304
familiar, but the game I made, Wandersong, I think is like maybe one of the closest examples of this

446
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:40,147
that I can think of where I think I, that kind of was the aim where Wandersong is like not the most

447
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:44,670
fun game at every part of it. I sort of was, I allowed myself to make concessions where I really

448
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,530
want the story to matter.

449
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,553
So I'm going to use the game to sort of elevate the story.

450
00:26:48,553 --> 00:26:50,255
And sometimes the game will be sort of frustrating

451
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:51,877
where I want the story to feel frustrating

452
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,620
or like, yeah, like whatever, right?

453
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,603
I let that sort of be the guiding light.

454
00:26:56,603 --> 00:26:58,645
So that's kind of my closest version of it.

455
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:01,208
It's hard for me to like totally extract them

456
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,750
from each other because

457
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,753
like what I enjoy about the process of these things is how they are in conversation with

458
00:27:06,753 --> 00:27:12,237
each other. So like, I, it's hard for me to just think of story in a vacuum without having

459
00:27:12,237 --> 00:27:16,681
fun, like game aspects to it. And the conversation between them, I think is kind of partly what

460
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:20,844
makes the stories like really, really fun. If I wanted to do it without having game design,

461
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:24,487
I would just like try writing books, but I don't think I would be good at or enjoy writing books,

462
00:27:24,487 --> 00:27:27,870
you know, it's a different sort of thing. So.

463
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:33,372
Yeah, I don't know. I guess, yeah. Sometimes making concessions for making the game less

464
00:27:33,372 --> 00:27:37,494
fun or the game design less interesting to present the story in a better light, I think,

465
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:43,216
is the most concession I sometimes will make in this kind of issue. I don't know if that

466
00:27:43,216 --> 00:27:46,897
answers your question. I hope it does. Yeah, that's cool. Thank you.

467
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:47,097
Yeah.

468
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:53,710
Hi, so I'm just wondering in the kind of dichotomy you set up between like

469
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,954
separating the problem solving from creative tasks, I'm wondering if you

470
00:27:57,954 --> 00:28:02,198
have any thoughts for how do you like encourage creative problem solving where

471
00:28:02,198 --> 00:28:07,503
you want people to solve problems, but like in creative ways, or if maybe that's

472
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:10,827
kind of doesn't quite fit in this framework.

473
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:18,057
It's a really interesting question. And it is like, yeah, I think it's really, really hard.

474
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:23,001
I mean, it's like, the closer you get to making these things meet, the more you just get into

475
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:28,726
so many weird... It always never quite goes the way you want. If I try to think of games that

476
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:32,889
are good examples of this... Okay, so when I think of games that have really creative problem

477
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:36,192
solving in it, usually the things that seem to be motivated the most...

478
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:41,434
are games that are extremely hard. And therefore, to solve the problems,

479
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:45,576
players will start working out of the box and doing unconventional things.

480
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:50,458
In a recent example, I'm sure we all are familiar with Elden Ring. The way that people play that

481
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,359
game... Everyone plays that game in a very different way because they're faced with a

482
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,700
very, very difficult challenge.

483
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:14,514
and that forces people to sort of like try different things, right? Or like, like act in weird ways, like, you know, try to clip through walls or go around corners or skip sections, like, they will do things more creatively when they're sort of like compressed to a closer point. A lot of roguelikes, you know, will also sort of encourage this type of thinking. But I do think like, you know,

484
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:18,636
the creative problem solving in that light, it's very different from the type of creativity that

485
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:23,198
I'm talking about. So like I'm talking about, you know, self-expression and problem solving

486
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:28,960
through self-expression is like really, really hard to force, I think, right? Because you can't,

487
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,281
like, if you, if the game is so hard that like players are thinking about how to solve it

488
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:38,063
logically, then that, that is a different headspace, I guess, to be in. Yeah. It's a

489
00:29:38,063 --> 00:29:42,505
really, it's a hard problem. I hope that kind of answers your question. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks.

490
00:29:44,822 --> 00:29:51,029
I'm kind of curious at what point in development, and this might be more development sausage-making question,

491
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:57,656
like at what point in development did you start showing Chicory to people and getting feedback

492
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:03,002
and, you know, evaluating whether your hypothesis of a game was worth pursuing further?

493
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:21,739
That's a good question. Well, so in the case of Chicory, I was showing it to like, I had close friends who are showing it to like very, very like, right, I would, okay, the very, very first big question I had was just like, can I make a satisfying like painting mechanic using a game controller? Because that already sounded like that was just wasn't going to work.

494
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:25,601
So, I made like prototypes where, you know, the player had like an MS Paint screen with

495
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:30,665
the paintbrush and I was just trying different stuff like the physics on the brush and colors

496
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:33,567
and stuff to see if I could find like kind of a fun version of that.

497
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:36,849
And I was trying that with people right away because I wanted to make sure that like the

498
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:38,270
core interaction was fun.

499
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,212
So, just from that, I was showing it to people.

500
00:30:41,212 --> 00:30:44,794
But, you know, the thing is like that drawing is really fun.

501
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:48,397
Like everybody, every single human being at some point in their life has drawn and had

502
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:49,878
a good time doing it, you know?

503
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:52,239
Which you can't really say for a lot of activities.

504
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:56,201
So once I had a little drawing app that you could use to draw with the controller,

505
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:58,762
people did enjoy playing that. I knew that was going to be fun.

506
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:01,964
The question was how to get people...

507
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:05,246
They tricked people into doing that as often as possible.

508
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:09,788
And as long as I was succeeding at doing that, then the game was fun.

509
00:31:09,788 --> 00:31:11,549
So I didn't have...

510
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:14,310
Yeah, once I had the basic format for...

511
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,932
The idea, the structure in mind for the game that was going to do that...

512
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:22,576
I didn't actually have a lot of questions that it was going to be fun.

513
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:25,518
I think if you can find ways to mix this stuff, it is a fun thing.

514
00:31:25,518 --> 00:31:26,559
And it's not used very often.

515
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,822
People aren't exploring the space that much.

516
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:30,543
So I encourage it.

517
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:38,490
I had a question about sharing the creativity outside of the game, like having tools to

518
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,753
go on social media and how it might change the motivation or the balances of the motivation

519
00:31:42,753 --> 00:31:44,835
and what your thoughts were on the right balance there.

520
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:50,767
Yeah, well, so in Chicory, we included a button that lets people save a GIF of the stuff they

521
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:55,651
do and post that to social media. That's our accent of it. We never prompt people to share

522
00:31:55,651 --> 00:32:00,474
stuff in the game. It's never like, I tweet this button. I do think that that changes stuff,

523
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:05,458
because then you're creative performatively. And I actually think that one of the strengths,

524
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,139
at least for Chicory, is that...

525
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,460
for players, it can be a really private thing.

526
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,340
In fact, like there were some streamers who I was

527
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,721
really looking forward to watching play Chicory.

528
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:15,241
And then many of them were like,

529
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,941
actually, I don't think I'm going to play this game on stream

530
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:18,402
because I'm having a really good time.

531
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,422
And I just want to like do something on pace.

532
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:22,022
And the game sort of like encourages that.

533
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:23,963
And I think that's actually like good.

534
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:26,263
I mean, it's good for those people, right, individually.

535
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:28,684
I think it makes the game a better experience.

536
00:32:28,684 --> 00:32:30,524
So those are two different types of motivations

537
00:32:30,524 --> 00:32:31,585
basically for making things.

538
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,471
making stuff to share with other people is also fun.

539
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:36,452
There are lots of games that do that really well.

540
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:38,872
Like Jackbox is a game I can think of

541
00:32:38,872 --> 00:32:42,113
that is all about making stuff and showing it to people,

542
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:44,054
right, or like Telephone or something.

543
00:32:44,054 --> 00:32:46,375
So those are really great examples of games that do that.

544
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,255
I think they are motivating

545
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:48,916
in a really different way though,

546
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:52,577
because you're not really thinking about expressing yourself,

547
00:32:52,577 --> 00:32:54,197
you're thinking about how do I make the people

548
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:56,198
in this room laugh or something, which is different.

549
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:59,982
but interesting as well, and a totally cool space to explore.

550
00:32:59,982 --> 00:33:01,143
I haven't thought of like mixing that

551
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:03,886
with an adventure game kind of format, the way I have here,

552
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:05,968
but yeah, yeah, I think all that stuff

553
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:08,211
is really, really interesting

554
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:10,553
and different ways of expressing this.

555
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:10,713
Thanks.

556
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:13,874
Hey, Greg.

557
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:17,256
Great talk and amazing game.

558
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:18,317
Thanks.

559
00:33:18,317 --> 00:33:20,638
I found when I was playing it, how much I'd

560
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:24,600
bother to color in a scene would kind of fluctuate

561
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,722
throughout playing, depending on my creative energy.

562
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:30,504
Sometimes I'd really intricately color something,

563
00:33:30,504 --> 00:33:32,365
and sometimes I would just be like,

564
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:33,606
oh, I guess I got colors in.

565
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:41,948
I guess it kind of went in line maybe like almost like role-playing like with the game.

566
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:45,710
Yeah I was interested in what were your observations of people playing and whether

567
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:53,392
that fluctuated and also kind of how do you account for people that might be like completionists

568
00:33:53,392 --> 00:33:59,494
and I definitely found a couple times I was like obsessively painting something when I was like

569
00:33:59,494 --> 00:34:03,115
tired like creatively tired but because I wanted to.

570
00:34:03,696 --> 00:34:06,551
to, you know, be a bit of a completionist.

571
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:11,705
Right. Well, so we don't reward players for coloring things.

572
00:34:11,705 --> 00:34:14,167
And this is like really important to me.

573
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,388
And I mean, I was hoping that it would mitigate some of that a little bit.

574
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,770
Right. Because when you were testing this, there were a lot of people

575
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,092
that were saying, hey, it'll be really cool if like when you color in the whole

576
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:25,254
screen, something happens, you know, like there's just like the character

577
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:28,936
does a little dance or you get like a little star on the map or something.

578
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:31,858
Right. And I like made really sure not to ever do that,

579
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:36,341
because as soon as you have that, people will do all of them just like by necessity.

580
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:41,243
So I really tried to make sure that people knew that they did not have to do that.

581
00:34:41,243 --> 00:34:41,744
Like there was no...

582
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:44,265
You have characters appear though, don't you?

583
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:47,767
Yeah, we reward them, but it was kind of meant to be like a surprise thing.

584
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,248
And they don't show up for coloring the whole screen.

585
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:51,769
They show up like you might not even color the screen like very much

586
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:52,910
and they might show up sometimes.

587
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,391
So it was meant to like disconnect that a little bit.

588
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:57,613
But yeah, I guess it does sort of like it does it right.

589
00:34:57,613 --> 00:34:58,473
And it's tough.

590
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:01,376
But it was something I was concerned about,

591
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:04,059
like something that we did separate to that,

592
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:06,281
where we have things in the game that are sort of intended

593
00:35:06,281 --> 00:35:08,643
as like, when you get to certain points in the story,

594
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:10,245
the game sort of prompts you to take a break.

595
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:12,066
And that was another way that we were trying to say,

596
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:13,608
like, hey, like if you've been playing for a while,

597
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,310
like you should maybe stop for a bit.

598
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,091
Like you're trying to find ways to insert,

599
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:19,354
like ways to encourage people to do that.

600
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:21,296
But yeah, I mean, if...

601
00:35:21,876 --> 00:35:25,878
It's really tough to completely stop people from doing it. I mean, you give people the agency to

602
00:35:25,878 --> 00:35:31,901
draw as much as they want. Some people will draw more than they want to because they just kind of

603
00:35:31,901 --> 00:35:37,883
get into it. I have that problem playing lots of games. I would be super interested to figure out

604
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:42,786
ways to do it, but to mitigate that as much as possible. Because when people are playing past

605
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:46,928
the point of exhaustion, it's not fun for them, and they kind of lose some of the experience.

606
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:51,430
The checkpoints worked well, I found. I did stop playing at those checkpoints a lot of the time.

607
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,582
Awesome, I really appreciate hearing that then at least.

608
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,924
But yeah, it was something we were concerned about

609
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,425
and something we thought about.

610
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:01,007
I hope that your experience was more good than bad.

611
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:02,668
Oh no, it's like my game of the year.

612
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:03,849
Okay, sweet.

613
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:05,590
All right, great, we're out of time.

614
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:11,315
Thank you very much for joining us today.

615
00:36:11,315 --> 00:36:13,997
Yeah, thank you for all the great questions, everybody.
