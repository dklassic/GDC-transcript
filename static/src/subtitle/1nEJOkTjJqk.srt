1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,422
can you hear me? I guess they wanted me to remind you that

2
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:15,082
you've got things when you came in, they scanned your thing and

3
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:20,504
they went feedback. So feedback would be cool. And also, he told

4
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:26,225
me to tell you something else. Say what? Yeah, cell phones.

5
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:30,686
Don't turn off. Turn your cell phones off. Yeah. Hi.

6
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:41,021
I'm going to talk about meat. Specifically, people as meat.

7
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:45,690
Specifically, specifically, people as meat in video games.

8
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:50,878
I should probably back up. Hi, I'm Tyreek. Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,463
I'm a pixel artist, animator, coder, I guess, currently

10
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:57,665
working on a roguelike platformer called Catacomb

11
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,689
Kids, which is not entirely relevant right now. We'll get

12
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,911
to that in a bit. But first I would like to pose to you a

13
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:06,054
question, which is, when was the last time you played a game

14
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:09,018
where you felt like you were inhabiting a human body?

15
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:11,734
Not just controlling a collection of numbers.

16
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,936
And I also don't mean like,

17
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:16,178
oh yeah, this is a really well-written character,

18
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:17,779
like I feel I can empathize with them,

19
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,700
they feel like a person.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,122
I mean, like when was the last time you played a game

21
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:22,543
where you felt breakable?

22
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:25,325
And not just breakable, but consequentially so,

23
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,927
where you fear a failure because a failure

24
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,368
is the beginning of something worse.

25
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:34,280
So human bodies are incredibly diverse in so many ways.

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,642
Each of us unique with thoughts and feelings,

27
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:38,424
strengths and weaknesses of all our own.

28
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:40,826
Bodies coming in all different shapes, sizes, and colors.

29
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,768
But we have one thing in common

30
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:44,149
and that's what we're made out of,

31
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,213
which is skin, bone, nerves, blood, meat.

32
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:50,696
Breakable.

33
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:53,438
Unless you're Bruce Willis.

34
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,807
But there are a lot of games that disproportionately feature Bruce Willis as a player character.

35
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:01,649
And don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with power fantasies.

36
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:02,849
I like power.

37
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,711
But power isn't a universally human quality. Moreover, power isn't always interesting.

38
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:10,492
But being human, I think, is.

39
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:15,099
So some of you may have noticed that the title of this talk is taken from the

40
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:17,862
famous short story by Terry Bisson called They're Made Out of Meat,

41
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:21,706
which recounts a conversation between two aliens marveling over the fact that

42
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,908
the dominant species of life on earth, that is to say,

43
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,872
humans, are made entirely out of meat and communicate by, quote,

44
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:31,636
flapping their meat at each other, and, quote, squirting air through their meat,

45
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:33,258
as I am doing right now.

46
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:38,708
So I read this story when I was like a little kid, and it really enamored me not only with science fiction as a whole,

47
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:41,569
but the idea of the physicality of humans.

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,612
Like, we think, and we feel, and we have like fears and strengths and loves,

49
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:49,354
and some of us are nervous wrecks, but before any of that,

50
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:55,257
we're physical beings that have to exist in this world without falling apart.

51
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:59,640
So how does that work? What physically is a person?

52
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,661
Well, we're a lot of things.

53
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:09,866
were 206 bones wrapped up in 640 muscles all like weaved through by 40 plus miles of nerves,

54
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:14,130
some 70 plus organs, all held together by this weird sack that's constantly dying and

55
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,890
replacing itself.

56
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,313
The point I'm trying to make is, we're made out of parts.

57
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,784
Many different parts all working together.

58
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:23,686
A lot of them we need to stay alive,

59
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:26,108
but for many of them, their damages and absences

60
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:27,609
can be adapted to, reckoned with.

61
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,813
The 206 bones, 640 muscles, all that, usually.

62
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:32,914
That's usually what we are.

63
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,835
But things happen, and we break.

64
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,538
Which brings us to the other thing that we are as humans,

65
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,119
which is fragile.

66
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,447
There are so many things that can go wrong in the human body without much difficulty.

67
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,247
Physical traumas are easy to come by.

68
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:47,308
Everybody trips, everybody falls,

69
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,269
manage to catch yourself wrong and your arm can take on a whole new shape,

70
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:53,770
as my brother once learned while he was skating.

71
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,172
Don't catch yourself at all, and a cushion might make you forget the entire concert you just came out of,

72
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:02,153
as I once learned while coming out of a concert.

73
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,013
And I was fortunate.

74
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:08,555
If I had hit my head worse, that could have been like the beginning of some very serious problems or an ending altogether.

75
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:12,355
And that's to say nothing of the effects of extreme heat, cold,

76
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:15,156
infections, diseases, our irritating need to do things

77
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:19,358
like eat and sleep. And we live in a world filled with sharp

78
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:24,540
things, fast things, hard things, long drops. So let's

79
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,461
just not go anywhere or do anything. Because the world is

80
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,283
terrifying. But even that can mess you up. Like

81
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,467
Everybody knows by now that prolonged periods of sitting

82
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:38,127
will wreck a body over time.

83
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:40,308
Just like, oh, my legs are dying.

84
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:46,550
But also, severe damage can be done in even shorter periods

85
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:46,890
than that.

86
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,971
Dave Mustaine, the lead singer and guitarist for Megadeth,

87
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:54,572
fell asleep with his arm hanging over the back of a chair

88
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:56,913
and woke up with severe nerve damage

89
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:58,494
that took months to repair.

90
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,655
It was like a year before he picked up a guitar again.

91
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:08,949
But that brings me to my next point about what it's like being meat, which is we do repair and we adapt.

92
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,530
Dave Mustaine's arm nerves got right again.

93
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:13,992
My brother's arm got arm-shaped again.

94
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,333
Eventually, I did remember that concert.

95
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:19,334
And our physical forms are incredibly resilient.

96
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:21,315
But I just said we were fragile.

97
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,036
And now I'm saying we're resilient.

98
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:24,676
But of course we are. We're all of these things.

99
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:28,797
For all of our breakable parts and glowing red weak points,

100
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:32,018
as we have, we're robust, resilient,

101
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:33,839
and capable of surviving extreme traumas.

102
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,341
Yes, we're made out of parts,

103
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,382
and those parts can fail and be lost,

104
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:39,803
but the whole continues.

105
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:41,764
We're fragile and we break easily,

106
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:43,125
but we can be restored,

107
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,986
and what can't be restored can be adapted to.

108
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:47,567
So we're made out of parts,

109
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:49,068
we're fragile, and we're resilient.

110
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,009
And it's the combination of these three elements

111
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,770
which I think comprises the core

112
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,531
of the human physical experience.

113
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:58,599
take one away and you're left with either superman or a robot

114
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,043
or a glass figurine.

115
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:03,492
So, we're GDC. What's this got to do with video games?

116
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:10,276
Well, I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of video games feature humans as player characters,

117
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,257
which is pretty neat.

118
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:12,177
Humans are cool.

119
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:12,918
I like games.

120
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:13,938
Let's put them together.

121
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,661
But while I've noticed there's been a push, and justifiably so, for making characters

122
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:23,324
feel more human in games as far as the right writing them goes and making them behave like

123
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:28,267
people and be relatable on an emotional level, it's still, I feel, fairly uncommon to see

124
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:32,450
humans in games represented as truly physical beings, as breakable, as meat.

125
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:37,184
And I think that as games are trying and making better

126
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:39,065
progress and representing the emotion of the human

127
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:41,105
experience in games like Gone Home and The Beginner's Guide

128
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,606
and so on, we as developers can't ignore the physical

129
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:47,407
aspects of what it's like to be human and these bodies that we

130
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:49,728
inhabit, many parts fragile and resilient.

131
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:51,669
So how do we do this?

132
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:54,430
How can we better represent the vast range of human

133
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,390
vitality in games?

134
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,572
Well, the first thing to do is realize the many ways that

135
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:01,092
health has already been represented in games.

136
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:04,304
So here's where I finally get to mention that game that I'm

137
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,366
making. So I've been working on Catacomb Kids for a while. It's

138
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,907
a platformer roguelike with all the things you'd expect from a

139
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:14,089
platformer roguelike. Procedurally generated levels,

140
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:25,015
looting, dungeon crawling, you level up, permadeath. Is it not

141
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:25,255
going?

142
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:32,513
permadeath. It also has a fairly standard sort of health system,

143
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:36,194
which is you have a certain amount of HP, when you get hit,

144
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:40,396
that number goes down. When it is zero, you are dead. This is

145
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:43,837
video games. If you were trying to represent a not video game,

146
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:46,998
but you want to make it seem very video games, this is the

147
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:49,419
thing that you do. Put some numbers or health bars

148
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:53,660
overheads. It's an easy way to detach events from reality. So

149
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,541
this is what I'm going to call the first most basic way of

150
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,921
representing health in games, which is through abstraction.

151
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,425
People don't really have hit points.

152
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:02,565
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

153
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:04,746
You can't defeat your rude neighbor

154
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:07,126
by repeatedly slapping him in the shin until he explodes.

155
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:09,847
Abstraction of health can be convenient, though.

156
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,588
It's easy to understand the cause and effect

157
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:14,049
are immediate and readable.

158
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:15,889
It lets players plan more effectively

159
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,490
when they know that the boss's fireball does three damage

160
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,491
and they have eight health, or when they know that, like,

161
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:23,112
it takes six bullets to kill someone without body armor.

162
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:28,298
and abstraction doesn't always only take on the form of hit points, abstraction can also be

163
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:31,522
status effects in jrpgs, like oh no my strong dude got poisoned

164
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:33,904
now a number is decreasing at regular intervals

165
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:37,008
or dang my ice cream buddy got blinded

166
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:40,251
now the percentage chance of a thing that i want to happen happening is

167
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,332
significantly diminished

168
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:45,948
I don't actually play a lot of JRPGs, sorry, with those examples, but...

169
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:50,290
The point still stands that abstractions of health are basically those systems whereby

170
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,371
players essentially lack all aspects of meatiness,

171
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,712
maybe aside from that death is possible.

172
00:08:56,553 --> 00:08:59,734
They're not treated as a collection of parts, but as some inseparable whole

173
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:02,255
where injury to any part is an injury to all parts.

174
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,097
Neither are they fragile or resilient because

175
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:07,578
both of those require some manner of meaningful change.

176
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:09,118
To be fragile is to be breakable.

177
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,540
To be resilient is to be restored from brokenness.

178
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:18,369
With abstracted health systems, player characters are mechanically identical at both one health and 100.

179
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:24,451
Or, if there is some mechanical change, it will have no resemblance to the actuality of being human.

180
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:25,691
Mario, for instance.

181
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:29,133
In the 2D Mario games, most of them, you can get up to three hit points.

182
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:32,854
One for your outfit, one for your bigness, and the last one to kill you.

183
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,239
that doesn't sound remotely human. One for your outfit, one

184
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:40,442
for your bigness, and the last one to kill you? Like what is

185
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:45,708
that? Do people shrink? No, that doesn't happen. Another way to

186
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:48,270
look at it is this. Another way to look at it is this.

187
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:52,831
If you can represent the player character as a ball or some other abstract shape

188
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:56,573
and still have the health system make just as much or just as little sense

189
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,174
it's probably using an abstract representation of health

190
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:02,797
because there's not really an easy way to convert back and forth between people and balls

191
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:06,819
If you can, it's hard to believe that anything resembling a human was part of the equation to begin with

192
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:10,244
Of course, abstraction is far from the only way

193
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:12,627
human physicality can and has been represented in games.

194
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:14,469
There are many games that have tried to employ

195
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,530
more representative systems.

196
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:17,692
And one of those games that really opened my eyes

197
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:19,915
to the possibilities was a roguelike called Ivan.

198
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:23,138
A few years ago, I was working on Catacomb Kids

199
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,640
and it was undergoing a major rewrite

200
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,882
because, you know, solo indie game dev,

201
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,123
I like redoing things.

202
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:30,846
And at the time, I was playing quite a bit of Ivan.

203
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:34,447
which is sort of a comedic traditional roguelike.

204
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,068
It's got this weird banana theme going on.

205
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:37,749
It doesn't take itself very seriously at all.

206
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:39,289
But I was really taken by the health

207
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:40,170
and damage system in the game.

208
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,511
So this is a screenshot of the game.

209
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:44,311
It's like, you know, looks like a roguelike.

210
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:46,172
It's got the tiles and the description at the bottom.

211
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:48,113
And over at the side, you can see all your stats.

212
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:51,314
And up at the top, there's like a little representation

213
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:51,894
of your character.

214
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:55,596
And in Ivan, the player's body is separated

215
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:56,757
into seven different areas.

216
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:59,838
Head, body, groin, left and right arm,

217
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:00,658
left and right leg.

218
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,056
each of which has its own pool of HP.

219
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:05,738
And alongside this is a more, you know,

220
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:07,880
common abstracted health system where you die

221
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,222
if your total HP reaches zero,

222
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,926
but each limb, like if your arm reaches zero health,

223
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,187
it'll get cut off.

224
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,028
If your legs, you can get your legs cut off

225
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,090
and if your body takes too much damage,

226
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,972
then you'll die regardless of what your total

227
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,333
remaining health pool is.

228
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:25,976
Same with your head and your groin.

229
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:32,171
Now, it's not like I hadn't played games with locational damage before, where you could cripple enemies

230
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:35,194
and blast off their arms and legs and heads, but there are very few

231
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,858
where I, as a human character, could undergo those same traumas.

232
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,724
The meat feel wasn't relegated only to enemies, but was applied to myself as well in Ivan.

233
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,828
And it was important for me to see that the player isn't

234
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,611
represented as a robot or a mech or anything else where it

235
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:53,412
would make sense.

236
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:55,073
Oh, yeah, you get your arm blown off.

237
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,575
You can just get a new one attached.

238
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:05,261
Like, they're represented as a human character, a person that

239
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,182
can be destroyed bit by bit or all at once.

240
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,211
But like I said, the game's got a comedic vibe to it.

241
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,332
It's not realistic at all.

242
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:13,353
You don't have to worry about bleeding out or going

243
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:14,194
into shock or anything.

244
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:16,395
You can get your arm lopped off and you're like, uh-oh,

245
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,457
I should get away from whatever made that happen.

246
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:21,419
And it obviously lacks the complexities

247
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,981
of trying to accurately represent the whole spectrum

248
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:24,821
of human vitality.

249
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:26,282
And it doesn't try to.

250
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:27,003
It's simple.

251
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,265
So here we have another way of representing humans

252
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:33,487
as meat in games, which is a step above abstraction,

253
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:34,468
which is by simplifying.

254
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:41,144
Simplification acknowledges that humans are more than just a hitbox, that we can be damaged

255
00:12:41,184 --> 00:12:47,246
in many ways and that we have more at stake than restarting a checkpoint or loading your

256
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:47,886
last save.

257
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,367
The cost now is change.

258
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,489
Fighting and failing, but surviving and emerging different.

259
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:58,950
Playing Ivan, maybe I still wasn't controlling anything quite resembling a human totally,

260
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,792
but it was far less abstract and it acknowledged what humanity was.

261
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:04,192
And I liked it.

262
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:07,964
so i did what i tend to do when i see something that i like

263
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:10,187
i stole it and stuffed it into my game

264
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:15,633
so this is a character in catacomb kids when you pause the menu you get this

265
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:17,214
little view of your stats and your

266
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:18,856
portrait of your character

267
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:20,318
and uh...

268
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:22,060
this is what they look like when they're

269
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,021
missing a leg

270
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:27,154
So I added a limb system to Catacomb Kids where you can get

271
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,155
your arms and legs chopped off by certain traps and enemies.

272
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:32,956
And it's nothing as in-depth as Ivan's where it's like, oh,

273
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:36,157
you don't have to worry about the HP of your arm or your

274
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:39,118
torso getting critical hitted and just destroying everything.

275
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:42,639
But if you're fighting a guy with a giant axe, you might

276
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,560
want to make sure you don't come out of the fight with

277
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,320
two fewer legs.

278
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:50,216
And there's also a boss in the game called the Reaper, which

279
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:53,739
is like, you know, death with a giant scythe. And it used to

280
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:56,901
have a really annoying habit of chopping off all your arms and

281
00:13:56,941 --> 00:14:01,743
legs and then killing you by hitting you with them. But that

282
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:04,445
was kind of unfair, so now he just chops off your arms and

283
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:08,548
turns them into lightning. Again, I'm not really making a

284
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,768
masterpiece of realism.

285
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:13,640
But after adding the ability to lose limbs,

286
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,721
something happened where there was a new fear in the game,

287
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:16,802
a new consequence,

288
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:18,743
and like a new complication to be thrown at the player.

289
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:23,006
Where before your only goal in each fight was to not die,

290
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:26,728
now there's a whole new potential cost, even upon victory.

291
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:29,830
And moreover, the cost is both meaningful and lasting.

292
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:31,191
It changes you.

293
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:36,715
Losing an arm removes your ability to equip offhand items and if you're a shield user that can really screw you up

294
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:40,077
because now you have to change the entire way you play the game.

295
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,558
You have to become more evasive now that you're not able to block attacks.

296
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:47,500
Losing legs is even worse where you're forced to hop everywhere on your remaining leg

297
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,841
or if you lose both legs you hop on your torso stump.

298
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:54,343
But it completely changes the feel of movement in the game

299
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:57,744
and makes a lot of maneuvers more difficult to pull off.

300
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,605
And it's super annoying.

301
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,962
probably not as bad as reversing the player's controls,

302
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,866
but maybe a couple notches below that.

303
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,468
By introducing these lasting consequences

304
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:10,771
to player's actions, choices begin to have more weight.

305
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:13,274
Decisions become more meaningful

306
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:15,116
and the prices paid are more potent.

307
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,237
So even looking at the system and realizing its simplicity,

308
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:21,218
that it exists at all,

309
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:23,598
adds a sense of meatiness to the player's failures.

310
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:25,799
And really this is the core of what simplification,

311
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,080
really this is the core of what simplification is

312
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,281
when representing human physicality in games.

313
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,081
An acknowledgement that we're meat.

314
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,230
We're not monolithic beings, but we break and we change.

315
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,791
But that's it, just an acknowledgement.

316
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:42,113
And this is usually as far as games go when representing

317
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:42,813
humans in games.

318
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,274
I mean, how can it not be?

319
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:49,197
We're not going to get a simulation level of breaking

320
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:50,558
the skin, that sort of thing.

321
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:54,320
Games will always only ever be able to present an extremely

322
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,381
simplified version of humans as physical creatures.

323
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:58,382
We're too complex.

324
00:15:58,642 --> 00:15:59,723
You've got to draw the line somewhere.

325
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,499
Dwarves, however, maybe we can get a little further with them.

326
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,122
So Dwarf Fortress is the only real example that comes to mind of a game

327
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:10,865
going well beyond a simplified representation of meat.

328
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,728
Another game descended from the roguelike evolutionary tree,

329
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,771
Dwarf Fortress does away with abstraction almost entirely

330
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:19,573
and enters into the realm of simulation.

331
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,706
Not only can your arms and legs be broken and severed as in Catacomb Kids and Ivan,

332
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:29,992
but you can get your brain bruised, your lungs can be pierced, you can have items lodged

333
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:34,196
in your flesh and there are pain values associated with certain types of injuries.

334
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:38,600
If your heart is punctured, you don't die because your HP reaches zero, you die because

335
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,403
your blood loss becomes too great to sustain your life any further.

336
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:45,507
If you'll indulge me, a quote from the Dwarf Fortress wiki page.

337
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:50,426
Guts. Damage to guts causes great pain and nausea. Creatures

338
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:52,627
will vomit and then retch repeatedly depending on how much

339
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:56,048
damage is caused. This slows the creature and can dehydrate them.

340
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,990
When guts are pierced, they may spill out of the wound. This

341
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,591
causes a lot of bleeding and exposes the guts themselves as a

342
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:05,652
target for aimed attacks. Slicing off the exposed guts

343
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:10,614
causes heavy bleeding and almost always death. The cut off guts

344
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:12,215
can then be picked up and used as a weapon.

345
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:22,575
So simulation goes above and beyond the expected representation of human physicality in games.

346
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:26,696
It strives to do more than just enhance a sense of meatiness, more than just present

347
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:30,656
for fragility and resilience, but it unifies your character with the laws of the world

348
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:31,157
they inhabit.

349
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:34,517
The line is blurred between what's a part of them and what's a part of the world.

350
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:37,338
Where does the self stop and the laws of the wider universe take over?

351
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:38,798
There is no line.

352
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:39,579
They're the same.

353
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:43,540
They're not only in the world, but held together by it and torn apart by it, and then they

354
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:43,940
become it.

355
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:46,356
So this is what simulation means to me.

356
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:49,038
Employing the nuances of our physical existence

357
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:51,480
to blur the line between the player characters

358
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,421
and the worlds they inhabit.

359
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,684
They're both existing within the world

360
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,026
and are a world unto themselves.

361
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,343
So abstraction, simplification, and simulation.

362
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:05,585
Each of these categories can and does mix and mingle

363
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:08,266
with the others to greater and lesser degrees.

364
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:11,027
Games with largely abstract health systems

365
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:12,988
supplemented by a suggestion of hit location

366
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:14,769
like a lot of first person shooters have

367
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:18,111
with headshots and other sort of tertiary damage.

368
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:21,012
Or games where the player is represented

369
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:23,534
as a breakable being, a mutable collection of parts

370
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:26,195
working alongside a more familiar abstract system

371
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,055
like with Catacomb Kids.

372
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:30,174
And games like The Long Dark and other recent survival sims

373
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,615
that skew towards the simulation side of simplicity.

374
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:35,156
Or Cataclysm, Dark Days Ahead, which is another roguelike,

375
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,936
which straddles the line between simplicity

376
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:37,916
and simulation altogether,

377
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:39,957
while still having some abstracted aspects.

378
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:41,918
Nothing is ever as cut and dry as just,

379
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,678
oh, that's simulation, or oh, that's simplistic,

380
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,759
or oh, that's abstract.

381
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,721
And so, like, this is some of, I tried to map some,

382
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:52,721
I don't know if they're accurate.

383
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:54,581
But.

384
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:58,829
So far, while I've mostly been talking about how damage is sustained in games,

385
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,932
there's a whole other side to this equation.

386
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:02,573
The aftermath.

387
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:04,375
How we heal, how we adapt.

388
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:07,378
Once the damage is done and the danger is passed, what then?

389
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,512
Well, there's an old saying that time heals all wounds,

390
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:12,834
but rarely is the sentiment ever present in games.

391
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:14,635
You're always looking for a med kit,

392
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,036
or popping a healing potion,

393
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,517
or like calling a cleric to heal you.

394
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:19,879
And Catacomb Kids is guilty of this as well.

395
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,960
Restoring your severed limbs is as simple

396
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:24,082
as just drinking a potion of regeneration

397
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:26,104
or casting the regenerate spell on yourself,

398
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:27,144
if you know it.

399
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:30,167
And your limbs come back a bit weaker

400
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,388
than your original limbs and blue,

401
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:34,890
but they serve the, you know,

402
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,331
the new limbs serve the purpose well enough.

403
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:39,262
If you become diseased or poisoned, a health potion will

404
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:40,122
make you right in an instant.

405
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:41,623
It's all very active healing.

406
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,423
So this is what active healing is.

407
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:45,424
Do thing, get better.

408
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:48,445
But rarely is there waiting.

409
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:52,367
I mean, maybe there's a little animation for drinking a

410
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,708
potion, or you might have to sit still for a second while

411
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:56,728
your shields recharge.

412
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:02,050
But beyond that, recovery is usually a matter of fairly low

413
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,711
consequence.

414
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,371
It's always a good thing.

415
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:05,552
You want to recover.

416
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:06,272
You want to heal.

417
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:10,749
In many roguelikes, you can sit still and spend a few turns

418
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,111
sort of waiting for your health to replenish.

419
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:16,615
But the games are usually already so abstract that this

420
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:18,337
doesn't really do a lot in the way of

421
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:19,738
representing a human need.

422
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,761
It's just more of like a mechanical thing where, oh, if

423
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:23,142
you stand still, your health will go up.

424
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:25,485
It's just like barely on the cusp of

425
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:26,546
simplicity and abstraction.

426
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:31,605
but there's no like cleaning your wounds and bandaging them, there's no uh... like

427
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,768
keeping the bed as you wait for the poison in you to run its course

428
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:37,130
there's no actually going to a hospital

429
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,094
not a haunted hospital full of like demons and stuff, just a normal

430
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:43,234
functioning hospital

431
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:47,918
I don't know, those seem kind of rare to me in games for some reason

432
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:53,137
Somehow games always seem to have medicine that makes time irrelevant.

433
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:57,140
And I get it. Don't think I'm suggesting that in shoot-em-ups

434
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,443
and shooters you should have a long hospital stay

435
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,386
after every gunfight where you're just sitting around playing crossword puzzles

436
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:06,306
and coding.

437
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:08,728
I mean, maybe that would be interesting.

438
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,371
But for the time cost of injury

439
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:17,514
to be so ubiquitously absent in games is a curious thing.

440
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,567
And it's not like there haven't been time-sensitive games before.

441
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:23,428
There's like Shenmue, Majora's Mask, and Harvest Moon games.

442
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,348
These all, like, run on a clock.

443
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:29,289
So, like, maybe in Harvest Moon you could, like, get kicked in the head by your horse

444
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:30,749
and then, like, get knocked out.

445
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:34,590
And then you, like, spend a week in the hospital waiting to recover

446
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,990
and during that time your crops aren't getting taken care of

447
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,891
and your horse is, like, really sad

448
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:41,871
because he's like, I'm sorry, guy. I didn't mean to kick you.

449
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:48,098
But it would cost the most valuable time,

450
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:50,220
the most valuable resource that you have in the game,

451
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,641
or that we have as existing beings, which is time.

452
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:56,923
Your crops won't wait, like Majora's Mask,

453
00:21:57,103 --> 00:21:58,044
the falling moon wouldn't wait

454
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,905
if you lost time as a failure.

455
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,626
And in Shenmue, you'd lose time

456
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:06,188
and then you'd be closer to not getting revenge.

457
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:09,170
And a lot of things can happen

458
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,451
in the absence of a person's unwellness.

459
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:13,632
And then there's coping.

460
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,865
Accepting that whatever injuries you've sustained, whatever scars you've received,

461
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:22,167
they're just a part of you now. You adapt and recalibrate and learn to move forward

462
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:27,490
through your new normal. Old familiar obstacles become new challenges. Maybe you learn to overcome

463
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:33,193
them again, or with some ingenuity or a different approach, or maybe you don't and find a different

464
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,493
new path to take.

465
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:40,596
But humans, I think, are incredible.

466
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:43,178
And maybe I'm the only one, but I'm constantly amazed

467
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:45,801
by the fact that we live for as long as we do,

468
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:47,682
despite all the million little random things

469
00:22:47,722 --> 00:22:49,644
that could go wrong every second.

470
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:53,687
And we're still tenacious enough to keep existing as meat.

471
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,911
I look at us and I feel like the aliens feel

472
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:59,592
from Terry Bisson's story.

473
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:01,234
Like, we're made out of meat?

474
00:23:01,354 --> 00:23:01,794
Like, really?

475
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,096
And look what the things that we can do.

476
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:09,638
And games. Games are, as I have mentioned, pretty cool. I like them.

477
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:17,264
And I feel like they're able to give us a unique perspective and let us act as through the mind and body of another.

478
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:24,390
And in doing so, perhaps, let us come to a better understanding of some meat that isn't us, some person that isn't us.

479
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:31,476
And so I've been speaking until now of people as meat, our parts as physical qualities on the most general scale.

480
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:35,970
because that does interest me and I do find it fascinating. I want to play more games where I'm

481
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,952
fearful and breakable and forced to live with the consequences of my failures and shortcomings

482
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,294
but still somehow continue and grow beyond them. I want to play a game where I'm parts and I am

483
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:51,697
fragile and I am resilient. But obviously people are more than me. People are hopes and loves

484
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,179
and hates, hurts, friends, memories.

485
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:56,524
Not every story starts with all 100...

486
00:23:56,784 --> 00:23:57,965
or not all...

487
00:23:58,245 --> 00:24:01,848
Not every story starts with all 206 bones and 640 muscles.

488
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:05,231
And not every story starts young and free of prior consequence.

489
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:07,573
And not every story starts with Bruce Willis.

490
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:10,235
And so this is the other thing that I want from games

491
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,137
is I want to know these stories.

492
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:16,901
I want to see these... the different types of bodies represented in games.

493
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:17,561
And...

494
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,243
It's like for all our glorious shape...

495
00:24:20,323 --> 00:24:23,566
and all the glorious shapes and sizes and ages and meatness.

496
00:24:24,722 --> 00:24:29,627
And I've been Bruce Willis in games many times, but I've never been you.

497
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:32,730
And that's the end.

498
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:45,383
APPLAUSE

499
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:46,464
Should I leave, or...?

500
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:47,865
LAUGHTER

501
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:50,587
Oh, questions?

502
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:51,327
If anybody?

503
00:24:52,227 --> 00:24:53,608
Yeah, microphones, if microphones,

504
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:55,529
if people want to ask things, hello.

505
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:56,909
Okay.

506
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:12,154
Hi.

507
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:15,175
It's really loud, okay.

508
00:25:15,195 --> 00:25:15,215
I...

509
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:20,940
This was actually going through my head the other day about the

510
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,884
concept of how damage and how people take it in video games

511
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:30,868
works. And I was thinking about a few games that have been time

512
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,431
sensitive to those kinds of things like XCOM. You get hurt

513
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:37,814
enough, they're gone for like weeks while everything is going

514
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:41,717
down on earth. So I was wondering, do you think there

515
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:46,301
will be a higher demand at some point in time for games to

516
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:47,422
represent more?

517
00:25:49,905 --> 00:25:52,526
risky mechanics when it comes to health or is that always going

518
00:25:52,546 --> 00:25:58,190
to be a niche thing? I don't know. I feel like it's on the

519
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,893
rise, especially in game, like survival games that have been

520
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:06,195
coming out like Rust and all these things that are like, oh,

521
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:08,477
you know, you've got to go out and make your way and survive

522
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:12,459
and those sorts of games where it's becoming more common for

523
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,422
I guess human effort to be introduced into the equation

524
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,563
where it's like you make things,

525
00:26:18,663 --> 00:26:21,144
but I still feel like the actual representation

526
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,026
of the physical health of characters

527
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:27,529
is, might continue being niche.

528
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:29,450
I'm not sure.

529
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,791
I hope it becomes a more common thing

530
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,672
because I want to play these games.

531
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:35,120
Yeah, I specifically remember someone talking about that on

532
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,403
the forum, mistake number one on my part, when they mentioned,

533
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:44,746
I suggested that a certain game should be a little more

534
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:46,968
realistic in how you take the images, just because I thought

535
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:47,548
it was interesting.

536
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:51,411
And they rebutted with, well, then I got to sit through, I

537
00:26:51,431 --> 00:26:53,932
don't know, a loading screen for this long, or just wait

538
00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:54,913
for my character to get up.

539
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,894
It's not going to, you know.

540
00:26:57,835 --> 00:26:59,076
I feel like there are.

541
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:06,084
I can't really speak to every game because every game is different, you know, but I feel like there are ways of making

542
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:08,244
these things still engaging

543
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:10,325
without necessarily making them

544
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:15,846
easy and just like, oh, you know, oh, I got hit and now I'm just like running away until I recover

545
00:27:16,506 --> 00:27:18,447
like five seconds later or however long.

546
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:23,128
I'm not sure how that would work with every game. In Catacomb Kids it was fairly easy

547
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:27,009
because it's kind of a cartoony game. It's like, oh, I got my leg chopped off, I can just hop

548
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:29,570
on my other leg forever.

549
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:35,411
don't get tired. But for more realistic games that would be a

550
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:38,152
problem they would have to solve in the design phase.

551
00:27:42,113 --> 00:27:50,195
So first thing, I would point out die hard. Nintendo

552
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:52,536
entertainment system there was a separate meter for Bruce

553
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:53,256
Willis' feet.

554
00:27:56,197 --> 00:28:01,225
So you are not exactly out Bruce Willis. Second thing I

555
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:06,674
wanted to ask, do you think there is a kind of point of

556
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:08,457
diminishing returns on

557
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,531
how representative you should be of people's meekness in a game?

558
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,932
Do you think that there's a point where it goes too far?

559
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:20,493
If so, where would you draw the line?

560
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,274
What factors would you take into consideration

561
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:25,814
to where a specific game should draw the line?

562
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:28,555
I guess I should ask, since it's kind of a case-by-case thing.

563
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:31,016
Yeah, I mean, this is again a matter of a game...

564
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:40,295
I feel like you could probably make an entire game that revolves around the concept of a

565
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:43,439
guy making his way through the woods with a broken leg.

566
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,984
You could probably make a game with that at its core.

567
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:50,346
So really it depends on what you're aiming to do in the game.

568
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:52,407
Like if you're making a game that's like an adventure game

569
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:55,029
and you want to be having like an actiony time

570
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,450
and you're like trying to have fun,

571
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,271
then of course the, you know, your limits

572
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:01,273
as far as that space would be different

573
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:03,754
from a game where you're trying to like accurately represent

574
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:06,676
someone's survival or a game where you know,

575
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:09,258
you're just like running through arcadey stuff

576
00:29:09,318 --> 00:29:11,319
and just like, oh, I'm like, you know,

577
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,820
I'm like losing bits left and right

578
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,201
and then getting them back and that sort of thing.

579
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:19,465
I can't really say that there would be a hard line.

580
00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:22,750
It depends on what you're doing and what your intention is

581
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,814
with the implementation of increased meatness.

582
00:29:26,615 --> 00:29:27,336
Fair enough, thank you.

583
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:37,170
Hello. So once upon a time I saw you tweeting about random

584
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:41,113
catacomb kids lore bits that don't necessarily exist in the

585
00:29:41,153 --> 00:29:44,355
game yet. And something that I was really taken with is the

586
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,778
fact that the grumbles, the goblin-like creatures in the

587
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:53,502
game overwhelmingly commonly give birth to twins. And most

588
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:57,224
grumbles are twins. And the ones who aren't are trained to be

589
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:57,705
assassins.

590
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:03,968
I think that's really cool and that's an aspect of meat that you don't see a lot in video games, right?

591
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:10,172
It's like a representation of birth. It's like fertility, all that stuff.

592
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:16,135
And I guess my question is, what are some qualities of these?

593
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:24,185
bits of meat flavor that you can insert in a game because to some degree like actually

594
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:26,610
portraying grumbles as uh...

595
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:33,606
you know, creatures that can be pregnant and that eventually give birth to twins might

596
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:39,048
not be the most elegant way to go about that in an actual game sense.

597
00:30:39,408 --> 00:30:41,669
I'm not sure I understand the question.

598
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:47,990
Yeah, so I like that a tweet told me about this fact of the game, but I'm not sure where

599
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,951
in the game I would be able to glean this fact.

600
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:55,053
In what way would this thing make it into the game?

601
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:58,864
probably just like reading the lore once I add it.

602
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:00,345
Oh, okay.

603
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,725
I was just wondering if there was some sort of

604
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:03,206
mechanical way that you had.

605
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:05,566
I mean, if it were a mechanical thing,

606
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:07,307
it might just be like grumbles coming in pairs

607
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:07,987
or something like that.

608
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:09,288
I haven't, I gotta get there.

609
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:10,448
That seems fine.

610
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:10,948
I just thought that.

611
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:11,868
That's the end of my time.

612
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:12,068
So.

613
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:12,429
Thank you.

614
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:12,989
Thank you.

615
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:13,229
Thank you.
