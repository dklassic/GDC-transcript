Hi!

2
00:00:01,511 --> 00:00:05,835
Merge Dragons is this game that came from seemingly out of nowhere to define its own

3
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:11,339
genre with this strange mashup of puzzle-like gameplay, little simulated creatures, and

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,060
building up a camp.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,723
And then it takes this concept of merging and jams it very intentionally directly into

6
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:17,244
the game world.

7
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:19,105
What's up with that?

8
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:22,928
In this session, we'll answer, what's up with that?

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,170
Where did Merge Dragons come from?

10
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:31,015
And then we'll look at some of the design philosophies that helped shape it into the unique and wonderful experience that it is.

11
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:36,238
From how we think about merging everything, to why the design team worships discovery,

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,941
to the idea that merge dragons should actually be more of an activity than it is a game, and why.

13
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:46,244
And since it's free to play, we'll also talk a bit about how the game makes money,

14
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:48,545
including one balancing adjustment we made.

15
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:53,379
Which was pretty simple, but that fundamentally changed how players consume the game,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,582
and in effect rocketed it from mere failure to great financial success.

17
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:03,945
And that for me as a designer was both astounding and somewhat unnerving.

18
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:10,329
So we'll talk about all that and plenty more, but my main goal for the session is for you to leave inspired.

19
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,311
If by the end you are inspired to think about design in new ways,

20
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:17,513
and you're even more inspired than you already are to make fantastic games,

21
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:19,411
Then the talk has succeeded.

22
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,695
So I hope to see you there.

23
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:24,099
It's Friday, 10 AM.

24
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:25,502
Bring your friends.

25
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:26,564
Let's pack the room.

26
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:27,345
It'll be great.
