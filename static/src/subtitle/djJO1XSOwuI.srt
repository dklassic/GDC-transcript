00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:10,905
Hi, welcome to the Classic Game Postmortem for Star Wars Galaxies.

2
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:15,329
I'm Raph Koster and I was the original creative director on the game.

3
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:19,772
And I'm Rich Fogle and I was the executive producer on the game.

4
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:23,696
We're going to take you through the story of a game that maybe was a bit

5
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:28,920
unlikely to end up getting a classic game postmortem, but here we go.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,924
We're going to start out with some of the early days, the prehistory of the game.

7
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:37,073
and how it got launched and started.

8
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:38,794
So Rich, why don't you talk about that for a bit?

9
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:44,356
Yeah, so the original team who started on Star Wars Galaxies

10
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:48,237
was really working on privateer online and origin systems.

11
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:53,959
And we, at that time, Origin was working on a couple of MMOs.

12
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:57,240
And one of them we figured would be great to take the Wing

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,521
Commander franchise and do privateer online,

14
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:01,842
in which we started on and worked on for about a year

15
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,182
and a half to almost two years.

16
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:07,797
did a great demo, a great actually first playable

17
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:10,039
of what Privateer Online was all about.

18
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,601
And then Origin canceled it.

19
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:17,024
About that time, Richard Garriott was also

20
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:18,625
no longer employed.

21
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,247
And I actually had to call Raf on the phone in Australia

22
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,189
to tell him what was going on

23
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,071
because he's actually over there

24
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,473
doing some UO promotions at the time.

25
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,034
And so it was a very interesting,

26
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:31,696
tumultuous time at Origin.

27
00:01:32,152 --> 00:01:35,934
And so at that time when we canceled the game,

28
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:38,535
well, we just started to look around

29
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:40,976
and we found a landing place at Barron

30
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,097
and the rest is history.

31
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:46,499
We formed the Austin Studio for Barron.

32
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:53,942
And one of the great things about it is

33
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,093
when we started working there, we didn't realize they were, we knew they had the Star Wars license,

34
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:03,836
but we didn't know that we're already working on the game. So when we got there and went up to San

35
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:12,141
Diego, we found out that they actually were working on the Star Wars game and had some things to show.

36
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:16,344
But one of the concepts was it was actually they're working on EQ2 at the same time,

37
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,366
and they wanted to share the technology and engine.

38
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:25,883
And so when we looked at it, we started to review it and see where they were on the project.

39
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:31,505
And we found that really, based on our opinion, there wasn't really much that we could use at that time.

40
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:38,147
And we felt like the engine wouldn't get us to what we really wanted to be and do in the time frame we had to do it in.

41
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:46,190
So next slide. So we started on the first thing we did is kind of like get our feet wet and get a feel for Star Wars.

42
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,550
And we love Wing vs. TIE.

43
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:53,098
And so we all kind of, we didn't have an office space at that time, there were about 12 of us.

44
00:02:53,098 --> 00:03:03,626
And so we started working at J. Allen Brax, who was at that time an associate producer for us.

45
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:08,850
And he lent us their house, his house, and we started working on Wing vs. Tai game.

46
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,014
And we actually put it together in about six weeks, a first playable.

47
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:32,182
It was so impressive that LucasArts decided, even though we haven't started on the game officially yet, that they would love to us to sign up for an expansion, and that would be actually a JTL, Jump to Lightspeed, actually came out of this prototype that we did.

48
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,951
for the Star Wars game that we started working on.

49
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:39,553
And we actually was able to get some of our previous technology

50
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,334
that another group was working on that we purchased.

51
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:45,976
So we get a little leg up on the client, but it was actually a pretty fun game

52
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,297
that we started there at J.

53
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:52,060
Allen Braxhouse. Next. And.

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,201
When we went up to San Diego, like I said before,

55
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,923
there was a team up there working on it, we decided that, you know, let's.

56
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,570
Let's look at this and let's break the development up.

57
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,531
So we took the good.

58
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:06,293
They had a really good, strong art team on it.

59
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:09,034
And we said, let's keep that strong art team on it

60
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:11,515
because they've done a lot already.

61
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:14,936
And let's form the tech team from Austin.

62
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:18,798
And we decided to do it in both locations, both Austin

63
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,259
and San Diego, to build this game.

64
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,461
There were lots of cultural challenges for that that we had to deal with.

65
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,422
And that's something we can go into a little later.

66
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:39,232
One of the biggest things that they wanted us to do before we started was to make sure that was not going to cannibalize EverQuest.

67
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:50,798
So they wanted to make sure it was differentiated enough that no way anybody would probably go for EverQuest to playing Star Wars, or if they did, it would be a very small group of people.

68
00:04:50,798 --> 00:05:00,203
And so we had a great background with Ultima Online on a skill based system where basically EverQuest was a Dooku mod, which was level based, class based type system.

69
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:05,206
and we weren't going to build that and we were actually going to use the template very similar

70
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:09,750
to what actually all the Warcraft used and we decided no we're actually going to do something

71
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,234
totally different and separate ourselves immediately from EverQuest. Next slide.

72
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:21,258
Take it from there. Yeah then came time to actually start making the game and the very

73
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:25,101
first thing that we ran into of course was what do we do about Jedi?

74
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:33,294
The game was set during the classic trilogy time period, in between the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

75
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:39,177
And the challenge with that is that Jedi in that time period are supposed to be incredibly rare.

76
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:43,138
They are incredibly powerful compared to everybody else.

77
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:47,100
But of course, if you put them in a game, then everybody will want to be one.

78
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,801
So we floated the idea. Could we make it so no players could be Jedi?

79
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,843
And we were told no, it was too important. Players needed to be Jedi.

80
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,920
we asked, could we change the time period to, let's say,

81
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,902
after Return of the Jedi, when, you know, thanks to Luke,

82
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:05,944
you know, there's more Jedi everywhere. We were told no, we couldn't do that.

83
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:09,366
Then there was a question, well, can we make them not be powerful?

84
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:13,168
And the answer to that was, well, that's not very Star Wars-y.

85
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:16,770
So we were stuck with this impossible dilemma where you needed to create an

86
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,912
Uber class that was somehow incredibly rare, even

87
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:23,714
though players had infinite time.

88
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,242
was in some ways almost the game's original sin

89
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:30,203
and something that ended up leading

90
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:32,124
to massive, massive problems later on.

91
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:35,626
We played around with the idea of having Jedi suffer

92
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:37,787
from permadeath when they lost,

93
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:40,248
but that was seen as also being kind of a challenge

94
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:41,449
with the audience.

95
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:44,371
So we settled on a system where players had to sample

96
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,332
a random set of the features in the game

97
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:48,433
and every player's set was different.

98
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,834
So hang on to that idea,

99
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,915
because it'll come back up later.

100
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:57,691
The game, you know, remember what it was like in 2003. We shipped on three CDs. We took up two

101
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:04,063
gigabytes of space. A cable connection today is thousands of times faster than the modems we were

102
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:04,744
designing for.

103
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:11,520
we were looking at making maps that were large, much larger than say Ultima Online or EverQuest.

104
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:20,044
You know, we were under a mandate to ship multiple planets, and so we ended up shipping actually

105
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:25,507
two and a half gigabytes worth of map data, and those maps are to scale, they're what you see.

106
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:31,495
And as you can see, that already exceeds the capacity of the CDs that we shipped on.

107
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:36,337
So we actually had to invent a whole bunch of fractal terrain technology in order to be able

108
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:44,940
to do this. What we did was we basically created a Photoshop-like tool that used layers where each

109
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,521
layer had procedural rules.

110
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:49,477
and these could be added on the fly.

111
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:53,319
And those 2 and 1 1 gigabytes worth of map data

112
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,042
ended up shrinking to about 30k per planet

113
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,283
as a plain old text file.

114
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:02,165
It was so much memory to store these maps

115
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:05,607
that we couldn't even afford to have the maps running

116
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:07,528
in full on the server.

117
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,850
We actually had to generate them as players

118
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,491
walked around on the server.

119
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:15,525
which actually led to massive issues with collision.

120
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:19,025
You know, you could shoot bolts through terrain that didn't exist,

121
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:22,966
all of that kind of thing. But it did unlock really, really cool

122
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:26,847
procedural placement of buildings at runtime while you were playing the game.

123
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:32,588
And the neat thing about this is this is actually

124
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:40,729
way before this technology in 2003 that we developed was way advanced

125
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,389
for its time.

126
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:47,890
You know, not, you haven't seen this until just recently, actually, this technology.

127
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,492
And so we had it then, and this is a great example.

128
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:54,074
This is kind of when we started with the terrain.

129
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:58,117
This is month one, and this is month four.

130
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:03,881
It is an amazing technology, and it allowed us not only to layer, like in Photoshop,

131
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:08,583
different aspects of the terrain, but we also are allowed to do, based on height map,

132
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,425
rivers flowing and things like that.

133
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:16,259
that was in the game as well. So very, some very, very cool technology that we are allowed to do.

134
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,420
Next slide.

135
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:24,465
Yeah, so of course, everything had to go through approval processes,

136
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:27,407
which slowed us down, right, a lot of extra dev work.

137
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:35,146
Exactly. And so basically I had to actually hire a producer just to handle the approval processes

138
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:41,809
for LucasArts and LucasFilm because not only did we have to go through LucasArts, our publisher,

139
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:46,672
we also had to go through LucasFilm to get them approved. And some things I had to go all the way

140
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:50,213
up to George Lucas himself to approve. We were lucky to have Hayden Blackman,

141
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:57,937
who is basically a walking encyclopedia of Star Wars knowledge over on the LucasArts side because

142
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:02,911
since he was, I forget his title, continuity coordinator, something like that,

143
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:07,155
on the Star Wars side, he was really able to do a lot of approving directly.

144
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:16,099
But the level of secrecy was over the top. We were being sent material from the movies that had not yet come out.

145
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:22,404
These were hand couriered on CDs, encrypted with every file name garbled.

146
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,407
The file extensions were changed so you couldn't double-click the file.

147
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:32,113
And there was a separate hand couriered paper copy of what file was what, so that you could find what you were looking for.

148
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,552
And this just led to really crazy development challenges.

149
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:40,337
Like you probably remember Mace Windu's purple lightsaber,

150
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:42,338
right, Samuel L. Jackson.

151
00:10:42,338 --> 00:10:44,380
We had designed a lightsaber system

152
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,042
that relied on different colored crystals.

153
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:49,365
And one day, the message comes down, nope,

154
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,546
all the lightsabers everywhere in Star Wars

155
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:54,369
are changing to only be red and blue.

156
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,731
We said, but we've gone and designed the system.

157
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:57,772
Nope, you've got to redo it all.

158
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:04,590
it turned out that that was just because George Lucas was editing this battle and he wanted the

159
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,734
two sides to be clearly different from one another. So a few weeks later we were told,

160
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:15,059
never mind you can put it all back, all the lightsaber colors can come back in, it's okay

161
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:27,088
again. So stuff like that was an ongoing development challenge as we went to go get approvals.

162
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:27,388
This is you Rich.

163
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:32,727
One of the things that we learned a lot about this, again, we used a layering system,

164
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:40,109
is we had to recreate these on Tatooine, Mos Eisley, and other areas, and they had to be

165
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:45,791
pretty much exact, because again, this was very much tied to the movie, so anything that

166
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,972
was shot in the movies, we had to actually replicate.

167
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:50,566
for approval into the game.

168
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,748
So it was a very tedious task of looking at.

169
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,150
We had pictures to look at for reference.

170
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,272
We had a huge library of reference material

171
00:11:58,272 --> 00:11:59,593
that we had to go through.

172
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,455
Hayden Blackman was also our guide for that as well,

173
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,197
because he was a subject matter expert that we used.

174
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:07,539
Not only was he our producer, but he was, as Raf said,

175
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:10,261
a subject matter expert on pretty much anything Star Wars.

176
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:14,744
It was great to have him there.

177
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:17,366
Yeah, we were pushing boundaries on a lot of things.

178
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:32,365
We put together a character customization system using morph targets that I think was the second video game ever to ship with something like this. The first was whichever Elder Scrolls game I remember.

179
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:38,537
being really upset that they beat us to market with it. And we supported just incredible levels

180
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:47,044
of character customization, including old and young, including really detailed things like

181
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:54,109
beards, makeup, tattoos, everything that people see today in character customization

182
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:58,232
in terms of modern AAA games, we were having to invent on the fly.

183
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,323
back then, because we were literally one of the very first games on Earth to do anything quite

184
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:10,589
like this, and to this level of detail, including things like depth of layered clothing, all of that.

185
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:17,334
And we ended up pushing it in directions pretty far, right?

186
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:22,619
And the reality is the character customization people look at Star Wars Galaxies as the,

187
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:27,583
really, the premier first one that really pushes the boundaries of that technology.

188
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:34,569
And we wanted to do that because we wanted to make sure everyone felt unique in the world,

189
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:41,411
and they could be what they wanted to be. We weren't limiting them to cookie cutter type

190
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:46,993
body types and faces and heads. And so that led to a lot of really cool customization in the game,

191
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:53,434
characters that you see running around. Yeah, it's funny because years later I actually met

192
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,235
J.K. Rowling and

193
00:13:55,657 --> 00:14:01,740
she was asking me, so hey, so in this game, can I be an overweight dancing Wookie?

194
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,763
So it kind of became a signature of the game, right, that people knew that it had that level

195
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:15,527
of personal expression in it. One of the nice things about Swig was it had a dynamic POI system

196
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:18,708
in the game. What that allowed us to do

197
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:25,573
is if you had a group of people walking around on Tatooine, for instance, you could have a dynamic

198
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:30,994
system like a spacecraft crash in front of you, someone run out and give you something, then

199
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:36,715
suddenly stormtroopers come over the horizon after you and shoot you for what you have. And you give

200
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:42,737
it to an NPC to get a reward once you tell them, she tells you to give it to this NPC in this town.

201
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:48,418
This was an amazing system. And it was also based on the level you were.

202
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,148
the level of your group or your party.

203
00:14:51,148 --> 00:14:53,109
Not only did dynamic system did that,

204
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:56,050
but it also allowed events to be done in the game,

205
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,610
where we had real-time people be able to run events

206
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,991
in real-time on all our servers, anytime,

207
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:01,131
anywhere within our structure.

208
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,711
So that was pretty cool.

209
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:04,472
Yeah, it also, of course, introduced

210
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:09,393
all kinds of challenges around changing the collision

211
00:15:09,393 --> 00:15:13,514
and the nav mesh on the fly and all the rest.

212
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:15,795
So it definitely gave us some headaches.

213
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:20,112
headaches was one of the big things, right? Because throughout

214
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:24,337
all of this, we were really consciously trying to create

215
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:27,602
sort of a next generation MMO, something that broke the

216
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:31,948
template of just levels and classes. So we tried doing too

217
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:33,089
many new things.

218
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,051
We had crafting on equal footing with combat.

219
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,152
We had hairdressing in the game.

220
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:41,494
You know, 612 individual skill boxes.

221
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:44,036
We even modeled PTSD.

222
00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:47,057
If you got hurt a whole bunch while you were out in combat,

223
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,599
you had to come back and hang out in a bar

224
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:52,340
and listen to musicians and watch dancers

225
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,601
and that kind of thing.

226
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:56,622
And people definitely made fun of us for that, right?

227
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:01,965
Like it introduced a level of both tedium

228
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:02,606
and also...

229
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:11,335
kind of social contact that was sort of different from other games, right? So we were really

230
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:18,922
pushing boundaries all over the place in a bunch of different directions. A great example of that

231
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:24,387
was actually with the economy, which to this day is one of the main things that people talk about

232
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:29,592
with Star Wars Galaxies. We didn't set the price of any goods in the game. Players set all of the

233
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:30,052
prices.

234
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,657
They harvested materials from the environment and these materials actually

235
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:39,626
appeared and disappeared and generated with different stats all the time.

236
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:45,916
which caused huge database problems, because not only were those stats different, but then anything

237
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:50,960
you made from them also came out with different stats, and it had four digits of precision. So

238
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,186
a few years later, there were literally billions of resource items, billions of types of materials

239
00:16:57,186 --> 00:17:03,011
in the database, and enormous database bloat and performance problems. And many of those,

240
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:06,154
there was one unit left of that resource in the entire galaxy.

241
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:12,947
everything was supposed to break. Everything was crafted by players. This meant that when

242
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:18,889
the game started, they had to bootstrap up the economy from nothing. And it was really a very

243
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:24,911
complex system. If you go hang out on Reddit today and threads start about, hey, what's the

244
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:30,454
greatest crafting system of all time? A lot of players mentioned Galaxies because of this level

245
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:35,516
of depth. But boy, did it cause problems with the database. It really did.

246
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:53,086
So we've gone and built all of this technology, but can we actually ship the game, right?

247
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:55,688
The answer was no. No, we couldn't.

248
00:17:55,688 --> 00:18:02,192
So the timeline that you see here is we started in 2000, and you can see how we went to E3 in 2001

249
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:04,934
and showed off a demo of the game at E3, which won

250
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:10,195
many awards, including almost a game best of show.

251
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:13,917
We lost it by one.

252
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,738
We did get PC best of show, I think it was.

253
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:16,899
What's that?

254
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:18,380
I think we got PC best of show.

255
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,981
We did get PC best of show.

256
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:20,921
Not game of show overall.

257
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:24,703
Right, and then we got the onliner game of show as well.

258
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,626
But we made a lot of promises here when we showed it off.

259
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:30,787
We also showed off the Krayt Dragon

260
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:33,168
as you came around the corner the first time

261
00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:35,650
you ever seen it in the Star Wars game.

262
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:40,497
And we could see how our tools were progressing

263
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:42,999
and where we are when we opened up the game.

264
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,461
We literally had people running around and just texting

265
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:47,683
with text bubbles when we first opened up.

266
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:50,024
We didn't have much anything working.

267
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:53,327
Now, I think it was very fortunate that we decided,

268
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:54,748
when we originally did this game,

269
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:56,750
we knew we didn't have a lot of time

270
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,732
to build this game, a very short time frame.

271
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:03,115
So we knew that we had to do a procedural type

272
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:06,358
of systematic type of game.

273
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:11,193
game design and not everything handcrafted.

274
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,395
So we didn't want to get into a handcrafted treadmill

275
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:16,817
when we released the game.

276
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:20,000
So doing that means that we had a huge

277
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,281
open world sandbox game, luckily.

278
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:25,544
But we didn't have much content, I'd call it,

279
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:28,386
in the game to really hold the players

280
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:31,329
for a very, very long time because our tools,

281
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:33,650
our content tool pipeline, as you can see

282
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,972
in the two dots at the end,

283
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:40,429
came very close to each other before we launched. We had no choice. The launch was set. We were not

284
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:45,975
going to move that date. They only gave us another month. That was it. We asked for six.

285
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:53,001
That wasn't going to happen. We actually even had to bring up 60 people to help us

286
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:59,026
to try to get the content done. But it was very much a hopeless case. We knew when we launched

287
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:01,709
this game that we would be running behind.

288
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:06,416
and having to really play catch up in terms of getting the content out and fixing the bugs in the game.

289
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:12,559
Yeah, so this meant there we are running off on the end.

290
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,560
We've gotten an extra month, we have no real quests.

291
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,861
I think there's one quest chain in the entire game.

292
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:20,482
There is no quest system.

293
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:24,804
So we just had to randomly generate missions from mission terminals,

294
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:28,946
not even from NPCs, because we couldn't afford to write dialogue for NPCs.

295
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:32,167
So it was just mission terminals.

296
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:38,110
Worst of all, we ran out of time to implement all of that tracking for becoming a Jedi,

297
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:43,533
and we had to change the system. Instead of a random subset of all the activities in the game,

298
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:50,718
every player had an invisible list of five skills out of the 612 that they needed to learn,

299
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:57,462
and that was how they were going to unlock Jedi. That was a very fateful decision made at the end

300
00:20:57,462 --> 00:21:02,485
of a, you know, 14 or 16 hour long crunch day that proved to have really bad repercussions later.

301
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:08,821
we had planned to have things like player-granted missions, and we were cutting whole skill trees

302
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:14,125
at this point because we were just really desperate for time. We knew we were running out

303
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:23,231
of it. And this entire time, of course, we had been talking with the community about what we

304
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:29,314
were making. And so one of the things that I had a lot of experience on in Mertain 59, and then went

305
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:31,736
to UO and work with Raph on UO, is

306
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:35,009
how to build community and how to talk to community

307
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,031
and how important that was in an online game.

308
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:40,693
So I took a lot of lessons I learned there

309
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:42,374
and I saw the way this was happening.

310
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:45,476
So I got the community involved in this game right away.

311
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:52,637
And so about six months after launch, we formed a special Jedi Council of key players that we felt

312
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:58,421
like in the community, invited them over to our offices, we paid for everything, and to come in

313
00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:06,246
and be our council and help us, guide us to what the players really want to do. And this concept

314
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:11,670
was never done before in an online game. And so this council and how we interacted with the community

315
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:18,341
was really very important to us because we realized that we had a very rabid fan base.

316
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:23,645
We wanted to make sure that we knew the way the game was launched. We knew it was buggy.

317
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:28,909
We were going to do everything we can to fix it to help. We basically helped with engagement.

318
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:34,554
And the Jedi Council's job was to help us to figure out how to triage what to do next to

319
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:39,318
get this game into the shape that we want to and the players want it to be. So

320
00:22:40,188 --> 00:22:48,653
On that, we also had a situation where we were threatened by the 504s because you couldn't play a stormtrooper in the game.

321
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:51,715
They threatened to go boycott our offices.

322
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:52,036
I wish they had.

323
00:22:52,036 --> 00:23:01,622
And I wish they had, because that would have been great news. But I was terrified, oh God, we're going to get harassed now.

324
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:06,245
And there was a reason we couldn't do that, because it all had to do with the movies.

325
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:09,807
And we couldn't talk about it at all. We were told not to talk about it at all.

326
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:13,737
So at that time, no one knew stormtroopers were clones.

327
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:14,757
No one.

328
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:19,578
And so that was a really, really important secret

329
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:23,359
that George Lucas wants to make sure kept within his group.

330
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,259
And so that is the reason why you cannot play

331
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:26,080
a stormtrooper in the game.

332
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,260
Yeah.

333
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,200
We eventually calmed them down by saying,

334
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,781
well, you can get stormtrooper armor and wear it,

335
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:35,182
and you can take the side of the stormtroopers,

336
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:38,583
you just can't really be one.

337
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:38,823
Yeah.

338
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:39,203
Tell you why.

339
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:45,116
Oh, well.

340
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:48,738
An effect of all of this was that there was a lot of hype.

341
00:23:48,738 --> 00:23:51,439
A lot of people got really, really excited.

342
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:55,401
That community was so big and so active,

343
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:58,622
it translated directly into day one sales.

344
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:01,223
But, you know, the coverage,

345
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:04,045
people are tipping Galaxies and Sims Online,

346
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:06,526
which was the other upcoming big MMO,

347
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:08,527
to be the two big MMOs.

348
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:10,027
Sims Online even landed on the cover

349
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:11,168
of Time Magazine or something.

350
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,152
Right. And so there was an enormous level of hype.

351
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:20,336
And in the office, we are freaking out because we know our timeline is so short.

352
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:24,058
Right. A release date hasn't been announced yet.

353
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:27,521
And we know that we're we're about to hit a wall.

354
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:33,285
And the one thing about that is, you know, when you when you when you launch a game

355
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:37,288
for the first time, or talk about it from a marketing campaign, not for launching the game

356
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:40,190
for a marketing campaign, when you really release for the first time.

357
00:24:40,591 --> 00:24:44,634
I think one of the biggest lessons I've learned is we release way too early.

358
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:49,657
I think that if you ever, you know, one of the lessons I learned for all the online games I have

359
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:54,460
is only talk about it when there's a point of action to occur, like signing up for a beta or

360
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,124
whatever. And it should be very close to when you're about to go into beta test. And that should

361
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:04,227
be it. Because if you wait so long, people in their minds get set up to what their perception

362
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:10,011
of what the game is. And it's very hard to change reality. Because perception is reality.

363
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,945
And so what that led to is we knew we were heading headfirst into a very bad situation,

364
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:24,249
which when we launched the game, we asked for it, you know, like I said, six months to a year.

365
00:25:24,249 --> 00:25:29,213
I didn't think that we would get a year, but I think maybe we could get six months,

366
00:25:29,213 --> 00:25:33,335
but we got one month, which really kind of like put us in a very big bind for.

367
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:36,649
for release in this game, because you only get one launch.

368
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:38,110
If anything is you got to get out of this,

369
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,111
you only get one opening night.

370
00:25:40,111 --> 00:25:42,532
And what that happens is if you don't make it

371
00:25:42,532 --> 00:25:43,733
on the D1 the first day,

372
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:47,915
and it becomes a very bad experience for the player,

373
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,976
what'll happen is you have a curve

374
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:52,077
and that curve goes like this.

375
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:55,679
And if you launch poorly, that curve will go like this.

376
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,541
You'll never get that really big accelerant

377
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,902
of that upward trending curve ever, ever, ever again.

378
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:02,423
You only get one opening night.

379
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:07,650
Now, most people think in today's world, if you see MMOs or online games launch,

380
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,132
they two years later, they come back and say, oh, they actually are pretty good,

381
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:17,755
but they will never reach that high point of the initial launch ever that I've seen.

382
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:20,416
So it's hard for a team that worked and crunched so hard.

383
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:23,138
We did that game in two years and nine months.

384
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:24,738
That was with no technology at all.

385
00:26:24,738 --> 00:26:27,560
We had to basically build everything from scratch.

386
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,942
That was an amazing amount of work in that very short period of time.

387
00:26:31,942 --> 00:26:32,482
We all.

388
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:35,774
It's very discouraging for the team to see it launch the way it did.

389
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:41,478
And we paid for it because this is probably the only classic game

390
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:47,702
post-mortem you'll see that won Coaster of the Year.

391
00:26:47,702 --> 00:26:49,043
The initial reception was not good.

392
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:54,686
I'm not sure there's much more to say about that.

393
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:56,087
No. Life went on, right?

394
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:58,409
I mean, it did. We had to still run the game.

395
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:06,095
Absolutely. And the one thing I'll have to say is we had some technology that we're using that

396
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:11,437
were very, very new to the way the database and stored and also with the company running EverQuest,

397
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:17,539
they never had that day one surge that this game had. And so what happened was, is their login

398
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:23,021
service melted on the amount of transactions per second that was happening and they could not scale

399
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:23,442
fast enough.

400
00:27:23,963 --> 00:27:26,884
And it took several days for that instability

401
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:28,164
to get cleared up.

402
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:31,085
And then on top of that, we had a new way of storing data.

403
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:35,646
As Ralph said, because our objects are the way they are,

404
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:38,807
the database we bought was for a very high-end company that

405
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:41,708
very much enterprise-level software,

406
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,968
had never seen the transactions per second that

407
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:45,228
was coming in with our game.

408
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:46,709
They'd never seen that.

409
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:48,729
And so they started melting.

410
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:51,270
And we had to figure out that for about, I'd say,

411
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,850
two weeks of instability really did cost us.

412
00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:00,035
a huge amount of players going into this game because the player experience just wasn't where

413
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:10,123
it needed to be. And yet what ended up happening was what people today call sort of a golden age

414
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:19,070
of Star Wars Galaxies. Everybody talks about this pre-CU period. Early on we actually had a

415
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,972
pretty robust analytics system.

416
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:27,119
and we actually have some numbers here to share about what life was like during this time period.

417
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:34,687
We were able to measure things like GDP growth in the game and where income was coming from and so

418
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:42,755
on, and even though the combat was terrible, the game balance was awful, and there was no content

419
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:43,335
in the game,

420
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:50,426
we found that the sandbox elements of the game were surprisingly popular and were working really,

421
00:28:50,426 --> 00:28:56,493
really well. Really high numbers of people were participating in all of these peaceful ways to

422
00:28:56,493 --> 00:29:04,422
play. And of these, probably one of the biggest and most forward-looking was player housing.

423
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:11,247
Yeah, so player housing was an amazing trial. We learned a lot from you. If anything that taught us

424
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:16,308
about player housing was was what you owe what to do and what not to do in player housing.

425
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:23,349
There were situations that people took player housing so serious and you are we weren't going

426
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:28,990
to screw this up in Star Wars galaxies. That I wasn't going to have happen I it was the housing

427
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,371
was so screwed up that I actually found a letter on my doorstoop that was not posted and said how

428
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,952
would you like your house broken into?

429
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:39,866
That was the first time I realized how fans can be.

430
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:40,826
It really scared me.

431
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:43,528
And I said, no, I'm not going to have that happen here again.

432
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:46,169
So we put a lot of effort into our housing system.

433
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,872
And because we were a factual terrain based,

434
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:52,493
we actually can level out and place buildings

435
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:55,515
on the terrain very effectively and efficiently.

436
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:58,497
And efficiently so much that sometimes it

437
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,278
hid entrance to the dungeon.

438
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,102
There are checks that were not put on specific places.

439
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:07,164
There were bugs, actually, that occurred that we needed to fix.

440
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:09,605
But most of all, the housing really worked well.

441
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:15,309
And it created cities within galaxies on planets.

442
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:17,431
And so it was a very, very cool.

443
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:19,532
And the customization, which I like to talk about,

444
00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:22,594
which is our next slide, was something that

445
00:30:22,594 --> 00:30:23,995
has never been done before.

446
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:25,776
There's nothing out there like that.

447
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:31,447
in my opinion, on player housing that was added, this is players customization that we showed you

448
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:37,610
here. They could customize this place, craft many items and put it in the house. And so what this

449
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:44,253
allowed is not only players to do that but guilds to express themselves. So guilds have their own

450
00:30:44,253 --> 00:30:46,695
guild halls that they develop themselves.

451
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,602
And because we had different types of housing available and different types of blueprints,

452
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:55,945
so to speak, they could pick the ones they liked and big halls and things like that.

453
00:30:55,945 --> 00:31:00,508
So guilds actually built their own places. And that was very, very cool and compelling

454
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:06,712
and engaging in our game. So the housing really, really took off. And it's something that's

455
00:31:06,712 --> 00:31:11,935
remembered a lot in Star Wars Galaxies. Yeah. And it wasn't just house by house because

456
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:18,381
guilds and players got together to found cities. And we actually created a politician skill tree

457
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:24,443
that allowed the elected mayor of a town to set laws, taxation for their town,

458
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:30,185
decide who the police force was so they could eject people or kill people who were misbehaving.

459
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:34,661
you know, we had a whole bunch of individual servers.

460
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:38,705
There's an average of 125 player cities per server.

461
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:42,829
So that means every planet had about a dozen player cities.

462
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:45,892
We had only built three or four per planet.

463
00:31:45,892 --> 00:31:48,874
And they went on and built a dozen more on every planet.

464
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,276
And these had theaters, and they had museums,

465
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:55,700
and they had malls, and they had all kinds of stuff.

466
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,403
And this is one of those things that

467
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:03,593
outside of the political structures in EVE Online maybe,

468
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:05,794
you know, it's hard to think of other examples

469
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:08,975
of this kind of empowerment being given to players.

470
00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:12,817
It really was a signature element

471
00:32:12,817 --> 00:32:15,277
and there are still countless websites out there

472
00:32:15,277 --> 00:32:16,978
for player-run cities and galaxies,

473
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:19,379
even though the game has been shut down for a long time.

474
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:22,320
And the cool thing about it is because the practical train

475
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,781
and other things that we're allowed to do, again,

476
00:32:24,781 --> 00:32:28,543
we had this way before No Man's Sky had this.

477
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:28,623
Yeah.

478
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:31,093
This is in 2003 that this came out.

479
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:33,194
So you can imagine how far ahead we were.

480
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:38,799
And we streamed terrain in real time, both server and client,

481
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,160
as the players went around.

482
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,501
So that was just unheard of too.

483
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,865
One of the neatest things, I think, that we had in our game

484
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:46,646
is the pet system.

485
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:49,528
The pet system was really, really cool.

486
00:32:49,528 --> 00:32:53,551
You started out with a baby pet, a baby bantha, so to speak.

487
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:57,314
And there were baby banthas all around.

488
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:58,295
And you can.

489
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:05,502
and you could train it. And basically, it would learn, if you are hostile to it, it would be a

490
00:33:05,502 --> 00:33:11,267
mean bantha. If you were nice to it and kind to it, and it will be a kind bantha. But it actually

491
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:17,153
learned from your behaviors of what type of personality would come up. And you could teach

492
00:33:17,153 --> 00:33:21,236
it tricks. And so one of the big things about the pet system was very, very cool. You walk

493
00:33:21,236 --> 00:33:25,720
into cities, you can see people all around with pets. And

494
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:32,209
It became a problem that we actually had to nerf because the pets became very powerful over time.

495
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:37,074
Again, if you're abusive to it, it would also be very tough, very aggressive animal.

496
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:43,801
So we actually had to nerf it a little bit so it didn't dominate the combat component of Star Wars Galaxies.

497
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,104
But the neat thing about it is it did allow players to do arenas, little battles between

498
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:56,448
the animals and bet on them and things like that. There was so many different aspects of the pet

499
00:33:56,448 --> 00:34:01,812
system that people used and liked. And you see them in their houses, people walking around the

500
00:34:01,812 --> 00:34:08,556
streets with them. It was a very, very cool part of our game. In fact, very unusual aspects of it

501
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:12,559
that made it, I think, one of the best pet systems in a game.

502
00:34:15,207 --> 00:34:17,848
Yeah, another thing that we ended up pushing on,

503
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,510
you know, player versus player, free for all player killing

504
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,871
had just about, I mean, it cut UO's user base in half.

505
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:26,892
It was devastatingly bad.

506
00:34:26,892 --> 00:34:30,574
And the consensus in the market was that safe worlds

507
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:31,514
was the way to go.

508
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:34,455
But of course, we had to model a galactic civil war

509
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:35,956
between the Empire and the rebels.

510
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:39,517
So we knew that PVP was going to have to be really important.

511
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:42,338
So we came up with this temporary enemy flagging system.

512
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:46,861
that let you join a side, but as a covert sympathizer.

513
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:49,364
So you could turn your flag on temporarily

514
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:50,345
and duck back out.

515
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:54,009
And, you know, the stats at the time showed

516
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:58,234
that only one to 3% of people would turn on a flag

517
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:01,037
permanently in games like EverQuest.

518
00:35:01,037 --> 00:35:01,578
Sure enough.

519
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:06,783
less than 1% of our players actually went to full-time PVP.

520
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:09,543
But over a quarter of them ended up

521
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:12,184
participating in the Galactic Civil War

522
00:35:12,184 --> 00:35:14,824
as long as it wasn't a permanent commitment.

523
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:17,285
Now, this may not seem shocking today, right?

524
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:22,046
But back then, the market couldn't sustain a title

525
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:25,787
like Rust or DayZ or games that were sandboxy

526
00:35:25,787 --> 00:35:28,367
but free-for-all PVP on their own.

527
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:31,028
That gameplay had to be integrated into something larger.

528
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,762
And Galaxies opened the door along with games like DAOC

529
00:35:35,762 --> 00:35:38,484
to show how you could have that kind of realm

530
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,024
versus realm combat.

531
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:42,265
And we definitely lifted a bunch from DAOC

532
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,626
in order to do that, of course.

533
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:49,489
And that PVP, in combination with the Proc Gen terrain

534
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:51,189
and the ability to build buildings,

535
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:54,511
meant that there could be entire bases spawning on the map,

536
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:58,213
being destroyed, the ability to put down turrets in them

537
00:35:58,213 --> 00:36:01,214
and have really large-scale battles and faction warfare.

538
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:07,420
So it really did unlock this thing where at any moment you might be in a city and suddenly have

539
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,444
a huge battle that wrapped around you. And if you weren't interested, it couldn't hurt you,

540
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:14,147
but it definitely made the environment feel more exciting.

541
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,582
One of the cool things about that is, and I will tell you,

542
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:23,323
is watching the faction battles.

543
00:36:23,323 --> 00:36:27,805
I mean, again, all the tools in the sandbox really worked well.

544
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:30,666
That was the cool part of the game, I will tell you.

545
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:34,368
And that's actually where all the players migrated to.

546
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:36,529
As we were trying to build our content,

547
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:38,490
they started building content, basically,

548
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,051
and actually entertaining themselves very, very quickly.

549
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:45,313
And probably the biggest way they did that was, of course,

550
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:47,373
with the stuff that people made the most fun of us for.

551
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:53,103
Yes. Like having dancing in the game at all. But it turned out

552
00:36:53,103 --> 00:37:01,145
that dancing and musicianship and beauty pageants, and making

553
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:06,846
music videos and filming little soap operas. And bear in mind,

554
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:10,387
this was before YouTube existed. Right? There was just an

555
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:14,108
enormous amount of player player creativity that got unlocked by

556
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:14,488
this.

557
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:19,843
even though everybody was also simultaneously saying that's not very Star Wars.

558
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:24,625
Yeah, and they had things like Hot Pants, all sorts of music videos that they did that were

559
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:30,067
were extremely popular, by the way, not only with our fans, but outside of our fan base, actually.

560
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:38,128
The emphasis on crafting in the game also unlocked all of this social play.

561
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:43,575
You know, the player economy had bootstrapped up from nothing because there wasn't real loot.

562
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:46,499
But players during this time period bootstrapped it up

563
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:51,546
to the point where one third of all players were running a shop.

564
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:59,745
whether a bakeries and weaponsmiths and architects and whatever. So we hadn't put any NPC shopkeepers

565
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:06,750
in the game at all and there were 15,000 of them per server. Probably more than we would have put

566
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:14,636
in by hand had we been doing it. So the community during this time period was amazing and yet

567
00:38:14,636 --> 00:38:16,217
we were still going to hit a wall.

568
00:38:20,151 --> 00:38:27,797
Yeah, so I mean, basically, if you see this, it's, you know, we promised a Star Wars experience,

569
00:38:27,797 --> 00:38:33,041
but we delivered a sandbox. And I think that when you think of Star Wars, you're talking about

570
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:41,648
fantasy of being a Jedi, or being on the other side, dark or light. And so that we did not provide

571
00:38:41,648 --> 00:38:47,693
a very good game experience for player experience for and that really did hurt us.

572
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:53,633
I think later on they made a lot of fixes and a lot of changes towards that, but initially

573
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:59,835
not filling out that fantasy was really something that hurt us. And I think Raph could talk about

574
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:05,338
that right now. Go ahead, Raph. Yeah, it was super clear that in the first few months,

575
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:12,521
this here is basically a graph of how many players are quitting in the first month, second month,

576
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:16,562
third month, and so on across a variety of games.

577
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:23,930
and the blue line is Galaxies. And you can see that the early months, it actually held better.

578
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:30,196
But players started churning out at increasing rates the longer they had played the game

579
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:35,982
because there simply wasn't enough to do other than participate in the sandbox community.

580
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:38,845
What I'm saying here, content is king.

581
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,861
I always talk about heartbeat.

582
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:42,342
Heartbeat is the amount of content

583
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:44,343
you're able to deliver after live.

584
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:46,544
A lot of games, even games today,

585
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:48,806
have made that valuable mistake of being

586
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:53,248
on a content treadmill that is too difficult to tap into

587
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:56,170
and get content out to the players in a timely manner.

588
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,571
And when you do that, guess what happens?

589
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:00,893
People leave the game over time.

590
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:03,174
What is interesting to say is, if we

591
00:40:03,174 --> 00:40:05,996
were to have that extra year, that extra six months,

592
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:08,537
we would have had a different situation in our game.

593
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:14,329
And I think we'd have time to clean up the bugs and get the content the way we wanted to get the content.

594
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,170
But you see, that didn't happen.

595
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,171
We had to play catch up.

596
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:18,932
And that was really, really difficult for us to do.

597
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:26,356
But one of the neat things about the survey is that 80 percent will return if we fixed it.

598
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:27,077
That was huge.

599
00:40:27,077 --> 00:40:30,499
That's a huge positive note about what we did.

600
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:35,167
So, you know, people look back at this game, I think they remember the sandbox elements of the

601
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:39,871
game versus the fantasy elements of the game that they were filled. What happened was,

602
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:45,116
is people filled their fantasy of Star Wars and living in the Star Wars universe themselves.

603
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:49,339
So they became what they wanted to be in the Star Wars universe versus us dictating it to it.

604
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:53,442
Now, that's pretty cool. And I think that's probably why people really hold this game

605
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:57,686
to where it is today in their minds, because they were actually living their own fantasies

606
00:40:57,686 --> 00:40:59,888
versus us creating one for them.

607
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:05,863
Yeah, in fact, our tagline for a while was the greatest story ever told in the Star Wars universe.

608
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:09,245
Yours, right? Remember that? I still like that tagline.

609
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:09,986
Yes.

610
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:15,650
We desperately tried adding content, but we don't even have the tools infrastructure to do it.

611
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:20,914
Right? Like, all of our work had gone into that system underpinning stuff, right?

612
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:24,457
It had not gone into making quest tools.

613
00:41:24,457 --> 00:41:28,980
So it's just like pulling teeth to get simple things like a dungeon added to the game.

614
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:32,463
And this is still in the first six months of launch

615
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:34,723
that we're hitting these issues.

616
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:36,804
And we get told by marketing, you know what?

617
00:41:36,804 --> 00:41:39,244
To do a new marketing push, we need Jedi in the game.

618
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:41,285
We want Jedi by Christmas.

619
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:44,666
And the decision is made to drop hints.

620
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:47,366
But if you remember, players just

621
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:53,147
needed to learn an arbitrary five skills out of the 612,

622
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:54,448
a random set for each of them.

623
00:41:54,448 --> 00:41:57,368
As soon as we stopped dropping hints,

624
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:03,452
A few players said, oh, it's a skill, it's a skill, it's a skill.

625
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:07,454
And then they decided they knew the whole system

626
00:42:07,454 --> 00:42:10,816
and set out to learn every single skill in the game,

627
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:12,256
one after the other.

628
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:15,118
Which meant the creature handlers started killing monsters.

629
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:18,579
The people who liked cooking started making spaceships.

630
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:21,661
The people who liked, you know, building houses

631
00:42:21,661 --> 00:42:24,062
went on adventures and died to Krayt Dragons.

632
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:27,223
Everybody started playing the ways they didn't like.

633
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:32,676
because the idea of becoming a Jedi was so powerful. And the result was that our turn

634
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:36,718
rate went up more and we started losing players even faster.

635
00:42:36,718 --> 00:42:45,183
One of the things that we did is a lot of us came from Wind Commander, so we knew about space flight,

636
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:50,226
we knew how to do space flight. One of the aspirational games that we were doing,

637
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:52,967
even with Privateer Aligned, was Sun Dog and Mule.

638
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:57,112
was the two taglines that we use as games of aspirational here.

639
00:42:57,112 --> 00:43:00,975
SunDog gives us a presence of what it's like working on

640
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:05,617
multiple functions on a ship. So when we did the Millennium

641
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:09,099
Falcon experience in JTL, it was that you could be a pilot, you

642
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:12,882
could be a gunner, or you can be an engineer. And that's pretty

643
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:17,764
damn cool. And allows people to have multiple roles on a ship,

644
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:21,207
be and be able to switch them off. And so that

645
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:28,114
what I call Millennium Falcon Experience, was a cornerstone of JTL. But it was a very cool game

646
00:43:28,114 --> 00:43:35,277
because you can fly Star Wars ships into combat and have fun doing it. JTL was a great expansion

647
00:43:35,277 --> 00:43:42,401
in the sense that it allowed us, and I'd say 80% of the user base got it, but there was one

648
00:43:42,401 --> 00:43:48,644
unfortunate thing. The unfortunate thing was it launched right when WoW launched.

649
00:43:49,244 --> 00:43:53,569
Yeah, so wow brought the whole industry down, not just us, every

650
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:57,474
online game out there went down as soon as well went out. Wow was

651
00:43:57,474 --> 00:44:02,220
like a huge succubus of players went over there and drove into

652
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,864
Wow. And it drove all our numbers down. But it didn't help

653
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:08,888
JTL JTL got us a very small bump.

654
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:15,176
Yeah, and it was such a good expansion, and yet it really suffered from this.

655
00:44:15,176 --> 00:44:18,839
Now, Galaxies, of course, this is a graph of daily active users.

656
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:23,062
You can see where WoW hits the game. It actually hit all MMOs.

657
00:44:23,062 --> 00:44:29,066
Galaxies suffered less than the level and class-based other MMOs that were out there at the time,

658
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:33,749
because the gameplay, the sandbox gameplay, wasn't on offer in WoW.

659
00:44:33,749 --> 00:44:36,931
But it really was just a devastating, devastating blow.

660
00:44:37,332 --> 00:44:41,377
And when combined with the increased churn ever since the Jedi holocrons,

661
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:47,766
it left the live team in a really challenging position and,

662
00:44:47,766 --> 00:44:49,668
you know, trying to stop the bleeding.

663
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:53,580
And at this point, I had already moved off the team.

664
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,922
I'd been promoted up to Chief Creative Officer at Sony Online.

665
00:44:56,922 --> 00:44:59,643
So I got to watch a lot of this from a distance

666
00:44:59,643 --> 00:45:04,245
as the live team was working on, let's try a combat upgrade.

667
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:05,446
No, that didn't do enough.

668
00:45:05,446 --> 00:45:07,526
Let's try modifying the grouping rules.

669
00:45:07,526 --> 00:45:10,488
Let's adjust the PVP.

670
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,969
All in all, none of it was really moving the needle,

671
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:14,249
as you saw from the graph.

672
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:17,571
And so this fateful decision is made

673
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:19,372
to try a really big revamp.

674
00:45:19,837 --> 00:45:22,258
that was known as the NGE.

675
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:27,560
At that particular time, I decided I did not want

676
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,842
to participate because I knew that you have a core loops

677
00:45:31,842 --> 00:45:33,502
in the game that you built from scratch

678
00:45:33,502 --> 00:45:35,863
and the players love and enjoy.

679
00:45:35,863 --> 00:45:38,985
And if you change that core loop and make it more like WoW,

680
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:41,866
you will lose a large audience over time.

681
00:45:41,866 --> 00:45:44,807
And I said, you can't do that in a game like this.

682
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:45,507
It's already been out.

683
00:45:45,507 --> 00:45:48,008
You already have the inner and outer loops

684
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:49,429
already working in the game.

685
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:54,643
changing that would be devastating to your base and you'll never ever get it back.

686
00:45:54,643 --> 00:46:00,005
And so I said, yep, I think that if you want to guys do that, that's not where I want to head.

687
00:46:00,005 --> 00:46:08,368
And so at that time I did leave SOE and actually joined BioWare and formed BioWare Austin Studio.

688
00:46:08,368 --> 00:46:11,910
Where ironically he ended up making another Star Wars MMO.

689
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,450
Yeah, I want to try it again.

690
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,991
My second thought.

691
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:16,511
So.

692
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,901
You know, I also didn't think this was a good idea.

693
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:22,162
Unfortunately, we were right.

694
00:46:22,162 --> 00:46:23,563
It has gone down in history

695
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:27,284
as the most infamous video game patch ever made.

696
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,945
It made the New York Times.

697
00:46:28,945 --> 00:46:32,006
All of that skill-based stuff was removed

698
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:34,687
in favor of classes.

699
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:38,629
The RPG combat came out in favor of action RPG

700
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,589
with clicky stuff.

701
00:46:40,037 --> 00:46:43,397
You couldn't mix and match different skills

702
00:46:43,397 --> 00:46:45,578
from different skill trees anymore.

703
00:46:45,578 --> 00:46:47,759
Peaceful professions now became helpless in combat

704
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:49,959
because there were combat levels.

705
00:46:49,959 --> 00:46:51,900
Jedi was a starter class,

706
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,341
and maybe the worst blow of all to a lot of people,

707
00:46:55,341 --> 00:46:57,921
their pets, the pet system got turned off for a while

708
00:46:57,921 --> 00:47:00,662
and all the pets were locked away in their data pad UI.

709
00:47:00,662 --> 00:47:04,663
And you could see Fluffy locked in there and tap on them,

710
00:47:04,663 --> 00:47:06,383
but you couldn't get them out anymore.

711
00:47:06,749 --> 00:47:11,951
and players literally held funerals across the game for their pets.

712
00:47:11,951 --> 00:47:14,953
It was just a disastrously bad reaction.

713
00:47:14,953 --> 00:47:18,735
And it wasn't just the New York Times, it made the Washington Post,

714
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:21,236
it made the Christian Science Monitor.

715
00:47:21,236 --> 00:47:26,338
And one of the weirdest things was suddenly seeing people say,

716
00:47:26,338 --> 00:47:31,240
no wait, this was something different and unique.

717
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,721
We liked it after all.

718
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:41,983
And that was a bit of a, you know, I mean, we were wrestling with bad reviews and churn and all the rest, and yet we get reactions like this.

719
00:47:41,983 --> 00:47:53,307
So that was an eye opening and shocking and really just depressing and distressing to the team. This was a very, very tough time period.

720
00:47:53,307 --> 00:48:01,191
Yeah, go ahead. And if you look at the graph coming up.

721
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:01,351
Yeah.

722
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:01,631
It was.

723
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:12,099
I'm not sure there's much to say. It was brutal. We had projected out what the normal rate of

724
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:19,664
cancellation was. In the space of one month, we lost 25% of the active usables.

725
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:24,568
And it continued to bleed over time as well. Oh, yeah. It got worse over time. Players just

726
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,431
complained in droves. A refund had to be issued for the last expansion.

727
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,902
you know, there was a marketing push. We tried to get magazines to write nice things about the game.

728
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:39,964
They said, oh, it's worth a second look. Right? Well, that very same magazine,

729
00:48:39,964 --> 00:48:48,608
Galaxies became the only game to win Coaster of the Year twice.

730
00:48:48,608 --> 00:48:55,290
I, not exactly what you want on your resume, right? So, yeah, and it, oh.

731
00:48:56,372 --> 00:49:03,477
Of course, the irony is that little review says no more do-overs, but that isn't what happened.

732
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:10,022
There was a do-over because there was a new era after that. Over the next six years,

733
00:49:10,022 --> 00:49:17,467
the live team on Galaxy started to be composed of people who were players of Galaxy, who loved

734
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:23,451
the sandbox qualities, who loved what made it different and unique, the things that made it

735
00:49:23,451 --> 00:49:23,691
not like WoW.

736
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:30,757
And over the next six years, they did this amazing job of putting all that sandbox stuff back in.

737
00:49:30,757 --> 00:49:36,338
And we can only call out a couple of things that they did during that time period, partly because

738
00:49:36,338 --> 00:49:41,920
neither of us were there, but we really want to give them props for the amazing job they did

739
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:49,121
in basically turning the game around and bringing it back to life.

740
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:52,442
They did some amazing things. They again...

741
00:49:53,228 --> 00:49:55,229
The event system on there really helped

742
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:56,810
because they ran a lot of events.

743
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,751
We had real time.

744
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:02,853
We had people that we played as volunteers to run the events.

745
00:50:02,853 --> 00:50:07,515
And they developed tools and added to the sandbox tool set

746
00:50:07,515 --> 00:50:11,357
where players can actually do and create, as you see,

747
00:50:11,357 --> 00:50:12,638
quests, a quest system.

748
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:16,219
And when they put that in, the live team put that in,

749
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:19,701
there were three main quests were created by players in one

750
00:50:19,701 --> 00:50:19,801
month.

751
00:50:19,801 --> 00:50:21,842
It was an amazing experience for the players.

752
00:50:23,306 --> 00:50:36,830
Yeah, but despite all of their heroic efforts. December 15 2011, the game was nonetheless shut down the team was so devoted and dedicated that they.

753
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:42,093
launched atmospheric flight, the ability to take off with your X-Wing from the ground

754
00:50:42,093 --> 00:50:48,979
and fly over the planets and from there go out into orbit and into space, kind of the Star Citizen

755
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:54,283
dream today. And they launched that even though the game was going to get shut down that month

756
00:50:54,283 --> 00:50:59,788
because they just were that committed to delivering on the promise of what Star Wars galaxies could be.

757
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:06,232
And so they held this crazy giant party and people from all over the industry logged in.

758
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:12,275
Many of the game sites ran all-day live streams of the final days with all kinds of really weird

759
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:17,117
stuff happening, like giant Ewok battles in the middle of Mos Eisley and whatever, as players

760
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:23,040
just really cut loose and were given access to do whatever they wanted on the last final days.

761
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,903
And so it was a big farewell. But it wasn't the end. Because there was an afterlife.

762
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:33,792
The fans also worked on keeping it alive.

763
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:36,654
They started building emulators.

764
00:51:36,654 --> 00:51:41,236
And today, there are dozens of Star Wars Galaxy's emulators

765
00:51:41,236 --> 00:51:42,076
running.

766
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:45,038
These projects have been running on a volunteer basis

767
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:46,438
for years now.

768
00:51:46,438 --> 00:51:51,581
And fans are not just keeping it alive, they're extending it.

769
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:56,263
Bespin just launched in Star Wars Galaxy's emulators

770
00:51:56,263 --> 00:51:56,903
this month.

771
00:51:58,025 --> 00:52:02,429
And to this day, across these fan run servers,

772
00:52:02,429 --> 00:52:04,230
there's still thousands of active users.

773
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:08,794
If Galaxies were a title today, running on Steam,

774
00:52:08,794 --> 00:52:10,495
it would have enough active users

775
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:14,078
to be in the top 100 online games on Steam, even now,

776
00:52:14,078 --> 00:52:16,600
which is just a testament to the passion

777
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:24,306
and dedication of that community.

778
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:24,746
And, you know,

779
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:33,981
We know that, like I said, it had a very ridiculous short debt period, two years and nine months.

780
00:52:33,981 --> 00:52:37,582
It had one of the worst launches ever, I'd have to say.

781
00:52:37,582 --> 00:52:41,223
Terrible churn and almost no content.

782
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:43,803
And I will say it had the infamous patch of all time.

783
00:52:43,803 --> 00:52:45,704
That's the NGE.

784
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:53,906
But still, people think of this game, even today, as an unbelievable masterpiece in their minds.

785
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:55,048
It's interesting.

786
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:55,568
It makes us...

787
00:52:55,568 --> 00:53:04,275
I'm left with these weird feelings because it was so painful and so demoralizing.

788
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:07,697
And it's like its reputation has improved over time.

789
00:53:07,697 --> 00:53:14,703
Because now people look back and say, look at the ambition, look at the things that were

790
00:53:14,703 --> 00:53:15,243
tried.

791
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:21,256
It turns out people do want to, you know, be Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. That used to be the

792
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:28,486
knock against it. And today, with the popularity of Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley and,

793
00:53:28,486 --> 00:53:33,192
you know, all of these ways to play that are just living in an alternate world.

794
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:37,654
Somehow, the game that went from two coasters of the year,

795
00:53:37,654 --> 00:53:39,375
Variety names it, you know,

796
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:41,536
number 10 best Star Wars game of all time.

797
00:53:41,536 --> 00:53:45,157
And there's this massive cognitive dissonance, right?

798
00:53:45,157 --> 00:53:48,419
Because the memory of the things that it did right,

799
00:53:48,419 --> 00:53:51,720
it turns out that those ideas were really, really right.

800
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,781
They really were going to be the thing

801
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:55,542
that extended the game marketplace.

802
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:59,724
And a lot of those things wouldn't come to full fruition

803
00:53:59,724 --> 00:54:02,265
until mobile gaming and casual gaming really,

804
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:07,723
blossomed, right? Today, people look back at the crafting system

805
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:10,865
and say that's the one to emulate. They look back and they

806
00:54:10,865 --> 00:54:14,747
say lots of players want to live peaceful lives. You know, it

807
00:54:14,747 --> 00:54:19,290
used to be that you had to mine everything by hand, the idea

808
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,632
that you could put down a mine and check back in later. That

809
00:54:22,632 --> 00:54:25,173
was the basis of games like Farmville and all of the

810
00:54:25,173 --> 00:54:26,074
Facebook games.

811
00:54:26,636 --> 00:54:33,721
right? Some of these features that we put into Galaxies that were the oddball things

812
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:37,924
have turned out to have been incredibly important to the development of online games.

813
00:54:37,924 --> 00:54:44,189
I mean, there's lots of things you think about Minecraft, where that came from, and all the

814
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:48,832
systems in Minecraft, you know, UO influenced, and I probably believe Star Wars Galaxies maybe

815
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:54,377
have influenced that as well, and Roblox today. It's an amazing amount of

816
00:54:55,090 --> 00:55:02,295
stuff that we did back in 2003, we got laughed at, like dancing and musicians, the music position

817
00:55:02,295 --> 00:55:07,138
skill in the game and things like that. But actually people have fond memories because,

818
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:11,481
like I said before, they created their own stories and lived in the Star Wars,

819
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:14,943
living in the Star Wars universe. And that was what made it special to them.

820
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:23,668
Yeah. And so one of my favorite stories, there is a musician named Porter Robinson.

821
00:55:24,437 --> 00:55:29,658
and I'd urge all of you watching, you know, we avoided putting the music in here because we

822
00:55:29,658 --> 00:55:34,119
don't want a YouTube takedown or anything, but go search for the song Goodbye to a World.

823
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:42,760
Porter is a really, really famous Grammy-nominated electronic musician, and his album Worlds is

824
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:49,842
considered a landmark in moving EDM in a more ambient, peaceful direction. And it turns out

825
00:55:49,842 --> 00:55:52,322
that this landmark album

826
00:55:52,827 --> 00:56:00,531
was inspired by his time as a player in Star Wars Galaxies and other MMOs that shut down.

827
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:06,734
And today, you know, whenever I hear that particular piece of music where this robot

828
00:56:06,734 --> 00:56:11,796
voice is singing, I'll say goodbye soon. Even though it's the end of the world, you know,

829
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:18,399
don't blame yourself. It's not your fault. But, you know, in the end, this is about giving life

830
00:56:18,399 --> 00:56:21,281
to a world that is your own.

831
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:25,414
And that's really what Galaxies was about in the end.

832
00:56:25,414 --> 00:56:26,695
And so even though we can't play the song,

833
00:56:26,695 --> 00:56:32,257
kind of like for you to all kind of play out this presentation,

834
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:35,539
go find that song and listen to the end

835
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:39,981
as the voice kind of dies off making weird modem noises.

836
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:43,882
Because that's the right way to play off Star Wars

837
00:56:43,882 --> 00:56:49,565
Galaxies in the end as it heads off into its afterlife.

838
00:56:49,565 --> 00:56:51,946
It really was a world for players.

839
00:56:52,197 --> 00:56:58,454
a world of their own. Thank you. Thank you for joining us. We appreciate it.
