00:00:08,317 --> 00:00:11,178
Hi, I'm here to talk about how That Game Company

2
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:13,119
created the unique social dynamics

3
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:14,700
in Sky Children of the Light.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,421
I'm John Hughes, a field engineer at That Game Company.

5
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:21,502
And since 2015, I've been working

6
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:23,003
on the social components of Sky.

7
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:25,744
Most of my background is in engineering,

8
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:27,684
but I do a lot of design work day to day.

9
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,445
This includes working on our relationship

10
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:33,727
and gifting systems, emote and outfit systems,

11
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:34,867
and our matchmaking.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,292
I also wanted to mention a lot of what's in these slides

13
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,754
comes from work done by over 50 people and mentoring

14
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,155
and feedback from many people, but particularly

15
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:49,717
Michael Hyland, John Edwards, Nicholas Clark, and Genova Chen.

16
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:56,141
In Sky, players explore together to spread light and warmth

17
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:59,243
through a desolate kingdom and return fallen stars to the sky,

18
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:01,764
creating bonds with each other along the way.

19
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:04,966
It takes place above the clouds, and players can

20
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:06,426
explore and fly around together.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,201
Players can hug, hold hands, and chat.

22
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:11,702
Sky is on iOS and Android.

23
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:13,343
We soft launched December 2018

24
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:15,564
and officially launched mid-2019.

25
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:21,486
When I joined TGC, we were still very much

26
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,407
figuring out the core experience of Sky.

27
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:26,708
We knew we wanted it to be social, whatever that meant.

28
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:29,269
We knew we wanted a story

29
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:31,090
that emotionally resonated with players.

30
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,671
And we had a clear idea of what the setting was

31
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,012
and had some tech to support it.

32
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,738
We knew flying together felt really good,

33
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,301
and our cinematic style was fairly well-established.

34
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:49,245
The narrative arc of Sky at the time

35
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:52,066
would loosely guide players forward and provide context

36
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:53,447
for their existence in the world,

37
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:55,429
along with emotional highs and lows.

38
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:57,750
This was super important to us.

39
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:01,793
We had learned from Journey that a strong emotional narrative

40
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,574
experience could bring people together,

41
00:02:03,594 --> 00:02:05,395
and we wanted to keep that in Sky.

42
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:07,636
We had a problem, though.

43
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:14,122
The clearer and more compelling our linear level design became, the more people ignored each other.

44
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:19,745
We were bringing in playtesters who were sitting beside each other, connected to each other, and in

45
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:24,148
the same game, and a good chunk of them didn't know it was multiplayer. They would see other

46
00:02:24,168 --> 00:02:27,810
characters in the world come and go, but they just weren't interacting.

47
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:34,250
Our idea was that we should incorporate some downtime between narrative events

48
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:38,653
on the main path where players had a chance to relax and spend time with each other.

49
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:44,676
This leads us to our first principle. Multiplayer gameplay that inspires social play

50
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:48,419
should provide a careful balance of open-ended and goal-oriented play.

51
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,743
We switched to more of a tree structure and created alternate paths, added secrets,

52
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:59,145
and activities. These acted as icebreakers for deeper relationships to form.

53
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:03,814
Anything in the world that slows players down can encourage the boredom necessary

54
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:08,095
to inspire creative usage of the mechanics players have gained access to.

55
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,817
Although to be clear, we saw this behavior with many types of goals,

56
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:19,419
not just when players were focusing on traveling forward in the story.

57
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,080
We had prototypes where people needed to work together to find keys to get through a door.

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,341
And the more compelling the goal in front of them was,

59
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:29,742
the more likely they were to ignore each other.

60
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:36,017
After that, almost all of us were focused on expanding the pockets of

61
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:41,619
pleasant gameplay moments like standing over a vista with another player,

62
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,801
or wandering into a mysterious cave and finding an abandoned structure to explore together.

63
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:52,223
These moments were really great, but could we encourage them to happen more frequently,

64
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:54,905
and how did they fit into the larger experience?

65
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:02,032
At this point in development, we knew that some of the best experiences you can have in Sky

66
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:07,096
were off the main path, being guided by another player or just stumbling around together.

67
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:13,761
To reinforce this, we introduced hand-holding between players, which has proven to be one of

68
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:19,044
the most iconic features of Sky. One player can give control to another and then be guided around

69
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:24,148
the world. A really attentive guide will create an experience for other players, trying to gauge

70
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:25,769
the interest of whoever they're guiding.

71
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,720
and being careful not to move through areas too fast.

72
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:38,448
A good guide will anticipate what secrets or collectibles others have left to discover

73
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:43,452
and help find them. Most importantly though, it's a nice intimate way for players to connect.

74
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:50,838
We knew it felt good to have another player offer their hand and dedicate time to showing you around

75
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,900
or helping you find the next play area.

76
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:56,882
We knew something about this felt real and emotionally resonating.

77
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,562
And somehow, through this in-game action,

78
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:02,723
you could feel a real connection to the player on the other end.

79
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:06,744
After an experience like this, while playtesting ourselves,

80
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:10,005
we wanted a way to be able to show each other appreciation.

81
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:13,846
This leads us to our core gifting mechanic,

82
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:18,307
the ability to reward another player for some value they've provided you.

83
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,368
That value could be from...

84
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,943
holding your hand and guiding you for helping you find a secret,

85
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:29,144
entertaining you by playing an instrument,

86
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,726
or just to show appreciation for the time you spent together.

87
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,111
All of this felt positive and exciting.

88
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,974
And at first, actually, we would tally gift counts

89
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:44,275
for our own play sessions.

90
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,757
And someone would come around and collect a real dollar

91
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:48,938
bill for each gift.

92
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:53,535
And this really magnified the feeling of getting a gift.

93
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:56,077
You knew someone meant it when you got one.

94
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,221
But we had to ask ourselves some questions.

95
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:05,083
Why did we feel like this was working?

96
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:07,684
And how could we build on this?

97
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:12,407
More generally, how do you define social play

98
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:15,890
or what determines the success of a social gameplay mechanic?

99
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,509
There are any number of ways to think about what

100
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:21,610
makes play feel social.

101
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,813
But we define social play as any activity

102
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:27,675
performed near other players, which

103
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:30,257
encourages simulating the thoughts and feelings of others.

104
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:34,720
The scope of what can fit under this definition is really big.

105
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,542
And note that we're not talking about multiplayer,

106
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:40,505
single player, or any social media integration,

107
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:41,406
or anything like that.

108
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,488
It doesn't even say with other players,

109
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:45,729
just activities near them.

110
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:50,691
What we're talking about specifically is the simulation that happens in your brain

111
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,572
of another person's brain as you interact with them.

112
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:57,954
This inner simulation can be used to either anticipate the needs

113
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:01,076
of others in a friendly, cooperative setting such as Sky

114
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:04,278
or maybe even to get an advantage during competitive play.

115
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,739
But basically we're talking about empathy.

116
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:15,163
So we had interesting spaces to explore.

117
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:18,696
along with a strong but subtle narrative backbone.

118
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:22,399
But things still didn't fully feel right.

119
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,442
You could acknowledge players for the experiences you shared with a gift,

120
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:28,624
but the experiences were fleeting.

121
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:31,807
The acknowledgments weren't tied to anything else in the world.

122
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:34,589
And when you're separated from your new friend,

123
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,012
there wasn't a clear indicator of who was who.

124
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,603
Playing internally, we were having a hard time distinguishing players from each other,

125
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:48,549
and we'd frequently have confusing playtests where one of us would just trick most of the

126
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:54,434
other players into giving them gifts, and weird erratic behavior was being rewarded.

127
00:07:56,696 --> 00:08:02,181
A few things came together to solve this. The first thing was expanding the outfit system

128
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,125
and basing the available outfits on the number of gifts you had received.

129
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:09,893
Through a number of iterations, we ended up with our current heart economy.

130
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:14,617
Players can gift each other hearts, and in turn, players have more options to

131
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,218
express themselves through what they wear.

132
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,841
This was also the beginning of our social gameplay loop.

133
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:26,046
The loop for a different game about building a character to fight monsters,

134
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:31,710
you might, you'd naturally allow the player to become more powerful to fight

135
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,431
more monsters.

136
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,473
We did roughly this in Sky, where you have outfits,

137
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,495
social abilities like emotes and other expressive items.

138
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:43,457
And as you use them with other people and they appreciate it,

139
00:08:44,218 --> 00:08:46,459
you get more opportunities to express yourself.

140
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,222
The loop we created allows players to earn abilities and equipment,

141
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:53,324
such as instruments, emotes, fireworks, outfits, and chat.

142
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:58,127
Players can reward each other for performing these abilities in creative

143
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,808
ways or places by giving them gifts.

144
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:03,067
And these rewards grant access to additional interpersonal

145
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,888
interactions, which in turn offer more opportunities

146
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:07,469
for being acknowledged by other players.

147
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:13,472
The key, I think, is always including another player

148
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,394
in the loop somehow, either directly or peripherally,

149
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:19,716
so players can get a real sense of mastery still

150
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:21,036
from a social experience.

151
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:24,158
They can become better at expressing themselves,

152
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,839
more charming and entertaining, or more helpful.

153
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,421
This brings us to our next core principle.

154
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,844
that expression is at the core of social play.

155
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:43,406
But how do we teach this unusual gifting reward expression loop? We didn't know if players would

156
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:50,848
understand the system, or let alone if we could make it feel motivating. I was personally inspired

157
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:55,509
by a Joseph Campbell book called Myths to Live By, and a big part of what he talks about in it

158
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:59,610
is the role of rituals and rites of passage in ancient societies.

159
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:06,051
He says that the role of these rituals is to teach people, especially during a transition such as

160
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:12,316
approaching adulthood or elderly years, how to interact with others and function and contribute

161
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:19,923
to their particular community. We embrace this idea of ritual as a social learning tool directly

162
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:25,668
with our reveal mechanic to reinforce a plight calm initial meeting between players.

163
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,651
At first, when you interact with a new player in Sky,

164
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:30,972
their identity is hidden.

165
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:34,233
And you can only see their silhouette.

166
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:37,194
To reveal the other player, you touch your candle flames

167
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:37,674
together.

168
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:41,095
And once they are revealed, you can perform other interactions

169
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,115
and see their outfit.

170
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:46,617
This doubles as a nice meeting ritual and a checklist

171
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:49,517
for which players in your game you've interacted with before.

172
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:52,718
So this and the outfit system were deliberate steps

173
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,379
to separate characters from each other.

174
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:58,067
It doesn't matter if you can guess what someone is feeling or thinking

175
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:01,069
if you can't recognize them again to do something about it.

176
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:08,576
We extended these ideas further to keep track of individual relationships.

177
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:11,919
In addition to emotes and outfits you can find in the world,

178
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,383
players have a set of abilities that they can perform with each other,

179
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:19,446
which are unlocked as the relationship grows.

180
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:27,095
Both players in this case are required to invest in the relationship to unlock more intimate interactions,

181
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:29,655
such as hand-holding, hugging, and chat.

182
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:38,497
Doing things this way, we mitigate a lot of the potential toxicity that can come from short, low-investment interactions.

183
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:42,998
We saw this toxicity in initial implementations of our chat benches,

184
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:48,299
which are areas that allow instant access to chat with others.

185
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:53,675
We reduced the toxic interactions by moving the benches to hard-to-access areas

186
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:58,157
and increasing the investment required for players to engage in chat.

187
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,242
At around this time in development, we opened early beta access.

188
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:09,764
We were feeling good with internal playtests,

189
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:13,206
like it really mattered spending time with someone else in Sky.

190
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:18,035
But would external people get the idea of a gifting economy,

191
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:20,137
or were these ideas too abstract?

192
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:23,059
We found that the gifting expression loop

193
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:26,321
was understandable and motivating for people,

194
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:27,302
which is great.

195
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:30,664
And we all had some magical moments

196
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:33,366
of bumping into new players and forming a real connection.

197
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:36,128
I had great experiences at the time,

198
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,311
bumping into a random person, sticking together for a bit.

199
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:44,841
and slowly investing in being able to communicate with them and eventually unlocking chat after

200
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:51,164
about an hour of play. And it turns out people are generally looking for a real connection.

201
00:12:55,006 --> 00:13:01,109
With these learnings at our disposal, after developing the gifting and relationship systems,

202
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,911
we're able to apply them more generally to the rest of the game.

203
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,193
And I think

204
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:13,336
It's easy to confuse something you do together with someone as being social,

205
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:18,658
just by virtue of you both being there. I think we can tell, though, that some

206
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:24,079
activities are definitely more social than others. I think typically, if you gave someone a task,

207
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,100
design some type of interaction for two people where in the end they're going to feel good

208
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,661
about each other. A pretty common first thought would be to put them in a situation where they

209
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,042
help each other accomplish something.

210
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:41,420
In a video game, this task might be to kill a monster together

211
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,743
or to use a two-person switch to open a door and progress.

212
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:50,887
Where these examples don't line up with how we're thinking about social play

213
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:55,370
is it takes very little thought about another person to do either of these

214
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,312
things. In the case of a monster, even if it

215
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,474
needs a coordinated strategy to win against,

216
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,576
you're typically not thinking about the other player as long as they're doing

217
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:05,957
their part.

218
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:09,834
In the case of a door requiring two people to open,

219
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:13,596
the other person has the exact same function

220
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:16,479
as a simple key, which definitely doesn't encourage

221
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:18,600
you to simulate their brain in any way.

222
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:20,502
You just want to get to the other side.

223
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:25,205
I think if you don't need to know how the other player feels

224
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:28,568
to perform your task together, players often

225
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:31,790
slip into a mode of treating each other as tools,

226
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,031
just a means to an end.

227
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,502
So in both these cases, we potentially have the opposite effect than we intended.

228
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:43,708
At best, the two players might have a muted feeling of immunity, or more likely,

229
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:47,792
one player will mess up and somehow inconvenience the other.

230
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:55,659
So actually, Sky does literally have two-person switch doors.

231
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:58,781
And this almost contradicts the previous slide,

232
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,562
but doesn't exactly.

233
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:03,762
And it just shows how context for these goals

234
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,123
really do matter.

235
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:10,304
We encourage people to think about the way

236
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,084
that others feel with a slight tweak.

237
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:17,245
We keep all of our multiplayer doors on side paths.

238
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:21,446
And all main path doors are, all of them are single player.

239
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,539
That way, players can always progress on their own.

240
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,681
But if they can convince other players, often non-verbally,

241
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,343
only through chirps and emotes to follow them

242
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:34,384
to a secret area, they'll both be rewarded.

243
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:39,267
Most of the time, this means playing

244
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:42,148
with the other player for a bit and building some rapport.

245
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:48,965
maybe unlocking some friendship abilities or really just investing in them in any way

246
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:52,728
to prove to them that you won't just abandon them as soon as they change course.

247
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:57,830
It's a subtle difference, but one design encourages players to consider each other

248
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,553
and the other one doesn't. So for sure, there's a ton of opportunity for social cooperative play.

249
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:05,915
It's just important to keep in mind that

250
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:11,129
Whatever we're encouraging players to do with each other involves thinking about others as people,

251
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:14,711
and ideally also encourages them to consider the way they think and feel.

252
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:21,755
So to review, a few of the key points I've discussed.

253
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:28,498
Goal-oriented play is the enemy of social play. Players really need a chance to relax

254
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:31,980
and get a little bored before they start focusing on each other.

255
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:37,662
Play becomes social when it requires you to understand and empathize with others,

256
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:43,026
and giving players the ability to express themselves in unique ways is how players

257
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:50,672
form connections. A few more notes on best practices for encouraging social play.

258
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:55,616
We don't force players to perform any of these interactions.

259
00:16:56,817 --> 00:17:00,179
Players can complete the whole story arc without the help of others.

260
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,491
This is important because as soon as you start thinking that someone is doing something with you,

261
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,852
because the designer has forced them to, even if the designer hasn't,

262
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:15,874
you lose a little bit of trust in the other player that they're being genuine.

263
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:23,615
So a tutorial quest to join a guild or a daily task to send a gift can potentially do a lot more

264
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:29,457
harm than good. A good example of where we've used this learning is sending gift messages to

265
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:30,877
other players asynchronously.

266
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:34,695
We've considered having a send-all button,

267
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:40,216
but instead it takes time to send a gift to each person individually.

268
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:44,558
Without this, I think we would be missing out on an opportunity for players to

269
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:50,659
build additional trust with each other. Also, as you play Sky, you start to

270
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:53,740
develop a bit of a sense for the types of players there are.

271
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,841
There are some who dive into

272
00:17:57,095 --> 00:18:03,539
relationships too quickly, and others that are measured or conservative in offering or accepting gifts.

273
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,202
This is another place where we encourage players to think about how the other feels,

274
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:11,545
to time the next step in the relationship in a comfortable way.

275
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:18,609
Something that has come up continually as we've developed and maintained Sky,

276
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,772
with all of these social tools at players' disposal and

277
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,467
With the rest of the experience really designed to get people

278
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,508
interacting with each other, it's

279
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:31,289
totally possible to have an awkward encounter

280
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:32,010
with another player.

281
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,552
And something we've tried to balance really carefully

282
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:39,313
is how much or how little we protect players

283
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:43,415
from these interactions, aside from a bug or a violation

284
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:46,956
of our terms of service and just pure social awkwardness

285
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:47,677
I'm talking about.

286
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:51,598
As a prime example, a mismatched level

287
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,259
of investment between two players.

288
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,439
where let's say a player chooses not to reciprocate a gift,

289
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,100
we stay pretty hands-off.

290
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:01,943
This is related to the earlier point

291
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:05,306
where it's best to avoid forcing players to interact

292
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:06,747
because it removes trust.

293
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:08,829
I think by the same token,

294
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:12,752
removing the stakes involved in investing in another player

295
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:15,615
also removes the opportunity to be vulnerable.

296
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:21,580
There are a lot of ways to experience drama in a game.

297
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:27,290
It can come from a narrow escape in combat, great direct or environmental storytelling,

298
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,051
or any number of places.

299
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:34,494
For a big portion of Sky players, that drama comes from real interpersonal experiences,

300
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:39,176
being slightly vulnerable in front of others and eventually paying off in terms of them

301
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:42,678
reciprocating and forming a deeper connection with the other person.

302
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,040
I think you need a range of social interaction.

303
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,581
You need the lows to really appreciate the highs.

304
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:56,288
Ultimately, what I think is crucial to designing social experiences is giving players the opportunity

305
00:19:56,368 --> 00:20:01,455
to anticipate other people's thoughts and feelings and act on those in some expressive,

306
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:05,420
creative, caring, and tangible way. Thank you for listening.
