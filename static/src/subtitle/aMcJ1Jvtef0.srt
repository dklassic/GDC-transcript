1
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:14,340
So my name is Mark Ferrari, and I am going to start with a little slideshow of some of

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,163
my previous work, because I'm not assuming that a lot of you know who I am.

3
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:22,426
I think you're probably here because you're interested in 8-bit and 8-bit-ish art, whatever

4
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:26,429
that is, and you're probably saying, yeah, and Mark Ferrari, who is that?

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,874
So I started with Lucasfilm Games when I was...

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,311
Excuse me?

7
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:36,913
Oh, right.

8
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:38,314
I'm supposed to press this button.

9
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:39,635
There we go.

10
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:46,741
I started with Lucasfilm Games before any of you were born.

11
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:50,384
And we made everything with this palette, those 16 colors.

12
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:52,266
And this is what the art looked like.

13
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,268
We didn't just have those 16 colors for this game.

14
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:58,471
The entire industry had those specific 16 colors

15
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,972
to do every game they did.

16
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:01,473
Those 16 colors.

17
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:09,243
were arrived at by well-intentioned programmers who simply slid the RGB numbers to even intervals

18
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,884
and said, look how symmetrical, how balanced we're done.

19
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:16,327
And the rest of us were left to do the crying and the cleanup.

20
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:23,211
So when I was hired at Lucasfilm, we couldn't even dither these colors because dither didn't

21
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,672
compress in those days.

22
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:29,195
So I did the best I could to do this.

23
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:35,773
And then we went on to dither.

24
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:37,914
I had a little something to do with this.

25
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:42,096
I put up some pictures on screen one day

26
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:43,836
after we were done with Zach McCracken

27
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,017
and the alien mind benders,

28
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:46,978
which those things were just from,

29
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,599
and I said, you know, if we used dither,

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,280
our pictures could look like this.

31
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,982
And believe it or not, this was a lot better.

32
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:00,743
So, inspired by that,

33
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:07,648
We learned how to compress dither thanks to Ron Gilbert, who is sitting in this room someplace.

34
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:13,329
And we made a game where you could actually have six or seven different kinds of blue,

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,851
rather than just four, because of the fact that we could dither it.

36
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:23,192
This was all EGA. It was all, as you can see, very low resolution.

37
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:28,766
This game actually won graphics awards.

38
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,767
Some people actually thought it was a VGA game

39
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:33,528
because they'd never seen EGA graphics look like this.

40
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,490
When we were done with that,

41
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,391
we went on to make a game called The Secret of Monkey Island,

42
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,492
which some of you have probably heard of.

43
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:45,473
The Secret of Monkey Island,

44
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:47,474
we really got the use of Dither Down.

45
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:52,156
In The Secret of Monkey Island,

46
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:56,888
We could have places that looked a lot less flat than those Zach McCracken environments.

47
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:59,548
We could have real sunsets in EGA.

48
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,430
We could have atmospheric perspective.

49
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,591
We could have depth of field still in EGA.

50
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,872
We could render sand so that it looked a little bit like sand

51
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:20,253
and not like a large yellow spot that someone had forgotten to color in.

52
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:25,346
It was exciting and inspirational for us artists.

53
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,329
And then we moved on from there.

54
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:36,015
I'm gonna now just put on a slideshow of other 256 color.

55
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:43,221
8-bit art I have done.

56
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:46,804
Everything you're seeing now was done 8-bit.

57
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:49,446
This is not 8-bit-ish art yet.

58
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,627
I'll get to that in a minute.

59
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:57,839
And this is stuff that I have done since then. This was for the very last GBA Spyro game ever made, as far as I know.

60
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,422
This is what I've been doing.

61
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:05,446
And while this is showing, I would like to talk a little bit about

62
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:13,112
the reason I am so, and remained so, interested in 8-bit, 256 color, limited palette art,

63
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:17,796
even after there was any technological or game design imperative to use it.

64
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:22,552
I am interested in it because it was so incredibly limited.

65
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:28,657
I don't actually have any desire to do EGA art ever again in my life, but I will say

66
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:34,782
that the most creative work I ever did was done when I just had those 16 horrible colors

67
00:04:34,862 --> 00:04:35,383
to do it in.

68
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:40,845
If somebody gives you two gum wrappers and three sticks and tells you to make the pieta with this,

69
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:45,507
you will take two gum wrappers and three sticks as far as they can possibly go

70
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:48,628
in your effort to accomplish your mission.

71
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:54,591
If somebody gives you all the artistic resources of the universe and says make the pieta with this,

72
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:59,673
you will dabble in all of those resources until the time is up and you have made nothing at all.

73
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:04,234
I think this is one of the challenges that's been facing our industry for some time,

74
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:08,175
is that the resources are so many now, they are so vast,

75
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:12,957
and they replace themselves and render themselves obsolete so quickly

76
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:17,898
that nobody has the time to do anything but just dabble for a moment in the current

77
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,040
resource du jour before it's gone, and they are busy scrambling to learn

78
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,741
just the merest proficiency of the next one.

79
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:33,386
Back in these days, I was able to work with Deluxe Paint 2 by Electronic Arts for 10 years

80
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,369
before I had to give that up and go on to the next art tool.

81
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:42,113
And during that 10 years, I was able to do things with Deluxe Paint that I don't think

82
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:45,375
even EA ever imagined would be done with Deluxe Paint.

83
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:47,977
I'm going to get out of this for a moment

84
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:53,961
and show you some of what I ended up doing with Deluxe Paint.

85
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:58,129
All of the animation that you see in these scenes right now

86
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:00,630
is done with ColorCycling.

87
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,150
There are no frames here.

88
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,371
There's no extra pieces of art.

89
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,013
This is actually an HTML5 ColorCycling emulator

90
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:12,514
created by Joe Huckabee, whom I will

91
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:13,634
mention a little bit later.

92
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:17,236
so that anybody could see these pieces.

93
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,136
These were done for software products

94
00:06:19,176 --> 00:06:20,537
that had been dead for ages,

95
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:25,259
until Joe learned how to show them happening on the web,

96
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,841
and then they became pretty widely seen

97
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,082
and pretty widely liked.

98
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:35,464
So here are snowflakes falling on a picture.

99
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:37,525
There is no actual transparency here.

100
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,946
This is one layer of eight-bit art

101
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:43,988
with apparently transparent snowflakes falling in it.

102
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:46,789
Here's Waterfall and Rain.

103
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:55,635
I will be talking just a little bit later about specifically how I did some of these

104
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,276
effects in an 8-bit environment.

105
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:06,943
Today Deluxe Paint 2 is barely usable even in a DOS emulator, as you will see when I

106
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:09,905
try to use it in a DOS emulator in just a little while.

107
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,640
The only real tool for producing true 8-bit art

108
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,761
that I know of out there right now

109
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:20,182
is a program many of you probably know called Promotion.

110
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:23,503
I am actually very grateful to Cosmigo

111
00:07:23,563 --> 00:07:25,863
for doing all that he has done

112
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:29,805
to keep an 8-bit tool alive and functioning out there.

113
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:33,186
But I have to say, there are a number of things

114
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:39,167
DeepPaint did that Promotion doesn't.

115
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,708
And some of them are pretty important.

116
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:52,844
Right now, I'm not sure that there are ways to do some of what I did these pictures with in DeepPaint, which is what these were all done in DeepPaint.

117
00:07:54,658 --> 00:08:02,784
However, I will say that Joe Huckabee hopes to have a product ready to look at sometime next year that does all of this again,

118
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:05,546
and at the higher resolutions you want.

119
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:12,711
So those of you who are really waiting for a tool you can do stuff like this in 8-bit will probably have it sometime next year.

120
00:08:13,732 --> 00:08:16,714
In the meantime, I'm left to ask myself, as people...

121
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:23,334
invite me to talk here why we are so interested in 8-bit art when in fact

122
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:26,716
there's so little way to produce it anymore and

123
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:28,337
so few really

124
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:34,139
integrally compelling reasons to be doing 8-bit art in today's

125
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,921
gaming universe and I have pretty much come to the conclusion that

126
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,183
most of you are probably here because you just love this aesthetic

127
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:49,592
Because maybe some of you remember playing games that looked and felt like this when you were younger

128
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:56,479
before the very cinemagraphic first-person shooters that we mostly play today came along.

129
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:02,027
Maybe some of you really love 8-bit because you've never seen anything like this,

130
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:07,568
being much younger and not have played these games back or used these products back when they were made.

131
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:13,570
Whatever your reasons, I'm going to assume that you're here for inspiration about thinking about 8-bit art.

132
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:20,192
And the first thing I want to say along those lines is that for me, 8-bit art is all about

133
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:24,093
an environment that is small enough to be creative in.

134
00:09:25,046 --> 00:09:28,997
What can you think to do with pixels and with a limited palette?

135
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:32,363
The great thing about a limited palette is that you can use it.

136
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:33,604
You can manipulate it.

137
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:36,406
It isn't just there, a giant ineffable cloud,

138
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,207
like the 32-bit universe that provides

139
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:40,568
whatever is called for.

140
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:42,709
You can actually go in and fool around.

141
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,771
What you're seeing over there on the right-hand side

142
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:49,233
of these things is, your right-hand side, I assume,

143
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,234
is the palette operating.

144
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:54,316
So you can see what parts are actually cycling

145
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:55,336
and what parts aren't.

146
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:00,738
Once I figured out how to do effects like these with color cycling,

147
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:09,824
I went on to figure out how we could do more with an 8-bit environment.

148
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,186
So here we're going to see some of those same scenes.

149
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:23,833
So what you're going to see now...

150
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:27,967
does not involve any extra frames of art either.

151
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,890
Not a single animation frame,

152
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:32,915
not a single second piece of art.

153
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:38,243
What you're seeing now is all done simply by changing palettes on this one picture.

154
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:47,553
Once I figured out how to rotate palette positions to create the sense of animation for almost any environmental effect I could think of,

155
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:52,797
I started trying to figure out how to make the whole picture change by constructing it,

156
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:58,982
so that using palettes we could get it at any time of day in virtually any weather condition.

157
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:04,026
I'm flipping quickly forward to get you some of the more interesting ones.

158
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:05,567
Actually, that was an interesting one.

159
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:20,372
These were for a product that put these,

160
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:23,193
originally put these pictures up on screen 24 hours.

161
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:25,093
And anytime you looked at your screen,

162
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,054
it was the same time of day in the picture

163
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:29,034
that it was outside your actual windows.

164
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:32,775
And all done with palette shifting.

165
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:45,239
Now I'm gonna show you another little trick

166
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,199
with palette shifting.

167
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:51,425
that I figured out in extremis about seven or eight,

168
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:53,506
maybe 10 years ago, I can't remember.

169
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:01,729
So we were doing a game for one of these little

170
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:03,170
you plug it into your TV,

171
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,430
the game is in the controller things.

172
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:07,291
It was an X-Men game.

173
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:09,592
And suddenly, after all these years,

174
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:12,213
storage and processing time and all the rest of that

175
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,374
really was an issue.

176
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,564
So we needed to cram as much art as we could in as little space as possible.

177
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:25,009
So we had this game, it was a storm game, the character Storm.

178
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,571
She fights people off while flying through the air.

179
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:28,912
So we needed a lot of backgrounds.

180
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:31,635
These backgrounds were all designed to scanline parallax.

181
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:34,517
So they were whizzing by underneath you in a kind of perspective.

182
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:37,120
And we needed as many of these environments as we could,

183
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,421
but we didn't really have much space.

184
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:43,184
So here's a valley scene. Imagine storm is flying along up here.

185
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:46,706
First of all, we wanted these scenes at different times of day.

186
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:54,010
So I just used the same old palette tricks you've already seen to...

187
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:58,572
I'm going to load a palette now. So there we are at sunset.

188
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,293
And then I'm going to load another palette now.

189
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:04,815
And there we are at night.

190
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,221
you'll notice that some clouds changed and disappeared in there,

191
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:13,302
but we also needed other environments.

192
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:16,802
So, now I'm going to load another palette,

193
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:23,924
and we'll just get rid of those hills and all those trees,

194
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:26,765
and now we're up in the stratosphere looking down at clouds.

195
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,105
I'm going to load another palette here.

196
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,266
Here we are at sunset.

197
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:43,993
Here we are at night, but we really wanted some diversity too.

198
00:13:44,393 --> 00:13:46,873
The clever observer can still see those trees in there.

199
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:49,314
They look like clouds now, but they're still trees.

200
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,995
So can we do anything more with palettes?

201
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:54,176
Well, okay, let's do something really different.

202
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:56,337
How about that?

203
00:13:58,657 --> 00:14:02,039
I did not change the picture, I just changed the palette.

204
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,060
And here's that palette in the evening.

205
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,761
Oh, nope, nope, sorry, wrong palette.

206
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:18,836
cloud, city, they look the same. Here's that city in the evening. Here's that city at night.

207
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,324
So there are basically three scenes at three times a day in this one piece of art, and

208
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:30,047
I will be talking a little later about how I do that as well.

209
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:38,196
Again, it's not so much that I expect you to run out and do palette shift effects like this, or color cycling effects like this.

210
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:44,041
It's just, there was so much more to do with a palette that you could control color by color,

211
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:46,364
that you could fiddle with the positions of things,

212
00:14:47,444 --> 00:14:53,090
there was so much more you could do because the environment was small enough that you could actually think about it that way.

213
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:00,286
And I think that that is probably part of the reason why 8-bit and 8-bit-ish art is still so relevant today

214
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:04,429
is because it was a mentally and creatively manageable space to work in,

215
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:10,494
which I'm not sure a lot of our other much more cinematographic and three-dimensional things are quite the same,

216
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:15,398
and because it wasn't going to evolve so quickly that as soon as you began to figure out what was going on,

217
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,200
everything had changed and you had to start over.

218
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,308
Before I talk about any of that, however,

219
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:22,789
I think the real reason I am here today

220
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:25,871
is probably because I have been given the tremendous honor

221
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:31,014
and really enjoyable opportunity

222
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:34,116
to work with Ron Gilbert, Gary Winnick, and David Fox

223
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,878
on a game called Thimbleweed Park.

224
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,561
And I'm gonna put on a slideshow now

225
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:43,842
while I talk about that.

226
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:50,773
Let's see here.

227
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:52,577
There we go.

228
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,387
So these are some backgrounds that I'm doing now

229
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,710
for Thimbleweed Park.

230
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:01,825
About a year ago, recognizing that there were a lot of people

231
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:05,368
out there with a deep hunger for 8-bit and 8-bit-ish games,

232
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:10,052
after all this time, Ron and Gary decided to try a

233
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:12,394
Kickstarter, where they basically told people, if

234
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:15,877
you'll fund us, we will do a game like the Lucasfilm

235
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:19,340
Adventure games that you used to play in the late 80s, as if

236
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,384
you bought one and just found it now, realized you never

237
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,566
opened it, unwrapped it, and started to play.

238
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:29,447
If you've heard about the Thimbleweed Kickstarter at all,

239
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,848
you know that it was very, very, very successful.

240
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:34,408
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars

241
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:37,909
raised in 30 days, and that indicated there was interest.

242
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,030
So, they've been doing that game.

243
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,911
They have invited me to do the backgrounds for that game

244
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:45,692
because I was the guy that did backgrounds

245
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:47,572
for a lot of the games that people are remembering

246
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,093
so nostalgically when they do it.

247
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:51,713
However, as we really began thinking

248
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:53,514
about what specifically to draw,

249
00:16:54,887 --> 00:17:03,330
We realized that while people have a marvelous memory of playing these games when they were young,

250
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,912
some people at least, they might not actually want exactly what would have been produced in 1987.

251
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:15,375
I remind you of the first slides I showed of the EGA palette and the artwork we made with it.

252
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:22,040
If people sat down to an EGA game right now with solid colors like they would really have gotten in 1987,

253
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,024
it might have been like going to a Renaissance fair and finding yourself in the actual Renaissance,

254
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:31,428
with sewage flowing in the streets, and people with hideous deformities,

255
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:34,651
and everybody smelling like people really smelled in the Renaissance.

256
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,133
They might prefer the Renaissance fair.

257
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:44,203
So, what we have decided to attempt to do is provide a game that feels just like people

258
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:50,793
remember these games feeling, and plays a lot like they remember them playing, except

259
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:50,933
that...

260
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:57,623
Ron and Gary and David Fox have had decades to learn from the way they put those games together.

261
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:04,508
So now, not only are we tweaking the art a little so that it's Renaissance fare, not the actual Renaissance,

262
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:09,632
they have also had the chance to tweak the game design, the interface, all of those things,

263
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:13,034
so that they look and feel just like you remember them feeling,

264
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:18,598
but all of the things you didn't like about those earlier games have now been amended.

265
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,881
They play more intuitively.

266
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:24,966
They don't frustrate in the ways that some of the earlier

267
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:26,267
games might have frustrated.

268
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:28,570
And they don't force you to look at EGA.

269
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,013
And yet, you can see the pixels.

270
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,356
It looks pretty 256 colorish.

271
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,238
So this is not 8-bit art.

272
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,101
This is being done in Photoshop.

273
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:38,162
And

274
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:43,274
It is being done to feel like VGA 8-bit graphics.

275
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:45,174
I don't actually count colors.

276
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:49,155
I'm sure there's many times 256 colors in some of these pictures.

277
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:54,996
Again, I decided that, we all decided, I think, that what we wanted to do is the art we would

278
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:59,597
like to have made in those days in a way that feels like the art we did in those days.

279
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:02,058
That is what I mean by 8-bit-ish art.

280
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:06,578
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about how I'm doing that as well.

281
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:13,241
And I have all sorts of demos that I can show you, but for the sake of brevity, I actually...

282
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:14,862
Let me see a show of hands.

283
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:19,945
How many people here would rather hear me talk about what I'm doing with the 8-bit-ish art now?

284
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:28,509
Or how many people would like me to talk more about how I did those things with color cycling and palette shifting in an actual index color tool?

285
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,371
So, 8-bit-ish art now, raise your hands if you want me to start with that.

286
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:34,592
Okay.

287
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:36,493
8-bit color cycling and...

288
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:44,453
Okay, I admire you, you poor little remnant of people who actually wants to hear about 8-bit art,

289
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:46,635
but I guess I will start with Thimbleweed Park then.

290
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:55,782
So, basically, let me...

291
00:19:55,802 --> 00:20:04,349
Okay, where did I put them?

292
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:16,531
Okay, so I start by just doing a sketch like this.

293
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:18,915
Oh, you don't want to see it that way.

294
00:20:20,938 --> 00:20:21,339
There we go.

295
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:25,234
So this is just done with the brush tool.

296
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,817
I'm just laying out the room and giving myself

297
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:30,260
some quick indication of what's going to be in the room.

298
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:32,262
If I'm not sure something's actually

299
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:34,105
going to fit at resolution, I actually

300
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:36,568
draw it in hard pixels so that I make sure

301
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:38,249
that we can actually put a machine with all

302
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:38,970
of these features.

303
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:46,997
Ron will sometimes give me ten whole pixels of space and tell me that he wants the thing to have mechanical arms and a keyboard

304
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:55,925
and a place for the keys to show and paper coming out of it and fifteen lines of poetry in Aramaic

305
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,448
and I have to figure out how to do that in ten pixels.

306
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:03,171
So, I will now and then make sure it's possible before I start.

307
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:06,133
Once I...

308
00:21:07,445 --> 00:21:09,507
Let me actually do this slideshow style.

309
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:22,775
Pardon the delay here.

310
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:24,536
Things I didn't anticipate.

311
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:30,580
Okay.

312
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:34,642
So,

313
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,203
Then I will start just coloring the room in,

314
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:42,165
trying to get a better sense of the space,

315
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:44,327
and then I start making these templates.

316
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:46,169
This is how I actually light the room.

317
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:47,930
I will create a pool of light,

318
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:49,452
I will create a bunch of them,

319
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:51,073
wherever there's supposed to be light on the wall,

320
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:56,658
and then I will use magic wand selections on those things.

321
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,900
and start just using color balance to add yellow to the wall.

322
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,522
And I'll start with the center circle and then I'll add a little bit more yellow

323
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:10,784
and then I'll go to the first the center and the next circle out and add a little bit more yellow

324
00:22:11,684 --> 00:22:16,326
and you know or blue or green or red or whatever. But basically I'm using color balance to add

325
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:21,068
light with and using selections to do it. It is very important to turn every

326
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:27,482
possible box to nearest neighbor. You have to do that in general preferences. You have to do that

327
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:33,106
in free transform. You have to do that in image size. There's so many places to turn every, to

328
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:37,670
the interpolation to nearest neighbor. You have to turn anti-aliasing off on every tool you're

329
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,834
going to use. Your selections cannot be aliased. Your pencil cannot be aliased. Your fills cannot

330
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:47,098
be aliased. Everywhere you can find an anti-alias box, you have to turn it off.

331
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:54,401
You're probably going to be using the pencil tool almost exclusively if you want to do 8-bit-ish art in Photoshop.

332
00:22:57,682 --> 00:23:03,844
There are ways to do anti-aliasing a little more easily than in the old days.

333
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:19,906
Here's a jaggedy line that I want to anti-alias.

334
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:22,767
I will make a selection

335
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:24,628
of that line.

336
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:27,489
I will move it over one.

337
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:29,570
I will

338
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:35,213
press Alt and remove all of that selection that is still covering the line

339
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:36,434
and

340
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:39,695
then I'll just adjust the color.

341
00:23:43,077 --> 00:23:44,297
I'm going to hide the selection

342
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:46,818
so that I can see what I'm doing and I will just...

343
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:52,352
Every now and then Photoshop tells me something I know, just to make sure.

344
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,294
And I'll adjust the color.

345
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:57,977
And then bringing that selection back, I'll just move it over one

346
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:01,059
and I'll

347
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,381
adjust the color.

348
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:06,103
And in this way

349
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:11,187
I can very quickly adjust all those jags at once.

350
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,492
I'm doing this with a mouse now at home,

351
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:15,253
I work on a 21 inch Cintiq,

352
00:24:15,673 --> 00:24:18,336
which is a lot less awkward than doing this with a mouse,

353
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:19,196
I have to say.

354
00:24:19,897 --> 00:24:23,220
So, when I'm done, and then I'll do this up above as well,

355
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,582
and when I'm done, I quickly have anti-aliased

356
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:28,104
that whole line without going through one pixel at a time.

357
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:30,906
But, an awful lot of this still needs to be done

358
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:32,107
one pixel at a time.

359
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,690
So, we've had to make some other decisions too.

360
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:37,552
We started out

361
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:39,934
by

362
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:43,745
We started out with a lot of dither.

363
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:46,006
Let me find the radio station here.

364
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:49,668
So in the old days, I was sort of the dither guy.

365
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,630
I was the one that convinced everybody

366
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,551
that dither was a better way to do VGA,

367
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,912
and then I just kept doing it in VGA.

368
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:59,354
So you can see all of this dither in these walls.

369
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:02,997
Virtually all of that was actually placed

370
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:04,097
one pixel at a time.

371
00:25:04,478 --> 00:25:05,518
I used the pencil tool.

372
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:09,498
to stamp down all of those things and these funny patterns.

373
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:11,619
That turned out to be not very viable.

374
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:13,819
We have way more backgrounds than you've seen.

375
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:15,300
There are going to be way more.

376
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,380
By the way, all the artwork you're seeing here

377
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,320
is in progress.

378
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,381
A lot of it isn't even fully colored in yet.

379
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:21,841
It's all subject to change.

380
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:24,042
I just want to do that caveat as we're looking at it.

381
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:28,243
So, we decided to go with bands of color instead.

382
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:31,744
So, an awful lot of our rooms now.

383
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:40,075
Going back to Dolores's room, you can see that rather than dither, I am just doing

384
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:44,537
concentric bands of color. This is how we're shading things.

385
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:49,300
This is something there's actually time to do, times the dozens and dozens and dozens,

386
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,683
possibly hundreds of backgrounds. I'm never sure when Ron is going to give up and cut it out.

387
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:58,576
Every time I think I'm caught up, he comes up with another great idea.

388
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:02,942
It's like one of those anxiety dreams where every time you reach the front door of the haunted mansion

389
00:26:03,182 --> 00:26:07,948
and are about to run outside, it opens onto a new hallway full of twice as many ghosts.

390
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:10,544
It's a marvelous experience.

391
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:12,846
I want to make that clear, Ron, wherever you are.

392
00:26:13,126 --> 00:26:14,327
Very happy to be doing it.

393
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:20,132
So we are now using banded color rather than dithered color.

394
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,815
As I mentioned, we are no longer holding ourselves exclusively

395
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,878
to 256 colors.

396
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:30,680
In fact, I'm not even holding myself exclusively

397
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,942
to 1,500 colors if I need to.

398
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:34,944
We just want to make sure that it looks like it.

399
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,622
and feels like it, but don't actually go counting the colors.

400
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:47,185
So, I'm gonna go ahead and show this slideshow now,

401
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,346
and before I go on to talking more about.

402
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:55,981
real 8-bit techniques. All of you who have come here to talk about 8-bit-ish art, I'm

403
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:59,204
hoping that perhaps you have questions and we're going to take 10 or 15 minutes right

404
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:03,948
now to give you a chance to ask those questions. There are mics there and there in the aisle.

405
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:08,091
If you have a question, if you could please come to the nearest of those mics and ask

406
00:27:08,151 --> 00:27:10,073
it, I would be happy to answer them.

407
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:18,517
I've told you some of the most basic things, the importance of nearest neighbor, the importance of turning off anti-aliasing, the importance of using selections.

408
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:30,203
I find it's much easier to fill any color in and then use either the color balance or the hue value saturation controls to slide a bar around and find the color you want,

409
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:36,146
than it is to go into the palette and try and find the right color or make the right color like you might have done in an earlier tool.

410
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,468
So I'm going to start here and then just go back and forth. So what's your question?

411
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:49,176
So, as you grew as an artist, using tools that were newer and newer, and using techniques that you and others were developing,

412
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:54,239
would you say that your taste in 8-bit-ish art changed from 8-bit?

413
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,883
Or do you think that your taste was pretty solid and it's just the tools that changed?

414
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:12,342
Most of the artwork that I have done for the past 10 or 15 years has been 32-bit, high-resolution artwork for all sorts of concept art and game art and art for various publishing applications.

415
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:13,784
That's where my art went.

416
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:18,710
When Gary Winnick first met me and asked me if I wanted to work for Lucasfilm,

417
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,231
my first comment to him was,

418
00:28:20,771 --> 00:28:24,315
I would love to work for Lucasfilm, but I am a dyed-in-the-wool technophobe who's

419
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:27,157
never touched a computer, and I'm not sure I'm the guy for you.

420
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:29,759
And Gary's response was, we find it easier

421
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,502
to hire artists and teach them to use computers

422
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:35,684
than it is to find computer technicians and teach them to be artists.

423
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:38,347
I would say that the EGA palette is proof of that.

424
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:43,653
So that's what he did and the rest is kind of history.

425
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:47,478
But the truth is I have always primarily been in it for the art.

426
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,841
I am not a big gamer.

427
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,284
I am certainly not a tech person to this day.

428
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,867
I'm pretty much an artist.

429
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:56,690
So as the tools allowed us to do more and more art,

430
00:28:56,931 --> 00:28:57,932
I did more and more art.

431
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:11,889
However, as I said earlier, I have never had as much fun creatively as I did figuring out how to take this tool further and do things with it that made the pictures better, even things that nobody ever actually saw coming.

432
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:13,210
So I really...

433
00:29:14,642 --> 00:29:17,747
I enjoyed the creative experience of using

434
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,530
limited color palette more than I actually enjoy

435
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,072
the contemporary tools.

436
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:24,115
But I like the product that I'm getting out

437
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:25,277
a lot of the contemporary tools.

438
00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:27,300
I like the fact that I can take those images

439
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,362
everywhere I want to take them without constraint.

440
00:29:29,723 --> 00:29:31,045
So it's a yes or no answer.

441
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:32,006
Yes.

442
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:41,073
Yeah, what I'm trying to ask you here is like, I see the 8-bit-ish artwork you're doing right now,

443
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:48,399
and I think it's biggest strength. Actually, all of your art, it's biggest strength is the color itself.

444
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:51,862
So, do you have any tips as of...

445
00:29:52,662 --> 00:29:54,664
if it's good to start with pixel art,

446
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:57,026
or if you should do oils,

447
00:29:57,146 --> 00:29:59,408
and other traditional media to learn about color,

448
00:29:59,468 --> 00:30:02,671
and how to reach that sort of color harmony in your work,

449
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:05,173
because that's really what shines here for me.

450
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:07,054
Well, that's a really good question.

451
00:30:07,094 --> 00:30:08,095
Thank you for asking it.

452
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:11,378
One of the biggest challenges, I think,

453
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,581
in this age of digital art, is that lots of people.

454
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:18,123
Both administrators and employers and even artists themselves

455
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:24,327
Think that we have created tools that somehow do some or all of the art for you, and that is not true

456
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:31,032
When I was working at a software contractor a fairly large one in Seattle a number of years ago

457
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:36,656
I was asked to mentor a number of young artists a lot of them coming straight to us from places like DigiPen

458
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,257
you know in their very early 20s and

459
00:30:39,418 --> 00:30:44,103
And I was working with one of those artists, too, who is a really very good artist these days.

460
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:47,927
In fact, he's probably one of the most important artistic assets of his company at all.

461
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:53,152
But he was trying to do, in a 3D environment, he was trying to do a desert scene

462
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:56,396
where there was bright sunlight on these structures,

463
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:58,538
and he wanted the shadows to have that sort of dark...

464
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:02,241
cool look that they have, but he couldn't make it look right. Everything was just looking

465
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:06,103
like big blobs of spilled ink. So he asked me to come over and tell him, you know, how

466
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:12,428
can I fix this? And I said, well, I think you just need to ask yourself, you know, where

467
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:19,073
is the light in those shadows coming from? And he said, the secondary light source.

468
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,763
I said, no, and he pointed at the interface.

469
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:26,567
There's the secondary light source right there on that little globe.

470
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:27,048
No, no.

471
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:30,492
I mean, those aren't black, so there's light in them from somewhere.

472
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:33,877
They're shadows, so it's not the same thing that's lighting up all the sunlit

473
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:34,157
parts.

474
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:35,980
Where does the light in a shadow come from?

475
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:38,944
And he pointed to the color wheel.

476
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,961
And I realized, oh my God, he doesn't understand.

477
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,642
I'm asking questions about the world.

478
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:46,983
He thinks I'm asking questions about his tool.

479
00:31:47,683 --> 00:31:49,623
And eventually we got to the point

480
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:51,404
where he remembered to think,

481
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:54,305
while working in this 3D interface,

482
00:31:54,525 --> 00:31:56,786
he remembered to think about a planet

483
00:31:57,046 --> 00:31:59,427
where the star casts a warm yellow light

484
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:02,268
and the sky radiates a blue interference

485
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:03,828
and it's that blue skylight

486
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:06,049
that is filling any light you see in a shadow.

487
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:12,255
And so the shadows are so we started once he started thinking about the real world and how light functions out here

488
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:14,558
He was able to answer his own questions and do this thing

489
00:32:14,838 --> 00:32:21,125
But sometimes people don't think past the tool all of which is a long way of saying you still need art skills

490
00:32:21,365 --> 00:32:23,508
To do art in any digital environment

491
00:32:23,928 --> 00:32:29,391
If you don't know what you're trying to do and understand how it's done outside of that digital environment,

492
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:32,872
it's very unlikely you're going to make the tool do that part for you.

493
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:34,813
You've got to know what you're attempting to do.

494
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:39,676
So yes, it's great to learn as much about art outside digital tools as you can,

495
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:43,958
and if you're going to learn art inside digital tools, which more and more of us are going to do these days,

496
00:32:44,238 --> 00:32:46,959
you need to first use them as virtual...

497
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,001
traditional media kinds of tools not as

498
00:32:51,622 --> 00:32:57,004
Technical rendering tools because until you can do what you're trying to do with traditional media

499
00:32:57,204 --> 00:33:00,286
You're gonna have a very hard time doing that in digital media

500
00:33:00,306 --> 00:33:06,609
Yeah, having said that there are some things about using even digital media that I will just quickly say first of all

501
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:13,987
in some of these outdoor scenes like this vista scene or some of the street scenes that you've seen there

502
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:18,128
it is very important for me, like this, it's very important for me to do the sky

503
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:20,429
and the background landscape first

504
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:23,630
I can't, let me get out of this just for a minute

505
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,351
and actually pull up one of these street scenes and show you what it looks like with the sky turned off

506
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:48,407
So, where is B Street?

507
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:02,581
Okay, so, oh, these are JPEGs. Sorry.

508
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,933
I rearranged my entire desktop this morning so there wouldn't

509
00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:31,575
be a lot of confusing icons on the screen.

510
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:35,478
And now I am paying for that lack of foresight.

511
00:34:49,328 --> 00:34:49,809
OK.

512
00:34:50,749 --> 00:34:52,311
So here is B Street.

513
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:54,352
Let me magnify this a little.

514
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:01,440
Here are some of the couple layers involved.

515
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,963
If I turn off the sky,

516
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:10,188
all of the skies,

517
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:18,555
I usually work with a Cintiq,

518
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:22,919
which means that the screen is a different size, too.

519
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:25,201
I don't think this menu is going all the way to the bottom.

520
00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:40,635
All right, you can go away now.

521
00:35:41,415 --> 00:35:41,816
Hello.

522
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:44,437
Really?

523
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:46,178
Okay.

524
00:35:47,598 --> 00:35:50,320
All right, without the sky, these buildings look like this.

525
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,521
I would have no idea to make anything

526
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:55,082
on those buildings this color,

527
00:35:56,443 --> 00:35:59,324
if it weren't for, boy, I hope this isn't as tough.

528
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:09,928
Why is that happening? Hello?

529
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:14,431
All right, if it weren't for this blue sky behind this building I

530
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:17,594
Would have no idea what color to make anything

531
00:36:18,374 --> 00:36:20,396
So the first thing I do is turn off

532
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:26,360
You know is turn off everything except for the background and do that and then I draw the buildings into the background

533
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:31,824
Because the sky and the light in the background tells me everything I need to know about what color everything else is going to be

534
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:36,847
Another thing I would say is that when you're talking about my color sense in general

535
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:40,209
Contrast has a lot to do with why things work.

536
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:42,871
And I don't just mean contrast between light and dark.

537
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:46,012
I mean contrast between saturated and unsaturated color.

538
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:48,734
It's very important to have both in a drawing.

539
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:51,315
Saturation, I mean, it's contrast between warm colors

540
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:52,096
and cool colors.

541
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:54,237
It's probably pretty important to have both.

542
00:36:54,317 --> 00:36:56,338
Even if you're doing an underwater scene

543
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:58,399
that's almost entirely blues, greens, and purples,

544
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,600
there ought to be a little red and orange in it someplace,

545
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,201
or yellow, something, because something that has

546
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:06,183
no warm in it or no cool in it is gonna look monochrome

547
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:06,963
and kind of boring.

548
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:10,326
So I try and make sure there's saturation, contrast,

549
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:12,007
that there's color contrast, and that there's

550
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:14,069
value contrast in everything I do.

551
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:19,353
Pretty much anything you could say about standard art theory

552
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:21,015
would probably apply to digital art,

553
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:22,035
and you have to know that stuff,

554
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,457
because the tool doesn't know it for you.

555
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:25,919
So I should go on to another question now, yes.

556
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:27,480
Thank you.

557
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,483
Hey, I have a question about your time of day shifting

558
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:33,805
8-bit palette stuff, where you change the color palette

559
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:35,706
in order to do time of day, which is really cool.

560
00:37:35,947 --> 00:37:36,427
Thank you.

561
00:37:37,126 --> 00:37:39,608
How do you paint it when you're actually in iteration on it?

562
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:47,935
So what I do is I paint it in one time of day. I often just start with morning

563
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:50,418
where all of the faces...

564
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:53,200
For me, left is just sort of inherently east.

565
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,283
West is kind of inherently right.

566
00:37:57,764 --> 00:38:00,727
I just have all the light coming from the left-hand side of the picture

567
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:01,908
and I render it that way.

568
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,415
If I have a stretch of a rock pinnacle, for instance, that has...

569
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:09,738
First of all, I use very few colors.

570
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,282
When I'm doing that, pretty much

571
00:38:13,244 --> 00:38:16,669
everything except the sky is three to seven colors

572
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,551
for whatever the structure is.

573
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:22,733
this because of palette limitations? Because of palette limitations and here's why. If

574
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:28,556
I want sunlight to hit the top of that rock spire and then during the day move down, in

575
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:32,317
the morning there's going to have to be a highlight side that looks like it's got three

576
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:36,439
colors in it. But each of those three colors is actually going to have to have a dithered

577
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:38,800
gradient of five other colors in it.

578
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,862
So that you have five colors that all look like the same color in the morning,

579
00:38:43,102 --> 00:38:47,203
but as the light changes, some of these colors get darker or lighter and change hue.

580
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:51,765
So you're actually going to have a whole bunch of colors in that one little strip of highlight taupe

581
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:54,846
that are going to have to change at different times of day.

582
00:38:55,306 --> 00:38:59,848
So if I'm using more than three to seven colors for any object times...

583
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:07,904
four or five iterative colors inside each one of those colors, we're talking about a huge number of colors for this little rock spire.

584
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:15,426
So, no matter what feature I'm drawing, except for the sky, it probably doesn't have more than seven colors in it, and if possible, five or three.

585
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:21,667
For sky, I use 16 to 32 colors max. I do that so that the dither won't be as apparent.

586
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:30,917
If you really want to hide dither, the way to do it is a long gradient where the difference between this color and the next color in the dither gradient is so subtle that people don't see it clearly.

587
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,164
So sky I use more things for, and then I try to reserve half the palette for color cycling effects.

588
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:38,866
Half the palette will be...

589
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:43,209
color cycling ramps that can't obviously be used anywhere else in the drawing or

590
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:46,230
you know trees and buildings would be flashing strangely.

591
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:52,274
So I have to use half the palette for that which means another reason to constrain all of the static parts of the picture

592
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,034
to as few colors as possible.

593
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:56,836
Does that answer your question at all?

594
00:39:57,616 --> 00:40:02,819
Do you paint with one palette at a time so you can actually see positional like red is eastward and blue is westward?

595
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:04,520
Like do you paint with those types of palettes?

596
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:08,669
What I did was I would make one picture and then I would move it to a different time of day

597
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:13,454
and I would render it at a different time of day and I would just keep doing that to this one file

598
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:16,057
until I had done it to the entire cycle.

599
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:18,860
I would usually start in the morning and go through the day till evening.

600
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:22,825
And each time I go to a new time of day, there's a few more things I need to add to...

601
00:40:24,475 --> 00:40:25,496
the picture to do that.

602
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:30,180
But I do also a very simple map of the picture first,

603
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,602
just a very solid color blocked out picture

604
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:35,904
so that I can have some sense of what I'm gonna need

605
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:37,025
light to climb down on.

606
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:39,147
Because if I know that I'm gonna need light

607
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,268
to hit this first and then this,

608
00:40:41,528 --> 00:40:43,170
and it's a need to climb down these surfaces

609
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,932
or up these surfaces right from the start,

610
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:47,913
when I go to put in that highlight color,

611
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:49,835
I don't just put in the highlight color,

612
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,377
I can actually just fill it with a gradient of five colors

613
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:53,518
knowing that I'm gonna need to.

614
00:40:54,178 --> 00:40:56,381
They're all the same color now, they look like one color,

615
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,364
but I'm gonna need to change them as time goes by.

616
00:40:58,384 --> 00:40:59,545
Does that make sense?

617
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:00,106
Yeah, it does.

618
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:01,467
Okay, great, thank you.

619
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:02,128
Yes.

620
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:05,352
Hi, you said you did all your dithering by hand,

621
00:41:05,392 --> 00:41:06,153
pixel by pixel.

622
00:41:06,193 --> 00:41:09,197
Is there any kind of methodology or mental process you use

623
00:41:09,357 --> 00:41:09,678
when you're?

624
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:15,954
Creating that or yeah, it would be difficult to explain verbally right now, but basically I mean

625
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:17,957
I you know back in the EGA days

626
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:23,523
I was doing most of that by hand too if you're using a pattern that repeats obviously you make that pattern once and you stamp

627
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,465
It down as brushes, but a lot of times

628
00:41:28,168 --> 00:41:28,929
Let's see here

629
00:41:40,943 --> 00:41:47,046
When you're doing something like this, obviously in areas like these, there isn't any repeating pattern for you to use.

630
00:41:47,227 --> 00:41:50,408
So, the idea there is that you start with a checkerboard.

631
00:41:51,129 --> 00:41:53,630
and then it's every second pixel,

632
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,351
and then it's, and you move up,

633
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,692
and you're always adding a pixel.

634
00:41:57,792 --> 00:41:59,753
Each time you want the dither to be more diffuse,

635
00:41:59,773 --> 00:42:01,014
you're adding a pixel vertically

636
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:04,216
and a pixel horizontally to your spaces,

637
00:42:04,616 --> 00:42:07,758
and that just creates a kind of branching pattern

638
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:09,419
that reads fairly smoothly.

639
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:10,859
Back in the days we did this,

640
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:12,620
CTR monitors were so blurry

641
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:14,541
that we actually counted on the blur

642
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:17,403
to sort of fill those colors in and blend them for us.

643
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:19,244
That's no longer an option either.

644
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:24,269
But it didn't look quite this dotty back then, but it was still an improvement

645
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:31,175
So there is however something that I do and I'm really glad you asked this question in the 8 bit ish art that I forgot

646
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,357
To mention even though it's all on my outline

647
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:39,243
I I make an outline and then I leave it home usually I brought it this time at least that's a step forward

648
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:42,326
I actually create dither templates first

649
00:42:43,535 --> 00:42:48,317
Remember when I was talking about making lighting templates and then I just select the layer

650
00:42:48,477 --> 00:42:49,917
Well, I select the lighting template layer

651
00:42:49,957 --> 00:42:53,958
And I I use a magic wand selection of the center circle and then I go back to the wall

652
00:42:53,998 --> 00:42:58,539
And I just add some yellow to it and then I select both inner circles and add some more yellow to it

653
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:00,780
Well, I do the same thing with dither a lot of times

654
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,001
there's a lot of times when you just need straight banded dither or you need a straight kind of circular dither pattern or

655
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,720
a particular light shape of dither,

656
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:14,642
and when there's a dither sort of pattern like that

657
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:15,902
that you're going to need a lot of times,

658
00:43:16,122 --> 00:43:18,983
you can just make it in grays, in a grayscale dither,

659
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:20,884
and keep it as a file someplace,

660
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:22,605
and then you can drag it in as a layer,

661
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:25,406
and put it on the layer above or below this,

662
00:43:25,446 --> 00:43:27,366
and you can just select one of those colors,

663
00:43:27,386 --> 00:43:28,507
and then go back to your layer,

664
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:30,687
and move color balance or HSV around

665
00:43:30,727 --> 00:43:31,848
until you get the color you want,

666
00:43:32,088 --> 00:43:34,329
and then you select the next color in your dither pattern,

667
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:34,949
and just...

668
00:43:36,143 --> 00:43:39,846
If you want to see me do this, I'll do it in a minute later.

669
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:44,408
But that way, you can actually very quickly dither

670
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:47,230
a large area with horizontal or circular dither,

671
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,712
because of course, Photoshop does not have

672
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:50,773
dither gradient fills.

673
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:53,294
They just didn't see that coming, I guess.

674
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:54,375
So, yeah.

675
00:43:56,256 --> 00:43:56,536
Yes.

676
00:43:57,257 --> 00:43:58,377
G'day, I just had a question.

677
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:01,139
I guess it was kind of more centered on EGA technology.

678
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,321
So that's a very good screenshot for it.

679
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:19,381
When you're working with colors in the EGA palette, which is 16 colors, in an 8x8 pixel chunk, is it similar to the Commodore 64 where you're only limited to using 2 or 4 colors of that palette?

680
00:44:19,441 --> 00:44:26,408
Or can you use any of the 16 colors in that 8x8 pixel chunk? And if it's the former, how do you plan around that in your...

681
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:29,350
You're talking about EGA environment here?

682
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,430
Yeah.

683
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:33,992
Okay, so EGA you could use any of those 16 colors anywhere in the picture.

684
00:44:34,192 --> 00:44:34,692
Okay, cool.

685
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:39,715
CGA, which came before it, you were limited to four colors per little chunk of the picture.

686
00:44:39,935 --> 00:44:40,215
Okay.

687
00:44:40,355 --> 00:44:49,880
But when we went to EGA, we could put all 16 of those colors, all beautiful 16 of those colors, anywhere we wanted to in that picture, whether we liked it or not.

688
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,861
Geez, thanks very much.

689
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:51,321
Yes.

690
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:52,561
Yes.

691
00:44:53,155 --> 00:44:56,637
Hi! First of all, I wanted to say you're really inspiring to me.

692
00:44:56,977 --> 00:44:59,758
When I was a little kid, my dad actually showed me some of your art,

693
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:02,700
and it was just so mesmerizing and amazing to me.

694
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,941
And now that I'm a little older, I want to start working on, like,

695
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:07,422
pixel art and stuff seriously.

696
00:45:07,442 --> 00:45:11,324
So I was curious if you, like, had any advice for someone who's just getting into it,

697
00:45:11,344 --> 00:45:13,345
and, like, what are the best programs to start learning?

698
00:45:14,225 --> 00:45:18,646
Right now, the best program I can think of is promotion by Cosmigo.

699
00:45:19,307 --> 00:45:23,308
If any of you are interested in sort of keeping track of what Joe Huckabee is doing,

700
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:29,529
because I think he will be producing a far more flexible tool sometime next year,

701
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:35,170
his Twitter handle is just jhuckabee, that's J-H-U-C-K-A-B-E-Y,

702
00:45:35,891 --> 00:45:38,251
and he may have a better tool for you next year.

703
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:42,692
In terms of other advice, I would basically say...

704
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:57,452
One of the great things about using 8-bit art today as digital artists is that in the old days we were trying to create a commercial product with commercial imperatives within a very narrow time frame and within a very limited

705
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:04,319
Bunch of storage capacity there was a whole lot of things you had to do when you had to do very quickly

706
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,805
The beautiful thing about doing 8-bit art today is that nobody really needs you to do this in some

707
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:15,414
commercial template to a certain schedule and within certain limitations, which means you're doing this for yourself, so

708
00:46:16,536 --> 00:46:17,917
Take it as far as you can take it

709
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:21,058
You know, do what you love.

710
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:22,779
We couldn't do what we love in those days.

711
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:24,220
I did all sorts of things I could love.

712
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,682
And Ron rushed in and told me why, for technical reasons,

713
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,583
I could not do that.

714
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:29,684
So that was the experience.

715
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:30,645
You don't have that today.

716
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:33,927
So really enjoy the freedom of doing 8-bit art

717
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:37,469
in an age that doesn't need 8-bit art, just wants it.

718
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:39,611
That's, you know, like marriage.

719
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:41,452
It's better to need your partner than to,

720
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,694
I mean, better to want your partner than to need her.

721
00:46:44,973 --> 00:46:47,114
My wife is in this audience too, sorry Shannon,

722
00:46:47,134 --> 00:46:48,234
I'll get this right someday.

723
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:52,236
It's better to want your partner than to need them,

724
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,697
well it's better to want to do EGA art

725
00:46:54,757 --> 00:46:56,997
than it was to need to do EGA art,

726
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:59,058
I mean 8-bit art back when we did it.

727
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:02,260
Anybody else got any other questions?

728
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,280
No?

729
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,161
Then I am actually going to check to make sure

730
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:07,962
I haven't left anything really crucial

731
00:47:09,362 --> 00:47:10,563
out of my 8-bit-ish

732
00:47:13,032 --> 00:47:17,134
Oh, yeah, I was going to show you this. I'm putting glasses on over my glasses.

733
00:47:18,075 --> 00:47:20,696
Someday you'll be this old, too. Don't laugh too hard.

734
00:47:24,459 --> 00:47:29,462
Okay, I don't know why that's happening, but it's really annoying me.

735
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:39,568
Okay, so underneath this, I have this. This is a dither template,

736
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:42,430
and hopefully that's big enough that you can see.

737
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:51,943
how that's arranged. On top of it, I just have a solid color.

738
00:47:52,263 --> 00:47:56,444
So if I want to apply dither to that color, I just select this,

739
00:47:58,405 --> 00:48:02,507
tap it with the wand, go back to this. I'm going to hide the selection for a moment,

740
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:06,668
and then I will just slide it to the color that I want.

741
00:48:08,076 --> 00:48:13,682
And then I will go back down to this gradient and tap it with the magic wand and go back to the layer I'm dithering,

742
00:48:14,322 --> 00:48:18,666
hide the selection so I can see what I'm doing, and then go back.

743
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:25,834
And this is ever so much easier to do with a Wacom stylus than it is with a mouse.

744
00:48:26,694 --> 00:48:30,999
Then I'll go back, tap the next layer of dither, hide the selection, and...

745
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:38,492
do the color I want and I can just go straight up. That way I don't have to place a single

746
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:43,576
pixel with the pencil tool. I've already done that. And I can create these dither templates

747
00:48:43,616 --> 00:48:47,719
in promotion. I can just fill a screen with an actual gradient fill and turn it, save

748
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:52,362
it as a BMP and drag it into Photoshop to use as a template here. So I never actually

749
00:48:52,382 --> 00:48:52,522
had

750
00:48:53,203 --> 00:48:54,804
to create these templates by hand.

751
00:48:54,884 --> 00:48:56,066
I let Promotion do that.

752
00:48:57,146 --> 00:48:58,408
The only problem you're gonna get into

753
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,949
is in a room where you have dither

754
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:01,170
in all sorts of funny shapes.

755
00:49:01,631 --> 00:49:03,592
One of the great things that Promotion

756
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:05,914
and Depaint and tools that were made

757
00:49:06,135 --> 00:49:09,117
for index color art have is they have gradient fills

758
00:49:09,177 --> 00:49:12,320
including a contour fill that will fill

759
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,982
conforming to the shape of the space

760
00:49:14,002 --> 00:49:16,244
you're trying to fill in a variety of different ways.

761
00:49:17,483 --> 00:49:19,364
There is no way to do that in Photoshop

762
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:21,106
except doing it by hand.

763
00:49:21,987 --> 00:49:25,930
Or taking that shape into promotion as a BMP,

764
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:28,432
filling that shape with a contour gradient filled air,

765
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:30,814
saving it as a BMP, bringing it back,

766
00:49:30,854 --> 00:49:32,495
and using that as a template.

767
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:34,236
You won't be able to,

768
00:49:34,537 --> 00:49:36,538
it probably won't be in the colors you actually want it to be

769
00:49:36,578 --> 00:49:37,879
but it'll make a nice template

770
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,803
for you to arrange those colors with color balance

771
00:49:41,863 --> 00:49:44,745
and hue value saturation slider bars.

772
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:59,303
So, um, so, okay, so I am going to now talk about the effects I did with color cycling.

773
00:50:00,604 --> 00:50:07,488
Um, I'm going to kill Photoshop and hope it comes up well when, if we use it again.

774
00:50:08,569 --> 00:50:13,892
So, uh, I'm going to go back to Joe Huckabee's.

775
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:16,345
website.

776
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:33,575
Okay. So,

777
00:50:36,177 --> 00:50:37,458
first of all, this moving

778
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:40,480
moray of a waterfall.

779
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:48,527
In here, I'm going to sort of show you how that was laid out and done because there are a number of things you would need to know

780
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:07,059
Best laid plans of mice and men

781
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:30,632
Now, okay, why isn't promotion opening this file?

782
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:41,395
There we go, okay.

783
00:51:42,616 --> 00:51:44,036
This is how you make a waterfall.

784
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:48,137
First you start.

785
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:54,368
with a template to pour a contour gradient into, a vertical contour gradient in this point.

786
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:58,251
You're going to want that vertical contour to repeat.

787
00:51:59,191 --> 00:52:04,875
Now the way to control the speed of your motion is with the length, not the speed of the gradient.

788
00:52:05,015 --> 00:52:09,378
So for instance, as the water first starts over the falls here, it looks like it's moving very slowly.

789
00:52:09,738 --> 00:52:13,561
By the time it's pouring down the front of the falls, it looks like it's moving much more rapidly.

790
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,261
the speed of the gradient isn't changing.

791
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,122
That's all one gradient at one speed.

792
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:21,103
But by putting that gradient in very short little segments,

793
00:52:21,523 --> 00:52:24,385
it only has to move, that color shift only has to move

794
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:26,046
three pixels of vertical distance.

795
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:28,047
Down here, that color shift needs to move

796
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:30,348
five, 10 pixels of vertical distance.

797
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:32,829
It has to all happen in the same period of time,

798
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:34,610
so that color shift is gonna happen.

799
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:38,591
faster in a long gradient than it is in a short gradient.

800
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:41,792
So you're gonna use vertical stuff to control your speed.

801
00:52:42,152 --> 00:52:45,233
So you want the things at the top to be shorter vertically

802
00:52:45,673 --> 00:52:47,873
and the spaces at the bottom to be longer vertically

803
00:52:47,893 --> 00:52:50,834
while you fill it with that contour gradient

804
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,354
so that your waterfall pours slowly over the lip

805
00:52:53,395 --> 00:52:55,035
and then picks up speed as it falls.

806
00:52:55,895 --> 00:52:57,816
Secondly, these little yellow bands in here

807
00:52:57,896 --> 00:53:00,336
are to bridge the seam between these gradients.

808
00:53:00,896 --> 00:53:02,637
If you just make different segments

809
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:04,817
and pour the same gradient into it.

810
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:11,423
The the transition between each color in that cycling gradient is dithered until you reach the end of the gradient

811
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:12,904
Then there's this sharp cutoff

812
00:53:13,164 --> 00:53:18,168
Between the last color in the gradient and the first color in the gradient and if you leave it that way there will be this

813
00:53:18,248 --> 00:53:26,535
Knife edge line where things flash in the middle of this otherwise smooth movement, so you actually need to fill those little yellow margins with a

814
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:28,657
vertical gradient and put

815
00:53:29,938 --> 00:53:34,139
fill the top half with the last color of the gradient above it

816
00:53:34,259 --> 00:53:37,361
and fill the bottom half with the first color in the gradient below it

817
00:53:37,761 --> 00:53:42,323
so that there is never a point at which you just have a hard edge between one color and the next.

818
00:53:43,906 --> 00:53:45,727
So that's what I'm doing in these first four things.

819
00:53:45,787 --> 00:53:49,469
I'm putting in, I'm filling this with the bottom color

820
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:50,729
and this with the top color.

821
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,230
Then you want to create a checkerboard

822
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,271
to create the semblance of transparency.

823
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:56,952
Transparency is something you don't have

824
00:53:57,272 --> 00:53:59,873
in an eight bit art file usually,

825
00:53:59,893 --> 00:54:01,774
at least you certainly didn't when we worked with them.

826
00:54:02,555 --> 00:54:07,037
So you create a checkerboard dither.

827
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,000
And you fill.

828
00:54:14,737 --> 00:54:17,779
one of the colors with the pattern,

829
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,220
the cycling pattern you just made,

830
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,861
and then you move it over slightly,

831
00:54:22,202 --> 00:54:23,542
and you fill the other color with it.

832
00:54:23,923 --> 00:54:26,464
So every other pixel is showing you one iteration

833
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:29,086
of that cycling texture you just made,

834
00:54:29,526 --> 00:54:31,888
and the pixels in between are showing you a different one.

835
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:34,970
And that way, you can sort of cross this pattern

836
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:40,453
with itself to get this sort of moving moray

837
00:54:40,533 --> 00:54:42,094
that you see over here.

838
00:54:42,715 --> 00:54:43,696
So one pattern.

839
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:51,082
transparently over another by simply filling the two patterns that you want to be transparent into every other pixel.

840
00:54:54,363 --> 00:55:00,784
Then you're going to create that very same pattern remapped

841
00:55:00,804 --> 00:55:00,844
to

842
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:08,686
the very two different gradients with the same number of colors moving at the same speed in the same direction, but

843
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:14,227
slightly shifted in value and hue. And you're doing this to shade

844
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:21,676
your waterfall. You'll notice that this gradient is very pale up here, it's very dark down here.

845
00:55:22,017 --> 00:55:27,040
It looks like I've rendered the gradient somehow. Well, the way I've actually done that is to create

846
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:34,045
that very same pattern in gradients of equal length and speed and direction, and then I've

847
00:55:34,085 --> 00:55:41,710
just created another sort of template. You use stencils to put the light gradient in over this

848
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:45,472
color and the next medium gradient in over this yellow color.

849
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:51,541
and the next and the next so that your gradient ends up

850
00:55:52,241 --> 00:55:56,605
it's the very same pattern, it's all identical except for the color so now you have the pattern

851
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,446
uninterrupted while the color changes.

852
00:56:02,149 --> 00:56:05,312
From there, you put it in its environment.

853
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:07,974
So you stick that in there in the rocks and it looks

854
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,317
it looks pretty straight edged for a waterfall.

855
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:20,308
you fill the edges you want to be full of falls with another stencil color here

856
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:24,090
a color that's nowhere else in your drawing so you can fill it easily

857
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:30,292
and you take this really dark iteration of the very same pattern and you just stencil it into the edges

858
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:32,954
now that dark pattern

859
00:56:34,534 --> 00:56:39,016
has the actual gradient in the palette

860
00:56:40,381 --> 00:56:45,563
has been arranged with cliff colors and fall colors in about equal amounts.

861
00:56:48,164 --> 00:56:55,966
So, once you stencil that with the rock colors and the fall colors in equal amounts into

862
00:56:56,006 --> 00:57:02,248
these green spaces here, the result is that when

863
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:07,576
when the gradient shows the fall colors, it'll look like that part of it is joined to the falls,

864
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:11,618
and when it shows the rock colors, it'll look like that part of it is joined to the rocks,

865
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:18,060
and it'll make the edges of the fall seem to waver between the rocks and the fall.

866
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,661
And then you create some...

867
00:57:21,728 --> 00:57:28,890
you know, some water down here. This particular falls was done for a game that was actually not just 8-bit, it was a character set game.

868
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:34,951
So, these were all actually characters that you could just pick up and stamp down on a grid to make any kinds of falls.

869
00:57:35,511 --> 00:57:37,152
Now you're going to make the foam at the bottom.

870
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:42,973
You do that by creating a contour gradient fill into a pattern like this.

871
00:57:45,234 --> 00:57:47,474
And then remapping those things.

872
00:57:50,506 --> 00:57:53,329
This is the boiling foam at the bottom of the falls,

873
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,311
but because I've just filled it with the same gradient,

874
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:58,254
you can see how it flashes, dark light, dark light.

875
00:57:58,494 --> 00:58:00,736
That's because the gradient is all happening

876
00:58:00,776 --> 00:58:02,939
in all of these little cells at the same time,

877
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:04,580
and that doesn't look very good.

878
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:06,362
So once you've created that thing,

879
00:58:06,602 --> 00:58:10,166
you create what I used to call a clown color stencil,

880
00:58:10,726 --> 00:58:11,247
like this.

881
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:15,181
and you fill a couple of those cells

882
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:17,162
with the same number of clown colors

883
00:58:17,302 --> 00:58:19,944
as there are in your cycling gradient,

884
00:58:20,224 --> 00:58:23,386
and you map those cycling colors to your gradient.

885
00:58:23,846 --> 00:58:24,347
And then,

886
00:58:27,229 --> 00:58:30,071
then you remap them with the gradient

887
00:58:30,111 --> 00:58:31,612
so that those cells look like this.

888
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:37,455
you take some more cells and you map them in the same clown colors,

889
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:41,419
but this time you remap them so that whatever was the center color in the last one,

890
00:58:41,439 --> 00:58:44,723
you start two colors up your gradient and remap them.

891
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:53,312
So that here, in this cell, it's starting with color number one in that cycling gradient.

892
00:58:53,673 --> 00:58:55,975
But in this cell, it's going to start with color number three.

893
00:58:56,932 --> 00:58:59,776
and you remap those cells, and then you repeat the process,

894
00:58:59,856 --> 00:59:02,780
and in the end, instead of this flashing gradient

895
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,662
that goes bright, light, bright, light, bright, light,

896
00:59:05,563 --> 00:59:06,424
you have this one,

897
00:59:08,387 --> 00:59:10,430
where the different cells are going bright and dark

898
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,532
at different times so that the overall mass

899
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:13,874
doesn't just flash at you.

900
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:15,216
I hope that made sense.

901
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,273
If it didn't, I am going to be doing more Q&A.

902
00:59:18,313 --> 00:59:19,734
I am going to the Q&A...

903
00:59:19,754 --> 00:59:21,735
Well, actually, we have this room for a little longer.

904
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:23,275
So anybody who wants to stay at 11.30,

905
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:24,896
I'll continue answering questions,

906
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:25,477
and you can say,

907
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:27,137
I didn't understand a thing you said.

908
00:59:27,418 --> 00:59:27,898
Try again.

909
00:59:28,938 --> 00:59:31,460
So to do mist, same sort of thing.

910
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,381
I create a clown color template

911
00:59:33,421 --> 00:59:35,202
to fill in with color cycling gradient.

912
00:59:35,682 --> 00:59:38,784
I create a color cycling gradient

913
00:59:39,024 --> 00:59:40,164
that will go over the falls,

914
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:42,886
and a color cycling gradient

915
00:59:42,906 --> 00:59:44,386
that will go over the rock spaces.

916
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:48,976
I did this with a gradient fill distorted,

917
00:59:49,456 --> 00:59:51,698
which is something you can do in an actual 8-bit tool

918
00:59:51,738 --> 00:59:54,640
pretty easily, usually, and then I filled in

919
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,442
those clown colors with those gradients

920
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:57,343
so it looks like this.

921
00:59:57,763 --> 01:00:00,145
And then because this was all done on character boundaries,

922
01:00:00,665 --> 01:00:01,786
I was able to,

923
01:00:04,108 --> 01:00:05,429
see if I can get my menu here.

924
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:09,032
I was able just to pick this up.

925
01:00:13,115 --> 01:00:14,496
Oh, helps if you have a grid on.

926
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:22,074
Okay, no I'm not. Yeah, there we go. So I was able to pick this up and...

927
01:00:22,094 --> 01:00:27,839
Sure.

928
01:00:29,249 --> 01:00:32,632
Yeah, alright, never mind, and flip it, and make a waterfall of my own.

929
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:36,775
It's been a while since I've used a lot of these tools, in case you couldn't tell.

930
01:00:37,536 --> 01:00:39,157
So, that's how I made a waterfall.

931
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,859
Now I'm gonna go through some of these other things very quickly.

932
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:43,040
Actually, it's 12.30.

933
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,884
If you want to stay, I'm gonna go through some more of these scenes and tell you what I did to make these things.

934
01:00:47,964 --> 01:00:50,025
If you need to go, thank you very much for coming.

935
01:00:51,006 --> 01:00:51,487
And, uh...

936
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:54,169
I hope it was worth something.

937
01:00:56,651 --> 01:00:56,891
Thank you.

938
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,770
So apparently there's not another session in this room

939
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:06,550
till 2 o'clock.

940
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,211
I am not going to stay here till 2 o'clock, don't worry.

941
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:13,392
But I will stay for up to another half an hour,

942
01:01:13,852 --> 01:01:14,692
talking as long.

943
01:01:14,832 --> 01:01:16,512
Feel free to leave any time you want.

944
01:01:18,533 --> 01:01:19,893
I will not take it personally.

945
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:24,014
So with the snow here, I'm actually

946
01:01:24,054 --> 01:01:26,414
going to open Depaint in a DOS box now.

947
01:01:27,874 --> 01:01:29,215
This should be very entertaining,

948
01:01:29,655 --> 01:01:31,855
even more entertaining than my use of more recent tools.

949
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,080
So with the snow, what you're actually seeing is this.

950
01:01:44,862 --> 01:01:47,223
So you're actually seeing a snow pattern

951
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,883
that looks like this.

952
01:01:53,765 --> 01:01:56,185
It is one gradient of about seven colors

953
01:01:56,585 --> 01:01:58,826
where all the colors are tuned to a single color

954
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:00,686
except for one palette position

955
01:02:00,706 --> 01:02:02,107
that is tuned to a snow color.

956
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:12,376
Then, I'm going to lay it over the picture like this, only I'm going to identify color

957
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:19,843
families in this picture, dark browns, dark greens, grays, whites, and I'm going to create

958
01:02:21,512 --> 01:02:27,677
So right now, you see I have a whole bunch of these cycling gradients.

959
01:02:27,937 --> 01:02:30,759
They are all the same length, they are all the same speed,

960
01:02:31,259 --> 01:02:35,442
the snow color is positioned at the same spot in all of them.

961
01:02:36,363 --> 01:02:38,024
Now, I am going to...

962
01:02:51,347 --> 01:02:54,871
Now you can see where the different gradients come and go.

963
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,775
Now I am going to map those gradients so that

964
01:02:58,696 --> 01:03:00,478
gradients that look the same,

965
01:03:07,345 --> 01:03:09,448
you can see that although these gradients

966
01:03:09,488 --> 01:03:12,691
will all have the same white dot in them,

967
01:03:13,595 --> 01:03:18,058
Gradients to where the rest of the gradient is dark brown will go over all of the dark brown or black areas

968
01:03:18,438 --> 01:03:21,420
Gradients that are dark gray will go over all of the green areas

969
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:26,284
And I'm just going to copy that same pink pattern you saw only colored appropriately

970
01:03:26,884 --> 01:03:31,968
Using a stencil and the grid function so that they're always laid down exactly in aligned with the others

971
01:03:33,469 --> 01:03:35,811
Using a stencil for just those colors. I want to cover

972
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:41,435
I'm just going to stamp that pattern down five or six times over this whole picture and the result is

973
01:03:43,339 --> 01:03:43,960
will be this.

974
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:54,629
And here I've left a couple of the colors unstenciled so you can sort of see them.

975
01:03:56,322 --> 01:04:00,804
If you're looking now, and down here I would need to do another gradient to do these browns,

976
01:04:00,824 --> 01:04:02,224
because it's kind of showing right now.

977
01:04:02,304 --> 01:04:05,385
If you're looking, you can actually see those stripes all throughout the picture,

978
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,906
but because all the colors in the gradient, except for the snow color,

979
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:12,247
are so similar to the static background colors they are up against,

980
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:18,670
it looks, without looking very carefully, as if you've got little white dots moving transparently.

981
01:04:19,737 --> 01:04:22,440
over a space when in fact they're embedded in it.

982
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:26,003
So I cannot actually get out of this DOS box

983
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:27,244
without doing this.

984
01:04:30,227 --> 01:04:31,748
Now I can get out of the DOS box.

985
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:35,352
These are part of the problems with the dearth of tools here.

986
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:38,675
So I can't magnify this anymore,

987
01:04:38,695 --> 01:04:40,977
but if you really look now, you will actually see

988
01:04:42,418 --> 01:04:45,501
little trails of background color.

989
01:04:46,357 --> 01:04:51,681
I've just made sure that the background is filigree enough so that those trails will not actually be very visible.

990
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:53,502
So that's what's going on there.

991
01:04:54,402 --> 01:04:57,505
That's what's going on with the rain here. It's the same thing.

992
01:05:02,628 --> 01:05:09,213
And there, this, that seawater was the same thing as the waterfalls.

993
01:05:16,428 --> 01:05:18,374
This moire pattern here...

994
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,802
There's something called the wavering edge.

995
01:05:22,862 --> 01:05:24,703
Remember in the waterfalls where I filled the edges

996
01:05:24,743 --> 01:05:27,404
of the waterfall with a gradient that was half the color

997
01:05:27,444 --> 01:05:29,866
of the rocks and half the color of the waterfall?

998
01:05:30,186 --> 01:05:32,707
I'm making the fish flap their tails and everything here.

999
01:05:33,007 --> 01:05:35,849
I'm making these corals and things seem to waver around

1000
01:05:36,169 --> 01:05:38,290
by just putting a one to two pixel edge on them

1001
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:42,092
and filling it with a linear cycling gradient fill

1002
01:05:42,132 --> 01:05:44,474
that is half the color of the coral or the fish

1003
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:46,515
and half the color of the water around it.

1004
01:05:46,795 --> 01:05:48,936
So it makes those shapes seem to waver.

1005
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:55,072
It's the same thing I do with a reflection in a pond.

1006
01:06:02,153 --> 01:06:05,314
So you see how the mountain seems to waver and the trees seem to waver there?

1007
01:06:05,354 --> 01:06:09,056
That's static art that simply has a 1-2 pixel outline on it

1008
01:06:09,316 --> 01:06:13,637
and is filled with gradients that are half the color of the image that's wavering

1009
01:06:13,677 --> 01:06:16,018
and half the color of the background behind that image

1010
01:06:16,338 --> 01:06:18,239
and it makes everything appear to waver.

1011
01:06:18,499 --> 01:06:20,760
It's also a really good way to do flames.

1012
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:25,282
So, for instance, in the...

1013
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:37,411
There isn't actually any way to view these things except on Joe Huckabee's little demonstration here, so I'm very grateful for it.

1014
01:06:38,652 --> 01:06:39,933
So the flames in this scene...

1015
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:49,073
This is another place where the gradients in these flames are all different lengths and different speeds

1016
01:06:49,533 --> 01:06:55,856
so that they move at different paces. If I had made them all, if I had made the light, the yellow,

1017
01:06:56,096 --> 01:07:00,697
the light orange, and the dark red gradients all the same length and the same size,

1018
01:07:01,158 --> 01:07:05,559
then these flames would have gone flash, flash, flash at you. But because of the fact that the

1019
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:10,121
yellows and the oranges and the reds are all moving at different speeds from each other,

1020
01:07:10,701 --> 01:07:16,025
There isn't anything synced up to flash here, so it's just a fluid movement that keeps going.

1021
01:07:16,606 --> 01:07:20,229
This fire light on the back here, same kind of thing I did with the snowflakes,

1022
01:07:20,629 --> 01:07:24,612
or the waterfall actually, where the waterfall is light at the top and dark at the bottom.

1023
01:07:24,972 --> 01:07:25,553
I just made...

1024
01:07:26,659 --> 01:07:33,206
I used a checkerboard dither to create this moire pattern by putting moving bars that were diagonal to the upper right

1025
01:07:33,986 --> 01:07:40,713
Into every other pixel of a checkerboard and in the remaining pixels. I made the same pattern move diagonal bars moving up or left

1026
01:07:41,634 --> 01:07:41,854
then I

1027
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:46,891
took that texture and remapped it to five different gradients in five different colors

1028
01:07:46,931 --> 01:07:51,372
from a very light color in here to medium colors to these very dark colors out here

1029
01:07:51,892 --> 01:07:56,333
and when I had five identical pieces of texture in five different gradients of different colors

1030
01:07:56,993 --> 01:08:03,954
then I stenciled various parts of the rock and simply popped that cycling texture

1031
01:08:03,974 --> 01:08:08,675
aligned with all of the others into the proper part of the rock and you end up with this

1032
01:08:08,995 --> 01:08:11,936
pattern moving over what seems to be a textured area.

1033
01:08:13,402 --> 01:08:15,124
So, for instance,

1034
01:08:19,608 --> 01:08:20,529
no, not that one.

1035
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:22,872
Mountain Storm.

1036
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:25,054
Where is Mountain Storm?

1037
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:32,221
Up, up? Tell me when.

1038
01:08:32,381 --> 01:08:33,302
Direct, there we are. Okay.

1039
01:08:34,763 --> 01:08:40,427
So again, it looks like I have a transparent layer of moving cycling texture over these clouds,

1040
01:08:40,888 --> 01:08:45,391
but I don't actually. If you took all the static cloud away, you'd discover that that's a solid.

1041
01:08:47,018 --> 01:08:48,679
piece of color cycling texture,

1042
01:08:48,939 --> 01:08:50,720
but it is mapped to different values.

1043
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,281
So this is the very same pattern in a dark value here,

1044
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:55,742
and the very same pattern in a light value here,

1045
01:08:56,022 --> 01:08:58,243
just remapped to the various clown colors

1046
01:08:58,283 --> 01:09:00,663
of my general cloud sculpture behind them.

1047
01:09:00,984 --> 01:09:02,664
So, is that making sense?

1048
01:09:03,304 --> 01:09:04,125
You understand what I'm saying?

1049
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:04,465
Great.

1050
01:09:04,825 --> 01:09:06,426
Does anybody have specific questions

1051
01:09:06,466 --> 01:09:07,966
about any of these color cycling effects

1052
01:09:07,986 --> 01:09:09,507
you've seen so far that you wanna ask?

1053
01:09:10,327 --> 01:09:10,627
That I can?

1054
01:09:13,501 --> 01:09:18,783
Back in the days when deep paint worked and was of a resolution to actually fill the screen and everything

1055
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:25,406
Depending on the complexity of the scene it probably took somewhere between two days and a week and a half

1056
01:09:26,406 --> 01:09:27,046
for one image

1057
01:09:28,227 --> 01:09:30,888
Because some of this is very meticulous it depended on what they wanted

1058
01:09:31,008 --> 01:09:36,870
You know if they just wanted moving water that probably took me a day and a half if they wanted falling snow

1059
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,971
That took a week and a half. You know it depends on what you were trying to do

1060
01:09:44,204 --> 01:09:45,945
You can still make these in promotion.

1061
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:48,847
In fact, I'm going to try and get promotion to work again.

1062
01:09:49,888 --> 01:09:50,389
Let's see.

1063
01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:54,672
Yep.

1064
01:09:56,654 --> 01:09:56,874
No.

1065
01:09:58,896 --> 01:10:01,338
Come on, just, oh, screw it.

1066
01:10:01,998 --> 01:10:03,980
Yeah, I don't know what's with my computer all of a sudden.

1067
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,782
I don't know why all my menus are insisting

1068
01:10:05,842 --> 01:10:07,083
on being in the middle of the screen.

1069
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:08,704
That's new.

1070
01:10:08,724 --> 01:10:12,887
Is it?

1071
01:10:15,395 --> 01:10:18,356
Oh, it's probably because it's attached to whatever's projecting it.

1072
01:10:18,736 --> 01:10:20,437
That's interesting. All right.

1073
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:23,178
Well, you'll still be able to see some of this.

1074
01:10:24,499 --> 01:10:27,100
Okay, so that waterfall was actually done

1075
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:32,222
for this Spyro game, the waterfall that I demoed the construction of earlier.

1076
01:10:32,242 --> 01:10:39,225
Geez.

1077
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:41,626
Oh, this is really annoying.

1078
01:10:42,847 --> 01:10:44,568
Oh, good. Look it, I moved it.

1079
01:10:46,105 --> 01:10:49,615
So these scenes were done in promotion.

1080
01:10:50,297 --> 01:10:50,418
And.

1081
01:10:54,378 --> 01:10:56,759
you can see that I'm doing most of the same things.

1082
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:58,920
Now, these effects are a little cruder

1083
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,501
than the ones in the landscapes I'm showing you

1084
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:02,661
in the Joe Huckabee demo

1085
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:04,722
because this was a character set game.

1086
01:11:04,982 --> 01:11:06,803
So I not only had to do all of these things

1087
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:08,823
in the palette constraints

1088
01:11:08,863 --> 01:11:10,704
that I told you for 256 color picture,

1089
01:11:10,924 --> 01:11:12,245
but these scenes all had to be made

1090
01:11:12,305 --> 01:11:15,426
out of 200 and some odd characters that were repeatable.

1091
01:11:15,886 --> 01:11:19,287
So I couldn't even be free form with my 256 color palette.

1092
01:11:19,327 --> 01:11:21,608
I had to do a little eight pixel by eight pixel characters

1093
01:11:21,908 --> 01:11:23,429
out of which all of this was constructed.

1094
01:11:25,082 --> 01:11:29,005
So, you know, here you see this moire pattern.

1095
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,511
I try to reserve half the palette.

1096
01:11:40,412 --> 01:11:43,314
Again, going into the demo here,

1097
01:11:44,294 --> 01:11:48,057
in this piece, the color cycling starts here.

1098
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,459
Everything from here down is color cycling.

1099
01:11:52,339 --> 01:11:52,700
Everything.

1100
01:11:53,549 --> 01:11:55,911
most of this picture is not actually static color.

1101
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:57,692
So all of the static part of the picture

1102
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,273
is in these top four rows.

1103
01:11:59,954 --> 01:12:01,035
Well, four and a half rows.

1104
01:12:01,095 --> 01:12:01,975
I guess five rows.

1105
01:12:02,015 --> 01:12:03,717
These top five rows are the whole picture.

1106
01:12:04,817 --> 01:12:07,279
Going back to those storm photos.

1107
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:07,539
All right.

1108
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:22,310
The entire picture.

1109
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,641
for all of those scenes is that big.

1110
01:12:28,121 --> 01:12:29,661
I didn't even use the rest of the palette

1111
01:12:29,681 --> 01:12:31,962
because we were going to put color cycling,

1112
01:12:32,082 --> 01:12:34,683
we did put color cycling effects over these pictures.

1113
01:12:34,923 --> 01:12:36,363
You know, a storm has a special power

1114
01:12:36,403 --> 01:12:37,443
that raises the hurricane.

1115
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:39,344
Well then we have wind blowing over them

1116
01:12:39,364 --> 01:12:41,204
that's made visible in various ways.

1117
01:12:41,244 --> 01:12:42,984
All of those things were gonna require

1118
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:43,845
the rest of the palette.

1119
01:12:44,105 --> 01:12:47,806
So all nine of these scenes use this much palette space.

1120
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:51,627
for the scenes that you saw there.

1121
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:53,909
So yeah, you learn really quickly

1122
01:12:54,129 --> 01:12:55,570
to make minimal use of colors.

1123
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:57,852
And I should have said this when everybody was still here,

1124
01:12:57,932 --> 01:13:00,073
but what you really want

1125
01:13:01,374 --> 01:13:04,416
is you want one to three highlight colors,

1126
01:13:05,257 --> 01:13:07,618
and you want one to three shadow side colors,

1127
01:13:07,658 --> 01:13:08,959
what I call bounce light colors,

1128
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:11,341
and you want one, what I call turning edge color.

1129
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:13,142
So when an object is lit,

1130
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,143
the light hits it from one direction

1131
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:16,884
and that's the bright side of the object.

1132
01:13:17,874 --> 01:13:21,756
some of that light misses the object and bounces off of things behind it and sort of lights up

1133
01:13:21,816 --> 01:13:25,819
palely the back side and that's the shadow side of the object and then there's this little zone

1134
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:29,301
down the middle of the object where light is hitting it neither from the light source or

1135
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:33,364
bouncing back from other things and that's what I call the turning edge it's usually actually the

1136
01:13:33,384 --> 01:13:40,429
darkest part of an object so I have highlight colors turning edge colors and shadow side colors

1137
01:13:40,869 --> 01:13:44,372
really sorry I didn't say that while everybody was still here and um

1138
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:53,204
At the very least, at these resolutions, you need one highlight color, one turning edge color, and one shadow side color.

1139
01:13:53,425 --> 01:13:56,546
At the very most, you probably need three highlight colors.

1140
01:13:56,967 --> 01:14:02,850
You know, three little iterations of the bright colors on the bright side, and three shadow side, and one still turning color.

1141
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:06,452
And I arrange them as turning color gradients.

1142
01:14:07,033 --> 01:14:07,253
So...

1143
01:14:16,434 --> 01:14:16,835
Bye.

1144
01:14:16,855 --> 01:14:20,059
That was my wife.

1145
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:21,481
I don't blow kisses to all of you.

1146
01:14:21,501 --> 01:14:22,983
I'm just warning you now.

1147
01:14:24,385 --> 01:14:25,367
So you won't be disappointed.

1148
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:27,510
Let's see.

1149
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,613
I guess I'm going to have to do this in deep paint, actually.

1150
01:14:31,836 --> 01:14:32,717
Back to DOSBox.

1151
01:14:55,989 --> 01:14:58,231
Okay, so in this picture

1152
01:15:00,993 --> 01:15:02,794
we're really only the watercolor cycles.

1153
01:15:03,515 --> 01:15:04,635
I have all of these trees

1154
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:10,760
and you can see

1155
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:14,883
that there are lighter colors over here

1156
01:15:15,483 --> 01:15:18,005
and there are some slightly lighter colors over here

1157
01:15:18,045 --> 01:15:20,007
and all the dark colors in the middle of the picture.

1158
01:15:20,707 --> 01:15:24,410
So those trees are...

1159
01:15:25,499 --> 01:15:30,723
these colors probably right in here or maybe actually I guess it's these colors in here and I don't know

1160
01:15:30,743 --> 01:15:32,924
I can't make this any larger because it's

1161
01:15:33,425 --> 01:15:37,348
deep paint and that resolution used to fill a whole screen and that's as big as it gets now

1162
01:15:38,108 --> 01:15:38,929
uh... but

1163
01:15:39,649 --> 01:15:39,789
the

1164
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:43,232
the side facing the light is over here

1165
01:15:43,892 --> 01:15:46,134
and then these are shadow colors.

1166
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,715
Now these trees were really large,

1167
01:15:47,755 --> 01:15:49,256
so I gave them some extra colors,

1168
01:15:49,776 --> 01:15:52,338
but then there's the turning edge portion of the ramp

1169
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:54,679
and then there's these lighter colors at the side

1170
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:55,840
which are the shadow side.

1171
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:57,962
And then I could just create

1172
01:16:00,964 --> 01:16:01,964
a ramp like this

1173
01:16:05,007 --> 01:16:06,548
and I could create a

1174
01:16:06,568 --> 01:16:09,530
a tree trunk.

1175
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:23,075
and do a ridge gradient fill, and so when I fill that tree trunk with that

1176
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:27,289
it just sort of comes pre-rendered.

1177
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:28,530
Do you see what I'm saying?

1178
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:31,392
So I don't have to render the highlight to the shadow.

1179
01:16:32,674 --> 01:16:34,916
It just sort of renders that automatically.

1180
01:16:34,976 --> 01:16:37,218
I think I actually got parts of two gradients in here,

1181
01:16:37,238 --> 01:16:38,519
which is why it looks funny folded.

1182
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:41,001
But I try and arrange my ramps from highlights

1183
01:16:41,021 --> 01:16:42,162
through turning edge, through shadow,

1184
01:16:42,402 --> 01:16:46,746
so I can do gradient fills that just render a thing for me

1185
01:16:46,786 --> 01:16:47,927
by filling it with a gradient

1186
01:16:47,987 --> 01:16:50,149
instead of having to go in with the individual colors

1187
01:16:50,209 --> 01:16:52,591
and color all that chiaroscuro.

1188
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:59,252
So now I'm going to hit control alt delete to get out of DOSBox.

1189
01:17:02,515 --> 01:17:03,716
Any other questions you have?

1190
01:17:03,956 --> 01:17:04,156
Yes.

1191
01:17:04,556 --> 01:17:06,698
So this is not really a question,

1192
01:17:06,718 --> 01:17:08,860
this is more of a, I just wanted to tell you that

1193
01:17:09,181 --> 01:17:11,563
I think the artwork that you're doing is brilliant.

1194
01:17:11,683 --> 01:17:13,845
I feel privileged to having been here and experienced this.

1195
01:17:13,865 --> 01:17:14,485
Thank you.

1196
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:15,526
I just wanted to tell you, I feel like

1197
01:17:15,967 --> 01:17:18,349
we're looking at like a master of his time.

1198
01:17:18,369 --> 01:17:18,949
Where?

1199
01:17:20,915 --> 01:17:21,555
I want to see him.

1200
01:17:21,815 --> 01:17:25,576
No, I mean, I just had chill bumps watching this, so I just wanted to tell you that, you

1201
01:17:25,616 --> 01:17:29,537
know, everyone here, speaking on behalf of everyone here, that this is masterful artwork

1202
01:17:29,577 --> 01:17:31,938
and I just feel privileged having got to see this.

1203
01:17:31,978 --> 01:17:32,238
So thank you.

1204
01:17:32,258 --> 01:17:33,338
Thank you very much.

1205
01:17:33,578 --> 01:17:34,599
I really appreciate that.

1206
01:17:46,602 --> 01:17:47,142
Well thank you.

1207
01:17:47,626 --> 01:17:49,047
I mean, when we did these originally,

1208
01:17:49,107 --> 01:17:52,869
they mattered for really practical logistical reasons.

1209
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:57,892
Storage, processing time, refresh rates on screens

1210
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:00,474
made doing full screen animations

1211
01:18:00,534 --> 01:18:02,275
of environmental stuff like this impossible.

1212
01:18:03,716 --> 01:18:05,978
this was the only way you could do this kind of animation.

1213
01:18:06,038 --> 01:18:07,179
Now, of course, we live in a world

1214
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:09,200
where the resources are virtually infinite

1215
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:10,802
and getting more infinite all the time.

1216
01:18:11,182 --> 01:18:13,844
So there is no compelling reason practically

1217
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:15,505
to be doing any of these things anymore.

1218
01:18:15,986 --> 01:18:18,067
One of the reasons there are so few tools to do it in.

1219
01:18:18,447 --> 01:18:22,931
But as an artistic, as a creative, expressive act,

1220
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,633
I think that it really does put you in a space

1221
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:27,094
that nothing else does.

1222
01:18:27,274 --> 01:18:29,956
So I applaud everybody who's actually going there

1223
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:31,898
to see what they can learn and what they can create.

1224
01:18:32,258 --> 01:18:34,163
because you end up taking the sensibilities

1225
01:18:34,504 --> 01:18:36,789
and the kind of thinking processes with you

1226
01:18:36,849 --> 01:18:38,012
back to those other tools.

1227
01:18:38,874 --> 01:18:40,117
Are you waiting to ask a question?

1228
01:18:41,295 --> 01:18:41,495
Yes.

1229
01:18:41,835 --> 01:18:45,917
Oh, so just like a really quick observation and then a practical question.

1230
01:18:45,937 --> 01:18:49,619
So the observation, I've also been trying to think about why this is so visually compelling.

1231
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:52,821
I mean, like I love this, I love your work and this whole style.

1232
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:53,641
Thank you.

1233
01:18:53,982 --> 01:18:58,284
And I just had this thought while watching this that maybe some of it has to do with a kind

1234
01:18:58,324 --> 01:19:04,247
of a crisp precision to the use of light that is very hard to do in, you know,

1235
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:06,308
in 3D or in a lot of other media.

1236
01:19:06,348 --> 01:19:09,430
Like the treatment, like I've heard you talk about light a number of times.

1237
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:14,034
today, right? And like there's something about the way that light gets

1238
01:19:14,095 --> 01:19:14,715
handled that

1239
01:19:14,895 --> 01:19:17,498
makes me think actually about like photorealistic painting or

1240
01:19:17,518 --> 01:19:21,663
you know, some of the surrealists like Magritte or somebody like that

1241
01:19:22,203 --> 01:19:23,505
is very hard to do in other styles.

1242
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:29,753
But anyway, so the practical question is about the dither templates.

1243
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:33,895
So, I have really, I don't really have a lot of patience.

1244
01:19:34,456 --> 01:19:37,458
So this is, I guess, why I've never really been successful at doing this style.

1245
01:19:37,498 --> 01:19:39,659
But, so like that was revolutionary,

1246
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,861
using this like the dither template hue and color shift technique.

1247
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:46,104
And so then the thing that immediately then came to my mind

1248
01:19:46,144 --> 01:19:47,985
being lazy is like, could you write,

1249
01:19:48,546 --> 01:19:50,387
could I write some code that would then construct

1250
01:19:50,427 --> 01:19:52,529
dither templates in different patterns and shapes

1251
01:19:52,569 --> 01:19:53,069
and different styles?

1252
01:19:53,229 --> 01:19:54,850
I have no doubt that you could.

1253
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,752
In fact, I've seen people do it.

1254
01:19:57,272 --> 01:20:00,254
I had a friend once who actually wrote a tool

1255
01:20:00,514 --> 01:20:02,916
that would allow me just to paint moving snow

1256
01:20:03,237 --> 01:20:05,278
in actual color cycling over a scene.

1257
01:20:05,818 --> 01:20:08,881
This tool actually registered what was beneath the mouse,

1258
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:11,423
what was beneath the cursor at any moment, and.

1259
01:20:12,064 --> 01:20:14,972
you still had to create the cycling things,

1260
01:20:15,213 --> 01:20:17,258
but it basically, as you went pixel by pixel

1261
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:18,602
over the screen, it just determined.

1262
01:20:19,302 --> 01:20:21,443
which of those gradients was the closest

1263
01:20:21,603 --> 01:20:22,763
to the pixel you were over,

1264
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:26,984
and just assigned this matched up dither pattern

1265
01:20:27,504 --> 01:20:28,884
to those pixels as you went down,

1266
01:20:28,904 --> 01:20:31,545
and you could just paint falling snow over a scene.

1267
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:32,885
In exactly the way I did,

1268
01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:34,286
except the machine did it for you.

1269
01:20:34,566 --> 01:20:37,406
So, there are undoubtedly ways to animate

1270
01:20:37,907 --> 01:20:39,947
the tedious parts of this, and it is tedious.

1271
01:20:40,227 --> 01:20:41,947
It's tedious and it requires patience.

1272
01:20:44,328 --> 01:20:47,129
or it requires exactly the kind of code and tools

1273
01:20:47,169 --> 01:20:47,869
you're talking about.

1274
01:20:48,629 --> 01:20:51,910
I suspect strongly that Joseph Huckabee's

1275
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:56,711
new pixel art tool will actually be

1276
01:20:57,051 --> 01:20:59,452
providing opportunities to automate a lot of these things,

1277
01:20:59,752 --> 01:21:01,673
as well as working in very high resolutions,

1278
01:21:01,933 --> 01:21:04,413
as well as giving you access to layers of pixel art

1279
01:21:04,433 --> 01:21:07,694
and other things that are available in promotion,

1280
01:21:07,774 --> 01:21:10,575
but sometimes rather awkwardly.

1281
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:14,731
Anybody else? You, yes?

1282
01:21:15,772 --> 01:21:18,575
Hi, first of all, thank you so much for that information.

1283
01:21:18,635 --> 01:21:22,239
I know this webpage for a few years already, as far as I remember.

1284
01:21:22,259 --> 01:21:29,607
I'm from Demoscene, and I was pixeling art on Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, so I perfectly know.

1285
01:21:30,247 --> 01:21:35,593
let's say, what we were talking about, those low palette modes and low resolutions.

1286
01:21:36,033 --> 01:21:40,297
Of course, I've never been able to do such beautiful graphics, especially color cycling.

1287
01:21:41,558 --> 01:21:47,244
And I was working on using the promotion software for GBA pixeling.

1288
01:21:48,124 --> 01:21:51,105
While I could recommend if you can check it out,

1289
01:21:51,145 --> 01:21:53,586
there is additional freeware software

1290
01:21:53,626 --> 01:21:57,447
for pixeling graphics too, GraphX.

1291
01:21:57,547 --> 01:22:00,428
Second, it's free of charge and it's really cool.

1292
01:22:00,808 --> 01:22:02,508
So if you want to check it out, it's great.

1293
01:22:03,329 --> 01:22:05,249
And once again, thank you and I'm waiting

1294
01:22:05,289 --> 01:22:06,830
for that new tool for pixeling.

1295
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:10,011
Yeah, well keep a watch on Joe Huckabee

1296
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:11,711
because that's where it'll be coming from

1297
01:22:11,771 --> 01:22:15,932
and I certainly am gonna be interested when it's accessible.

1298
01:22:16,112 --> 01:22:16,393
Thank you.

1299
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:17,193
Thank you.

1300
01:22:18,217 --> 01:22:18,437
Yes?

1301
01:22:19,357 --> 01:22:22,940
Do you know if Huckabee's new tool is going to allow

1302
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,822
for plugins and extensions so that you can actually?

1303
01:22:26,242 --> 01:22:29,184
Well, the amazing thing, the reason that this tool

1304
01:22:29,204 --> 01:22:31,365
doesn't exist right now is that Joe's day job

1305
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:32,906
has pretty much prevented it.

1306
01:22:33,727 --> 01:22:36,048
Joe's going to be taking a hiatus from that day job

1307
01:22:36,188 --> 01:22:37,289
in just a couple months.

1308
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:40,011
At that point, Joe is an independent developer

1309
01:22:40,231 --> 01:22:41,792
and a very accessible person.

1310
01:22:42,572 --> 01:22:49,094
And I am pretty sure that Joe would welcome any input from anybody who has things they're hoping the tool will do,

1311
01:22:49,514 --> 01:22:53,035
or hoping the tool will include, or hoping the tool will improve on.

1312
01:22:53,495 --> 01:23:00,177
So, I cannot tell you for sure everything that's currently in the tool Joe's working, but I can tell you he's a brilliant guy.

1313
01:23:00,817 --> 01:23:03,618
who, if anybody, can incorporate input,

1314
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:07,040
is gonna know how to incorporate input, it'll be Joe.

1315
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,841
And if you are looking for specific features,

1316
01:23:09,981 --> 01:23:14,543
I encourage you to tweet him or find him

1317
01:23:15,744 --> 01:23:19,445
in the, out there, in the cyber frontier someplace,

1318
01:23:19,525 --> 01:23:20,866
and tell him what it is you're looking for,

1319
01:23:20,886 --> 01:23:22,206
because now is exactly the time

1320
01:23:22,246 --> 01:23:23,547
when he could use that information.

1321
01:23:23,747 --> 01:23:24,647
Sounds great, thank you.

1322
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:25,328
Great, thanks.

1323
01:23:26,344 --> 01:23:26,564
Yes.

1324
01:23:27,105 --> 01:23:30,867
I just have a question about your setup in Photoshop.

1325
01:23:31,107 --> 01:23:32,488
Like, what's the canvas size?

1326
01:23:32,548 --> 01:23:33,769
Like, what?

1327
01:23:34,449 --> 01:23:36,890
Well, for this project, we are trying

1328
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,812
to create a game that looks at about the same resolution.

1329
01:23:39,912 --> 01:23:43,414
So our screens actually have several resolutions.

1330
01:23:43,955 --> 01:23:49,038
But they are anywhere from 128 pixels high to 428 pixels high.

1331
01:23:49,498 --> 01:23:51,899
And the width is dependent upon what's happening

1332
01:23:51,959 --> 01:23:53,280
from side to side in the screen.

1333
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:58,803
but they are similar to the 640x480 kind of resolution

1334
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:03,365
that we last saw in the age of 8-bit indexed color games.

1335
01:24:03,806 --> 01:24:07,888
Some of them are similar to the 320x200 kind of resolution

1336
01:24:07,928 --> 01:24:09,008
we had back in the 80s.

1337
01:24:10,429 --> 01:24:12,330
So for screen size, was there another part

1338
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:13,530
of your question that I missed?

1339
01:24:16,192 --> 01:24:18,933
I guess how do you use Photoshop set up

1340
01:24:18,973 --> 01:24:20,434
so that you get the best result?

1341
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:21,214
This is new Photoshop.

1342
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,041
I guess make your own custom templates.

1343
01:24:24,301 --> 01:24:28,665
Well, when I do the original sketch, I make sure that I'm creating a new file that is,

1344
01:24:29,225 --> 01:24:36,171
you know, 128 pixels high and 400 and something, 80 pixels wide, and then I draw in that with

1345
01:24:36,191 --> 01:24:36,992
the pencil tool.

1346
01:24:37,132 --> 01:24:38,073
So as long as the...

1347
01:24:38,855 --> 01:24:41,357
As long as the file you're starting on is the right resolution,

1348
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:44,480
a pixel will be that size automatically.

1349
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:47,603
And again, you're going to be using only the pencil tool, not the brush tool,

1350
01:24:48,003 --> 01:24:51,646
and anti-aliasing will be turned off everywhere,

1351
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:54,129
and nearest neighbor interpolation will be turned on everywhere.

1352
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,091
Does that mean it's time to stop?

1353
01:24:58,127 --> 01:24:59,048
Five minutes, great.

1354
01:24:59,068 --> 01:25:01,009
Okay, so I need to be out of here in five minutes.

1355
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:02,310
They've been extremely generous

1356
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:03,751
to let me go over this far.

1357
01:25:04,251 --> 01:25:06,553
And if there's any urgent questions,

1358
01:25:06,673 --> 01:25:08,134
I will go over to the alcove,

1359
01:25:08,514 --> 01:25:10,015
not the one straight across from the room,

1360
01:25:10,115 --> 01:25:11,857
but down the hall for a little bit

1361
01:25:12,097 --> 01:25:15,719
to continue talking more close up and face to face

1362
01:25:15,759 --> 01:25:17,140
with anybody here who wishes to do that.

1363
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,301
Otherwise, thank you so much

1364
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:19,962
for all of this time and attention.

1365
01:25:20,002 --> 01:25:20,963
I appreciate it very much.
