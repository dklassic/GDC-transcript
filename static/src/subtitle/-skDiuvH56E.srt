00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,912
Hello, welcome to my talk.

2
00:00:06,312 --> 00:00:09,453
It's titled, It Takes Two to Tango,

3
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:12,775
Integrating UX Research and Production at EA.

4
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:19,437
So this presentation is about how we learn to dance together.

5
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:22,478
One dancer is production.

6
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:24,899
The other dancer is research.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,961
When you start learning how to dance, you're not good at it.

8
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:34,958
You step into toes, ones go to one side,

9
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:36,498
the other goes to the other side.

10
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:39,179
The two dancers are going to make mistakes.

11
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,060
Like in dancing, you're constantly moving.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,240
Like in development games too,

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,881
you're constantly producing, iterating,

14
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:48,961
you're always moving.

15
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:52,802
There is no time to stop, keep things coming.

16
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:57,003
And it takes practice to get good at it.

17
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,664
So, how these two dancers met.

18
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:05,207
User experience has been getting a lot of traction

19
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:07,829
during the last couple of years within the game industry.

20
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:11,291
You could say that it's one of the newest aspects

21
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:12,932
within game development.

22
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:17,035
For instance, here we are, GDC.

23
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:19,857
It is 29th iteration,

24
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:22,699
and this is the first time there is a UX summit.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,801
That alone is very telling.

26
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:30,025
Yet, UX as a concept was coined in the 90s.

27
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:32,128
by Norman.

28
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:34,991
It actually, history of testing usability

29
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:36,693
goes all the way back to the 40s.

30
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:40,056
So there has been a long history of measuring and assessing

31
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:43,339
user experience in a variety of products,

32
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:45,802
particularly in games.

33
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:49,484
You have heard about playtesting for a long time.

34
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:55,209
However, such concept has been used in a variety of ways

35
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,071
and generally without the framework of research.

36
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:00,774
And I'll dive more in depth about this

37
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:02,175
throughout the presentation.

38
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:07,920
Nowadays, every major developer

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,123
has a dedicated UX research staff.

40
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,096
I surveyed these numbers mid-2016 and I sorted them out alphabetically.

41
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:22,579
Notice that some of them are quite sizable.

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,344
It could be the equivalent for a whole company or to a development team in itself.

43
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:34,178
And moreover, as our understanding of player experience matures,

44
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,422
multiple disciplines are consolidating within larger departments.

45
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:43,365
And this is the case for Electronic Arts, Riot, and Ubisoft,

46
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:49,550
where games user research, analytics, market research, and data science

47
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,111
are part of an internal larger organization.

48
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:01,632
However, during the advent of UX research into game development, production might have

49
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:07,855
been seeing research as a disruption to process that they have already established.

50
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:15,059
While UX researchers were still adapting their methods and their vocabulary for game development

51
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:15,659
contexts.

52
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:23,430
And that interruption took many shapes, from production not seeing the need for research,

53
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,355
to production wanting, but not knowing how to action on those findings.

54
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:36,863
Mind you, it was also for research to know how to convey those UX findings in a timely

55
00:03:36,903 --> 00:03:41,408
manner, and how to communicate it in such a way that were meaningful and actionable.

56
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:44,583
And this is part of the story I'm going to tell you today.

57
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:48,565
When UX research are designed and not fully synchronized,

58
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,007
it leads to missing UX opportunities.

59
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:55,290
And opportunities doesn't mean that they

60
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,032
have to be a major overhaul.

61
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:01,235
Opportunities are also within production's limitations

62
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:06,279
of time, budget, scope, and technology.

63
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:11,342
And why I'm telling you all this?

64
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,291
Well, my name is Veronica Zamito.

65
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,812
I'm the lead senior UX researcher at Electronic Arts.

66
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:20,732
And over the last seven years, I've

67
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:24,013
had the opportunity of working on amazing games

68
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,113
of the EA portfolio.

69
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:28,974
And today I'm going to be sharing with you

70
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:32,895
the stories on how we tackle UX research and production

71
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,655
integration at EA.

72
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:38,576
Spoiler alert.

73
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:40,316
This is how we are now.

74
00:04:41,212 --> 00:04:42,994
This is what happens at the end of the story.

75
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:47,577
UX Research at EA is a sizable team.

76
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:52,041
We're geographically distributed across eight locations worldwide.

77
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:55,783
And at EA, we have three prototypical tasks.

78
00:04:56,524 --> 00:05:00,407
We have researchers, recruiters, and lab technicians.

79
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,070
Depending on the size of the company,

80
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,953
all those roles can be carried out by different people

81
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:10,174
or by a single person.

82
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:18,503
The latter happens more often in smaller companies or at early stages of UX research teams.

83
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,164
And that was actually my case.

84
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:27,125
Back in the day when I started UX research at EA, I had to do my own recruitment while

85
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:29,626
designing the sessions and setting up the lab.

86
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,986
That was a lot of struggling.

87
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:37,259
So imagine that each task takes time away from the other one.

88
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,743
And it's not that they have to be done in sequential order.

89
00:05:41,363 --> 00:05:46,028
So it's quite exhausting and it's actually not efficient.

90
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:52,314
Now with SIDA, we do have certain philosophies

91
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:57,159
that actually define and help the way that we want to work.

92
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:03,209
So we aspire to work as one team across multiple studios.

93
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:08,374
And actually, what's at the forefront of our job is

94
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:10,355
players, so it's players first.

95
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:14,438
And all these things might sound great.

96
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,919
It's actually great.

97
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,883
But it wasn't with many bumps on the road and misalignments

98
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,825
at first until we got there.

99
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:26,828
So how did we get there?

100
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:33,015
Well, first and foremost, we didn't get that overnight.

101
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:36,196
It was a multi-year journey.

102
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,557
And sincerely, it's a path that will never end.

103
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:44,538
As the UX practice, the industry, and products evolve,

104
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,799
we will have to evolve as part of that.

105
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,180
And in this talk, I'll share those examples,

106
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,681
those lessons learned that shape, thriving, and integrated

107
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:55,882
the UX practice.

108
00:06:57,772 --> 00:07:02,514
This is a journey with key milestones, and I'm going to go through those.

109
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:08,436
It starts rough, and it starts with a wake-up call.

110
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:14,779
Back in 2009, the NBA elite was being developed.

111
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,241
Improving UX was a huge driver for that team.

112
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:21,661
There were high expectations.

113
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,485
They were introducing a brand new set of controls,

114
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:27,486
mechanics new to EVO.

115
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:31,567
It was meant to be a reboot of the NBA Live franchise.

116
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:35,129
And consequently, the game team was very self-aware

117
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,930
of the quality of the UX data and how actionable it was.

118
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,292
At the time, playtesting was part of development process.

119
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,253
However, it was led by designers and producers

120
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:52,374
who self-taught themselves how to do usability.

121
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:57,009
And even though they have the best intentions in the world,

122
00:07:57,609 --> 00:08:00,231
they could smell that something could be better,

123
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:01,852
something could be done differently.

124
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:06,555
And that was the seed of starting from transforming

125
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:09,317
play testing into UX research.

126
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,802
In 2010, we started initiatives for new approaches

127
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:19,084
to evaluate NBA with players

128
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:20,905
and bringing the edge of science.

129
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:29,476
For that, I went super tech and I brought advanced techniques

130
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:33,138
that it was the first time doing that for play testing.

131
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:37,000
So we're using eye tracking and biometrics and telemetry

132
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,722
and all of those at once to assess visual attention,

133
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:45,404
emotional valence, tracking their in-game behaviors.

134
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:47,705
It was awesome.

135
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:52,908
The idea behind that was to tap into insights

136
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:54,108
that surveys.

137
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:55,563
couldn't get.

138
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:59,365
And the effort was to give the most we could to NBA

139
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:01,205
for understanding the player experience.

140
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,987
There was a particular fascinating finding

141
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:08,569
that players consistently looked at the coach

142
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:09,689
after making a basket.

143
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:13,571
And bear in mind, the coach was there in the background

144
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,431
doing nothing.

145
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:20,711
No animation, no voiceovers, anything that could lead to him.

146
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:27,117
So it was very unexpected and pointed out a missed opportunity for positive reinforcement.

147
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,441
That insight never appeared with any other technique.

148
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:39,489
I was getting insights that were completely new on that approach and all this marvelous

149
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:39,909
work.

150
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,082
was new, so the process was a little bit slow,

151
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,885
and actually, those findings couldn't be done.

152
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,246
There was no automation.

153
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:51,867
It was very labor-intensive.

154
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:55,590
So findings like those needed to be left for discussion

155
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,072
for a next installment of NBA.

156
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,095
Time was passing by,

157
00:10:01,115 --> 00:10:04,397
and the team needed to focus on finishing the game.

158
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,940
And NBA Elite was coming hot.

159
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:14,156
As it's common, there was a demo scheduled and released to the public.

160
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:21,581
And I'm going to show you next some snippets from a video that went viral of a player playing

161
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:22,041
the demo.

162
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:34,550
One thing I didn't like, they make you play in the up and down view.

163
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,892
I really don't like that fucking up and down view.

164
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:37,692
Oh, I can change it?

165
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:38,513
We'll change that shit.

166
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:41,316
Broadcast, there we go.

167
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:45,037
I didn't even know you could change it, I just noticed that.

168
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:45,677
You did?

169
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:48,798
What the fuck is going on?

170
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:53,139
Hold up man, there's something wrong with my goddamn buttons.

171
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,159
This shit is crazy.

172
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:06,342
I didn't have it on my lead, that's what it was.

173
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,083
Alright, let's go.

174
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:13,116
The response time to the buttons is slow as fuck.

175
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:14,017
What's that about?

176
00:11:14,117 --> 00:11:18,922
These controls are crazy. You gotta get used to these controls.

177
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:23,546
This is crazy, man. I haven't played live in so long.

178
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,307
What the fuck?

179
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:26,569
Yo, y'all seeing this shit?

180
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:41,354
Yo, what the fuck?

181
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:46,355
This nigga just standing like Jesus in the middle of the court.

182
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:50,856
Oh my God, man. That's it for the demo, man.

183
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,417
I can't take no more of this shit, man.

184
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:55,037
It's hard these times, man.

185
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:56,057
Deuces, man. Deuces.

186
00:11:56,137 --> 00:12:00,378
That was a funny video, but...

187
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:05,059
There were obviously friction points in the UI.

188
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,839
There were friction points in the mechanic.

189
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:11,781
And this demo actually was a nail in the coffin.

190
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:16,844
NBA Elite never ended up being released.

191
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,706
It was deemed that it didn't reach the desired quality,

192
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:22,787
that players would be disappointed,

193
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:27,010
and that the best decision was to not release it at all.

194
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:31,172
It was an extremely hard decision,

195
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:34,254
and I cannot stress enough how much of a shock

196
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:35,195
it was for everyone.

197
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:38,339
It was a wake-up call.

198
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,743
As a video game company, it was very clear that quality

199
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:45,184
process needed to be better.

200
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:51,049
And I wouldn't go as far as saying, oh, better UX research.

201
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,950
We have been the silver bullet for this.

202
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,072
There were other problems.

203
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:59,615
But definitely, clear and more iterative UX

204
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:01,516
checkpoints needed to be there.

205
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:08,984
With that, the new UX research initiatives were a business case to bring to the next level.

206
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:12,707
And there was work to be done.

207
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,411
We needed to improve the research practice from its foundations.

208
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,854
Even though biometrics techniques proved to be very insightful,

209
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:26,140
we needed to change focus from advancing methodologies to establishing a UX process.

210
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:33,160
We needed quality research in an iterative process where production and research are

211
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
fully synchronized.

212
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:38,221
That means having a plan, knowing your steps.

213
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:41,502
We tackled this problem from three different angles.

214
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:49,665
Strengthening the good research practice from a macro as well as from a micro level of research

215
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:50,905
and production integration.

216
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,906
Regarding the basic good research practice.

217
00:13:56,872 --> 00:14:01,136
There were imminent aspects to address, such as quality data,

218
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:04,479
things like ensuring wording of questions in service

219
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,900
are clean and not leading.

220
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:09,463
These efforts were towards researcher skills,

221
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,806
and the goal was to have quality data.

222
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:17,410
So we have been certain that the research findings are good,

223
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,252
and that also leads to trust.

224
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:23,776
Trust from production, it's key.

225
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:26,597
They don't have to double check the data,

226
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,258
they don't feel they have to go themselves.

227
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:32,880
The entrust is the cornerstone for any relationship.

228
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:36,963
But ultimately, doing research

229
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:39,284
is to communicate those findings.

230
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:44,547
And like in tango, communication has to be clear and timely

231
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:47,089
because you're constantly moving.

232
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:49,850
You don't want your partner to go that way and you that way

233
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:52,752
or accidentally step into each other's toes.

234
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:56,405
So I'll show you one example on this topic.

235
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:01,427
And you'll have seen research data coming in this form

236
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:04,749
of prototypical question and a scale from one to five,

237
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,051
all player data aggregated and presented in a bar chart

238
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:14,154
like this, which is okay to know how good or bad things are.

239
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,777
However, it's not sufficient if you want to prioritize

240
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:20,878
resources in production.

241
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:31,253
In cases when you have to look at multiple variables and do comparisons.

242
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:39,416
This is the case in Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare, where there were more than 40 characters

243
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:41,057
that you have to choose from.

244
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:45,198
And productions wanted to ensure that all of them were hitting a mark,

245
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:47,959
and if not, focus on those first.

246
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,621
And that was exactly the question that we had, which was great.

247
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,214
And looking to communicate findings, we look at different ways.

248
00:15:56,434 --> 00:16:01,259
We put some tables, so now you can really see the spread of responses.

249
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,242
And even though the game team was happy with this,

250
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:07,605
you can start to see that it's getting too hard to read.

251
00:16:07,986 --> 00:16:10,708
And when you have 40 columns of those,

252
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,750
you cannot see through that clutter.

253
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:14,092
So...

254
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:21,198
That's why confidence intervals were becoming a part of

255
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:24,879
integral practice of research and how to communicate findings.

256
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:29,600
Confidence intervals are going to give you a way to represent that variability

257
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,661
from players' responses, which allows to spot

258
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:36,542
meaningful differences. You keep it simple,

259
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:40,623
yet with a richer insight. So in that case...

260
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:48,123
It says that the target score was 3.5 and the option in orange is coming tight.

261
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:52,947
Just hitting the mark, could be better, sure, but it's coming at least where we want it.

262
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:58,691
Whereas the blue option, you can see it was actually looking at it first glance stronger,

263
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,494
but actually it was inconsistent.

264
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:03,215
They were polarized options.

265
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:04,776
It was a bigger risk.

266
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,519
And gaining prioritization from production was at essence.

267
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:12,135
And that's how confidence intervals now are part of a

268
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:14,938
basic research practice of doing research.

269
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,104
Now, at a macro level, at EA we have a game development

270
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:25,867
framework, which is all the games developed at EA have to

271
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:26,267
follow.

272
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:29,410
I have a simplified way here.

273
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:33,723
Which is pretty much all the different stages common in the

274
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:37,946
game industry, pre-production, production, and release.

275
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,087
So it's applicable to everyone in the room.

276
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,670
The value of stopping and getting intimately familiar

277
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,433
with the dev process is that we can really understand from

278
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:52,314
research where the efforts

279
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:57,270
are at different stages, what the biggest challenges are,

280
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:00,493
what are they being asked by executives.

281
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,896
All those challenges are the clear information

282
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:05,937
that needs to be common.

283
00:18:06,498 --> 00:18:08,339
Otherwise, it leads to misconceptions

284
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:12,283
about readiness, priority, and also vice versa,

285
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,986
how research activities are aligned to the best

286
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:17,887
impact for those UX efforts.

287
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:21,110
So I add some of those prototypical tasks

288
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,051
in the chart.

289
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,544
But ultimately, that map...

290
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,214
It's a map.

291
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:31,835
That framework is a map that UX and research need to navigate together.

292
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:34,195
So that's what we did.

293
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:36,456
We tried to find that common language.

294
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:42,237
So for UX research at the A, in order to be part of the development process, we need

295
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:45,257
to articulate how we were bringing value to the table.

296
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:51,899
And we work on an expansion of that framework, laying out all our prototypical tasks and

297
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,299
endeavors on those stages.

298
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:57,578
And from there, we were able to work with production

299
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:00,559
to further tailor their questions

300
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,619
on a specific game characteristics

301
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,399
and design intentions.

302
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,560
For example, in Battlefield 1,

303
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:12,481
a key design intention was being epic.

304
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:17,022
We make it explicit that we were supporting

305
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:18,363
that feeling of epicness

306
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,763
throughout the whole development process.

307
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:28,640
Being a first-person shooter in World War I meant that, for instance, weapons had to

308
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:37,027
feel old-school yet authentic, but not to the detriment of slowing down players' actions,

309
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:40,010
which we did there.

310
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:45,795
And another example was the introduction of large vehicles, like the Zeppelin.

311
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:49,445
We need to answer those questions related to the impact

312
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:52,866
of introducing those behemoths, those vehicles,

313
00:19:53,286 --> 00:19:56,087
during a full match, during our playtesting sessions.

314
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,670
Now, we have a roadmap, we know what we're doing.

315
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,991
All that is key.

316
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:06,971
Now we need to execute it.

317
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,335
So let's look at the micro level of how we work.

318
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,476
And I'm referring to this of what happens in each and

319
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:15,337
single study.

320
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:19,118
And a default test can be divided into four big steps.

321
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,240
Preparation, execution, analysis, and reporting.

322
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,243
It informs production, action on those findings, and then we

323
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:31,143
go to the next iteration to the next test.

324
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,751
We were doing fairly good with production in the kickoff meetings.

325
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:37,071
Everyone was attending.

326
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:40,992
It was going great during the execution of the sessions.

327
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,473
Production was coming to the observation room.

328
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,633
They were doing the test.

329
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,374
Now, the interesting part of the story here was

330
00:20:48,974 --> 00:20:51,734
between analysis and reporting.

331
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:55,455
And we were experiencing a couple of errors during that time.

332
00:20:57,012 --> 00:21:01,594
At first, we were so eager to give them the best research ever

333
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,575
that one of the deliverables for the final report

334
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:10,136
took two weeks from final session to here, report.

335
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:12,737
And that was detrimental.

336
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:14,978
We forgot that we kept moving,

337
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:17,659
that our partner was going over there dancing.

338
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,739
And by the time that they got the results,

339
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,860
they had made changes.

340
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,221
A lot of those findings were obsolete, dying inside.

341
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:28,974
Those applications were gone.

342
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:31,495
Something salvaged it, but it was very clear

343
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:34,715
that we were not aligning with their pacing.

344
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:37,516
It was also generating anxiety.

345
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:39,976
From the day of the test to getting results,

346
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:41,876
they knew that we collected data,

347
00:21:42,037 --> 00:21:44,297
and they wanted to know how we were doing,

348
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:48,458
what unnecessary settings for the dev team.

349
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:52,518
We went to the other extreme on the spectrum,

350
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,639
and we tried to be very, very, very, very quick

351
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,879
and try to deliver it within two days.

352
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:00,096
And analysis was hurt.

353
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:01,317
It was more like a data dump.

354
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:02,537
Not proud of that work.

355
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:06,759
So we need to find that middle ground.

356
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,242
We need to do something to give good data, good analysis, in

357
00:22:12,262 --> 00:22:13,062
a timely manner.

358
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:18,665
And that's when we introduced what was a top liner in our

359
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,886
process, which is between.

360
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:25,930
Just 24 hours after the last session,

361
00:22:27,031 --> 00:22:28,972
production receives this top liner

362
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:31,533
which contains the high-level analysis of the test,

363
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:35,595
and then a final report two to four days later

364
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:36,956
with the full scope.

365
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:40,438
And that helped greatly to our communication

366
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:43,019
in providing information in a timely manner

367
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,600
and keep moving forward.

368
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,421
It helped to the relationship

369
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,182
as well as addressing their needs.

370
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:55,774
So now that we have a UX process laid out,

371
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:58,537
I want to focus on organizational structure

372
00:22:58,817 --> 00:22:59,778
for UX research.

373
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:05,362
And with this, I'm referring to where within the company

374
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:07,344
should UX research live.

375
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:11,687
And organizational structures have implications

376
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:15,810
on relationships, visibility for the product,

377
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:20,174
and how you're going to be prioritizing content.

378
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:25,105
At EA, we had a centralized UX research organization.

379
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:29,329
We engaged with multiple game teams across all EA.

380
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,232
And as you know, the EA portfolio is pretty large.

381
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:40,339
So in other words, we have a single team with just a handful of researchers carrying out

382
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:43,622
all the research activities for the whole organization.

383
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:50,127
This means that the researcher was A, no part of the

384
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:52,928
development team, and that the researcher was supporting

385
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:54,149
multiple franchises.

386
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:58,751
For instance, someone would be working on FIFA, as well as

387
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:00,531
UFC and NHL.

388
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:06,654
This type of organizational model was great for us at the

389
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:06,974
time.

390
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:08,975
Remember that wake-up call?

391
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:12,565
We need a good sense of processes.

392
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:15,668
So this organizational model was great for that.

393
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:16,869
Why?

394
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,151
There are like four key positive aspects for this.

395
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:28,098
For once, it creates a really high, strong hub of experts.

396
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,901
This allows a lot of easy sharing of best practices,

397
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:36,625
reinforcing that quality, which was very important

398
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:37,826
to mature our practice.

399
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:44,883
The range of projects was varied, so it kept entertaining and refreshing, which for retaining

400
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,964
talent long term can be important.

401
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:56,468
The accumulation of knowledge across the different products allow us to have meta insights.

402
00:24:57,168 --> 00:25:01,730
If we put all our shooters together, all our sports together, we can answer bigger business

403
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,771
questions for this.

404
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:07,004
And ultimately, it has an economical benefit too,

405
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,325
because central teams can share those resources.

406
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:14,306
You don't need to build like two labs, three labs.

407
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:16,607
You can license products.

408
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,968
You can have your recruiter, your lab technician

409
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:20,108
that serves everyone.

410
00:25:21,528 --> 00:25:23,689
So that was great for us.

411
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:27,990
And with a handful of people, we need to cover a lot of games.

412
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,291
And that's where some challenges are.

413
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,893
We have to rationalize efforts.

414
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:38,597
We have one person with three titles, three big titles.

415
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,700
Well, we covered them all, but it's still one person.

416
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:47,306
And that leads to a constant reprioritization exercise

417
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,468
of the portfolio, which can be tricky,

418
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:52,632
because it has implication of what's important,

419
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:54,313
what's not important, what we should tackle.

420
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,047
And you don't need a big portfolio.

421
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,628
I'm pretty sure that all you can relate to this

422
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:01,210
within a single game.

423
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,831
You have different features, you have different modes.

424
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,733
Something has to give attention,

425
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:07,334
something will not have attention.

426
00:26:08,495 --> 00:26:10,736
And another shortcoming of this structure

427
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:13,358
is the relationship with production,

428
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,140
which tends to feel like it's more at arm length.

429
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,252
The development team can perceive the research as external,

430
00:26:21,092 --> 00:26:24,253
and the research are feeding out of the loop from production.

431
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:27,214
Sometimes the game changes a lot within a week.

432
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:33,057
So, what we do.

433
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:36,238
At EA, the research efforts and the improvements

434
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:37,538
that we're doing were paying off,

435
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,019
and we had great support.

436
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:42,280
It enabled to actually...

437
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,782
Oop, it's missing something, but it's a letter.

438
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:51,521
It was missing... no, there was animation, you saw it.

439
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:53,383
There it is. It was there.

440
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:58,587
So, we were very lucky that we could actually increase the size of the team.

441
00:26:59,448 --> 00:27:04,052
And we could actually now be having people more dedicated to certain franchises

442
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:05,013
and not dividing them.

443
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:07,875
So it was one person for FIFA, one person for Battlefront.

444
00:27:08,436 --> 00:27:11,359
And that was increasing fantastic for our bandwidth.

445
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:15,037
But getting more headcount for more researchers is not a light task.

446
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:20,703
As in any organizational, for any role, it's something that just doesn't grow on trees.

447
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:31,534
I think about evaluating what a decentralized model will look like, and where people are

448
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:32,776
independent from each other.

449
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:42,596
So however we concluded that the slower pacing of our practice didn't really trump having

450
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:45,978
that close, close, close relationship with the team at the time.

451
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:54,585
And something that was huge for us is that the lack of having comparable results was

452
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:57,207
a huge, huge risk that we could not afford.

453
00:27:57,727 --> 00:27:59,749
It was almost like calling for another wake-up call.

454
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:02,968
So we wanted to keep the quality.

455
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:06,131
We wanted people to know how to dance properly,

456
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:09,353
not just shaking their body in some way.

457
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:11,455
Not like this.

458
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:12,635
Thanks, Ian.

459
00:28:16,518 --> 00:28:20,041
So by now, we did have a better, established, stronger

460
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:21,382
relationship with the production.

461
00:28:22,323 --> 00:28:24,744
We identified champions within the game teams.

462
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:28,821
And we work with them to iron the process.

463
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,382
So things have improved a lot.

464
00:28:31,703 --> 00:28:36,327
But what happened for us was keeping each other in contact

465
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,108
with our partner.

466
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:42,413
And one day, one of the key point of contacts from NHL

467
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,335
moved to another project.

468
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:47,798
And that left a void into our synchronization.

469
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:53,027
And instead of waiting for the NHL team to come up with a

470
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:57,788
backup field for that position, we stepped up our game and we

471
00:28:57,828 --> 00:29:02,348
decided to propose to go embedded with our researcher.

472
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:06,089
In other words, that the researcher will be working now

473
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:09,790
on the floor with that dev team, being reintroduced as a

474
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,910
team member rather than a partner.

475
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,871
And the NHL team was very supportive of this approach.

476
00:29:16,995 --> 00:29:17,876
And it was awesome.

477
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:23,299
It really helped us to improve to a new deep level

478
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:24,660
of those relationships.

479
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,342
We had that extra time and dedication with the team now.

480
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:32,324
So we could actually now answer more questions.

481
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:35,526
There were more people from production asking more and more

482
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:36,486
to the researcher.

483
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:38,988
And it was also an opportunity for the researcher

484
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,049
to keep developing those skills.

485
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:45,322
So because we have that strong foundation now,

486
00:29:45,722 --> 00:29:49,643
we could refocus on those advanced technologies

487
00:29:49,903 --> 00:29:51,743
and bring them back to the team.

488
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:56,965
In that case, we were focusing a lot on UI and accessibility

489
00:29:56,985 --> 00:30:00,325
to blind color players that we could go back to now

490
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,706
keep advancing the field.

491
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:09,527
The one risk of going hybrid is that now that researcher

492
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:10,608
becoming an island.

493
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:15,720
And that's a delicate because it's an island from the other

494
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:21,564
researchers and actually how to allow tailoring for certain

495
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:25,087
practices but yet being aligned with the overall process.

496
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:28,929
So we're working on that in a variety of different ways from

497
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:33,032
our end and keeping that tightness of the researchers by

498
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,474
allowing to have internal projects to work on.

499
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:39,334
Things that I can connect it and to can actually,

500
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:43,016
can keep advancing our practice over and over.

501
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,699
Now, what I've told you so far

502
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,900
is related to the grassroots efforts.

503
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:55,183
A lot of that change was from UX from the bottom up.

504
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,565
But really, to change culture within a company,

505
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:02,086
it also needs to come from the top down.

506
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:05,408
There needs to be management buying into UX.

507
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:09,228
And at EA, we were all doing our dancing steps,

508
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:13,411
but you truly dance when you're going with the music.

509
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:15,732
And the director of the orchestra

510
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:20,154
is a key piece to keep us all together and dancing.

511
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:25,737
You need leaders in your organization to believe in UX

512
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:27,318
and to support those efforts.

513
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:32,249
So in 2013, when Andrew Wilson became the CEO of EA,

514
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:34,470
as a new leader in the company,

515
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,993
he set a series of pillars for guiding EA.

516
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:41,635
And the most important ones was player first.

517
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:44,177
When I heard that, I was like,

518
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,819
woohoo, I was over the moon with that.

519
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,041
Because he was really talking about

520
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:52,663
that nothing is more important than our players.

521
00:31:53,524 --> 00:31:56,206
That user-centered design is the way that we work.

522
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:58,217
that is player first.

523
00:31:58,838 --> 00:32:02,941
And nowadays there is no discussion how good a game is

524
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:05,364
without talking about player's insights.

525
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:13,471
With that was the whole journey of EAF-UX so far.

526
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,554
And I just wanted to recap on those

527
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:18,676
shared learnings from today.

528
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:21,562
have a shared framework.

529
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:25,243
You need a good research practice that is effective

530
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:28,444
and communicates clearly, but it sets a map

531
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:32,065
to relate to each other for those steps

532
00:32:32,505 --> 00:32:33,925
at the macro and micro level.

533
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:38,046
So make sure that your findings are actionable and timely

534
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:38,726
all the time.

535
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:41,507
Constant improvement.

536
00:32:42,317 --> 00:32:45,299
Feel how your partner is doing and adjust accordingly.

537
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,321
Leverage on opportunities.

538
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:50,344
Find an organizational model that fits your needs.

539
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:53,266
And continue reviewing your deliverables and tech

540
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:54,227
as you go through.

541
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:58,090
And ultimately, it has to be a UX culture.

542
00:32:58,991 --> 00:33:01,633
And it needs both dancers and the music.

543
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:04,996
And to have those, is go from the grassroots,

544
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:07,378
but it also need to find your champions.

545
00:33:09,961 --> 00:33:10,281
Thank you.
