1
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:08,370
Hi, thanks for coming. So yeah, my name is Patrick, as you can see up there. I'm the

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:14,012
developer at Dry Cactus, and we're just a very small studio based in New Zealand. We

3
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:19,233
made a game called Poly Bridge, and we released it at the end of June 2015 on Steam Early

4
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,894
Access, and we had a few unexpected and unusual things happen, so that's why I'm here today.

5
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:27,815
Specifically, these are the most interesting things.

6
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:33,857
So you might have seen some of these pop up on some social media such as Reddit or Twitter

7
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:41,660
in the last six months. What we did with the game was kind of integrate a replay sharing

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,062
tool that made it very easy for players to share their little moments with their social

9
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:52,485
media timelines and posts and wherever. And it had a very welcome, unexpected kind of

10
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:58,036
flooding effect in the sense that we didn't really anticipate the kind of exposure we got

11
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:02,058
through social media and how that translated to sales and financial viability of the game.

12
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:07,680
So what I'm trying to do today is kind of go over some stats and try and identify the link

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,702
between exposure on social media and how that translated to sales and how eventually it

14
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:16,884
created this kind of feedback loop between content creators on Twitch and YouTube and

15
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,485
people sharing on Reddit and so on.

16
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:23,305
First of all I want to have a quick intro what the game is

17
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:26,766
about because I don't expect most people to know about

18
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:30,467
Poly Bridge. It's a very simple bridge building game at core.

19
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:33,068
I'm a big fan of bridge building games. It was one of my

20
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:36,108
favorite genres when I was a kid. Particularly the pont

21
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:38,389
effect series if anyone is familiar with that from chronic

22
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:41,410
logic. It was the best bridge building game ever still.

23
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:46,616
So we took a number of ideas from those games. We did try and take it in a different

24
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:50,500
direction though. So as you can see from some of the images and also these

25
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,304
screenshots specifically, we tried to kind of take a step back away from the

26
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:59,228
seriousness that are bridge building and kind of physics games in general. And it's

27
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:03,232
a trend that's been going on. You can see it like in the hugely successful Kerbal

28
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:04,513
Space Program, for example, is

29
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:10,457
while super realistic with all the physics and so on, it has a more playful approach and makes it

30
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:17,363
look less hard and less kind of engineering which is a big barrier I think to adopting these kind

31
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:22,687
of games. So one of the first choices was to have a simple aesthetic style, limited color palette,

32
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:28,311
make it a bit childish and just when you see the game I didn't want anyone to say, oh this is like

33
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:32,854
it's an engineering game, it's not my kind of thing. So we tried to break down that wall first of all.

34
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,933
Along with that came some other choices like we tried to make a safe space for players

35
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:42,096
as we're calling it so we don't punish failure in any way. If anything we try and encourage

36
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:46,540
kind of trying this, trying that. It's very quick to try a bridge, it collapses, I'll

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,523
try another strut and move this thing around and kind of make it very easy to

38
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:54,768
You can iterate on your bridge design instead of feeling punished for failing.

39
00:02:54,968 --> 00:03:00,596
So, no failure. Along with that, Adrian Talents, who is a very talented composer based in Canada,

40
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:05,462
did a really nice soundtrack which goes very well with creating the mood of, we call it

41
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:08,526
anti-rage soundtrack because the game does really, really well.

42
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:13,390
push the button sometimes if you have to spend 45 minutes tweaking a bridge design and it keeps

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,454
collapsing. It's not much fun. So to try and counter that feeling of I want to kill the game

44
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:24,079
developer, we put this kind of soft, mellow guitar instrumental soundtrack which is really

45
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:31,945
nice. The niche is this word that is tossed around a lot. There might be some other developers

46
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:36,789
here who kind of focus on niche design. It's a bit of a broad word. It doesn't really mean too

47
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,009
much.

48
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,691
Bridge building game is kind of a sub niche of the physics building niche in itself. What I did

49
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,912
when I started this project a couple of years ago and I was alone, it was shortly after my

50
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:54,993
partner became pregnant and I had to decide what to do with my life. It was either find a

51
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:59,334
job and do that kind of thing or try and do another game. The only successful game I had

52
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:03,495
done previously was a bridge building game. Taking the lessons learned from that, I

53
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:05,395
really thought I will just do a kind of game.

54
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:12,300
small niche game. Eventually the scope got bigger over time. It's something that many

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,824
other developers feel the same. If you're going to make a game and you don't have much

56
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:25,589
money, try and do a niche game. That's what I did. It paid out in a way. Along with that,

57
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:30,733
the sandbox was a big thing. Very trendy as well. Low poly is trendy. We tried to identify

58
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:37,203
trend so to speak in indie games and what players want. So sandbox was a big thing. So you're not

59
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:41,184
limited in content to what the game developer gives you but you can kind of do your own thing.

60
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:47,565
It's integrated with Steam Workshop and so on. And the other big word, community, which means

61
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:51,626
nothing and everything at the same time. We kept tossing this word around as we were designing

62
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:55,007
the game, developing features and deciding what to do and what direction to take it in.

63
00:04:56,322 --> 00:05:05,609
We kind of thought community has to be kind of the foundation of this game for it to have a long term longevity and viability and so on.

64
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:19,199
So throughout the game design we always try to keep in mind how can this feature specifically work and integrate itself with the community forming and building that community and kind of, and keeping people happy at the same time.

65
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:20,800
Yeah.

66
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:25,160
Okay, so again, just to get an idea of what the kind of style

67
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,401
is, a very talented artist whose name is Javier, he's based in

68
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:31,762
Spain, and he's here with us today. Came up with this kind of

69
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:36,263
low poly style, very limited color palette. Hopefully it's

70
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:39,764
inviting to the eye, you know, it's not like an eyesore, and

71
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:42,105
when you see it, you might think, oh, it's cute. It's

72
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,245
something a bit different, at least for a bridge building

73
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:47,566
game. So I think that contributed a lot to kind of the

74
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:50,247
exposure we got going, you know, moving forward.

75
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:54,590
So community, you know, we kept tossing this word around,

76
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,770
not really knowing what to do with it

77
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,171
and how to try and build a community

78
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:01,552
and have people actually positively interact

79
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:03,353
with us as game developers and between them

80
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:05,854
and kind of take the game in a new direction.

81
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:09,175
So this is just a short recap of some of the choices we did

82
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,695
as we were developing the game.

83
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:13,176
The main one being the replay recording and sharing,

84
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:14,657
which is kind of why I'm here today.

85
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:18,578
So I'll talk a bit more about that shortly.

86
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:25,208
Along with that we integrated some other tools. The gallery, so when you share a replay in the

87
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:30,751
game it goes to an anonymous online gallery where people can log in through steam and rate,

88
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:34,513
comment and filter through submissions for specific levels.

89
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:40,317
It kind of gives the content creators that give the replays to our gallery a bit of feedback

90
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:43,039
because you get kind of your little star rating and comments occasionally.

91
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,482
And it just allows kind of other players to see what people are doing.

92
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:52,985
And the most important thing for us as developers is that we're able to see very, very quickly

93
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,768
what kind of ideas people are coming up with when playing the game.

94
00:06:56,988 --> 00:07:00,270
And this has been a huge factor because as we moved forward with development shortly

95
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,391
after the early access launch.

96
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:07,834
We were able to see all these new ways, kind of, and new mechanics to play the game that we weren't

97
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:12,576
aware of. And by doing so we kind of then started designing levels and designing features of the

98
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:18,539
game that brought that into the game. So a very good kind of feedback loop, so to speak, was

99
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:22,661
created between the early adopters of the game and us as game developers in trying to kind of,

100
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,602
you know, everybody's happy at the end of the day.

101
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:32,046
Another thing we did was the feedback tool. I attended GDC last year and there was a talk from one of the developers of Subnautica.

102
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:37,887
which is that kind of underwater diving game. And they had a whole talk about how they

103
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:43,088
developed a feedback tool that allows players to send a little item of feedback without

104
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:46,889
ever leaving the game. So a panel just pops up. You can say if you're happy, sad or medium.

105
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:52,130
You can give them a comment and it will also send a screen shot and the debugger log of

106
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,211
what's going on behind the scenes. So when a player identifies or a bug happens,

107
00:07:56,892 --> 00:08:00,994
Hopefully they will send us a little feedback item saying this bug happened, I'm not sure why.

108
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:06,257
And I get to see the debug log and I can hopefully identify why the bug kind of happened.

109
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:12,601
So it's semi bug tracking, semi kind of feedback and again the loop between the player and the

110
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:18,645
developer kind of trying to narrow that gap and make it a bit more kind of meaningful for

111
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:20,206
players to interact with the developers.

112
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:25,942
Again, the sandbox and the workshop, a huge part of building the community, because that's

113
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:28,286
where the community forms is when people get to design levels.

114
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,034
and send them up to the Steam Workshop specifically in this case and players can download them.

115
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:38,438
So along with that we also created the link between the Steam Workshop submissions and

116
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,382
the replay gallery. So it's starting to kind of pay off now so to speak and seeing lots

117
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:48,686
of replays. So as a player of the game if you make a sandbox level and you submit it

118
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:53,690
to Steam Workshop for other people to solve, you can then see when a replay is submitted

119
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:57,153
for your level you can see what players are doing with your own level. So this kind of

120
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:57,434
gives.

121
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,122
This level designer type of feedback is rarely seen in other

122
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,164
games which I think is a bit of a shame because you design a

123
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:08,985
level, you just send it out and often you can see maybe some

124
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:12,667
comments but in this way you can actually see the bridge designs

125
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:15,349
that are being made with your kind of layout and it makes a

126
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,070
really kind of nice feedback and tiny in the community.

127
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:24,455
And replays. So just a little bit talking about the replay and kind of the technical

128
00:09:24,495 --> 00:09:29,377
implementation without going too deeply into it because there's lots of stuff out there and I'll

129
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:33,379
be more than happy to answer any questions later about the more technical stuff. But what we're

130
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,780
doing is we're always recording footage as the simulation happens. We record that at 15

131
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,901
frames per second.

132
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:43,595
for technical reasons and also because animated gifs or gifs,

133
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:47,179
depending where you're from, kind of a standard of 15 frames

134
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:47,719
a second.

135
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,904
It's, you know, the animated gif is a very ancient file format.

136
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,106
It's like from 1990, I think.

137
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,208
So it's not very well compressed.

138
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:58,230
It has a very limited color palette, which is 256 colors.

139
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:04,316
The files get very large very quickly and obviously the challenge there was as we were

140
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:08,741
recording footage it goes into the VRAM so we can't obviously take up too much VRAM otherwise

141
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:13,566
lower end devices can't play the game and also when you go and upload the file itself you want

142
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:17,691
it to be quite small because it doesn't you don't want to take like you know a minute to upload a

143
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:21,535
replay it kind of breaks the flow so we you know kit plays quite small.

144
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,646
So we're recording footage at all times.

145
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:30,254
This kind of was a choice to try and break down that wall.

146
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:32,717
I was talking to many other game developers

147
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:33,999
who are doing similar things.

148
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,722
And some of them are saying, we put these tools in,

149
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,045
but we're not seeing the kind of interaction

150
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:39,887
that we were hoping for.

151
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:45,034
And it's often because they require you to log into your YouTube account. You have to do all

152
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:49,901
these extra steps which players are just, they're not going to leave the game to go and upload

153
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:53,566
something to YouTube or to the social media platform. Some of them will of course but

154
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:55,008
you're just like a good

155
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:59,753
90% making it up, obviously, of people will not just bother pretty much.

156
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:01,775
So what we try to do is you never have to leave the game.

157
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:06,259
With a single click, it generates an animated GIF of the buffer that has been recorded over

158
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,584
the last 10 seconds, and then it saves it locally or it can upload it to our online

159
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,666
gallery which I talked about, and social media.

160
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,369
We have Twitter integration at the moment and are working on some other ones.

161
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,551
So once you authenticate the first time in-game...

162
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:22,403
You just press a single button, share it, save your replay, upload it to your Twitter timeline,

163
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:26,154
to the online gallery, to your local hard drive, so then you can repost it wherever you want.

164
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:31,685
And that created the whole kind of feedback loop which we weren't expecting. If you're

165
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:36,448
interested in the tick, it's open source. It's actually Zach Bart who's a developer on

166
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:43,592
Zachtronics and recently released TIS 100 and InfiniFactory. He actually wrote the

167
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:47,474
encoder and he's very kind to give it to me and then it was released open source in a

168
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:52,317
Bitbucket repo. So it's up there for everyone to use. It's C sharp obviously. Not

169
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:56,439
obviously but it's C sharp and it comes with an example to integrate into Unity very

170
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:56,780
quickly.

171
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:01,455
So definitely, you know, if your game allows for this kind of

172
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:05,698
feedback, number one recommendation would be to

173
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,839
integrate something like this and think about it, you know.

174
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,262
So, yeah, covering this, what I'd like to then go on to see

175
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:16,964
is the more financial kind of aspect of the game.

176
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:20,346
So this is a bit of a confusing slide, so I'll give you a few

177
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,628
seconds to try and kind of make sense of it.

178
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:29,981
It was hard for me to identify the timeline of events so it was even harder to try to

179
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:33,725
communicate it in a meaningful way but this is the best I could come up with at the time.

180
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:40,833
You can see on the left you have a linear timeline and on the right is a meaningless

181
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:42,615
diagram of how ‑‑

182
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:48,397
things kind of feed back into each other. It's very hard to say this first happened on a

183
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:53,398
Twitter feed and then it faded into this Twitch stream which then meant somebody posted it on

184
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,960
Reddit and then the YouTube guy came along. So it's just, you know, I just thought it's just a

185
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,541
feedback loop between all the different platforms and the content creators that use those

186
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:08,483
platforms. But what did happen though is the first kind of month is kind of what you're seeing

187
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:11,944
in the left timeline. So we launched into early access. That was the 30th of June.

188
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:17,935
We had some positive reviews because we had worked with a small PR company to get some people

189
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:22,938
playing the game early on and do some YouTube videos pre-launch which helped hugely I'm pretty

190
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:28,581
sure. So on launch we had 15 positive reviews I think and a bunch of YouTube videos were already

191
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:33,584
out there on launch day which was a very big thing in kind of creating the positive image of the game.

192
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,012
So along with that, shortly after launch we started seeing a very steady stream of content

193
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:43,034
going on the Twitter timelines. Lots of people sharing the replays on Twitter, which were

194
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:48,196
then getting retweeted and kind of starting the snowball effect of exposure of the game,

195
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:51,498
which is ultimately what obviously we were trying to get, because with exposure comes

196
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:55,940
potential sale. But without exposure, you're probably nowhere, unfortunately.

197
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:01,286
So then we started seeing more YouTube content coming through. The first Twitch stream started

198
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:05,729
happening and kind of generating pretty sharp spikes of sales when the Twitch stream was

199
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:11,654
happening. Reddit was the main one, as we're going to cover shortly. And then shortly after

200
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:16,138
the Reddit kind of top page, we started climbing up the Steam charts and were in the top ten

201
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:21,743
for a couple of days, which obviously created more interest. And you can see quite a while

202
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:24,685
down the timeline, we then started getting mainstream media coverage.

203
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:29,731
So it's a bit unusual but it's something that's been shifting so much in the last couple of

204
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:35,857
years is you no longer aim as much for getting that coverage from Kotaku, Gizmodo or IGN.

205
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,884
Personally what happened for us was seeing the coverage from mainstream media would bring

206
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:49,350
virtually, it was impossible to identify when an article on IGN, how that would translate to

207
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,751
exposure and sales. It wasn't even noticeable on the sales graph. While if you see a Twitch

208
00:14:54,771 --> 00:15:00,653
stream or a Reddit post that gets upvoted a lot, you see a very, very clear spike in sales. So

209
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:06,234
as an indie developer, I guess you're aiming more these days for getting the exposure on

210
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:11,035
social media and with content creators on these new platforms and not so much with the

211
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,455
traditional media, so to speak.

212
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:19,843
Just because the level of exposure you get is nothing compared to what you can get with a Reddit post.

213
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:25,946
So to try and kind of bridge the gap, so to speak, funny bridge

214
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:29,868
pun, between sales and exposure on social media, what I thought

215
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,950
I was going to do, what I'm doing, is looking at the first

216
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,332
30 days of sales. And so with these 30 days of sales, as you

217
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,534
can see here, so quick stats, in the first 30 days we sold just

218
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:45,396
over 50,000 copies at full price, which is $1,199. And it

219
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,997
made a bit over a half million gross in revenue.

220
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:52,789
This is aggregated data from the two platforms they were selling on, which were steam and

221
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:59,555
humble. So what I did here was identify these kind of little events that happened the first

222
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:05,700
month. You can see. So our L is the launch. You can see it kind of goes up a tiny bit and

223
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,703
then it starts coming down. And until we hit T1, that was kind of

224
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,455
what launch was going to be. If we hadn't integrated all the social media and replay sharing

225
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:22,802
in these community tools, I'm pretty positive this graph would have just kind of stopped at

226
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:25,785
the L and slowly gone down and just held there.

227
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:29,487
what happened instead are these other events that you can see

228
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:34,509
obviously kind of crushed the launch cell. So we're going to

229
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:37,170
dive a bit more deeply into these. So we're going to ignore

230
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,912
launch but you can kind of launch. We had maybe on launch

231
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:48,275
day about 300 cells and then 250, 200 and so on. So it's

232
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:52,997
going down pretty quickly. So we have T1. T1 is the first major

233
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:54,398
event. It's a twitch stream.

234
00:16:55,603 --> 00:17:00,766
We peaked at about 2,000 viewers as you can see from the graph. While these are daily

235
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:07,751
sales, the first 30 days, these are now hourly sales. So you can see on the left we're tailing

236
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:13,695
at about 5 to 10 sales per hour on that day. And then we get a huge spike. It's about 80

237
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,717
on the first spike and about 100 on the second spike.

238
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:27,587
What's quite interesting with Twitch, which might be obvious to some and was not obvious to me because it was quite new to me, the whole Twitch stream and YouTube and so on.

239
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:35,135
With the Twitch stream, you often get these spikes of cells during the Twitch stream and as soon as the stream ends, you kind of just go back to where you were.

240
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:38,999
So it generates a small and short-lived spike of cells.

241
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,743
Potentially it generates a longer term interest in the game because people talk about it to

242
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:50,287
their friends and cover it on YouTube and so on. But as far as immediate visibility

243
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:55,010
of increased sales, there is virtually none. You just see the spike and it goes back down.

244
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:00,713
So that was the first Twitch stream and pretty decent spikes and we were very happy at the

245
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:05,956
time. This is very unexpected. Wasn't really anticipating the game picked up by Twitch

246
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:07,578
streamers but it was pretty cool.

247
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:13,294
So the second spike, T2, is just here. That's another Twitch stream.

248
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:19,191
This was a larger twitch stream. It had about 16,000 concurrent viewers at its peak.

249
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:25,236
Similar effect. We're tailing at about 20 up to 50 sales per hour because of other

250
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,520
like YouTube was starting also to pick up. So daily or hourly sales were kind of

251
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,804
increasing slowly on their own. But then the twitch stream happened. There was the

252
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:37,988
one spike as you can see in 200 there. Shortly after that twitch stream another

253
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:41,270
twitch stream with slightly fewer viewers. So that's the second kind of hump you

254
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:41,951
see after the 200 mark.

255
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,334
But again, interesting to see how the end of the sales graph

256
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:51,136
kind of matches the beginning of it. So we had the spikes and

257
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:56,361
then we went back down. A couple days after, when I was working

258
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,203
on the game, so we released the game and I was somewhat

259
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,845
obsessively looking at the stats. What you can do on a

260
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:04,828
Steam store page is link a Google Analytics tracking code

261
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:07,370
so then you can go on your Google Analytics dashboard and

262
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,691
see what's going on. You can see how many people are viewing,

263
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:10,932
from which platform they're coming.

264
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:17,244
there's some issues around tracking where traffic is coming from but overall it gives you a

265
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:22,445
very good idea. And what I was doing, I was keeping a little window open with the live stats

266
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:26,486
so you can Google Analytics tries to tell you how many people are currently on your page.

267
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:31,587
And that was a way for me to try and identify very quickly when something happened

268
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:35,928
because like these Twitch streams started to happen and other events were starting to

269
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:38,408
happen and it was very important for us to try and keep track of.

270
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:44,076
what's generating a spike in sales and so we can kind of leverage on that in the future

271
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:48,178
and try and make features that encourage that kind of thing to be shared or whatever.

272
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,661
So a few days after the second Twitch stream I was looking at my live stats which were

273
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:59,205
generally hovering between 30 and 40 live concurrent people on the store page and I

274
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:00,746
just turned around and it was about 1500.

275
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:05,046
And I was like, hmm, there's something suspicious going on.

276
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,988
And because I'm not too much of the digital generation,

277
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,991
I was aware of Reddit, but I did not frequent Reddit as such.

278
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:17,313
So I wasn't too familiar with how it works and what goes on.

279
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,854
So a friend of mine sent me a text saying,

280
00:20:18,874 --> 00:20:19,874
you should check out Reddit.

281
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:22,656
And then I saw at the top of the front page on Reddit,

282
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:24,977
there was a Polybridge GIF, which is the one you actually

283
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:25,738
see in a top right.

284
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:30,056
Incidentally, that's as you can probably tell, kind of a physics glitch.

285
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,058
What's happening there is that the monster truck has infinite friction on its wheels.

286
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:38,560
So when it hits the edge, it just kind of has to go somewhere and it flips wildly back.

287
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:43,423
Somehow, it actually re-does a thing and hits the flag and wins the level.

288
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:46,084
So it's kind of a, you know, a very happy glitch, so to speak.

289
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,025
It was the first Poly Bridge gift it got.

290
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:52,830
Lots and lots of traction. It got upvoted so much that it was top front page on Reddit for any

291
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:59,677
person subscribed to the gaming sub or also just anonymously browsing Reddit. So you can see the

292
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:03,641
spike there pretty much. These are hourly sales. We shot up to a maximum of 350 sales for an hour.

293
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:11,151
And interestingly enough, when it goes back down, it doesn't go as down as it was at the

294
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:15,932
start. So Reddit has, because it's obviously a Twitch stream, it doesn't end suddenly.

295
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:21,874
Once you drop down the front page, you still have a certain amount of visibility. And that

296
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:25,876
just created the phenomenon of the meme, so to speak.

297
00:21:27,274 --> 00:21:32,057
Somebody actually published a page on a website called knowyourmeme.com and

298
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:36,800
polybridge gift sharing became kind of a very niche meme where people would play

299
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,642
it and say here's how an engineer plays polybridge, here's how a student plays

300
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:46,445
polybridge, here's how whatever my job title is plays polybridge. So we started

301
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:50,247
seeing like some various things and it just translated to huge sales and

302
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:59,763
It kind of just kept growing and when a Reddit feature would drop off front page, it was still like holding, hourly sales were still holding very well.

303
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:07,733
It wouldn't just drop out of nowhere. So definitely the fact that it got picked up by Reddit players was the main thing that drove sales.

304
00:22:08,802 --> 00:22:14,284
running a bit short in time so very small stats. Might be relevant depending on what you're

305
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:19,447
trying to accomplish. On Reddit these are stats that are new to me. They're a bit hard to find

306
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:24,009
so that's why I thought it would be useful to share these. So on the left you see the top

307
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:28,772
ten Polybridge gifs that come up on Reddit. They've accumulated roughly 12 million views.

308
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:29,512
Probably a few more.

309
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:34,298
If you want to go, if you're aiming for the front page, you

310
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:37,280
have to get at least 2,000 votes, up to 5,000 if you want

311
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,462
to be on the front page and not only on the top of the gaming

312
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:44,525
subreddit. When we did get a front page gif, it would

313
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:47,888
easily generate 1 to 2, even 3 million views. If you think

314
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:52,131
about just, we're independent developers, we're trying to make

315
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:55,714
a small game and suddenly we're getting 4 or 5 million views

316
00:22:55,794 --> 00:22:58,276
every couple of days just through reddit. It was just

317
00:22:58,976 --> 00:22:59,877
so insane for us.

318
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:05,563
What is hard though, because on Reddit you just share your little gif, luckily most people

319
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:10,369
would at least put the name of the game sometimes. But if you want to then find out more about

320
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:14,494
the game, most likely you're just going to go on Google, search for Polybridge. So it's

321
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:17,978
very hard for us to track direct traffic from Reddit to the store page.

322
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:23,982
It's kind of guess work but it's pretty obvious when you look at the sales stats and how you

323
00:23:24,022 --> 00:23:29,626
see a Reddit thing and you see the spike in sales. But it's very hard to say track the

324
00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:35,930
long term life of a Reddit kind of feature. The other thing being YouTube. Lots of videos

325
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:41,073
on YouTube for some reason or another are very big in Brazil and some other South American

326
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:41,514
countries.

327
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:46,686
Top nine are from non-English speaking countries.

328
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:52,009
And then PewDiePie did kind of a very short video and misspelt the name of the game.

329
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:52,389
Thank you.

330
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:55,450
But still, it had a few million views.

331
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:58,492
The top 10 videos accumulated about 70 million views.

332
00:23:58,952 --> 00:24:02,033
There's 20, whatever number, thousand videos have been posted.

333
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:06,676
And YouTube does have a very long-term impact on sales, but again, a bit hard to track because

334
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,116
generally...

335
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:12,068
Players don't seem to click on a YouTube link and then go and buy the game.

336
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:14,309
They might be interested, but later on they'll Google it.

337
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:19,170
And so it's hard to track the direct correlation between a YouTube exposure and how that translated

338
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,371
to sales and how many people, you know, what percentage of people actually bought the game

339
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:23,711
and so on.

340
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:28,012
And this is the Dancing Banana, which you might be familiar with.

341
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:32,313
This is the top result if you do a Google image search of animated GIF.

342
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:34,093
So I thought it was relevant.

343
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:40,866
If anybody has any questions, there's a few mics or you can just shout out and I'll repeat it.

344
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:48,814
And also, because we're all kind of running out of time, I'll be across the room in the wrap up room if anybody wants to have a chat or whatever. I'm very open.

345
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:57,175
So other than having in-game videos and GIFs making it easy to share, other than that,

346
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:04,119
to get the Twitch players to stream your game or the Redditors to post and upload your game,

347
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:12,684
what can you do to enable, what can you do to make the Twitch players play your game

348
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:15,006
and the Redditors to post it and upload it?

349
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:21,632
It's a bit of a hard question I guess. So I'll just repeat the question real quick in case nobody heard it for the video.

350
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:26,315
He was asking what can we do to try and encourage Twitch streamers or raditors to actually share the content.

351
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:30,797
So what worked for us was trying to knock down those barriers with the sharing.

352
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:36,700
So within the game, it's literally a single click and half a second and then you can keep on playing.

353
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,961
And then it saves your gif locally and uploads it.

354
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:58,261
So I think that was what created the initial interest in the game and as far as Twitch streamers go, we really didn't do anything though. We didn't reach out to Twitch streamers. It was just natural discoverability through the social media platforms that did everything pretty much. It was largely not anticipated on our part.

355
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:01,563
Mostly a mistake to be honest, it just kind of happened.

356
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:03,524
It was a very happy accident so to speak.

357
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:07,667
But we did contact, two weeks prior to launch,

358
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:10,789
we worked with Evolve PR and they contacted some YouTube

359
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,171
and some Twitch streamers as well, but kind of smaller channels.

360
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:17,333
The ones that I covered as far as the events and the sales graph

361
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:20,174
that we looked at, those were completely organic

362
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:23,376
and they were larger streamers that normally covered Minecraft

363
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:26,078
specifically and for some reason they decided to cover,

364
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:28,439
they were all friends I think, and they just covered it.

365
00:26:29,677 --> 00:26:32,260
Yeah, so kind of organic in that sense.

366
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:36,525
I think just because so many people were sharing these gifs and then doing it on Reddit as well,

367
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:38,448
just because they felt like doing it.

368
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:41,792
There was not an encouragement on our part necessarily to do so.

369
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:43,855
Yep, sorry.

370
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:58,754
I think I was going to ask something similar, but how do you think this will affect the next game that you have in development, knowing that this GIF stuff and this Twitch is actually a really effective marketing strategy?

371
00:26:59,414 --> 00:27:04,457
So the question being, how is this going to affect our future development on other games with the GIF sharing and so on?

372
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,112
Specifically, we're not working on the game. We're a very small team, so we're still in early access.

373
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:12,954
So we're just working full-time on this. If I had to take a guess, though,

374
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:19,057
I would try in any future game I work on, the core design will be keeping in mind

375
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:23,159
how a player can own the content that they're making.

376
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:27,101
This worked really well in our case because you're building a bridge, and every bridge is a bit different.

377
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:27,901
So when a player...

378
00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:34,830
see something funny or it's quite ingenious, they feel like they own that content. They

379
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,192
came up with that bridge so it's going to motivate them to share these moments and that's

380
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:43,934
a huge factor which other games have tried to tap into but maybe because they're quite

381
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:48,857
linear and the end result is going to be the same for everyone, it's not a personal experience

382
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:52,298
so I'm not going to be motivated as a player to share. So yeah, definitely kind of keeping

383
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:57,501
in mind the game design with the player owning what they're doing kind of in a sense.

384
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:00,944
Hey, Patrick.

385
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:01,564
Great talk.

386
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:06,846
I'm curious if the analytics you put in to track your spikes

387
00:28:06,906 --> 00:28:08,847
and correlate them with social media stuff,

388
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:12,468
was all of that or most of that in ahead of time

389
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:13,129
when you launched?

390
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,509
Or did it become apparent that, oh, the stuff

391
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:16,510
is feeding into each other.

392
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,431
We better start to investigate it more.

393
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:23,434
Yeah, so question being what we did with the analytics pretty much and whether we had them

394
00:28:23,474 --> 00:28:30,963
from launch and so on. Well, I'm not the biggest adopter or I don't really know much about

395
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:35,268
analytics, so luckily when you set up a steam store page, you can get a lot of

396
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:39,593
So all the analytics come from Steam pretty much. So you can set up a Google Analytics code in your

397
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:45,881
Steam store page and then that's pretty much all I did. As far as timing, I set up pre-launch

398
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:49,986
because it seemed to make sense and it was recommended by some other developers. Otherwise,

399
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:51,568
I probably wouldn't have been aware of it.

400
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:56,865
And yeah, so that's kind of all I did. I just put up the Google

401
00:28:56,885 --> 00:29:00,187
Analytics tracking code and then I would keep a close eye on live

402
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:03,829
stats specifically and then also getting an idea of how many views

403
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:06,710
did we have yesterday on the store page and what percentage of

404
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,872
those views came from a specific platform. The problem though

405
00:29:09,912 --> 00:29:12,673
being that it's very hard to track direct traffic because of

406
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:15,735
the way you discover a game on Steam specifically.

407
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:18,716
It's very, very vague where the traffic came from.

408
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:22,097
So for example, if we track traffic from Reddit,

409
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:22,757
it says it's like 3%.

410
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,298
But it's obviously way more than that.

411
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:27,159
But because people go through Google search engine

412
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,639
to actually find a store page, there's

413
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,240
that disconnect, which is very hard to make sense of.

414
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,101
But that's all we did, really.

415
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:38,462
It wasn't too much in the analytic space.

416
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,543
It was just keeping an eye on what's going on.

417
00:29:40,623 --> 00:29:41,423
It was useful for that.

418
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:46,427
Cool, okay, thanks.
