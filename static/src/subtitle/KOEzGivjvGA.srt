1
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:07,639
Hey everybody.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,820
I recently added videos to this PowerPoint,

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,741
so I'm definitely tempting fate today.

4
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:16,262
So I'm ready to start?

5
00:00:16,702 --> 00:00:16,962
We're good?

6
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:17,482
Yes?

7
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:19,123
Okay, cool.

8
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:20,243
Thanks everybody for coming

9
00:00:20,283 --> 00:00:22,464
to Advanced Environmental Storytelling

10
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:24,545
in Spider Right of the Shrouded Moon.

11
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:26,386
Please silence your cell phones.

12
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:28,306
Please fill out the survey at the end

13
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:29,167
that you'll get in the email.

14
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,008
So my name is Randy Smith.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,021
And I've been working on games that are not per se story games,

16
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:38,542
where the focus tends to be on gameplay instead.

17
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,542
So gameplay designer is one of the hats I wear.

18
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:43,483
But I liked putting story into these games anyway,

19
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,963
and oftentimes I did this with environmental storytelling.

20
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:48,604
So let's start with the story of Spider,

21
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:51,045
the secret of Bryce Manor, aka Spider 1.

22
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,825
In this game, you play as Spider,

23
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:55,346
who proceeds from one room to the next of an abandoned mansion,

24
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:57,006
leaving a place covered in cobwebs.

25
00:00:57,376 --> 00:01:00,357
the props in the environment convey who once lived here and what happened to them.

26
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:04,058
Because you're a spider, you can get into every little nook and cranny and have a better

27
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,978
perspective on the story than any one of its human players.

28
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:11,579
It's a story of domestic drama and mystery, there's a love triangle and sibling rivalry

29
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:16,100
and betrayal and a suicide and a kooky grandpa character who hid the family fortune from

30
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:18,341
beyond the grave using a puzzle.

31
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,602
So let's locate Spider in the space of all possible stories.

32
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:25,523
There are absolutely no words.

33
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:30,397
text or dialogue. Other games of this quality include Another World, and Ico, and 30 Flights

34
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:36,443
of Loving. This is actually an exaggeration, as we'll see. The story is extremely nonlinear,

35
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:39,706
and what I mean by that is that the storyteller doesn't know what information is going to

36
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:43,690
be presented to the audience, nor in what order. Another game like this is Her Story.

37
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:48,645
There's these like tattered fragments that come at the audience in a way that's not under the author's control.

38
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:53,026
Environmental storytelling is usually at least somewhat non-linear unless you're controlling the camera

39
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:57,186
and really forcing the user to stare at and witness and understand each little piece of story data.

40
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:00,867
So the Back to the Future opening title sequence is a wonderful example of that.

41
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:05,108
And lastly, it's like what I call a dead story or archaeology gameplay.

42
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,448
There's no living characters present.

43
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:10,349
It's, you know, the story has concluded before the game actually begins.

44
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,949
It leads to the question, what happened here?

45
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,198
This tends to have a lonely vibe,

46
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:16,478
as is also pretty common in environmental storytelling,

47
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:17,979
which comes from the player, I believe,

48
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:20,579
thinking a lot about people, but there's no people present.

49
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,160
So this is a good time to clarify that.

50
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,900
When I talk about the story for Spider,

51
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,481
I'm specifically talking about

52
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:27,641
the linear narrative of the NPCs.

53
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:31,162
I'm not talking about the PC's on-screen emergent narrative

54
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,902
or world building or puzzle design.

55
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:34,943
Those are also parts of story, sorry,

56
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,743
of Spider, but not this presentation.

57
00:02:37,644 --> 00:02:39,144
So there's some things I really like about.

58
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:42,164
spider story, including the fact that it's asynchronous

59
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:44,645
and non-intrusive, that means that it'll never interrupt

60
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:46,126
the user like a cinematic would.

61
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,289
The user can absorb the story while they're engaged

62
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,590
in other things like gameplay.

63
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,491
It's a, oop, I never fixed this.

64
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:54,853
It's a pull not push story, so just go ahead

65
00:02:54,993 --> 00:02:56,334
and read the opposite of what that says.

66
00:02:58,497 --> 00:03:00,920
So what this means is that the story is not foisted onto the player,

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,363
and so the player takes the initiative to mine the story out of the game themselves,

68
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:07,386
and this leads to a much higher level of investment on the part of the player.

69
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:10,990
And those two points together also mean that you can kind of monitor the player

70
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,152
becoming interested in the story during playtest.

71
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:16,355
The player has a sense of ownership over the story.

72
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,802
And what that means is that the player's job is to form their own interpretation of Spider's story.

73
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:26,465
And my goal as the designer is to foster different possible interpretations.

74
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:31,209
I like maintain the one true version, but that's only to make sure that all the clues land

75
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,791
and the story isn't inherently self-contradictory.

76
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,912
And lastly, it's a fresh way to tell stories.

77
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:40,496
Like, her story would not be as memorable if you watched all the videos in chronological order.

78
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:45,840
And in a similar way for Spider's story, it has like plenty of archetypes and like hoary old chestnuts and stuff.

79
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:49,193
But it's the other qualities that actually make it unique.

80
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,355
It's literally never required that the player follow along at all.

81
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:55,296
If you just want to play the gameplay part, that's totally valid.

82
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,278
And it's also told from the point of view of a character who cares nothing about the story.

83
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:03,000
Like, the spider is only motivated by building webs and eating insects,

84
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,882
but we happen to know that there's a human player who's sort of like watching over the spider's shoulder

85
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:09,243
who might be drawn in by the human drama they witness.

86
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,811
But we only give that human the tools to express spider-like behaviors,

87
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:14,753
like you can't actually respond to the story.

88
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:18,796
And this is very elusive quality, one of the most distinct parts of appreciating spider story,

89
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:21,278
and we really push this separation as far as we can.

90
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,260
So that was Spider 1, and then some years later,

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,163
it's time to start working on the story for Spider Right of the Shrouded Moon, aka Spider 2.

92
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:31,954
And we wanted this to be a leveling up in all possible ways.

93
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:33,875
There isn't going to just be one measly old puzzle,

94
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:36,537
there's going to be many puzzles that would add up to this hidden mega puzzle.

95
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:40,078
We wanted to do more of that layer of separation between the spider and the player,

96
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:42,620
like kind of blurring the boundary between the game and real life.

97
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,441
But mostly I'm going to be talking about the first two.

98
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:47,462
We wanted there to be more characters, more intertwined plot threads.

99
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:53,125
The way I approach things, like designing good characters or drawing inspiration,

100
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:57,307
it's very similar to how I'd author a story in any other game or other media.

101
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,273
So I'm not gonna cover these things very much.

102
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,774
Instead I'm gonna focus on stuff specific

103
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:02,854
to environmental storytelling.

104
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:05,774
And where I like to start is by brainstorming

105
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:06,775
what I call anchor moments.

106
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,575
And these are specific story beats

107
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:11,356
visualized as they would appear on screen.

108
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:12,856
So they have to have the right tone.

109
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:14,956
I'm hoping for some really good emotional strength

110
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:15,637
to come out of them.

111
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,617
And they need to fit the format

112
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:19,477
by being easily read for information.

113
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:21,338
And so I don't necessarily know

114
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,658
how these moments are gonna fit yet,

115
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,698
but they seem like they might be right for the game.

116
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:28,372
And then I proceed to this bottom-up process

117
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:30,754
followed by a top-down process using those anchor points.

118
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:31,455
So what do I mean?

119
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:34,158
The low-level is the anchor moments

120
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,680
and any other actual on-screen game content,

121
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,023
but the high-level stuff is more like plot lines

122
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:40,324
and themes and characters.

123
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:43,127
So basically, once there's enough low-level moments,

124
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:45,789
the high-level structure starts to emerge,

125
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,351
and then you think about that

126
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,852
and use that to drive back downwards,

127
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:49,733
and it goes back and forth.

128
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:51,888
exploring and developing possibilities.

129
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:54,849
So for example, here we have the anchor moment of a locket

130
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:56,009
that's been thrown down the well.

131
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,890
So that suggests this is a story about heartbreak.

132
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,250
And what else might convey that?

133
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,410
Well, here's a wedding ring that was lost in the drain

134
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:03,231
that was sort of derived from this.

135
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:05,752
And players report these are both strong moments for them.

136
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:08,512
In Spider 2, this character seemed to be shaping up

137
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:11,333
to be too much of a mustache twirling, vaudevillian cliche.

138
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,233
So how can we give him some more dimension?

139
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,174
So we can see here that in his private moments,

140
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:17,874
he plays the lute while gazing at a portrait of his beloved.

141
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,091
And I had this cool idea that you're

142
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:22,212
going to follow some footprints.

143
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,092
But which character this is or even

144
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:26,093
what plot line it's associated with, I'm not sure yet.

145
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,894
So why do I do low level first?

146
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:30,655
It's because even for the most artfully structured work,

147
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:32,656
it's the on-screen moments that are the content.

148
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:34,937
The structure provides the substance and meaning,

149
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:35,758
but it's invisible.

150
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:37,839
It's kind of a candy versus vegetables thing,

151
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,299
and I believe that both are important.

152
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,080
And one of the keys here is being

153
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:43,461
willing to cut the good anchor moments

154
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:45,482
and other amazing ideas that just aren't fitting in.

155
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:48,204
So focus on cohesion, not kitchen sinking it.

156
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:49,144
Being your own editor.

157
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,609
So I have a technique I call histogramming,

158
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:53,289
which sounds fancy, but really just means

159
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:54,810
counting how many of the planned levels

160
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:56,831
are devoted to which topic.

161
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,312
So for example, I can see how much stage time

162
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:00,673
each character is getting relative

163
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:01,934
to that character's prominence.

164
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,135
I also use it for things like themes,

165
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,315
like making sure we still have enough

166
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,756
relatable domestic drama, and it's not all

167
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:09,537
like secret societies and hidden passages.

168
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:12,079
So it's kind of like this left brain analysis,

169
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,300
which helps confirm we're building the right content.

170
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,360
What can we cut?

171
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,561
What might we need to add?

172
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:19,520
And there's another technique where I sort of gather

173
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,161
all the elements of a particular thread

174
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:23,143
and think about how the player would logically

175
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:25,424
connect them into a story, which is pretty standard.

176
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:28,567
But the opposite direction is a more careful one,

177
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:30,808
which would be like listing every inference

178
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,670
the player would have to make in order to draw,

179
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,272
in order to understand the story,

180
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:36,733
and then connecting each of those steps

181
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,474
with a specific piece of game content.

182
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,716
In both cases, the goal is sort of proving

183
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:42,137
the story can be understood.

184
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,839
And this is my best answer to how to design

185
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,920
for non-linear storytelling.

186
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,271
because you can examine each step and think about

187
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,692
when they're gonna present themselves to the player.

188
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:54,413
But another really good answer is,

189
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,774
hey, play, test, and refine.

190
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:57,555
Users will just tell you when they're confused,

191
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:59,076
and when they are, it's usually the case

192
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:00,897
that one of those steps is either missing

193
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,058
or it's badly conveyed.

194
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,439
So let's go into the shipping game

195
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,861
and take a look for major things to talk about.

196
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,362
We're gonna start with the very beginning

197
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:10,803
of the carriage house, which is kind of our training level.

198
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:14,165
And here we see a lot of establishing material

199
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,986
and symbolism, so the first thing that happens

200
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:17,627
is the spider hatches from an egg.

201
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,240
We actually see the spider go through a full life cycle from birth to death,

202
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:24,743
which is important because the human characters are struggling to achieve immortality,

203
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,565
and by contrast, the spider does achieve it, but using natural means.

204
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:31,687
And the better to draw such parallels, it was also important to me that the spider be born

205
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:36,070
under the symbol of the secret society, thrust into the same circumstances as the humans.

206
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:42,194
We also see anachronisms like, hey, there's license plates from cars versus this antique carriage.

207
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:43,435
It's meant to establish that this is...

208
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:46,385
a modern time and has a strong connection to its past,

209
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:47,746
much like Vermont, my home state,

210
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,027
which inspired many parts of the game.

211
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:52,130
And you can also find a hidden stash of valuables

212
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,252
plus some weird little tinctures in the carriage house.

213
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:55,954
This is meant to be a reward for exploring,

214
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:57,215
but it's also a story hook.

215
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:58,837
Like, who put this here and what were they up to?

216
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,700
Moving on to the entrance hall, the next level.

217
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,923
We're gonna spend some time talking about this portrait,

218
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:06,625
which internally we call the Arrival.

219
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,582
There's a distressed pregnant young woman who's being taken in by an older couple,

220
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:15,084
the woman of which is receiving her joyfully, but the man standing a little bit apart, he seems annoyed.

221
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:17,645
We see their names below on a plaque.

222
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:22,447
The man's name is D.V. Blackbird, and the S.B. Blackbird is the other half of the elderly couple,

223
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:24,268
and the pregnant woman is L.S. Bryce.

224
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:29,251
L.S.'s arrival in the house is the inciting incident of Spider 2 from which everything else unravels.

225
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,452
But how do we know that this isn't like a departure,

226
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,413
like maybe they're showing off their shamed servant girl or something?

227
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:38,505
So, partially that's conveyed through body language.

228
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,385
We see SB's gathering embrace,

229
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:41,986
and we also added luggage at one point

230
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:43,687
to help convey a sense of arrival.

231
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:46,288
Like we wanted her to seem like she's from someplace else.

232
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:48,909
So this portrait features numerous connections

233
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,170
for the players to draw, including this window,

234
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:52,671
and this hat.

235
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,972
We laid it on pretty thick in this first level,

236
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:56,472
because we were trying to help players realize

237
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:58,974
what their job is, because make no mistake,

238
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:01,014
understanding Spider's story requires

239
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,415
what is essentially detective work,

240
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,276
even if the story isn't detective themed.

241
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:07,587
And this is partially due to the non-linear, no-text format.

242
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:09,868
It's just really difficult to read complicated stuff

243
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,769
like character motivations and causality.

244
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,250
So we work really hard to help the players understand

245
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,551
by designing clues that are easily read

246
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:17,932
and combined with other clues.

247
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:19,813
So coming back to this portrait,

248
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:21,073
let's look at some more examples.

249
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:23,534
This piece of luggage appears in a later level.

250
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:26,996
And in that same room with the luggage,

251
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,097
we find this purse and this necklace.

252
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:31,998
So this establishes that the room is LS's bedroom.

253
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,241
And nearby in that same level, there's this earring,

254
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:37,302
because we know it's her bedroom,

255
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:38,563
we can assume this is her earring,

256
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:40,304
so that when we see the matching earring

257
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:41,626
in an even later level,

258
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:43,607
we know that LS is the person who is here

259
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,090
strapped to this weird experimental bed thing.

260
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,072
And it so happens that all four pixels

261
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:48,992
of her earring in the portrait

262
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,654
happen to not contradict those earrings.

263
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:52,836
Now some of you may also have drawn the connection

264
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:54,037
between these red shoes,

265
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:56,920
the other of which shows up at this kidnapping scene.

266
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,035
that's chloroform on the table above there,

267
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:00,677
and together this is supposed to express

268
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:02,298
that she was kidnapped in the basement

269
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,400
and then brought to the experimentation table.

270
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:08,963
This idea of connections is the most prominent tool

271
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:11,305
in Spider's storytelling technique.

272
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,167
So when you see this cane and bowler hat in a later level,

273
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:15,948
I want you to know that this is DV's place,

274
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,850
and I want you to process everything in that level

275
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,871
with respect to him.

276
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,612
It's his stuff, it's things he was doing.

277
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:23,759
Portraits provide a rare opportunity

278
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,960
because we have few of them to connect the props

279
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,882
to a name and a face and all the humanity

280
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:28,982
and character those convey.

281
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:31,164
So I try to wring a lot of use out of each portrait.

282
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:35,327
And the entrance hall also contains candy wrappers

283
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:36,367
which are a calling card.

284
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:38,168
They're associated with a particular character.

285
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,350
You can kind of sprinkle them around wherever you want

286
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,931
to establish this character has been there.

287
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,372
And they're a little bit more effective

288
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:45,133
because you're essentially drawing a connection

289
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:46,534
to that same prop over and over

290
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:48,655
instead of having to notice and track

291
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,396
individual unique props like clothes.

292
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,779
These guys are also interactive, you can kind of bounce them around a little bit, so it calls more attention to them.

293
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:59,862
There's other calling cards in the game, like the child character, if he's been somewhere he tends to leave toys around.

294
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:03,783
Now this is a whole lot of stuff for just one level, it's one of the first levels of the game,

295
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:08,386
but it's not intended to be understood on the first pass, not at all, much more like repeat visits.

296
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:11,527
And again, players don't have to do any of this, they can just totally ignore the story.

297
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:16,610
Moving on to the parlor, this is a scene of quiet domestic life for the elderly couple.

298
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,044
The left side is his, the right side is hers.

299
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:22,225
That ordering is reflected in the portrait above the hearth,

300
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,686
and it's later preserved in their bedroom

301
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:25,346
in terms of which side of the bed they sleep on.

302
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:29,528
So let's go in and examine each character's props.

303
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,929
For DV, on the left, we can see he's the guy

304
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:32,910
with the candy wrappers.

305
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,711
We see his books, which seem to be about things

306
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:36,831
like engineering and math,

307
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:39,312
and along with the screwdriver and this gizmo,

308
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:41,133
it's meant to establish him as the inventor

309
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:43,654
of the inventions we're gonna see later in the game.

310
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:45,505
And we see that he's drinking not whiskey,

311
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:46,987
but maybe that's like Kool-Aid,

312
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,849
which along with candy suggests some kind of childishness.

313
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,631
And over here on the right with SB,

314
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,833
looks like she's just sewing like a very innocuous housewife.

315
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:56,855
There's a reveal about her later,

316
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:57,996
but to make it work,

317
00:12:58,016 --> 00:13:00,338
you have to start by setting up the wrong impression.

318
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:02,760
Zooming on that portrait,

319
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,862
DV looks like an uptight fuss bucket,

320
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:06,844
which combined with the Kool-Aid and candy

321
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:09,306
and genius levels of inventing,

322
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:10,927
that pretty much sums up his character.

323
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,086
And there's some power dynamics here too.

324
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,668
DV is standing up and he almost seems to be holding down

325
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,669
his seated wife, but once the player learns

326
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:19,350
how headstrong and wild his wife is,

327
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,431
they'll get a second read on this the next time they visit.

328
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:23,392
This is more about what DV wishes were true

329
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:24,172
than what's really true.

330
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:27,354
And lastly, PFEN, the guy in the background standing apart,

331
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,955
the hope was to establish him as a servant,

332
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,557
but since servants aren't normally in family portraits,

333
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:34,198
this was confusing for players.

334
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,321
Off in a corner, we see where a child drew on the walls.

335
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:41,102
This is meant to indicate an invasion of the couple's

336
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:42,223
quiet domestic life.

337
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:45,765
And in the parlor, we find our second hidden stash

338
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,966
of treasures and tinctures.

339
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:49,808
So let's take a look at this recurring pattern.

340
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,110
The treasures are supposed to look valuable,

341
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,470
like somebody is stealing.

342
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:55,111
For a little while in our game,

343
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:57,153
they just looked like normal plates and silverware,

344
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:57,913
too much like that.

345
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,314
So people are like, I don't know,

346
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:00,975
somebody just wanted to do the dishes, so they hid them.

347
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:04,718
So to solve this, we really beefed up their value appearance

348
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:06,638
and we also made sure the first ones in the carriage house

349
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,519
especially looked super treasury.

350
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:10,659
The reason they're plates and silverware

351
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,400
is because these are items a butler would have access to.

352
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,560
In a later level, we can find the mother load

353
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,301
of all these items, and the name of this level

354
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:19,161
is butler's quarters, which establishes

355
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:21,842
that there is a butler, and players tend to figure out

356
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,582
who it is using process of elimination, if nothing else.

357
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:27,343
And these caches are implemented as secrets

358
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:30,043
and the sense of a formal interaction in the spider games.

359
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,260
The way a secret works is they start covered up,

360
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,660
and then when you figure out where they are

361
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,181
and get inside them, the cover comes off,

362
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,822
and you see the message, secret found.

363
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:40,043
This message helps the player to contextualize the contents,

364
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:41,543
even if it doesn't immediately register

365
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:43,024
as something that someone would keep secret.

366
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:45,585
In this case, we can see that the child's hiding something

367
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,446
that he stole to play with he wasn't supposed to take.

368
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:50,527
Secrets and hiding are very compatible

369
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:51,728
with environmental storytelling,

370
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,468
so all the characters in Spider are designed

371
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:55,969
as people with secrets and objects that they want to hide.

372
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,350
Moving on to the kitchen.

373
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,394
The first thing you encounter is this tray of food,

374
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:03,515
which kind of implies that somebody is serving

375
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,056
or caring for someone else.

376
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:06,797
And there's some medicine here,

377
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:08,579
which implies that the recipient might be sick.

378
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,681
So medicine versus tinctures.

379
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:13,882
These are both recurring props,

380
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:16,324
but they're associated with two different story threads.

381
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:17,985
We tried to make them visually distinct

382
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,646
to signal the correct connotations.

383
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:21,347
The medicine's supposed to look healthy,

384
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:23,609
the tinctures are supposed to look nasty and like addiction.

385
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:25,590
But they're too close, it's too easy

386
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,112
to draw a spurious connection between them.

387
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,592
And now we're back here, and you might ask yourself,

388
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:32,592
if that pepper shaker's supposed to be relevant,

389
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,232
which is some slides I cut, so ignore that,

390
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:35,333
but the pepper shaker's relevant,

391
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:37,193
then what about this other thing?

392
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,274
It's just a cool prop that we found in real life.

393
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,594
That's the only reason it's in the game.

394
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,595
Almost every prop in Spyder comes from some photo reference,

395
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:46,056
and that's the major reason it's in the game,

396
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:47,116
for authentic texture.

397
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:49,297
What would be in this kitchen?

398
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:50,617
What are cool, appropriate objects?

399
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,138
But this kind of texture can become red herrings

400
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,098
in the detective sense.

401
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,322
spurious data that if you mine it for meeting,

402
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,164
you can wind up with incorrect conclusions.

403
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:01,707
And this real data versus noise, texture, red herrings,

404
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,188
is a really big topic in Spyder.

405
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,910
So one huge misstep I made along these lines

406
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,992
is that I had three separate plot threads,

407
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,394
they all involved coffins, and two of them

408
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:13,037
involved replacing the contents of those coffins with rocks.

409
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:14,298
But they're totally separate,

410
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:15,659
and I didn't mean for you to draw connections.

411
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,883
So this is confusing for people, short version.

412
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:22,656
So this kind of confusion is toxic

413
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:23,977
to the player's detective process.

414
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,137
There's like a tipping point where too much confusion

415
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:28,958
has cascading effects, can cause players to tune out.

416
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,059
What you really hope for is that things will land

417
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:33,279
into place early to keep the player invested

418
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,720
and also to eliminate some clues,

419
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,400
taking them off the board,

420
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,561
leaving fewer for the player to put together.

421
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:40,701
But conversely, when players are pursuing

422
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:43,262
a spurious connection, they're going down a dead end

423
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,983
and eventually they're gonna need to recognize that

424
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:47,103
and rewind, putting those clues back on the board.

425
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:48,263
It's bad news.

426
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:50,736
So in Spyder, we really like texture,

427
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:51,957
and we don't want it to be trivial

428
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:53,517
to pick out a story clue,

429
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,318
so we have a deliberately high rate of noise.

430
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,619
But one thing I've learned is to stay consistent in that.

431
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,920
So for example, players can come to the conclusion like,

432
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,961
that night thing might be a clue,

433
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:03,601
but not necessarily in this game.

434
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,702
Basically, you make an implicit with a contract

435
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:06,963
with the player, and you have to stick to it.

436
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:08,683
And of course, it helps not to go out of your way

437
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:09,284
to create problems.

438
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,885
One example of the consistency rule is this scene.

439
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,777
where given the story here, there would realistically be

440
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:18,340
so many overlapping layers of tracks and footprints

441
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,362
that at first I chose not to depict them all,

442
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:22,764
but that was inconsistent with my normal way

443
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,705
of depicting clues, so players read it wrong,

444
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:27,548
meaning that they correctly read the incorrect data

445
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:28,429
that I had presented them.

446
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:31,411
So after the scene read like this confusing mess

447
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:33,753
before you, then it clicked easily for players,

448
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:35,515
and this went against all of my instincts.

449
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:37,837
As an aside, these marks right here.

450
00:17:38,695 --> 00:17:43,818
We're confusing the players, they're supposed to be the heel marks from a shoe, like heels being dragged.

451
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:46,259
But that didn't click until we actually added the shoe.

452
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,721
And this and many other suggestions were brought to us by playtesters.

453
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:56,305
Moving on to the guest bedroom, this is a room shared by two people, an adult, L.S. Bryce, and the pregnant lady.

454
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:59,526
She's the pregnant lady, and her now-born child, named T. Bryce.

455
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:02,668
This room establishes firmly the outcome of the pregnancy.

456
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:06,770
And even though it's a huge mansion, they're both like crammed in here, they share one bed.

457
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,961
and that implies they're unwanted guests.

458
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:13,385
We see a portrait of T. Bryce the baby with S.B. Blackbird.

459
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,108
He's being given a monkey doll by S.B.

460
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:17,469
And partially this is symbolic

461
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,010
because T. Bryce is like a little monkey.

462
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,572
He's always getting into things he shouldn't.

463
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,874
But of course, the monkey's a connection

464
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:25,316
and it later places T. Bryce in this creepy basement.

465
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:27,198
And so I had hoped for it to feel

466
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:28,759
like he carried this doll around for years

467
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:30,821
to build a sense of fond relationship with S.B.

468
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:32,993
But we never see another portrait of him,

469
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:34,293
so I couldn't express that.

470
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,174
I only had one monkey doll propped to place,

471
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:37,194
and this is where it had to be.

472
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:39,195
And moreover, without any portraits,

473
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,415
it's hard for people to be sure how old T. Rice is

474
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,175
when the game starts.

475
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:43,075
Is he still a baby?

476
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,636
So we added multiplication tables,

477
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:47,636
which kind of calibrates that he's probably not

478
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:50,557
three years old, but he's not an 18 year old either.

479
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,518
Let's call it maybe seven to 10, which works perfectly.

480
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:56,018
There's a lesson here about the importance

481
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:58,379
of being able to visualize a scene correctly

482
00:18:58,579 --> 00:18:59,379
in your detective work.

483
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,414
So before the multiplication tables,

484
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,575
we had a lot of trouble with this scene directly

485
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:05,155
above where you find the monkey doll.

486
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:07,676
We wanted to imply that he climbed a stack of things

487
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:09,876
to escape a window, but in order to visualize that,

488
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,997
you have to imagine the correct size of kid,

489
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,277
like large enough to climb,

490
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:15,258
but small enough to squeeze through.

491
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:17,558
So what really took the scales in this case

492
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,239
was these hand-printed footprints,

493
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:21,400
which again, helps with visualization.

494
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,161
In a dark closet in the guest bedroom is where.

495
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:28,267
LS keeps things she no longer needs,

496
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:30,769
like T. Bryce's baby stuff, since he's grown out of that.

497
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:33,931
And there's a trunk where she stashed her broken dreams

498
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:36,233
and artifacts from her former life and memories

499
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:37,514
she doesn't want to think about anymore.

500
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:39,295
Cramming them way back in the corner,

501
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:40,756
it's meant to be heartbreaking.

502
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:46,220
So, the vault is where we have DV's cane and bowler hat.

503
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,841
This is his man cave.

504
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:50,323
And it contains this portrait of a secret society,

505
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:51,584
which shows a lot of things.

506
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:54,206
It shows the robes they wear, where they meet,

507
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,867
which is a location you can visit in the game.

508
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:59,996
and how they establish rank, because the ones that are on the dais a little bit further up,

509
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:04,337
they carry orbs of triangles in them, whereas the ones lower down on the floor carry orbs of

510
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:08,959
squares in them. So there is such a thing as rank, and here's how you know what rank people are.

511
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,781
In a different part of the vault, there's this safe which has been carelessly pushed aside,

512
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:18,083
indicating there's more at stake than just treasure, raising the stakes relative to Spider-1.

513
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:21,683
And there's this dartboard, which is an unsubtle clue

514
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:23,624
that DV dislikes someone with the name of Bryce,

515
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:25,085
and so we can see how that might extend

516
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,645
to our other Bryce's in this game.

517
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:29,267
And on the wall we see papers where someone's trying

518
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,508
to puzzle out some secrets of the secret society,

519
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:34,529
and the candy wrappers indicate that it's DV doing this.

520
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,431
This thing right here is a secret sliding wall.

521
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:39,412
It's very Scooby-Doo.

522
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,573
And then it changes to this, which is a robe

523
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:44,254
and an orb from the secret society.

524
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:49,592
So players understood that the robe and orb belonged to someone of low rank in the secret society,

525
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,353
but there's a lot of confusion here,

526
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:55,134
and I'd wanted it to be a cool reveal that Devi was in a secret society,

527
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:55,754
but it wasn't.

528
00:20:56,234 --> 00:21:00,776
Like, who belonged to or knew about the secret society was an extremely messy topic for players.

529
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,057
And a big piece of the confusion was that, in my mind,

530
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:06,318
the family was just the caretakers of the secret society's estate.

531
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:10,479
But for many playtesters, they assumed that the family, like, was the secret society,

532
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,679
and this was their estate.

533
00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:14,187
And so of course they knew all the secrets

534
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:15,407
and they were all members and stuff.

535
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:18,028
So to solve this problem and to signal a sense of mystery

536
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,289
right off the bat, we just opened the game with this quote,

537
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:21,969
which had been a tagline from our website.

538
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,190
So there's lots more in the game,

539
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,631
but I'm gonna focus on just a few most noteworthy moments.

540
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:31,792
This scene worked great at conveying

541
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,392
that someone was spying on DV

542
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,453
and it introduced a mystery of who the spy was

543
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:36,853
at a time that worked well for the story.

544
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,934
Many players cite this as one of their favorite moments

545
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:41,855
and it wasn't one of the anchor moments.

546
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:46,006
Usually those are the ones that work best since they're originally conceived as being visually strong.

547
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:49,948
I think this one works because the reveal is exciting, because you're just in that room.

548
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:55,970
And even though one-way glass is a hard thing to convey, the rest of that cubby clearly communicates a furtive operation.

549
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,631
And of course these photos are a great way to show DV going through a progression over time,

550
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:03,953
which is normally hard to convey in environmental storytelling.

551
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:06,093
And specifically he's descending into insanity.

552
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:10,373
I was really excited to do an actual crime scene,

553
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:11,593
but it didn't work that well.

554
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:13,954
And it's because it's a nexus of a lot of the things

555
00:22:13,994 --> 00:22:15,975
that are hard to get right with environmental storytelling.

556
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,096
So most people understand that T. Bryce

557
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,276
escaped through the window and that L.S. was the victim.

558
00:22:20,857 --> 00:22:23,498
But what's hard is sequencing events,

559
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:25,598
building timelines, causality.

560
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,859
It's supposed to be the case that T. Bryce

561
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:30,400
was fleeing from D.V. and he ran to his mother for help,

562
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,841
and then D.V. chased them both down to the basement,

563
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,342
and then she helped her son escape,

564
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:35,402
but she got caught instead.

565
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,016
But that's a whole lot of stuff to try to fit together

566
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:39,997
in a sequence, and people have other ideas,

567
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:42,318
like well maybe LS was being held prisoner down here,

568
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:44,399
and maybe T. Bryce came to try to rescue his mom,

569
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,240
but he got caught.

570
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,062
And so one solution was this level subtitle, A Last Stand.

571
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:52,704
So the summary about text in Spyder

572
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:54,565
is that there's text all over the friggin' place,

573
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:56,145
but it's usually used pretty subtly

574
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:58,387
to provide a little bit more context and orientation.

575
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:00,908
I only use it as an actual crutch in a couple places

576
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:02,829
where player comprehension is really flailing,

577
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:04,130
and I don't feel bad about it.

578
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:10,430
Um, another problem with the kidnapping scene is that it's not the archetypal kidnapping scene.

579
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,833
Like, there's this weird replacement victim concept, and there's a lot of scene changes.

580
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:18,836
Um, and being a deviation from the expected norm is also true of, like, the secret society

581
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,858
and how they work, and the butler being in the family portrait.

582
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:25,040
Um, I think archetypes can be great for helping the player understand,

583
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,102
but I use them really sparingly because I believe that cliches are lame.

584
00:23:28,122 --> 00:23:30,623
That's a technical word for it.

585
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:35,352
Since we're making a list, here are some things I've had a hard time depicting with environmental storytelling.

586
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:37,532
We've already mentioned timelines and causality.

587
00:23:37,892 --> 00:23:41,594
This tends to extend to character motivations, like the butler's cache of treasures.

588
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:44,214
Why is he hiding them inside the house?

589
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:46,735
Is his plan to come back and steal them later or something?

590
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:50,736
Things that are missing are hard to convey because they're not on screen.

591
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:54,197
So this perch is missing a mechanical blackbird that's supposed to be there,

592
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:57,578
but without seeing the bird, players thought it might be a handle or a lever.

593
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:59,895
So we actually had to just like depict the bird

594
00:24:00,015 --> 00:24:02,376
on its perch like very nearby in the same scene.

595
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:05,197
And those two points together explain

596
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:07,038
a recurring problem in the Spider games.

597
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:08,978
These places are always abandoned,

598
00:24:09,018 --> 00:24:11,219
but unless they literally put the corpse in the game,

599
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,320
no player has any idea where all the characters went.

600
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,760
So for example, we saw that T-Brice climbed out

601
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,561
that basement window, but we don't know for sure

602
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,222
if that was his final appearance in the story.

603
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:23,746
There's a lot of things I regret about Spider 2.

604
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:26,268
I think Spider 1's hooks were hookier.

605
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:28,189
Spider 2 takes a little while to get going.

606
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,012
Spider 2 is too close to Spider 1,

607
00:24:31,352 --> 00:24:32,593
which is part of that problem.

608
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,494
Like, they both take place in abandoned mansions,

609
00:24:34,535 --> 00:24:36,296
and so I had already used my best material,

610
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:39,118
in particular, to establish that it's an abandoned mansion.

611
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,240
Spider 2 is kind of a lot.

612
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,961
It's really stuffed full of ideas.

613
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:44,262
It's a little bit of an overreach.

614
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,845
Probably fewer ideas with more stage time each

615
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:49,326
would have helped the player comprehension.

616
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,362
And it takes a really long time to compare clues

617
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,063
in both games, like, you know,

618
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:56,583
if the clues are in separate levels,

619
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,744
you can't just flip back and forth between them.

620
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:00,844
But there's one thing I really like,

621
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:02,385
so I wanna share with you my favorite moment,

622
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:04,186
which is the dramatic conclusion of the game,

623
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:05,586
or at least the climax.

624
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:08,467
So first of all, there's these diagrams in the metagame

625
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,348
of a time machine and a weather device,

626
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,208
and these are actually player tools that you use

627
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:13,789
to change whether it's day or night,

628
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:15,769
or rainy or clear in Blackbird Estate

629
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:16,910
when you're playing the game.

630
00:25:17,246 --> 00:25:19,527
but then you actually find these as levels in the game.

631
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:20,928
So they've actually been invented.

632
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:23,390
And you get to play around there.

633
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,411
And then there's this corpse you find

634
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:27,072
who you can examine really carefully

635
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:30,094
and almost but not quite confirm that this is DV.

636
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,835
But it can't be DV because DV is still alive.

637
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,376
You've seen him in the window.

638
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:37,118
He's up here with the kidnapped LS in the tower.

639
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:38,779
So you make your way there,

640
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,800
but when you arrive they are both gone.

641
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,541
And you chase DV down a trap door

642
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,642
to arrive in his laboratory.

643
00:25:44,662 --> 00:25:45,723
And now we're gonna.

644
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,491
dramatically attempt to play a video on PowerPoint.

645
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,773
Now we're gonna dramatically attempt

646
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:24,034
to get our PowerPoint presentation, but it works, okay.

647
00:26:24,454 --> 00:26:25,175
So what happened here?

648
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:26,976
Did DV disintegrate himself,

649
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:28,797
or did he actually invent time travel

650
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:30,017
in his quest for eternal life?

651
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:32,138
It's designed to be interpretable either way,

652
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,679
and most players report being unsure

653
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,760
which they most believe.

654
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,241
And this pertains to the meaning of Spider,

655
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:38,181
right, in the Shrouded Moon,

656
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:39,982
which is about mysteries and magic.

657
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:41,383
What's real, what's not,

658
00:26:41,523 --> 00:26:42,684
and how you'd even know the difference,

659
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:44,765
which is something that I believe is very relevant today.

660
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:46,766
There's plenty in the game that plays with this theme.

661
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,487
There's the fate of LS, the quest for immortality.

662
00:26:49,997 --> 00:26:51,678
and the Seeker Society's machinations

663
00:26:51,718 --> 00:26:53,800
and what's actually really going on behind their facades,

664
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,101
which you get to go back and look at.

665
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:56,842
And I really like that the player's ability

666
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:57,943
to interpret what they see,

667
00:26:58,003 --> 00:26:59,624
the skill that they've been using throughout the game,

668
00:26:59,964 --> 00:27:01,145
is so relevant to this meaning,

669
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:03,046
and it comes into play especially at the climax.

670
00:27:04,547 --> 00:27:06,448
So taking this even one step further,

671
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:08,590
soon after the climax as the game is wrapping up,

672
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,872
you get exposed to increasingly strong hints

673
00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:12,433
that the story extends beyond the game

674
00:27:12,473 --> 00:27:13,333
and into the real world.

675
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:14,954
And the starting point for that is that

676
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,276
the Seeker Society is based on a historical one.

677
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:20,652
and you can research them to connect the remaining loose ends in the game,

678
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,974
and discover the deepest secrets buried in the game,

679
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:25,797
and also to learn the connections between the game and the actual,

680
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:29,641
out in the physical, real world, historical mysteries that the game is based on.

681
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:31,923
And that's it.

682
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:34,926
I got three minutes for questions, if anybody has questions.

683
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:36,428
And I'll take them. Thanks.

684
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:52,064
Go ahead.

685
00:27:52,344 --> 00:27:52,625
No, go ahead.

686
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:53,125
All right.

687
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:54,846
Thank you so much for the talk.

688
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:57,688
I always find so much useful knowledge from the talks

689
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:58,788
that you do.

690
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:01,550
I kind of got a couple of questions,

691
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,650
if no one has any more.

692
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:06,032
But my first one would be, how much reworking

693
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:07,593
do you do on the artwork?

694
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:10,915
So I guess the art style was specifically chosen

695
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:13,317
so you could iterate, because you said play testing is

696
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:13,977
really important.

697
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:20,197
So do you do like a broad pass of the artwork and then kind of clean up on that as you go,

698
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:25,518
but then that might also bring too much emphasis on players and have to do the playtest and all

699
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:31,279
over again. And then how do you keep track of the connections? So say you kind of reference this

700
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:35,840
doll in one of the pictures and you have him down in the basement for example, do you have some kind

701
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,962
of spreadsheet like okay I've referenced this somewhere else, I need to get rid of that if

702
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:42,622
I remove it from the basement? Like do you keep track of that stuff?

703
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:50,727
Yep, so the answer about process and art style, if it was more flexible, that would be great.

704
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:54,749
It's a little bit costly to change things, so that's one of the reasons for more advanced

705
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:55,269
planning.

706
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:58,751
It's not impossible, and we definitely do have to change things, and we hope to change

707
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:01,012
small props, not big parts of the set or whatever.

708
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,399
I feel like I had another point for you about that.

709
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,639
Oh yeah, one of the problems is that a lot of this stuff

710
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:09,340
is very, very nuanced, really specific direction,

711
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,501
and it tends not to come together

712
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:12,661
until very close to the end.

713
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:15,082
And so there's lots of little tiny details missing

714
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:16,222
that they're actually really important

715
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:17,822
because players focus so much on everything

716
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:19,643
because we're asking them to mine everything

717
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:20,423
for so much data.

718
00:29:20,943 --> 00:29:23,264
And so the playtest is actually hard because of that,

719
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:24,964
but you do your best with what you got.

720
00:29:25,424 --> 00:29:27,045
And the second question was about spreadsheet.

721
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,365
Nope, not quite that organized.

722
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,045
But one thing that's handy is if you know

723
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:31,166
something's like a hero prop

724
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,506
and it's actually relevant to meaning.

725
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:34,176
If it's got a, like the earrings,

726
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:35,197
there's only one piece of art,

727
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:37,398
and so we just copy and paste the art kind of a thing,

728
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:38,138
and that helps a little bit.

729
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:39,259
Okay, well.

730
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:40,619
Another question?

731
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,000
In my experience with sort of environmental

732
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,121
or pull versus push storytelling,

733
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:47,442
it seems like one of the stronger emotions

734
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:50,043
is sort of this human voyeuristic tendency

735
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:52,645
to want to see events or get knowledge

736
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:54,045
that it seems like they're not supposed to have.

737
00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:57,067
Does your sort of experience bear that out,

738
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:59,608
and does that affect kind of what you sort of keyframe

739
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:01,488
or pick as your sort of main moments

740
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:02,809
that you want to make sure that you communicate?

741
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:08,353
Yeah, I didn't actually explicitly think about voyeurism when designing either Spider Stories,

742
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,775
but so I also worked on the Thief series and it's a big deal there, and I think that's because those

743
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:15,816
are living humans that you get to watch, and so it's easier to design things that living humans

744
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,338
are doing in front of you that are like fun and you feel sneaky when you're watching them or

745
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:23,179
whatever. I think it's a little bit harder to build into props, but I'm sure that like some

746
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:25,880
of that Thief experience kind of carried over. Like I didn't explicitly be like,

747
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,381
you're going to go through this person's underwear drawer or anything like that.

748
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,642
But if you're looking at, for example,

749
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,604
their failing relationships,

750
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:33,906
which is a common theme in Spyder,

751
00:30:33,926 --> 00:30:35,788
I think that has a little bit of a voyeuristic sense,

752
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:36,668
but kind of a sad one.

753
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:38,130
And now we're out of time,

754
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,151
so I'll be in the wrap-up room.

755
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:39,671
Thank you very much.
