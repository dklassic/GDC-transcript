1
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:11,979
I've somewhat ranted a little bit about this in the past and that I think design and AI are very linked.

2
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,044
I think that what I want to rant about is sort of codifying that a bit.

3
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,006
So, oversimplification is bad, right?

4
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,148
I've even had other rants where I've said,

5
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:24,992
AI that oversimplifies how it looks at you is pretty stupid.

6
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:27,535
If it reacts to everybody in the same way, that's stupid.

7
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:31,743
And likewise, if companies don't have a rich enough model of me,

8
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:33,305
I think that's pretty stupid too.

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,009
And it doesn't matter what model they use, right?

10
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,413
I think a lot of simplified models are pretty dumb.

11
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:41,393
So the problem is humans love to bucket things.

12
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:42,094
They just love it.

13
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:45,036
We're classification engines and it just sucks.

14
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:48,579
Programmer, artist, designer, producer, these are buckets.

15
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:49,640
And they're not very good ones,

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,981
especially because a lot of us are mixtures of these things.

17
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:53,723
Even games do this though.

18
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:55,464
We have tanks and DPS and whatever.

19
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:58,286
Although a lot of the better RPGs recognize

20
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:59,687
that the combination characters

21
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,448
are some of the more interesting ones to play, right?

22
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:02,969
But in real life.

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,890
You have dedicated career builds,

24
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:07,252
and you have a severe penalty for respec.

25
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:09,973
And if you do do quests outside of your main line,

26
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:11,794
you're sure as fuck not gonna level up.

27
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:16,096
So what I'm saying is that there should be

28
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:17,497
a big five of developer skills.

29
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:19,177
And I'm not talking about personality-wise,

30
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:22,799
I'm talking about actual sort of skill set-based spec

31
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:25,921
of what you do as a human being in the thing.

32
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,442
So now programmer, designer, artist, producer

33
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:30,323
are sort of buckets of skills.

34
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:32,704
and instead of an AI programmer, you're a mix of them all.

35
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:35,205
And I'd also recommend having some optimal specializations

36
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:35,646
within each.

37
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:38,227
So if I'm rated P7 AI database,

38
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,188
that means I'm a seventh level programmer

39
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,669
with AI and database specialties.

40
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,790
D1 means I don't really have much design space in my head.

41
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:49,033
AI audio means I'm probably the audio guy for the company

42
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:52,535
and PR6 remote means I've got really high producer skills

43
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,516
and I've specialized working with remote teams.

44
00:01:55,303 --> 00:01:56,044
So let's do this.

45
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:57,004
Here's an AI generalist.

46
00:01:57,064 --> 00:01:59,685
Now this graph, instead of pointing at an entire team,

47
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:00,806
points at a single person.

48
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:03,627
He's a P7 AI D6 A2 PR1.

49
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:07,008
It means he's an almost 50-50 programmer-designer split.

50
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,248
He has some good art tendencies,

51
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:09,889
and he has a slight notion of organization.

52
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:12,910
I would call this guy a textbook senior AI programmer.

53
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,511
This is kind of what I look for

54
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,311
when I'm interviewing a senior AI programmer.

55
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:17,872
AI specialist.

56
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:18,732
Here's a different mix.

57
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:22,434
P8 AI D4 systems A5 animation P3.

58
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,074
This guy has.

59
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:30,336
He's a really high-level programmer, but he's also a pretty decent artist who specialized in animation.

60
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:32,177
And he's also a systems designer.

61
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:34,979
And he has quite a bit of organizational skills.

62
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:40,522
He probably loves working in heavy AI animation systems, especially with IK or mocap.

63
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:45,104
And he even has the organizational skills necessary to handle the heavy asset notions

64
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,725
that you have to do when you're dealing with that kind of stuff.

65
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:49,107
And I know all of that by reading that thing.

66
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:51,308
I don't even have to, like, look at his resume down there.

67
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,474
It doesn't just work with AI programmers.

68
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:55,795
Here's a bunch of tech artists.

69
00:02:56,296 --> 00:03:00,018
P7, GraphicsD2, AA, P2 is probably a shader programmer.

70
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:01,799
Just by looking at that, I can tell you

71
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,360
he's probably a shader programmer.

72
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,260
Here's another one.

73
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,902
P3, D6, UI, A7.

74
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:08,903
This guy's still a tech artist, right?

75
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:11,364
He has an A7 artist, just like the guy above him had an 88,

76
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:12,825
but he's half the programmer.

77
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:15,007
But he could probably design and implement

78
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:17,568
the entire UI system for your game all by himself.

79
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,022
Here's an exact similar guy, except he doesn't have that UI specialization.

80
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:26,023
My guess is this guy's probably a lead artist of some form and has had to wear many hats

81
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:32,906
over the years, or he's a prototyper or an indie who's by simply not having a lot of

82
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,187
people around has had to have a lot of hats on and has had to do a lot of things.

83
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,168
So stop the oppression of the pure disciplines.

84
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:40,628
It's not helping us.

85
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:52,365
What the fuck is a technical designer or a creative coder or an advanced experience developer?

86
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:58,107
Those are meaningless garbage ways to try and show a blended discipline skill set

87
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:01,549
and they don't give me any actual information as to what you do.

88
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,851
I spend the entire time talking, I could spend two years talking to you and not exactly know

89
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,892
what a creative coder does because 90% of people have a different definition of that.

90
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:15,035
So the other thing is is that we should have these different skill buckets so that if you do

91
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:19,947
improve other parts of your skill set, you actually get recognition by the company.

92
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:24,688
And you can actually get raises and bonuses and level up based on any given skill set.

93
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:28,749
Like if you need to improve your art skill sets for a particular game,

94
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,530
or your design skill sets for a particular game,

95
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,650
you get the recognition of doing that.

96
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,370
As opposed to like,

97
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,071
I'm sorry, you're a programmer,

98
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,971
and the guy who's reviewing you only knows how to review programming,

99
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,072
so tough noogies, you didn't get five more programmers under you,

100
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:42,552
no cheese for you.

101
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:47,194
And finally, I think this should really help start breaking down the discipline walls,

102
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:49,335
because goddammit, we are all a mix.

103
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:54,258
And just like in real life, stop the oppression of purity.

104
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:55,298
Let's go for it.

105
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:55,978
Thank you.

106
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:06,343
I didn't expect going after Brian, so my slides kind of suck.

107
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:09,976
Since I'm Canadian, I want to apologize.

108
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:12,757
I'm not talking about any one of you.

109
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:15,818
If you feel targeted, see it as motivation.

110
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:18,459
If you don't, but know someone that should be targeted,

111
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,500
try to mentor them.

112
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,521
So basically, I want to bash the gameplay programmers

113
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:24,722
that let themselves go.

114
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,143
So let's start with a little story

115
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:30,544
of a little boy who wanted to be the very best

116
00:05:30,604 --> 00:05:32,665
the world has ever known, Ash Ketchum.

117
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:39,439
A lot of programmers start their careers trying to be the best and want to learn so many things,

118
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:46,045
but as they work on games and go from milestone to milestone, I feel like a lot of gameplay

119
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:52,251
programmers let themselves go, whereas engine programmers try to be a bit more structured.

120
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:56,939
I wish gameplay programmers would continue using

121
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,840
the broad range of data structures, algorithms,

122
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,941
and focus on efficiency in their designs.

123
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,602
A lot of time we take the shortcut saying,

124
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:09,043
oh, but I need to be flexible and revise my game

125
00:06:09,063 --> 00:06:12,524
because the game designer wanted this change or that change.

126
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,745
I feel like those are excuses.

127
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,506
A lot of programmers stick to only STD vectors

128
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:22,087
or the equivalent in their game layer.

129
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:29,764
That's kind of crappy, and I think we owe it to ourselves to at least know when to use

130
00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:36,106
other containers, and if your gameplay layer doesn't support them, I know a lot of game

131
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:42,108
engines only support dynamic arrays for gameplay programming, take the time to try to learn

132
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:45,790
how to extend the language and create new containers if you need to.

133
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:51,163
Also keep an open mind, there's not only utility systems,

134
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:54,404
or there's not only finite state machines.

135
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:57,685
Try out stuff, try behavior trees, planners,

136
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,826
whatever you need to try, and experiment with them.

137
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:05,127
Lastly, I'm trying to go fast for the other guys.

138
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:07,188
Here's a quick book recommendation,

139
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,069
because yesterday Rez said that...

140
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:15,426
Maybe 50% of juniors you'll interview will have a hard time during the technical part

141
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:16,367
of the interview process.

142
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:21,470
And that 10% of the more experienced programmers you'll be meeting will have a hard time.

143
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:28,214
Well, keep in mind that it's very likely that this 10% is already working for another company,

144
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:30,895
and that 10% might be your co-worker.

145
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:35,218
So you can suggest them, like, a quick shortcut, a book like this.

146
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:36,038
It's a...

147
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:42,961
like crunching through algorithms and data structures so you can really quickly practice

148
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:47,562
some computer science concepts that you knew when you came out of school that you might

149
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:49,423
have forgotten over the years.

150
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:53,364
So just try to be a bit better with that.

151
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:58,146
And honestly, read books.

152
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:00,507
Buy the Game AI Pro.

153
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:01,807
Buy AI Wisdom.

154
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,448
Just try to be more...

155
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:11,147
Curious. Also, try tricks. There are so many things that these books give you that can

156
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:15,928
be implemented in like a half a day just to play with concepts. So do it. And try to find

157
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:22,690
better ways to improve these tricks that you read about. Also, if you think of something

158
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,471
great, contact Steve and write an article.

159
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:32,329
Also, most of you guys studied this, so just try to work on it.

160
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,210
And gameplay code, it's just an excuse when the code sucks.

161
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:40,812
You guys can do better, so focus on being better programmers.

162
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:44,413
And also, premature optimization is evil,

163
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:49,415
but doing things right is what we should aim for.

164
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:50,196
Yeah.

165
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:52,436
Game designers now.

166
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:56,412
Try being independent.

167
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:00,335
I've seen so many game designers telling me,

168
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:03,658
well, I have no idea if my game design is fun or not.

169
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,239
I need to see it in the engines.

170
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:06,319
Don't.

171
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,942
You should try to be able to prototype your own stuff.

172
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,645
There are so many engines now, like Unity, even Unreal,

173
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:15,886
that you can just download and learn how to script

174
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:16,827
quite easily.

175
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:19,148
And if you can't prove me that your concept is fun

176
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:21,030
with a cube, it probably won't be fun

177
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,412
with the super expensive mocap animation.

178
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:26,273
And it's also 2017.

179
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:29,355
What are your tools?

180
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:31,317
Word, PowerPoint, and Excel?

181
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,579
Come on, you can do better.

182
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,722
And with Excel, it's quite easy to learn VBScript.

183
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:40,804
So you can automate some of your spreadsheets

184
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:42,986
and try your concepts within Excel.

185
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:46,889
This will allow you to have quicker iterations,

186
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,832
and it's easily shareable with the other people on the team.

187
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,754
And like I said, there are so many game engines that are.

188
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:59,543
easy to play with and to script, so even some stuff as simple as Blockly.

189
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:03,147
Our Prime Minister in Canada programmed the game.

190
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:08,034
It really sucked. You can probably do better, but it's there and it's easy to do.

191
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:12,048
Also, don't be scared to use paper design.

192
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:15,911
You can play Dungeons and Dragons, your game,

193
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:21,995
and just sit at a table and use turn-based methods

194
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,235
to test out your gameplay.

195
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:24,396
So just do it.

196
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:34,963
All right, hi, everybody.

197
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:37,765
My name is Mike, and I have a beef with magic.

198
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:44,035
We're all probably fairly well exposed to science fiction here, so I'm sure you've already

199
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:49,601
heard this cliché quote, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from

200
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:49,982
magic.

201
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:55,467
This is due to a certain Arthur C. Clarke, and since Brian did me the courtesy of already

202
00:10:55,507 --> 00:11:00,333
breaking the F barrier in this rant session, fuck you, Arthur C. Clarke.

203
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,598
I quit hitting the wrong button there.

204
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:07,979
Magic is bullshit.

205
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:10,180
And I'll give you an example of why I'm saying that.

206
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:13,982
So we have here a couple of high school graduates.

207
00:11:14,462 --> 00:11:17,564
They're deciding what they want to do for their institute of higher learning, and they're

208
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:18,624
trying to figure out where to go.

209
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:21,085
So where are we going to send them?

210
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:27,348
Well, we have options in the United States, colleges like MIT or Caltech, and I don't

211
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:28,128
know how that got in there.

212
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,229
We're sure as fuck not sending them to Hogwarts.

213
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,691
And the reason for that is because we study computer science.

214
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,931
Algorithms are not magic, okay?

215
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,713
Solving bugs are not magic.

216
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:44,594
This remote apparently is magic.

217
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:58,402
Software is a science, and that has a very significant implication for us, which is that

218
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,963
superstition is irresponsible.

219
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:03,485
Here's another quote for you that I'm sure we've all heard at some point or another.

220
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:06,778
I don't know, let's run another build, maybe that won't happen again.

221
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,121
My opinion is that this shit has to stop.

222
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,182
So this here is an interesting screenshot.

223
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:25,364
This is a debugger, Microsoft Visual Studio in 64-bit mode debugging the disassembly of

224
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:26,524
the Guild Wars 2 game client.

225
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:28,285
And I have one question for you.

226
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:29,865
Does this scare you?

227
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:34,105
Because it shouldn't be fucking scary.

228
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:36,708
This is our bread and butter, this is our lifeblood,

229
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:38,509
this is the tool that gets us our job done.

230
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,252
Never be scared to keep asking questions,

231
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:44,194
because science itself is predicated on questioning.

232
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:46,897
And that means that if you ever stop asking questions,

233
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:48,298
you're basically dead.

234
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,501
Computers don't run on magic,

235
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,483
which has an interesting implication.

236
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,284
Our questions have answers,

237
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,006
and we should go out and find them.

238
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,308
So here's another inspirational quote.

239
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:03,084
Witchcraft to the ignorant, simple science to the learned.

240
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:04,544
This is due to Lee Brackett in the 1940s.

241
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:06,905
This is a much less popular quote

242
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:07,925
than the Arthur C. Clarke one,

243
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:09,045
but I think much more reflective

244
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:10,966
of how we should be thinking of our practice.

245
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:15,007
So, this guy here is a magician,

246
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,168
and this is a computer scientist.

247
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:20,349
Let me leave you with one question.

248
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:22,849
Who do you want to grow up to be?

249
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,050
Thank you.

250
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:38,472
So, looks like we are doing kind of the same rant here.

251
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:44,517
So, my rant is called Garbage In, Garbage Out.

252
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,521
So, yeah, I'm a programmer.

253
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:52,563
I might be putting myself in a bucket here.

254
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:58,889
I take random designs and turn them into computer code.

255
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:02,096
And you know what, computers don't process very well.

256
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:05,437
Well, they don't process nonsense.

257
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:07,998
They just don't care what you feed them with.

258
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,500
So you might have heard of Charles Babbage,

259
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,720
the father of the computer himself.

260
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:16,341
Well, guess what?

261
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:17,281
He knew about this.

262
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:18,882
Somebody asked him once.

263
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:23,804
Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures,

264
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:25,625
will the right answers come out?

265
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:32,252
I'm not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

266
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:41,440
Well, at least I suppose that's how Charles talked, because that's so ancient that there's no recording of his voice.

267
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,521
Like, 1864.

268
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:48,065
So, some people still don't get it.

269
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:50,667
I said, you said no French, sorry about that.

270
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:51,808
Putain de merde.

271
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,811
So here's an example.

272
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:59,445
This is from the development of this week's title about being a top model.

273
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,306
And yeah, I worked on pretty awesome games.

274
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:06,808
We had a basic dialogue scripting system with some variables for a good measure.

275
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,949
I remember telling the narrative designer to go easy with that system.

276
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,010
We had no budget, no time to check for consistency.

277
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:17,031
What do you think happened?

278
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:20,426
We let our players two options.

279
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:23,567
In the story, you wander around in luxurious gardens,

280
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,247
and at some point, one dialogue lets you date the gardener.

281
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:29,448
Because everybody loves romance involving gardeners.

282
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:32,869
And there was another dude you could date later,

283
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,709
a taxi driver that would drive you around to your model stuff.

284
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,389
So that made a total of two choices.

285
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,370
Two choices, thus two possible combinations for which

286
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,751
we had dialogues authored.

287
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:47,231
In the end, you could either be dating the gardener

288
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,652
or dating the driver.

289
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:50,729
We're covered, right?

290
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:52,330
Right?

291
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:53,970
Well, no.

292
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:56,291
Provided with these options, the computer

293
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,193
performs very advanced computations

294
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,954
and deduces four possible outcomes.

295
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,476
Granted, you can be dating the gardener or the driver,

296
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:08,257
but you can also date nobody, or worse, be polygamous,

297
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,459
because the computer just doesn't care about morality.

298
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:12,319
So.

299
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,855
We discovered that we were missing dialogues for this

300
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:19,276
at the very last moment, the evening before uploading

301
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:20,357
to certification.

302
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:23,419
We had to patch during the night, fingers crossed,

303
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:26,061
hoping we weren't breaking the entire game.

304
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:28,882
So I just want to make up for this

305
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:31,344
to my former colleague, Martin, if you hear me someday.

306
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:34,506
Sorry, man, I know I oversimplified things.

307
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:38,008
Six years after release, we had our first user review

308
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:40,670
on Metacritic, and it appears to be from a total fan of yours

309
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,211
so you rock, Martin.

310
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:48,076
Here's another example, this time from the early stages

311
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,837
of the development of Dishonored 2.

312
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:52,499
So let's take a guard.

313
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,821
He's called Michel because we call all our guards Michel.

314
00:16:57,843 --> 00:16:59,244
That's the way it is, don't ask me why.

315
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:02,466
Michel is patrolling when suddenly

316
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,567
a player enters his field of view.

317
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:08,716
So at this point, Michel starts fighting for his life

318
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:11,077
and calls for help from time to time.

319
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:14,238
And during pre-production, we only had placeholder speech,

320
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:17,439
so our guards barked, aperu, which is French for,

321
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,160
let's have a drink.

322
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:24,282
The goal of these barks is to bring other guards

323
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:26,643
at hearing range to the fight, not to the bar.

324
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:30,324
So let's say we have another Michel in a room nearby.

325
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,925
The other Michel hears the call.

326
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:37,757
and joins the fight, barking Apero in return.

327
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:40,759
On paper, this looks fair and good.

328
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:43,281
We agreed on this design, and I innocently

329
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:46,423
proceeded to implement it without the shadow of a doubt.

330
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:49,025
Now guess what happens when you stress

331
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:51,647
the system with more guards, and the player vanishes right

332
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:52,828
in the middle of that fest?

333
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:55,430
Well, this is what happens.

334
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,492
There's no sound, but they are shouting Apero, Apero, Apero

335
00:17:58,552 --> 00:17:58,893
forever.

336
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:07,138
Because the computer just doesn't care about doing the same thing over and over again.

337
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:09,819
So let me sum this up.

338
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,540
So it's crystal clear for everybody here.

339
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,683
If you take nonsense and put it in a computer, well, it just blows up plain and simple.

340
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:22,386
It stops to respond or loops forever or crashes or worse, just pretends everything's fine

341
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:25,288
until you find out that your save file is corrupted.

342
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:27,809
So the outcome is rarely fun.

343
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,450
That's the curse of our craft.

344
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:33,938
My point is, often the germs of failure

345
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,161
are already present right at the design phase.

346
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:40,085
So we need to be consistent as early as possible.

347
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:43,689
Also our responsibility as programmers in our buckets

348
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,913
is to invest time in proper error checking

349
00:18:47,614 --> 00:18:50,657
to prevent nonsense creation in the first place.

350
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,259
It's always best in the long run.

351
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,021
So please, every time we fail at doing so,

352
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,742
a programmer somewhere has to pay back

353
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:01,183
with a small amount of time

354
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:03,445
and a considerable amount of sanity.

355
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:08,870
And if you don't do it for me, at least do it for Charles.

356
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:11,151
Thank you for listening.

357
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:25,540
Guns, shooting, cover systems, sniper AI, grenade throwing,

358
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,161
enemy detection systems, damage systems, tactical planners,

359
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,562
animation syncing to have realistic and gruesome kills,

360
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,682
blood splatter effect systems.

361
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:35,962
I'm done.

362
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:39,923
I love working in AI, but I'm really sick of game AI

363
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:42,524
having so much focus on combat and killing.

364
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:46,225
And it's the same shit that we keep redoing in every game.

365
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:49,911
Enemy AI is where their sole purpose is kill or be killed.

366
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,496
Gameplay mechanics and verbs only focused on combat.

367
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:59,364
The thing is, the only thing that evolves is us trying to make things look more realistic.

368
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:04,487
And it's actually kind of disturbing because I've started to get JIRAs with full-on blood

369
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:08,870
splatter reports showing me how we can make our kills even more accurate.

370
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:14,434
So either my testers are equally getting bored, or there is a bigger issue at play here.

371
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,310
Now, some of my personal favorite games from the past year

372
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,391
tend to have minimal amounts of combat

373
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:23,592
and focus a lot more on socialization.

374
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,594
But on the flip side, I also really do love

375
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:29,595
watching horror movies and action movies,

376
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:32,457
which made me start to think, well, what's different?

377
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:35,819
Why am I okay with watching movies with combat,

378
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,000
but I really dislike combat-based games?

379
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,101
Well, it comes down to the NPCs that we're developing

380
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,643
and the gameplay interactions that we give to the player.

381
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:46,778
Characters on TV have a lot of depth.

382
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,241
They have conflict between each other.

383
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,044
They have ups and downs and we really care about them

384
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:53,665
as they progress through their stories.

385
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,647
They fight, they love, they grow.

386
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:56,829
We care when they get hurt

387
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:58,911
and we cringe when they make bad decisions.

388
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:01,734
But we can't actually do anything to help them

389
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:02,574
because it's TV.

390
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:07,919
Games, on the other hand, have this great opportunity because we can actually interact with them.

391
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,202
But honestly, I rarely give a shit about any of the NPCs in our games.

392
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:16,566
They're too simple. They're designed to either protect someone, kill someone,

393
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:19,048
or roam around in a big city like a zombie.

394
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:23,431
In short, our NPCs are lacking empathy and intelligence.

395
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:27,435
And this is what makes us really care about characters in cinema and TV.

396
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:30,557
I'm going to call this artificial intelligence.

397
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:37,352
as I would like to see some actual real interaction, socialization, and memorable moments

398
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:40,373
that I can experience with the NPCs in our games,

399
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:44,035
from developing love and relationships to hate and jealousy.

400
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:47,037
So here are a few examples for inspirations.

401
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,720
First off, if no one actually mentions Facade, Prom Week, and Versu,

402
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,522
at least once in every AI Summit, then GDC will totally crash and everything will go wrong.

403
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:57,423
So...

404
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:00,864
For those of you who are new to the AI Summit,

405
00:22:01,284 --> 00:22:03,025
you are going to see these games mentioned

406
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,286
at least once every year.

407
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:06,527
And the reason is because these games,

408
00:22:08,148 --> 00:22:10,690
these are great examples of social simulation games

409
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,771
where the player's actions actually changes

410
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:14,912
the relationships between the NPCs.

411
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:20,538
Now what pisses me off though is that we haven't actually really progressed all that much since

412
00:22:20,618 --> 00:22:21,619
these games came out.

413
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,866
What I wish is for AAA to please just copy paste one of your thousand combat systems

414
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:33,111
that you've already developed and actually put some of your AI developers on some interesting

415
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:34,352
socialization models.

416
00:22:34,713 --> 00:22:38,176
Because what was done in these games are fucking brilliant and I want to see more of them.

417
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,387
Next off is Generic Shooter X.

418
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:46,871
A friend of mine once told me that when he was working on one of these games, he wrote

419
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:49,453
some really interesting barks for the characters.

420
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:54,456
And basically, there's this rare moment where one of the NPCs is idling with his gun and

421
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:57,599
he looks up into the sky and he goes, I hate my job.

422
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,822
And then he basically starts saying, this goes against everything that I believe in.

423
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:05,324
I'm only doing this for my family.

424
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,165
And I was like, oh, that's really awesome.

425
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:09,727
There's a great back story for one of these NPCs.

426
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,148
But let me guess.

427
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:14,410
There's nothing that I can do in this game except kill him, right?

428
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,011
Yeah.

429
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,972
Is there an actually family that I can go to?

430
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:19,332
Can I help out his family?

431
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:19,872
No.

432
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:24,674
Can I convince him maybe to join me and stop doing this horrible job?

433
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:25,274
No.

434
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:31,276
Because he was programmed with just one generic enemy AI behavior and nothing will actually

435
00:23:31,316 --> 00:23:33,217
change anything he does, which is sad.

436
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:39,940
Next, Shadows of Mordor was amazing, and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room has raved

437
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,662
about their Nemesis system.

438
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:45,866
For once, we had a game that left us with NPCs worth remembering.

439
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:51,230
The game celebrated my losses, and it made me hate these NPCs, which was amazing.

440
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:54,133
I had an actual emotional connection to the enemies.

441
00:23:54,774 --> 00:23:58,656
Now what pisses me off here is that when this game came out, everyone was like,

442
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:02,098
oh, we're totally going to make a better version of this, just wait and see.

443
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:08,282
It's been two and a half fucking years and we haven't seen anybody actually build upon this amazing system.

444
00:24:08,862 --> 00:24:13,445
However, yesterday they did announce the sequel, so hopefully we will see a little bit more.

445
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:18,177
On a happy note, finally, finally, last year,

446
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:19,558
the last Guardian came out,

447
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:22,758
and I have to say my interactions with Trico

448
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,639
was one of my favorite AI moments ever.

449
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:28,540
What I loved was that interacting with Trico

450
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,020
was actually a pain in the ass

451
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,740
compared to most companion AIs

452
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,101
that do everything that I ask them to do.

453
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:37,622
It felt like training an actual animal,

454
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:40,282
which made the AI feel so much more believable.

455
00:24:40,943 --> 00:24:45,111
I've probably never felt so attached to an AI character in a game because of its realistic,

456
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:49,259
flawed, and loving behavior, so I hope that we develop more AIs like this.

457
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:55,107
And finally, everyone in this room, if you're involved in AI, you should be watching Westworld.

458
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:59,748
It has been one of my favorite television shows in the last year, and basically in the

459
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:01,868
second episode, there's this beautiful quote.

460
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:07,489
Anthony Hopkins says, it's not about giving the gamer what you think they want, the killing,

461
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,530
the garish things.

462
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,450
The players don't actually want that.

463
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,931
They come back to the game for the subtleties, the details, that they imagine no one has

464
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:17,591
noticed before, something that they've fallen in love with.

465
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:21,114
They're not looking for a story that tells them who they are.

466
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:22,375
They already know who they are.

467
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:25,577
They're here because they want a glimpse of who they could become.

468
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:30,681
And I love this moment because to me it represents everything that I wish that we were doing

469
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:31,701
with our games.

470
00:25:32,222 --> 00:25:36,745
Actually having meaningful interactions with the NPCs, not just through violence.

471
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:40,879
So, in conclusion, what do I want to see more of in our games?

472
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:45,641
I want to work on the empathetic side of AI, on artificial intelligence.

473
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:48,163
I want to actually care about the characters in our games.

474
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:52,585
I want to find new ways of interacting with our games instead of new ways of hurting each other.

475
00:25:53,105 --> 00:25:57,488
Combat and violence is easy, we've been doing this years, and honestly it kind of feels cheap

476
00:25:57,588 --> 00:26:00,009
when you throw this into your game because we know it works.

477
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:05,295
So please, let's invest more time instead into finding new and interesting mechanics,

478
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:09,600
tools, systems, and AI to make games that feel new, innovative, and optimistic.

479
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:10,241
Thank you.

480
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:20,293
Hi, everyone.

481
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,122
So my name's Rez, and I'm going to continue what appears to be this year's trend in terms

482
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,785
of complaining about bad practices, basically.

483
00:26:28,746 --> 00:26:30,467
So how many of you have had this experience?

484
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,110
You're writing some system, you're coding something, you have to dig into some system,

485
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,712
maybe you haven't seen that system before.

486
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:40,096
And your immediate reaction as soon as you look into the code for this other system is

487
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:40,816
something like this.

488
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:43,739
Maybe it's this.

489
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,502
Or what I tend to see more often is something like this.

490
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,172
We've all had this experience, right?

491
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,294
We've all gone in and you look at some system,

492
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,175
you're like, fuck man, the physics system

493
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:56,056
is shit in this game.

494
00:26:56,377 --> 00:26:58,659
Or the x system is shit.

495
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,520
Whatever that system is.

496
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,841
Hopefully it's not the AI system.

497
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:02,422
And so...

498
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:06,367
The problem here is that these are basically broken windows,

499
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:08,809
and that's a term that I like to use for this.

500
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:11,332
There's these broken windows that exist in our systems.

501
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,454
The term broken windows, as far as I can,

502
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:19,539
to deal with this kind of stuff, was a term coined by James Q.

503
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,641
Wilson and George Kelling sometime in the early 80s,

504
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:21,861
82, I think.

505
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:28,415
The idea is that there's a broken window, and as soon as you have a broken window, it

506
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:32,818
crosses some psychological threshold that now this building is garbage and whatever,

507
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:34,219
we'll just let it fall apart.

508
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,860
And that happens in our code constantly.

509
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,501
How many of you have had to deal with that, right?

510
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:41,062
Where it's like, oh, fuck it, we'll just add another three functions in here.

511
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,224
I challenge you to do this when you get back to wherever it is that you work.

512
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:49,126
Do a global solution search for the word hack and see how long you weep.

513
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,485
I did that once on The Sims 4, and it was enlightening.

514
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:58,787
So don't live with broken windows.

515
00:27:58,827 --> 00:27:59,547
Why are we doing this?

516
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:00,828
We should not live with broken windows.

517
00:28:00,968 --> 00:28:03,951
This wisdom comes from The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew

518
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:04,852
Hunt and David Thomas.

519
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:05,873
Everyone should read that.

520
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:08,255
If you're a programmer of any kind, or possibly even a

521
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:09,596
designer, you should probably read this book.

522
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:10,116
It's a great book.

523
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:12,558
So why do we do this?

524
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:13,339
Why do we live with this?

525
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,120
I mean, I get it, right?

526
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,721
There's deadlines.

527
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,216
There's bosses.

528
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,276
So you kind of get into this mad coder mode, right?

529
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:21,797
And you just want to get stuff done.

530
00:28:22,677 --> 00:28:25,178
But I'm here to tell you that the dangers of this are very real.

531
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:29,499
I worked on The Sims Medieval, and I can tell you that there was one particular file in

532
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,900
there, and this was only one example of the atrocities that were there.

533
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,142
And there were good parts of the code, but there were also sim.cs, which was 13,000 fucking

534
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:37,722
lines of code!

535
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:41,305
No one could find anything in this file.

536
00:28:41,665 --> 00:28:43,668
And we would just keep adding stuff.

537
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:44,269
It's fine.

538
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,431
The class was actually bigger than this.

539
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:46,712
It was split across multiple files.

540
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:48,154
What kind of monster does this?

541
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:50,137
The answer is all of us.

542
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:52,881
We were all guilty of it, because it's like,

543
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:53,882
just put it into sim.

544
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,104
Just put it into sim class.

545
00:28:55,404 --> 00:28:55,885
It's fine.

546
00:28:57,117 --> 00:28:59,759
On The Sims 4, we wrote everything.

547
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,263
So we're like, maybe we should not do this again.

548
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,466
It was actually bad enough that it was one of our things

549
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:08,428
that we talked about, of like, let's not

550
00:29:08,468 --> 00:29:09,689
have this terrible sim class.

551
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,281
And we didn't. It was much more manageable.

552
00:29:12,321 --> 00:29:16,744
We used components and all sorts of the fancy CS and architectural terms,

553
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:17,865
but we had to be diligent.

554
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:21,128
And I will admit this, because I'm bashing on the code right now,

555
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,750
I will admit that I absolutely added about six or eight

556
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,792
AI-specific functions into the Sim class in Sims 4.

557
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:28,553
And then I'm like, wait, I'm being an idiot,

558
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:30,975
and then I created an autonomy component and added everything in there.

559
00:29:31,315 --> 00:29:33,497
But we had to go back, and sometimes we had to refactor stuff,

560
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:36,719
sometimes we'd have to fail code reviews and say,

561
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,081
no, what are you doing? Put this where it should be.

562
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,844
had to be super diligent.

563
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,178
Now, the complexity issues can rise.

564
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,941
I'm shocked this animates correctly.

565
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,703
The complexity issues can arise, right?

566
00:29:51,783 --> 00:29:54,325
And these are other types of broken windows.

567
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:56,186
And that's already been touched on by people

568
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:58,468
who came before me and various people around.

569
00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:01,671
That if you're AI, you have this super complicated AI

570
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:04,333
that's using this Monte Carlo tree search

571
00:30:04,373 --> 00:30:07,175
across a neural net of some Bayesian logic

572
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:08,476
and does all this crazy shit.

573
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:11,518
But if your AI is indistinguishable from RAN,

574
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:12,439
then what are you doing?

575
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,161
Or to quote Steve Rabin, why are you employed?

576
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:20,901
One of my other favorite things, this is actually a pet peeve of mine,

577
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,382
is the swap argument.

578
00:30:22,522 --> 00:30:23,843
And I don't even know why this is an argument.

579
00:30:23,883 --> 00:30:25,564
People will argue about this shit.

580
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,045
There are basically, there are a couple ways you can do swap, right?

581
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:30,187
There's the one above, which is the XOR style of swap,

582
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,908
which is fancy and sexy.

583
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,789
And then there's a lower one, which is a temp variable.

584
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:36,050
Like, who uses a temp variable?

585
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,011
Oh my god, four bytes.

586
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,492
People love this method and they hate this method.

587
00:30:40,153 --> 00:30:43,015
And they're like, why are we creating this temp variable?

588
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:45,116
And since we've broken the assembly language barrier,

589
00:30:45,816 --> 00:30:46,297
you're not.

590
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,859
Like this is the actual disassembly of it in 32-bit mode.

591
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:53,801
And we're not using a temp variable because we have this thing called an optimizer.

592
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,862
Oh, but XOR is faster!

593
00:30:56,262 --> 00:30:59,044
Well, no, it's faster six out of...

594
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,945
It's faster four out of ten times.

595
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,247
Right? The VAR swap is faster six out of ten times.

596
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:07,989
In just ten random tests of ten million that I did.

597
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:09,850
But really, ten million swaps.

598
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,491
What are we really comparing here?

599
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,352
We're comparing, like, look at this top one.

600
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:15,354
How much are you really saving?

601
00:31:15,514 --> 00:31:17,075
Why are you optimizing this?

602
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:18,977
Why is this even a conversation?

603
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:21,559
And, I mean, at this point I'm just going on a tangent, right?

604
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:24,421
And I'm basically just yelling at you guys and all that stuff.

605
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:29,406
So probably I should just stop and have some kind of zen moment.

606
00:31:29,446 --> 00:31:32,308
And I know it's all a balance, but for God's sake,

607
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:33,809
please don't live with broken windows.

608
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:34,250
Thank you.

609
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,222
I gotta ask, did you do an architectural diagram for Sims?

610
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:46,262
What was that?

611
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:48,983
Did you do an architectural diagram for Sims?

612
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:50,024
Did I do one?

613
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:50,224
Yes.

614
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:51,264
Did everyone do one?

615
00:31:51,324 --> 00:31:51,564
No.

616
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,405
Yeah.

617
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:55,046
Yes, I did.

618
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:57,707
So in the 1970s, there's this thing called the AI winter.

619
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:00,648
And before that, apparently there was huge investment

620
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:01,968
in AI technologies.

621
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,170
And I've just learned recently that apparently we're

622
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,470
out of our AI winter.

623
00:32:07,197 --> 00:32:10,960
we are apparently inside an AI spring, according to Google.

624
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,662
And of course, if it's on Google, it must be true.

625
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:17,906
According to John, and I'm going to screw up his name here,

626
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:22,190
I think it's G'Andrea, we're in some kind of an AI spring.

627
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,852
I'm not entirely sure what kind of AI spring

628
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:27,754
he's talking about, possibly this one,

629
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:30,176
or maybe he meant just a really early spring.

630
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:34,704
But regardless, everyone's talking about ML.

631
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:36,666
Now maybe this is a spring for John.

632
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:38,888
I mean, after all, he's the head of machine learning

633
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:39,408
for Google.

634
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,712
And maybe I should be excited that we're all

635
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,073
talking about machine learning.

636
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:47,737
Until I get this question.

637
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:52,962
I mean, really, about machine learning is a pretty big field.

638
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,821
And now, of course, I would really appreciate

639
00:32:56,861 --> 00:32:58,662
that there'd be a For Dummies book.

640
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:00,764
And of course, then I had to Google

641
00:33:00,784 --> 00:33:02,266
to see if there was a For Dummies book,

642
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:03,106
and yes, there is.

643
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:06,089
Machine learning for dummies, that's how far we've come.

644
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,631
I'm gonna get that from my parents.

645
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:13,275
But for me in games, and despite a big increase

646
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:15,257
in the number of cores on our consoles,

647
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:17,839
I'm not feeling that spring.

648
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,601
That red line, by the way,

649
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:21,903
is the increase I've seen in AI budgets.

650
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,101
Now, I'm not against machine learning.

651
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:27,322
I mean, there's some use for that in our games.

652
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:28,323
I mean, it is cool.

653
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:32,165
But it's not something that I feel particularly enhances

654
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:35,767
my games, and I do think you should experiment with it.

655
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,989
But what I'm saying is I'm not seeing a translation

656
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:41,391
between the increased interest in AI

657
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:43,812
to a commitment to the resources,

658
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:47,535
either in terms of people or in terms of real support.

659
00:33:51,177 --> 00:33:53,819
But there are rising expectations.

660
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,503
So there is a little bit of hope, at least in the AI game

661
00:33:57,523 --> 00:33:58,243
dev community.

662
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:01,566
I've never seen so many reviews actually

663
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,268
start to mention AI, at least in positive terms.

664
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:08,212
And our top reviewed game for 2016, apparently,

665
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:09,533
was a simulation game.

666
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:12,555
And maybe we're getting away from all those combat games

667
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:13,076
after all.

668
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,672
Now, the nice thing about those reviews,

669
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:19,274
if you go back into them, is they're not just talking

670
00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:21,496
about how good the game is.

671
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:24,999
They do talk about the AI, and they do talk about gameplay.

672
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:27,040
But here's the brutal truth.

673
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:29,782
Unless you're willing to give me some of those cores,

674
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:32,444
and support me by sending me to conferences

675
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,826
such as this one, and give me time

676
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:36,527
to build the right AI system,

677
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:39,550
then you know that awesome machine learning feature

678
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,430
you were looking for?

679
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,952
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

680
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:46,966
Yeah, I admit it, I'm holding your AI hostage.

681
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:49,787
I'm not asking for the whole pie,

682
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,968
just like my piece of the pie.

683
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:56,130
I mean, you can keep the GPU, rendering programmers,

684
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,451
but maybe for us in-game AI, it's not quite spring.

685
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,232
Maybe it's just slush season.

686
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,511
Hello everybody, my name is Ben Sunshine Hill.

687
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:26,837
It does say these are Ben Sunshine Hill's slides, though. I guess that was meant for me.

688
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:28,378
Glad to know who you are.

689
00:35:29,787 --> 00:35:32,770
So, I'd like to start with a small disclaimer.

690
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:37,014
In previous years, my rants have been fairly silly and light-hearted.

691
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:44,441
This year's rant is a little angrier, and so I want to apologize to anybody who finds

692
00:35:44,562 --> 00:35:49,466
it overly severe, and assure you all that it comes from a place of abiding friendship

693
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:50,007
and respect.

694
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:53,390
I wouldn't bother saying these things if I didn't think you could benefit from them.

695
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:56,331
It's also not going to be a very funny rant,

696
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:58,112
and I don't apologize for that.

697
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,452
The title of the session is Turing Tantrums,

698
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:02,192
not Let's Giggle at Cat Pictures.

699
00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:04,293
Oh yeah, just one.

700
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:06,633
Onward.

701
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,074
So, I was reading an article the other day,

702
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:12,234
rereading an article by Jeff Orkin,

703
00:36:12,594 --> 00:36:14,154
the article where he first introduced

704
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,575
goal-oriented action planning.

705
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:20,295
For a lot of us AI devs, it was the first exposure

706
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,236
we really had to automated planning.

707
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,756
at least outside a CS class on stacking boxes with a robot arm.

708
00:36:28,557 --> 00:36:30,259
It may not have been new, but it was new to us.

709
00:36:30,979 --> 00:36:35,364
And in the article, Jeff lamented how the architecture

710
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:39,608
and player experience of game AI had been basically unchanged

711
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:40,710
for the better part of a decade.

712
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:42,612
Well...

713
00:36:43,528 --> 00:36:44,970
GOAP didn't take the world by storm.

714
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:48,356
Even in the article, Jeff said that the results

715
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:49,679
weren't quite as good as he'd hoped.

716
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,544
And about the same time, behavior trees

717
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,908
started to gain traction after they were used

718
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:57,192
so successfully in Halo 2.

719
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,800
And here we are, more than a decade down the road,

720
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,561
and guess what?

721
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:04,722
We're still using behavior trees.

722
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:05,923
And yeah, sure, I know.

723
00:37:05,963 --> 00:37:07,445
They've come a long way since then.

724
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:11,828
But look, suppose that you were starting on the architecture,

725
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:13,449
the AI architecture for a new game,

726
00:37:13,669 --> 00:37:15,031
and you told your team, you know,

727
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:16,992
I really liked the AI in Halo 2.

728
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:18,253
We should do it how they did it.

729
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:20,455
They'd say, sure, behavior trees.

730
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:22,516
Modern BTs look a little different,

731
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,559
but yeah, it's a solid approach.

732
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,523
In contrast, suppose that you were starting on the renderer,

733
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:31,886
and you told your team, you know,

734
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,487
I really like the graphics in Halo 2.

735
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:34,909
We should do it how they did it.

736
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:36,370
What do you think they'd say?

737
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,533
Oh yeah, the incredible graphics of Halo 2.

738
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:42,296
We can use those newfangled vertex shaders.

739
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,119
Oh, and the accumulation buffer for all the bloom

740
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:45,759
we're going to do.

741
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,243
They would laugh at you, because we threw out all that crap.

742
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:53,269
when we found a better way of doing it.

743
00:37:53,549 --> 00:37:55,130
And then we threw out that approach too,

744
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,372
because you don't write a renderer like it's 2013,

745
00:37:58,653 --> 00:37:59,173
let alone 2005.

746
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:05,537
I am truly dismayed by the stagnation I see

747
00:38:05,957 --> 00:38:08,218
in game AI's core technology base.

748
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:11,941
I think it is killing game AI as a creative discipline.

749
00:38:12,561 --> 00:38:16,183
I believe we are killing game AI as a creative discipline.

750
00:38:17,137 --> 00:38:21,839
I believe our model of what is and isn't possible is ossifying.

751
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,641
And by this we, I include you.

752
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:28,762
We've all twisted that knife.

753
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:31,338
No? Let me refresh your memory.

754
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:35,402
Some designer has come to you with some idea she has,

755
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:37,664
some way in which the AI could serve the game.

756
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:40,266
And you've chuckled in that avuncular fashion

757
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,129
and patiently explained to her that in game AI,

758
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:46,992
many things that seem straightforward are actually quite impractical.

759
00:38:47,232 --> 00:38:49,174
You've said, I will do what I can for you,

760
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:51,476
but you have to understand that fundamentally,

761
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,578
this is not something that AI can do.

762
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,101
And I'll go further.

763
00:38:58,217 --> 00:38:59,938
I think it gives us a little thrill.

764
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:02,379
Not just how condescending we get to be.

765
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:03,080
That's old head.

766
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,423
No, I think we get off on gaping at the limits of game AI.

767
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:08,464
Of AI.

768
00:39:08,484 --> 00:39:10,945
Because it's this grand mystery, right?

769
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:17,149
Intelligence, cognition is so innate to our everyday experience, and yet we cannot describe

770
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:19,371
it or explain it or reproduce it.

771
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:23,253
We try, we fail, but, you know, there's joy in the attempt.

772
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:25,935
And joy in the retelling of the struggle.

773
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:30,365
Well, no more.

774
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:32,826
I deny you that pleasure.

775
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:34,266
I rip it from you.

776
00:39:34,646 --> 00:39:36,587
You are not worthy of that joy.

777
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:38,968
For 10 years now, you have worshipped

778
00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:42,750
at the altar of transparency, of authorability,

779
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,591
of convenient, elegant mundanity.

780
00:39:46,111 --> 00:39:49,052
You have mistaken what is known for what is possible.

781
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:51,652
You have mistaken what is easy for what is practical.

782
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:55,814
And your self-serving pronouncements of what is possible and what is practical

783
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:57,914
have become the walls of your kingdom,

784
00:39:58,234 --> 00:40:00,755
a very comfortable place where you're never asked to do things

785
00:40:00,795 --> 00:40:01,975
that you don't know how to do.

786
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:07,537
You spend your days and your energies on debuggers and user experiences,

787
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,937
sharpening the pencils of development.

788
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:13,358
You are a friend to your co-workers and an enemy to your craft.

789
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:32,461
And your actions, regardless of your words, argue that game AI does not matter, that it

790
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:36,483
cannot matter, that what it is now is all that it shall ever become.

791
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:43,170
Which means that in 10 years, the player experience of game AI

792
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,991
will probably be pretty much the same as it is now.

793
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:47,852
How do you feel about that?

794
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:49,273
Does it content you?

795
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:51,714
And if not, what are you doing about it?

796
00:40:52,194 --> 00:40:53,914
What are you doing to save game AI?

797
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,856
Because let me tell you, nobody is coming to save us.

798
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:58,376
We've seen to that.

799
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:03,059
Peter Molyneux is maybe the last game designer to come try to save us.

800
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:06,481
You know, I've said a lot of shit about Peter Molyneux over the last few years,

801
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:07,701
so let me also say this.

802
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:13,624
His showmanship, his fabulism, his assurance, his idealistic assurance

803
00:41:13,644 --> 00:41:16,565
that if something ought to be possible, then it will be possible,

804
00:41:16,985 --> 00:41:20,287
have done more to put game AI on the map and keep it on the map

805
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,068
than all you jerks put together.

806
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,930
But now it's up to us.

807
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:34,850
If game AI is to be anything more than an offshoot of tools programming,

808
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,572
we need to build it into something worthy of notice.

809
00:41:38,693 --> 00:41:42,876
And the first step to that is getting over our ideas of what is and isn't possible.

810
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:45,598
We must do things we don't know how to do.

811
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:50,301
We must create experiences we thought were not creatable.

812
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:54,825
I didn't say it would be easy, but look.

813
00:41:55,843 --> 00:42:00,846
Either you truly believe that game AI has already achieved its apex,

814
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:04,008
or you believe that it has unrealized potential.

815
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:06,369
If it's the first, I have nothing to say to you.

816
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:10,952
But if it's the second, well, no time like the present.

817
00:42:11,672 --> 00:42:15,194
Time to go home, put down the behavior trees,

818
00:42:15,695 --> 00:42:17,716
and fucking get to work.

819
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:19,637
Thank you.

820
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:37,514
All right, so after this brilliant talk,

821
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:41,216
I will just ask you, if you want to innovate, fine,

822
00:42:41,316 --> 00:42:42,897
but don't leave the players out.

823
00:42:45,018 --> 00:42:48,479
So AI is evolving fast, and I am biased

824
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:50,380
because I'm working on the Watch Dogs brand,

825
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,662
but we see it all around us.

826
00:42:52,942 --> 00:42:54,983
And yes, Westworld is awesome.

827
00:42:57,714 --> 00:43:04,161
So now we have self-driving cars and smart cities and big data and robotics and machine learning.

828
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,743
And it's fascinating and inspiring.

829
00:43:07,524 --> 00:43:12,069
And it makes us dream of a future where artificial intelligence is everywhere.

830
00:43:13,942 --> 00:43:18,307
But we as game maker, we want our AI to follow the same path.

831
00:43:18,447 --> 00:43:21,511
We want newer, smarter, more capable agents.

832
00:43:22,212 --> 00:43:27,258
And we think AI will help us reaching a new paradigm,

833
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:29,260
as well as in any other industry.

834
00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:30,461
And it's true.

835
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:34,338
But it's easy to be lost in all this novelty

836
00:43:34,398 --> 00:43:35,999
and great advancement of technology.

837
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:39,380
It's easy to get deep in how your AI can learn

838
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,980
and create new things and fulfill its needs

839
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:45,541
and completely leave the players out of the equation.

840
00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:49,002
We are game makers.

841
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:53,463
We make games as art, as experiences, as entertainment.

842
00:43:54,464 --> 00:43:56,324
Our goal is to create an interactive world

843
00:43:56,364 --> 00:43:58,045
for the players to experiment in.

844
00:43:58,065 --> 00:44:00,965
There are no games without a player.

845
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:05,741
Games that can play themselves without players are not games,

846
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:06,942
they are simulation.

847
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,365
I just said it might sound really obvious.

848
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:10,926
It is.

849
00:44:11,786 --> 00:44:13,908
But easily forgotten when we make AI.

850
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,851
So let's say I tried to simulate a town.

851
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:21,374
I have all those AI agents that have all these needs.

852
00:44:21,915 --> 00:44:22,775
Like real humans.

853
00:44:23,296 --> 00:44:26,058
They can eat, have a job, go see a movie sometime.

854
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,600
They have family, friends, co-workers.

855
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:30,167
Sounds great, right?

856
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:34,808
Sounds like I've given my agents roles to live a fulfilling life.

857
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:38,110
Yeah, maybe.

858
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,770
But is it a great game?

859
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,671
No, it's not even a game yet.

860
00:44:42,371 --> 00:44:45,652
It's a simulation, and the players live outside of it.

861
00:44:49,508 --> 00:44:56,173
So, like, no player will dare give a crap that your agents can eat an apple and evacuate it later.

862
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,955
Well, unless it's part of your gameplay.

863
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:05,440
If the players must collect feces to, I don't know, create compost and make plants grow, I mean, it might be relevant.

864
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:08,763
But otherwise, not that much.

865
00:45:10,146 --> 00:45:13,690
In other words, players don't care how smart your agent is.

866
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:17,354
They care how well your agent interacts with them,

867
00:45:17,374 --> 00:45:20,798
how smart your agent looks to their eyes,

868
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,602
how well your agent sells its fantasy.

869
00:45:27,206 --> 00:45:29,408
So we are making virtual worlds.

870
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:33,845
Robotic engineers, self-driving car makers, big data analysts,

871
00:45:34,346 --> 00:45:36,847
they are dealing with real-world problematics.

872
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:40,049
They have constraints that we don't have.

873
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:42,831
We create the constraints.

874
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,152
We make the world.

875
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:47,774
Your AI should care about your game constraints,

876
00:45:48,334 --> 00:45:49,375
not reality's ones.

877
00:45:51,436 --> 00:45:54,378
How many times have I heard fellow developers say that

878
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:57,840
this is a design problem, not a technological one?

879
00:45:58,841 --> 00:45:59,441
And it's true.

880
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:06,565
But then, why do I see so many developers making their own AI system before even knowing

881
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:07,987
what the design of their game is?

882
00:46:08,747 --> 00:46:13,392
Before knowing what it is that their AI is trying to solve in the first place, and with

883
00:46:13,473 --> 00:46:14,153
what constraints?

884
00:46:16,456 --> 00:46:20,961
If I put a self-driving car in space, it would make no sense to expect it to behave as it

885
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:21,661
was designed to.

886
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:28,594
So the next time you try to simulate life or create a smart agent that can learn the alphabet,

887
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:31,115
ask yourself what you're trying to solve with it.

888
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:36,399
Sit down with the designers and see what sort of AI answer best the needs of their game.

889
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,802
Otherwise, you won't ship a game at all, just a beautiful tech demo.

890
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:42,863
Thank you.

891
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,082
Hi, so for my rant, I'm gonna talk about

892
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:55,586
how you can't procedurally generate novelty.

893
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,748
So, you know, the Mandelbrot set is beautiful

894
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:01,253
and we can zoom into it, but after five or 10 minutes,

895
00:47:01,713 --> 00:47:03,135
you sort of grow bored of it,

896
00:47:03,235 --> 00:47:04,998
even though you can zoom into it forever.

897
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:11,445
But we do have great success stories in video games for procedural content generation,

898
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:15,269
like Speed Tree, where you can make beautiful scenes and such.

899
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:19,393
But, you know, if we want to create lots and lots of novelty,

900
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:21,856
well, the trees kind of all do look alike.

901
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:26,577
We have No Man's Sky, which promised that we could go to millions of planets, and actually

902
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:27,997
No Man's Sky uses SpeedTree.

903
00:47:29,438 --> 00:47:34,439
But we really would love to go and see all these new creatures we've never seen before,

904
00:47:34,779 --> 00:47:37,099
and first couple times, it's amazing.

905
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,121
A couple, like a month or two ago, someone looked at the data files for No Man's Sky,

906
00:47:42,201 --> 00:47:46,862
and they use a constructionist approach, and this is the Triceratops model, and that's

907
00:47:47,262 --> 00:47:50,843
So they have eight heads, five bodies, six tails.

908
00:47:51,683 --> 00:47:56,768
And you can see that there's 240 different combinations you can see there.

909
00:47:56,788 --> 00:47:58,530
And then when you put different paint jobs on them,

910
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:01,593
you put a belly paint job and a top paint job, right?

911
00:48:01,853 --> 00:48:05,918
You can get to about 10,000 different variations of it.

912
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:09,085
Now if we look at something like the,

913
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:10,686
try and figure this out,

914
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:12,186
well it doesn't feel like we saw

915
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:13,727
10,000 different things, right?

916
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:15,628
There's a spectrum of novelty,

917
00:48:15,728 --> 00:48:17,848
from the weakest where we are, we've seen it,

918
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:19,809
oh we've seen something like it,

919
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:21,850
and mildly interesting,

920
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,751
and then wow, and then holy shit,

921
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:26,652
I've just seen something amazing.

922
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:30,924
So really, we don't care that there's 10,000 creatures,

923
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:33,107
we care more like how much novelty there is.

924
00:48:33,588 --> 00:48:37,653
So Rabin's novelty number is the number of wow and holy shit items

925
00:48:38,234 --> 00:48:39,095
that you actually see.

926
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:41,017
So when I look back at this, I'm feeling like,

927
00:48:41,037 --> 00:48:42,679
uh, I think the number is six.

928
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:50,458
Right, it's just not as what you thought it may have been.

929
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:55,324
Borderlands, amazing game, of course, has a lot of weapons, right?

930
00:48:55,524 --> 00:48:59,730
And they use the same constructionist approach where you can have all the different pieces

931
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:00,191
and such.

932
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:08,299
And it has so many different guns in this game that the Guinness Book of World Records has certified it.

933
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,143
And I know what you're thinking, like the official Guinness Book of World Records?

934
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:15,607
Yes, that Guinness Book of World Records.

935
00:49:17,618 --> 00:49:21,079
They've certified it as having over 17 million possible guns.

936
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,261
And then Borderlands 2 came out, and it has even more guns.

937
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:29,823
But Randy Pitchford of Gearbox actually

938
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,124
said there are enough where it doesn't matter.

939
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:38,406
Because saying these high numbers is kind of silliness.

940
00:49:39,747 --> 00:49:43,048
Your clever algorithm is not going to make infinite content.

941
00:49:45,531 --> 00:49:49,535
Well, yeah, because what you really want is infinite novel content, right?

942
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:50,596
So it's not going to do that.

943
00:49:51,296 --> 00:49:56,761
Your clever algorithm with n novelty will make something like n novel content.

944
00:49:57,702 --> 00:50:02,486
And this is something like the Kolmogorov complexity.

945
00:50:02,927 --> 00:50:05,089
I figured out how to pronounce it by checking the internet.

946
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:10,754
But that's like descriptive complexity, algorithmic entropy, program size complexity.

947
00:50:11,054 --> 00:50:15,558
Really, you're only going to get the novelty that's in the original code that you put there.

948
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:17,399
It has to come from somewhere.

949
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:22,684
Maybe you could scour the internet for novelty, but you have to put it in there.

950
00:50:23,184 --> 00:50:25,946
And like SpeedTree has been around for 17 years.

951
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:28,849
17 years of development, of refinement, adding novelty to it.

952
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:30,570
And so it is really good.

953
00:50:32,171 --> 00:50:35,553
So no clever algorithm is going to give you this infinite novelty.

954
00:50:36,053 --> 00:50:39,735
I think when it just comes down to it, you have to make the novelty.

955
00:50:40,315 --> 00:50:41,035
So that's my rant.

956
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:51,981
I'm just going to leave that guy up there for a little while while I take a drink of water

957
00:50:52,021 --> 00:50:55,242
because it's just fascinating to look at. It's the face that makes it.

958
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:56,923
I am covered in spoons.

959
00:50:59,704 --> 00:51:00,785
Okay, now it's starting to get creepy.

960
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:11,026
We have talked a lot about procedurally generated content, the craft of it, the effect of it,

961
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:16,688
not only here in the past two days, but actually in these halls, and it's a kind of thing that

962
00:51:17,268 --> 00:51:22,731
is being discussed a lot more lately, let's face it, including by Steve, imagine that.

963
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:25,092
And you know what?

964
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:27,893
Steve's right, kind of.

965
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:31,897
Um, procedural content isn't a magic bullet.

966
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:36,058
It isn't going to be that one thing that just penetrates right through and, and,

967
00:51:36,418 --> 00:51:39,779
you know, solves your game and gives you all of that novelty.

968
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:43,300
But that's actually not what procedural content a lot of times is used for.

969
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:44,061
It's use case.

970
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:44,321
Really.

971
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:49,102
It's a little bit more like this where you really need to spray a lot of content

972
00:51:49,162 --> 00:51:53,644
around your world because of design, you know, and, and, and asset pipelines and

973
00:51:53,684 --> 00:51:53,964
stuff.

974
00:51:53,984 --> 00:51:56,405
So you just want to fill your game full of lead.

975
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:59,466
Unfortunately, of course, a lot of people think that, well, you're just going to burn

976
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:04,388
the place to the ground, or at least drop very bad bombs in places, and so certainly

977
00:52:04,448 --> 00:52:08,650
designers and others get kind of defensive about the use of procedurally generated content.

978
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,110
But be that as it may.

979
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:14,492
What do we do about this, though, if it's not a silver bullet?

980
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:18,349
And it seems to have some use.

981
00:52:19,009 --> 00:52:21,890
So here's my advice, AAA studios, seriously,

982
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,751
just stop wringing your hands about,

983
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:25,312
you know, oh my gosh, should we do some procedural,

984
00:52:25,332 --> 00:52:28,513
you generate content, we got a budget for this,

985
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:31,674
you know, indies, indies, stop pouring over blogs

986
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:33,375
and articles and message boards and Reddit

987
00:52:33,415 --> 00:52:35,956
and say, how do I put PCG in my game?

988
00:52:36,176 --> 00:52:37,656
How can I make a game that does this?

989
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,832
Seriously, just, you know, stop.

990
00:52:41,793 --> 00:52:43,374
Academics, God, I love so many of you.

991
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:44,575
You're so many of my great friends,

992
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:47,717
and you do amazing work, but stop researching PCG.

993
00:52:48,438 --> 00:52:50,219
Just seriously, stop tormenting yourself,

994
00:52:50,279 --> 00:52:51,500
enslaving your grad students,

995
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,422
and chasing the whole EP value

996
00:52:53,762 --> 00:52:57,545
in the name of academic research about PCG.

997
00:52:57,965 --> 00:53:02,309
All of you, just stop doing all of those things,

998
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,692
and instead, just do the damn procedural content already.

999
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:08,431
No, I'm serious!

1000
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:14,033
By way of anecdote, I just came off a contract where I was working for a company called Pixelmage

1001
00:53:14,073 --> 00:53:16,654
Games on a game called Hero's Song.

1002
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:21,356
We made it to Steam Early Access, had to pull it because of some business concerns and whatnot,

1003
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:25,338
but it did see the light of day for a while there.

1004
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:29,860
And the thing was, a massive amount of the game was PCG.

1005
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,040
For example...

1006
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:32,461
Big breath...

1007
00:53:33,227 --> 00:53:38,333
We did procedural world gen where we made continents and had many different biomes with rivers and lakes.

1008
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:42,458
And we did it through the generation of tectonic plates that moved and created elevations.

1009
00:53:42,478 --> 00:53:46,584
We had moisture levels and wind movement that blew things around that gave us those biomes.

1010
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:51,310
And our worlds were massive, 10,000 square kilometers to generate a world.

1011
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,632
I mean, they looked kind of like this, and every single one was different.

1012
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:55,592
They were really cool.

1013
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,834
You could say, oh, look at this, this valley here.

1014
00:53:58,414 --> 00:54:00,395
We did procedural terrain across that.

1015
00:54:00,435 --> 00:54:05,998
We had grass and rocks and dirt and trees and all sorts of things, even flowers lettered

1016
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:06,578
around the world.

1017
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:08,739
And that was all based on whatever biome you were in.

1018
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,762
We could actually even blend between biomes as you walked across the world, gradually

1019
00:54:12,802 --> 00:54:16,744
transitioning from grassland to plains to forest to mountains.

1020
00:54:17,544 --> 00:54:20,447
procedural civilization placement in those worlds

1021
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:24,911
that the civilizations had capitals and cities and towns and villages and even

1022
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:25,732
small camps

1023
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:29,575
littered about the place. And we had hundreds of them in those worlds

1024
00:54:29,915 --> 00:54:33,539
and it was all based on the size of the civilization. What kind of coverage were

1025
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:35,941
they? Were they a global civilization or were they just regional?

1026
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,742
What preferences did they have for biomes?

1027
00:54:38,762 --> 00:54:41,462
Because the dwarves were in the mountains and the elves were in the forests

1028
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:43,523
and the goblins were over here.

1029
00:54:44,723 --> 00:54:45,864
Land feature preferences.

1030
00:54:45,944 --> 00:54:49,945
Did they want to live next to lakes and rivers or along coasts or out in the middle of nowhere?

1031
00:54:50,485 --> 00:54:53,005
And what kind of neighbors did they prefer to live next to?

1032
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:56,386
That all factored into where we placed civilizations in our world.

1033
00:54:56,406 --> 00:54:58,087
And so you can actually look at the map and see all these little...

1034
00:54:58,247 --> 00:54:59,467
This is my debug map, by the way.

1035
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:04,310
All the little colored dots of, hey, look, those are cities and towns and villages and everything,

1036
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,371
and these guys are over here and these are over there.

1037
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:10,353
We did procedural history generation on these civilizations,

1038
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:14,436
where we could have wars and assassinations and alliances and trading pacts

1039
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:18,438
and creation of epic items and loss of epic items.

1040
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:20,019
That is important, by the way.

1041
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,741
And this was all based on proximity to the habitations,

1042
00:55:23,781 --> 00:55:25,962
the friendliness of the civilizations to each other,

1043
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:28,904
the ebb and flow of relationships over time.

1044
00:55:29,144 --> 00:55:34,770
And speaking of time, we simulated 10,000 years of history when you generated your world.

1045
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,131
Where's Tarn? Are you here?

1046
00:55:37,352 --> 00:55:39,234
Tarn Adams, I love you brother.

1047
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:40,816
And no, we weren't copying your...

1048
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:41,676
Okay, a little.

1049
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,061
We did procedural road generation in those worlds, then, between the habitations and

1050
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:52,102
even to points of interest in the world, like dungeons, so people could find them easier.

1051
00:55:52,403 --> 00:55:53,743
We had different sizes of roads.

1052
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:57,144
Some of them were huge, between capitals like the King's Road, and some of them were just

1053
00:55:57,184 --> 00:55:59,984
paths going off to camps and dungeons and whatnot.

1054
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:04,466
And those were, of course, based on the proximity, how close we were to these cities, what were

1055
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,126
the friendliness of the civilizations.

1056
00:56:06,286 --> 00:56:10,107
Allies had roads running between them, not so much to your enemies, because that's dangerous.

1057
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,710
And then of course we used the biome traversal costs.

1058
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,452
You know, you don't want to run a road through the mountains unless you have to.

1059
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:20,195
And then, so if you look carefully, you see the little black lines.

1060
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:24,198
We had roads all over the place, networking across these massive worlds of ours.

1061
00:56:24,498 --> 00:56:26,139
The cities were procedurally generated.

1062
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:28,041
We had all sorts of different types of buildings.

1063
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:33,865
I think we had 25, 30 different types of buildings, and we placed them procedurally in a place

1064
00:56:33,885 --> 00:56:36,227
where we knew that there was going to be some sort of habitation.

1065
00:56:36,547 --> 00:56:43,073
And it was all based on the town size, the racial preferences for the types of buildings that would be in this racist city.

1066
00:56:43,914 --> 00:56:46,135
And then we had to work around the terrain features.

1067
00:56:46,175 --> 00:56:47,577
What if there's a river running through here?

1068
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:50,139
We had to place them procedurally around the river.

1069
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,562
The buildings and the dungeons themselves, the building shapes.

1070
00:56:53,602 --> 00:56:57,465
And yes, we actually had multi-story buildings that conformed to the exterior shape.

1071
00:56:58,145 --> 00:57:02,166
Building interiors were procedurally generated with the placement of objects in buildings.

1072
00:57:02,406 --> 00:57:06,747
The dungeon interiors were all procedurally generated. No dungeons were ever the same.

1073
00:57:07,087 --> 00:57:09,548
Not just modular rooms were gluing things together,

1074
00:57:09,768 --> 00:57:13,569
but they had nooks and crannies and obstacles and everything in the dungeons

1075
00:57:13,649 --> 00:57:17,289
so that they were all completely unique and you didn't know what was coming next.

1076
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,730
But they looked real.

1077
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,710
The population of the world was procedurally generated.

1078
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,411
The creatures that were in it, the humanoid creatures as well as the animals.

1079
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:27,011
Town inhabitants.

1080
00:57:27,372 --> 00:57:30,433
When we created those towns with those buildings, we staffed them.

1081
00:57:31,334 --> 00:57:34,835
Objects that were littered around the world, crafting items, loot, all sorts of

1082
00:57:34,895 --> 00:57:36,216
interesting things you could find.

1083
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:38,357
And all of that was based on what biome

1084
00:57:38,697 --> 00:57:41,019
you were in. You would find different things in different places.

1085
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:44,801
The influence of the civilization. While I'm in dwarf territory, therefore I'm

1086
00:57:44,821 --> 00:57:46,221
probably going to see a few more dwarfs.

1087
00:57:46,942 --> 00:57:51,285
And what the neighbors were, well, we're kind of near goblin territory and they might be invading.

1088
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,546
Oh look, there are some.

1089
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:58,010
And then the rarity, are they something that's common or a little bit uncommon, rare, or are they something unique?

1090
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:03,574
And then we'd also space them out so that not all of the difficult stuff was right next to each other.

1091
00:58:03,834 --> 00:58:05,715
All procedurally at runtime.

1092
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:11,782
Names. Everything in the world had a name, not just the characters and the cities, but geographic features.

1093
00:58:11,982 --> 00:58:17,828
You could have a forest that had a name, sometimes more than one, because different races called it different things.

1094
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:25,516
Mountain ranges, etc. had names, and they were based on designer-created templates that we would sort out by race, sub-race, gender, whatever.

1095
00:58:25,536 --> 00:58:26,237
We could just...

1096
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:31,423
like one example of that template right there, a prefix with the little apostrophe and first

1097
00:58:31,463 --> 00:58:35,207
and last and suffix, so you could have tens of millions of unique names, and just using

1098
00:58:35,267 --> 00:58:37,770
that template, for example, you could get things like this.

1099
00:58:39,272 --> 00:58:40,033
How do you even pronounce it?

1100
00:58:40,053 --> 00:58:40,213
A.I.

1101
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:41,455
Dave Markmaster, A.I.

1102
00:58:41,575 --> 00:58:45,399
Steve Rabindude, and A.Lisha Ladeck, wow, what are the odds?

1103
00:58:46,558 --> 00:58:49,701
Cool. Anyway, procedural dialogue in this game.

1104
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:52,623
Now, we had text instead of VO, so we could get away with a lot more here.

1105
00:58:52,943 --> 00:58:55,085
We had greetings, friendly, neutral, hostile, whatever.

1106
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,846
We had taunts. We had barks.

1107
00:58:56,886 --> 00:58:59,408
We had information about the world that the characters would say,

1108
00:58:59,468 --> 00:59:01,089
not only to you, but to each other.

1109
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:05,432
And you could hear worldwide information, regional information about the town,

1110
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:07,774
or even just local dynamic events that were happening.

1111
00:59:07,814 --> 00:59:09,255
They may just tell you about it.

1112
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,703
Some of it was generic, a lot of it was racially specific.

1113
00:59:13,223 --> 00:59:16,045
They sounded like that particular race.

1114
00:59:16,105 --> 00:59:18,046
They had their own speech patterns, et cetera.

1115
00:59:18,427 --> 00:59:19,787
And we used templates to create these

1116
00:59:19,827 --> 00:59:21,208
so that they could insert information

1117
00:59:21,268 --> 00:59:22,789
like race, gender, name, class.

1118
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,870
They might call you by name,

1119
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,151
they might call you by, refer to your race,

1120
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:28,533
they might refer to each other by their class, whatever.

1121
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:30,574
And we filtered it by all of the above,

1122
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:31,815
including the disposition.

1123
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,956
They're going to say completely different things to you

1124
00:59:34,036 --> 00:59:35,877
if you're hostile compared to friendly.

1125
00:59:37,308 --> 00:59:38,568
all filled into those templates.

1126
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:40,629
Procedural information about the world

1127
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:43,190
that was constantly being generated at runtime

1128
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,290
using what was going on in the world

1129
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:48,351
referenced by the generated names in the procedural dialogue

1130
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:50,152
so you could actually hear things like,

1131
00:59:50,352 --> 00:59:52,932
we've heard reports of knolls to the southwest.

1132
00:59:52,972 --> 00:59:54,113
And if you went southwest,

1133
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:55,613
damn it, you're gonna run into knolls.

1134
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:59,958
They were telling you about this. There are goblins attacking the east

1135
01:00:00,178 --> 01:00:03,222
gate of the city. The orcs are massing in

1136
01:00:03,462 --> 01:00:07,687
the forest north of the river. They would fill in all of this information.

1137
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:13,996
Items in the world, information about the items in the world, using the game world information

1138
01:00:14,036 --> 01:00:19,041
referred to by the names in the procedural dialogue with varying degrees of specificity.

1139
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:20,582
What do I mean by that?

1140
01:00:21,123 --> 01:00:24,386
The magic tome of amazing AI is rumored to be lost far to the west.

1141
01:00:24,426 --> 01:00:26,108
Well, that's not terribly helpful, is it?

1142
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,912
But as you get people who know more and more about this situation...

1143
01:00:30,492 --> 01:00:33,953
they would actually add more specificity to the point where you would get to

1144
01:00:33,993 --> 01:00:36,634
something along the lines of the magic tome of amazing AI

1145
01:00:36,914 --> 01:00:40,435
is lost far to the west in the dungeon of Moscone near the Californian city of

1146
01:00:40,475 --> 01:00:43,116
San Francisco where it is guarded by a horde of AI programmers

1147
01:00:43,476 --> 01:00:47,638
and that was the god-honest truth because they knew it was in the world

1148
01:00:47,718 --> 01:00:49,298
and they were signposting the player

1149
01:00:49,538 --> 01:00:52,319
hey there's something interesting over there in Moscone

1150
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:54,740
and it's guarded by a lot of AI programmers

1151
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,801
That was all procedural.

1152
01:00:56,961 --> 01:01:00,002
We even had quests, procedural quests that were constantly being generated

1153
01:01:00,122 --> 01:01:03,684
using the procedural items, placed in the procedural dungeons,

1154
01:01:03,764 --> 01:01:07,865
in the generated world, using the names and referenced by the dialogue.

1155
01:01:08,886 --> 01:01:12,908
So we had all of this stuff, all of this procedural.

1156
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:16,409
I did a lot of it just by myself, and there was two or three others on the team

1157
01:01:16,429 --> 01:01:18,730
that worked on various portions of it.

1158
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,611
My point is not necessarily to brag.

1159
01:01:21,671 --> 01:01:23,132
Okay, well, it was actually really kind of cool.

1160
01:01:25,234 --> 01:01:31,077
My point is this, we did all of this in one year.

1161
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:34,518
And that's on top of me actually doing

1162
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:36,379
the regular game AI that I had to do

1163
01:01:36,439 --> 01:01:38,920
for combat and for moving around and whatnot.

1164
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,621
And by the way, all of the characters knew how to respond

1165
01:01:41,661 --> 01:01:45,083
to detect and process all of this procedural information.

1166
01:01:45,563 --> 01:01:46,363
How did we do this?

1167
01:01:47,975 --> 01:01:52,258
We didn't write a thesis, we didn't do years of research, no hand-wringing, no scouring blog posts,

1168
01:01:52,298 --> 01:01:53,799
or pleading for advice on forums.

1169
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:56,721
We just looked at the problem one at a time,

1170
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:58,522
we thought about it for a little bit,

1171
01:01:58,862 --> 01:02:00,623
and said, well, let's figure this out.

1172
01:02:01,143 --> 01:02:02,944
And then we just did it.

1173
01:02:03,405 --> 01:02:05,286
Because it's just programming.

1174
01:02:06,907 --> 01:02:09,888
So, again, I'm not here to brag about this.

1175
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:11,569
There is a bigger message here.

1176
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,591
I'm here to pump you up.

1177
01:02:15,493 --> 01:02:18,914
about the fact that, you know what, you can do this also.

1178
01:02:18,994 --> 01:02:21,916
You don't have, there is no such thing as an expert in PCG.

1179
01:02:23,576 --> 01:02:24,217
I'm serious.

1180
01:02:24,977 --> 01:02:28,618
Stop all of the hand-wringing and researching and just do it.

1181
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:32,460
Because it might make things kind of better,

1182
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,541
spraying some content around your games.

1183
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:37,582
