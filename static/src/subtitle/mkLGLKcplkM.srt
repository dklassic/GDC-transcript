1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,603
The way this talk came about is that I spoke here two years ago at the Game Developers Conference,

2
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:12,244
and I talked about leadership.

3
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:17,547
And as part of that talk, I kind of gave some thoughts about heartfelt communication,

4
00:00:17,587 --> 00:00:19,128
but I didn't get very technical about it.

5
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:22,069
And afterwards, that kind of bothered me.

6
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,030
Like, I felt like it maybe chickened out a little bit.

7
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,973
Because I do get very technical about it in my day-to-day work,

8
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:31,755
and I give some very specific advice.

9
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:34,857
But it's kind of a delicate subject, which is why I avoided it.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,942
So it's incredibly important, but it can also be difficult to talk about.

11
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:41,685
Here's an example of what might make it difficult.

12
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:46,028
When someone wants to do more at a company, when they want to increase the scope or value

13
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:48,329
of their work, or if you want to be, you know, a little bit vulgar about it,

14
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:51,852
if they just want a promotion, right, often what stops them is

15
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:53,693
that they get perceptually pigeonholed.

16
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:58,937
You know, you can't actually do senior work if you're in an environment

17
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:00,878
where everyone still treats you like your junior.

18
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:03,660
And so in those cases, I'll say.

19
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:07,707
if I'm managing this person. Part of your work here is to change perceptions, and to

20
00:01:07,787 --> 00:01:11,788
do that I'll get really specific. I'll say, forward me drafts of your emails before you

21
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:15,249
send them out, and I'll write back and say stuff like, you know, your tone in this part

22
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:19,210
is a little conciliatory, I think that sends the wrong message. I'd actually be a tiny

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:25,112
bit patronizing here. You know, when I put it in those terms that I'm like giving people

24
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:31,233
calculated advice to be patronizing on purpose, it sounds pretty manipulative, and manipulative

25
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:34,094
I think is a dirty word to us, and that's what makes it hard to talk about.

26
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:39,792
Here's another way of putting that. Take two people who I'm going to call Dale and Eugene.

27
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:43,676
Both of them send emails with a patronizing tone.

28
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:51,024
Dale is very analytical, and he employs his patronizing tone on purpose to alter the way others see him.

29
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:56,410
Eugene, on the other hand, writes the patronizing email because he's just a patronizing kind of guy.

30
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:04,500
take a moment to reflect on Dale and Eugene and get a sense for what your gut reaction is to people like each of them.

31
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,202
Like, what do you think about their behavior? You probably know people like each of them.

32
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:20,908
While their outward behavior is the same, in my experience, the general tendency, and maybe you got a sense of this as you were just thinking about it,

33
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:25,310
is we tend to react very negatively to Dale, much more so than Eugene.

34
00:02:25,632 --> 00:02:30,575
There's this basic sense that because Dale knows what he's doing, because he's doing this consciously,

35
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:33,877
his behavior is somehow dishonest or even immoral.

36
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:42,123
Both Dale and Eugene's emails are examples of framing, which is the thing I want to talk about,

37
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,024
though in Dale's case, the framing is conscious and intentional.

38
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:48,547
If you're talking to someone...

39
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:53,631
and they're being condescending towards you, and so you patronize them a little bit in reply to try to combat that,

40
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:56,932
you are reframing the power dynamic of the interaction.

41
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:03,015
A frame, to define it, is just a context, it is a set of basic assumptions,

42
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:07,516
it is a perspective that you bring to and impose upon your interactions with people.

43
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:11,578
There's these two guys, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky,

44
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,939
and they're the founders of an academic field called behavioral economics,

45
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,080
and they first used the term framing.

46
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,093
back in 1981 to describe this phenomenon.

47
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:25,957
In their studies of human decision-making, they noted that phrasing the same choice in

48
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:29,059
different ways can drastically alter the way people make that choice.

49
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,742
In Kahneman's most recent book, which is excellent and everyone should read, he gives an example

50
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:38,325
of one of their classic framing studies which has come to be known as the Asian disease

51
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:39,385
problem and it goes like this.

52
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:44,248
Pretend all of you in this room right now are public health professionals, like you

53
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:45,489
work for the CDC or something.

54
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:50,255
I have gathered you here today because there's a disease sweeping through Asia and despite

55
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:52,995
our best quarantine efforts, we expect it's going to make it to the U.S.

56
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:56,236
And when it does, we expect that it's going to kill 600 people.

57
00:03:57,796 --> 00:04:01,597
We have two avenues for treatment, but we only have the resources to pursue one of them,

58
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:03,618
and your job is to decide which one we pursue.

59
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,798
Treatment option A is a sure thing.

60
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:10,779
If we pick option A, 200 people will be saved of the 600.

61
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:13,840
If we pick option B...

62
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:19,399
there's a one-thirds chance that all 600 people will be saved and a two-thirds chance nobody will be saved.

63
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:23,620
So which would you choose? Think about it for a sec.

64
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,021
Save 200 people for sure or the one-in-three gamble to save everyone?

65
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:36,404
In their studies, they say a large majority chooses the sure thing. They choose to save 200 people.

66
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,503
But a different group of people from the same background were given a slightly different choice.

67
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:46,986
Faced with the same disease, they were also given two treatment options.

68
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:52,790
If you choose option A, they were told 400 of the people will die for sure.

69
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:57,794
If you choose option B, there's a one-thirds chance that nobody will die,

70
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,597
but a two-thirds chance that all 600 people will die.

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,183
Now I can't give you the full sense of what it's like to hear this because I just told you the other group's choices,

72
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:10,445
but what do you suppose this group would have chosen?

73
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,967
To lose 400 people for sure or to gamble to save everyone?

74
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:17,389
In the study, large majority chose to gamble.

75
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:25,615
If you're paying attention, you've already noticed those two groups were given the exact same choice,

76
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:26,836
it was just a difference of framing.

77
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:31,278
Save 200 and lose 400 describe the exact same outcome.

78
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,820
But that choice of phrasing changed the way that people chose.

79
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:39,444
And their conclusion was people will take a sure gain over a gamble,

80
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:42,126
but they will take a gamble over a sure loss.

81
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:46,790
But whether it's a sure gain or a sure loss is really just a question of how you describe it.

82
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,372
That's the framing fact.

83
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,615
But now comes the part that really blew my mind when I was reading this.

84
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:56,398
Kahneman gathered the two groups together and explained, like I just did to you,

85
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,820
the two different frames. He told them...

86
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,534
You chose to save 200 lives in one formulation, and you chose to gamble rather than accept 400 deaths in the other.

87
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:09,977
Now that you know these choices are inconsistent, how do you decide?"

88
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:15,761
And the answer, he says, is usually embarrassed silence.

89
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,023
Why is it embarrassed silence?

90
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:22,886
When people are given one frame or the other, they answer quickly.

91
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:25,928
But when they're given both frames, they're paralyzed.

92
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:26,948
Why?

93
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,301
It turns out this is a really illuminating question.

94
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:36,163
Here's the way I think a lot of people see framing.

95
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:39,284
There's some core issue or decision to be made.

96
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:44,546
And we have some feelings or moral intuitions about that issue.

97
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:49,408
Frames are different ways of looking at the issue

98
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:54,350
and they can distort the issue and thereby distort our feelings for the core issue.

99
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:57,332
If this is our model...

100
00:06:57,815 --> 00:07:00,776
and I think it's a really common one, I think that people generally approach it this way,

101
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,877
then we would naturally regard framing with distrust.

102
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:10,019
We see it as a way of manipulating us, of tricking us into making the wrong choices.

103
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,661
But when you put it that way, if there's a wrong choice,

104
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:17,802
it implies that we think that there is a right choice,

105
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:22,743
and that right choice is the way we would decide if the problem were not framed at all.

106
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:28,899
And that is why this model is wrong. There is no such thing as an unframed problem.

107
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,420
You have to say it somehow.

108
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:36,165
And in the Asian disease problem, the reason that final question is met with embarrassed silence

109
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:42,390
is that once we're presented with both conflicting frames, we actually don't know how to decide.

110
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:44,372
Gamble or certainty.

111
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:47,054
When you frame it one way, we prefer one choice.

112
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:49,316
But when you frame it the other way, we prefer the other choice.

113
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:53,519
But then, when you give us both frames at once, we're paralyzed.

114
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:57,235
We have no intuition. We have no right choice.

115
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,617
Kahneman puts it this way, he says,

116
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:08,821
Framing should not be viewed as an intervention that masks or distorts an underlying preference.

117
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:14,865
At least in this instance, there is no underlying preference that is masked or distorted by the frame.

118
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:20,108
Like, no matter how many times I read that, that is still crazy to me. Think about that.

119
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:23,530
We do not have underlying preferences.

120
00:08:26,163 --> 00:08:32,345
Kahneman continues, your moral feelings, he says, are attached to frames, to descriptions

121
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:35,006
of reality, rather than to reality itself.

122
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:40,328
Or to put it another way, with no frames, we do not have moral intuition.

123
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:48,290
I walked you through this whole line of thinking to make a single point, and that is that framing

124
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,811
itself is a deeply moral act.

125
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:57,711
We tend to think of people who actively and consciously frame their conversations as manipulative,

126
00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:00,212
Machiavellian, even dishonest people.

127
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:06,154
But in the Asian disease problem, let's say you're the person that has to write the email

128
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:08,895
that's going to go to the experts that have to make the choice.

129
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:14,877
It's very clear now that the way you choose to frame the choice in your email is the point

130
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:19,539
at which the decision actually gets made, because your email phrasing will determine

131
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,539
which decision gets made.

132
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:30,604
Let's go back to our friends Dale and Eugene. If you are ignorant of frames, if you don't take the time to carefully consider how you frame the choice,

133
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:39,750
if you just pick whatever phrasing seems natural, you still framed it and you are still responsible for the results of your actions.

134
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,852
Ignorance of the law is no excuse.

135
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:48,756
Though I should be clear that when I say that framing is a moral act, I'm not saying that every frame itself is good,

136
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:52,299
I just mean that when you decide how to frame something,

137
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:57,088
That decision has moral implications and thus the choice is a moral one.

138
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,929
And so for Dale here, it's really a question of his intention.

139
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,891
If his intention is good, then he is making a sound moral decision.

140
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,071
Framing is a tool.

141
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:14,133
If we wield it with both skill and wisdom, it can do great good.

142
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:18,454
But if we are unskilled or unwise, it can cause great harm.

143
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,243
So I spent some time thinking about when I was putting this talk together, like what

144
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:29,324
can I actually talk about in regards to framing skill that would be helpful, right?

145
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:32,885
Like what can I give you that you might actually be able to actually use in your daily work?

146
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:35,686
I will quote Kahneman one more time.

147
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:41,068
He says, unless there is an obvious reason to do otherwise, most of us passively accept

148
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:46,050
decision problems as they are framed and therefore rarely have an opportunity to discover the

149
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,592
extent to which our preferences are frame bound rather than reality bound.

150
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,816
It takes attention and deliberate effort to hear something

151
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:59,698
and to take a step back before you respond and say,

152
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,639
how is that framed?

153
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:03,421
And to analyze it and to consider its impact.

154
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,323
But in my experience, once you are paying that attention,

155
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:08,764
once you notice it happening around you,

156
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:10,525
the rest of the skill, like how to respond

157
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:14,108
and what to say, how to behave, will follow naturally.

158
00:11:14,728 --> 00:11:16,349
It's not easy, it takes a lot of work,

159
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,011
but you'll be able to figure it out

160
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:21,533
because you're now noticing the opportunities to do so.

161
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:25,008
The initial sensitivity is the thing that really needs a jump start.

162
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:27,050
It really needs your initial attention to get the ball rolling.

163
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,212
So I thought it might be helpful, since I actually tend to think about this stuff kind

164
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:34,816
of borderline compulsively, I collect archetypes of situations,

165
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:37,278
of framing situations that I thought maybe I could describe.

166
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:40,381
There are cases that I encounter frequently, and I think about them a lot,

167
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:43,984
and I have them filed away mentally, and I find that it helps.

168
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:49,360
Because one of these situations arises during the workday because I've kind of thought about

169
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,641
it and categorized it away, in the moment that it happens I'll notice.

170
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:55,641
It's like I have kind of a spidey sense going off in the back of my head and I'll think

171
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,261
like, wait, this is one of those times.

172
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:09,564
So the first situation I want to talk about is when you are collaborating, sorry, directly

173
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:13,525
with someone else in a different team or department or organization.

174
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:17,406
So I've drawn it out as this big formal org structure here,

175
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,847
but the relevant thing is actually just that it's a cross-discipline kind of thing.

176
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:21,708
That's a salient point.

177
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:24,589
You are working with someone that you don't work with every single day,

178
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,770
who's not on your immediate team,

179
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,672
and these collaborations, I find, are usually prompted by a specific thing

180
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,012
that you guys need to get done together.

181
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:37,095
When I'm doing this, I start first by bringing to mind

182
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:39,416
one model of game development, which is this.

183
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:43,318
You can just think of game development as solving a set of constraints.

184
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:45,157
my engineering is coming out.

185
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:48,659
Your ship date is a constraint, right?

186
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,260
Design goals are all constraints.

187
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,821
Your target frame rate is a constraint.

188
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:55,163
The process of shipping a game is just satisfying all of these constraints.

189
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:58,265
Other constraints fall out from them, you know, how many animations you need and what

190
00:12:58,305 --> 00:13:00,106
subsystems you have to code and all that good stuff.

191
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:05,890
And in this model, every single team member's job is simply to own some set of those constraints

192
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,372
and to ensure that they are satisfied.

193
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:13,956
I like to bring this model to mind and kind of roll it around in my head to kind of get

194
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:18,019
myself in this mindset when I'm working with people across team boundaries because when

195
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,802
we have some conflict, as inevitably happens with creative work, I can think of this model

196
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:27,266
and remind myself, you're just trying to satisfy your constraints, I am just trying to satisfy

197
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:27,946
my constraints.

198
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:32,369
And when I'm able to stay in that mindset, I find that I naturally frame the situation

199
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:38,113
as you and me versus the problem, which is collaborative, instead of getting stuck in

200
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,174
you versus me.

201
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:42,134
which is actually a really easy trap to fall into.

202
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,597
Now, this frame is helpful,

203
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:48,978
but just the simple intention is rarely enough

204
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,319
because conflict still happens.

205
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,160
People misinterpret and miscommunicate.

206
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:54,062
We do things trying to help,

207
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:56,043
but our actions come across the wrong way.

208
00:13:57,484 --> 00:13:58,424
And though rationally,

209
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:00,766
we all know we're working towards the same goals,

210
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:03,327
it's very easy in practice to lose sight of that.

211
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:06,009
Sometimes the waters get rough,

212
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,170
and navigating them takes a little bit more nuance.

213
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:10,945
So for that nuance, I'm going to turn to another researcher.

214
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,926
Deborah Tannen is a professor of linguistics

215
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:15,827
and an expert on human communication

216
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:16,727
and has written a bunch of books.

217
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:19,128
And in her book on family relationships,

218
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,909
she has a model for understanding conflict

219
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,310
that I really like and actually think is super applicable

220
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,731
to professional relationships, too.

221
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:28,012
You can see your relationship, she says,

222
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:30,774
existing somewhere in this two-dimensional space.

223
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,995
One axis is a continuum from closeness to distance,

224
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:37,797
and the other one is a continuum from equality to hierarchy.

225
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:42,856
Now, when you and I, we have some relationship, it exists in both of our heads.

226
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:46,077
Don't worry about drawing, this is going to be on like a million slides, so everyone who's

227
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:51,639
writing down, you can... When you have some, when you and I have a relationship, it exists in both

228
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:57,500
of our heads. So we each have some idea of where we are in this space, and it can be more or less

229
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,522
aligned. You know, maybe you think that we're closer than I do, or maybe I think that we're

230
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,943
peers, and maybe you disagree.

231
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,805
So what I'm showing here right now is kind of an extreme case, especially at work,

232
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:17,987
because in my experience, I think most working relationships, by default, most of the time, are pretty well aligned.

233
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:21,688
We usually have a pretty good mutual understanding of where we are with respect to one another.

234
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:27,690
Here's the important thing. Your view of where we are on this chart,

235
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,472
whether you are conscious of it or not, is a frame that you bring to all of our interactions.

236
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:38,253
You behave differently towards me depending on where you think we are in this space.

237
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:42,223
And of course for me it's the same. My behavior towards you is framed by my view.

238
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:47,525
And then you can steer us around on this chart by behaving in certain ways, so it's a feedback loop.

239
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:53,867
Where we think we are on the chart affects our behavior, and then our behavior affects where we think we are on the chart.

240
00:15:55,268 --> 00:16:02,810
Arguments often result, Tannin says, when you feel yourself or someone else moving around the grid in ways that make you uncomfortable.

241
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:08,492
Too much closeness and too much hierarchy, for example, or too much equality and too much distance.

242
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:15,905
In cross-team collaborations, then, I want us always to be at the bottom of this chart.

243
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,906
I am always shooting for equality.

244
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:19,006
That's part of my frame.

245
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:20,747
We both have our constraints.

246
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,148
We're both trying to solve them.

247
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:25,629
Both of our constraints are important, and we're interacting as peers.

248
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,291
I use a tone I would use when talking to a peer.

249
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:33,653
I spend time listening to the other person and understanding her concerns, but I regard

250
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,013
them as equal to my own.

251
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,374
I try not to be dismissive.

252
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,702
but I also try not to be deferential. I deliberately behave in a way that communicates we are equals.

253
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,365
As for whether I aim to the left or the right, that's more of a case-by-case thing. It depends

254
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:52,026
on how close I think we are. If she and I are friendly, I'll lean on that a little bit.

255
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:56,128
Our rapport means I can assume a bit more and not have to spend as much time reassuring

256
00:16:56,168 --> 00:17:01,050
her of my motives. If she and I don't know each other as well, I'll incorporate a little

257
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,252
more distance into the way I frame things just as kind of a matter of common respect.

258
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:11,545
Given this, when we conflict, that means that she disagrees with what I am communicating

259
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:15,048
about where we are in this chart, which means that one of a few things has happened.

260
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:22,172
Perhaps I have misread where we are on that horizontal axis, the closeness to distance

261
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:22,752
spectrum.

262
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:28,736
If I'm treating her as closer than she feels we are, I can come off as invasive.

263
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:33,119
I can come off as overly patronizing, where to her it feels like I'm trying to pretend

264
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:34,300
we're closer than we are.

265
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:39,540
in the hopes that she'll go along with things like a used car salesman, kind of pretending you're

266
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:44,965
kind of chummy, and she will likely react by pushing in the other direction, being distant,

267
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:52,011
being cold, clamming up. If, on the other hand, I am the one being too distant and she feels that

268
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:56,855
we're closer than that, she can end up feeling abandoned or left out, or she can infer that I'm

269
00:17:56,915 --> 00:18:01,119
deliberately being cold or callous because I expect that we're going to fight and I'm preparing for

270
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:01,599
conflict.

271
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:07,889
So those are the errors of closeness and distance, and the good news there is those signs are

272
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,709
pretty easy to spot as long as you're looking for them.

273
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:12,710
And then the other way that things can go wrong is the vertical axis.

274
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:18,072
I can simply fail to communicate equality, and something about my behavior can convey

275
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:20,272
an unintended frame of hierarchy.

276
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:24,994
And Tannin says, at the hierarchy end, every relationship is a power struggle.

277
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:27,495
Someone is one up, and someone is one down.

278
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:36,938
When cross-team collaborations end up stuck in conflict at the hierarchy end of things,

279
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:42,021
I think it's almost always because someone feels that one of their constraints,

280
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:44,902
something that they're responsible for, is not being respected.

281
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:48,184
And that is an assertion of control by the other person,

282
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:52,346
which is a quality of hierarchical relationships and not equal relationships.

283
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:58,649
The important thing here to internalize is that every time your constraints are disregarded,

284
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,310
it makes your job harder.

285
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,674
You know, if I tell you I can't build you a tool

286
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:05,795
because someone else's needs have priority,

287
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:08,156
that means now you have to work harder to get your job done.

288
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:11,978
And that is why these kinds of conflicts

289
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:13,439
can be so emotionally charged.

290
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,900
If what you're hearing is that I don't respect

291
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,001
your constraints, then you're also hearing me say

292
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:20,282
I don't value your time, and by extension,

293
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:21,243
I don't value you.

294
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,527
So, in cross-team relationships,

295
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,805
The challenge is to bring the right frames to your work together so both of you understand

296
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:37,785
your relationship to be in the same place on this chart.

297
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:41,426
You want it all the way down at equality and in the appropriate spot between distance and

298
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:41,886
closeness.

299
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:46,708
When there's misalignment, when you are either miscommunicating or actually disagreeing about

300
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:50,129
your location on this chart, it damages your interaction.

301
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:52,749
And then that damage is the result of your work together.

302
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,830
And the severity of that damage gets worse.

303
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:59,143
the more misaligned you are, and it gets worse,

304
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:01,745
the longer you allow that misalignment to continue.

305
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,987
You know, a couple awkward minutes in a meeting

306
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:06,668
is one thing, but if you don't resolve it,

307
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:07,908
you let it stew overnight,

308
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:10,270
that can really damage the relationship more and more

309
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,191
and impair your ability to do great work together.

310
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:16,353
That is why it's crucial that you do two things.

311
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:21,322
First, do your best to read the situation clearly in the first place so you know where

312
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:22,303
on this chart to aim.

313
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:26,166
And then second, always be reading the other person as you're going, watching for that

314
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,328
feedback and responding to it with no delay.

315
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:33,673
It can be kind of a delicate dance sometimes, and it definitely takes a lot of practice.

316
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:37,656
And that's why it's important to have a really good model in your head for it and then pay

317
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:38,857
it the attention that it deserves.

318
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:50,172
All right, situation number two.

319
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:53,315
I began this talk by describing a situation

320
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,616
where I was giving someone advice

321
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:56,798
to be patronizing on purpose over email,

322
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:58,119
and maybe you're wondering what that was about.

323
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:00,661
So let me go back and fill in the blanks.

324
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:06,205
Situation number one was about relationships between equals,

325
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,147
but obviously not all team relationships are between equals.

326
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:12,750
Again, I've drawn this out as a kind of formal org chart,

327
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,232
but whether you have a very formal rigid org chart

328
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:16,573
or no org chart at all,

329
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,651
It remains the case that some relationships are more hierarchical than others.

330
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:25,493
Hierarchy reinforces perception.

331
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:30,496
If we hire someone as junior, I will perceive him to be junior to begin with,

332
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,237
and I'll interact with him as I would a junior employee,

333
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:35,918
and unless something really happens to change my perception,

334
00:21:36,518 --> 00:21:37,439
it's going to tend to stay there.

335
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,801
Perception reinforces hierarchy.

336
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:47,428
because I see him as junior, I'm not going to go to him with the kinds of questions I would ask someone senior.

337
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:51,791
I'm not readily going to trust him with the kinds of responsibilities I'd trust to someone senior.

338
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:57,195
So because I see him as junior, I'm less likely to give him the opportunity to do more senior work.

339
00:21:59,657 --> 00:22:02,959
On the other hand, someone who is already senior, who I perceive to be senior,

340
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:07,142
has to really screw up to push my perception very far down, right?

341
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:08,383
I think the reality is...

342
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:12,647
as humans, we're very susceptible to confirmation bias, which is where we pick the evidence

343
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:14,828
that confirms the conclusion we want to draw.

344
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,691
And so our perceptions of people are stable.

345
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:23,714
This loop here represents cognitive bias, and cognitive bias causes us to pigeonhole

346
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:24,415
people where they are.

347
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:30,579
A good example of this, a number of years ago, a friend of mine got his PhD at UT Austin,

348
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:34,802
and then he started looking at other universities to go to for his postdoctoral work.

349
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:35,302
And I was like...

350
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:38,718
wait a minute, you love Austin, why don't you stay here and do your postdoctoral work?"

351
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:39,858
And he laughed and he was like,

352
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:45,220
everybody knows you don't do your postdoctoral work at the same university you get your doctorate from

353
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,301
because they knew you when you were a grad student and they will always see you as a grad student.

354
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:55,103
The unsavory reality of cognitive bias means that if you're trying to,

355
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:57,124
to put it in these terms, if you're trying to get a promotion,

356
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:01,065
you have to be doing better work than the people who are already at that level

357
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:04,226
because they have inertia keeping them there and you have inertia keeping you down.

358
00:23:06,842 --> 00:23:09,104
A clarification before I go further with this example.

359
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:11,666
You may be listening to this and being like, I don't know what he's talking about.

360
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:12,908
I'm not trying to get a promotion.

361
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,090
I'm using you in a casual sense.

362
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,272
Take this example however it's relevant.

363
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:19,734
Maybe it's pertinent to someone on a team that you manage.

364
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,816
Maybe it's pertinent to a colleague that you're friendly with.

365
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:24,959
In any case.

366
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:29,748
Obviously, to be more senior, you need to actually do more senior work.

367
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:32,989
You need to step up, you need to take more initiative, you need to contribute more value

368
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:33,929
to your team and your company.

369
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:38,031
I'm not suggesting that you should be deceiving people into believing you are doing better

370
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:38,711
work than you are.

371
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:43,653
On the other hand, sometimes there's this idea that it should just be enough to do the

372
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:46,434
better work and everyone should just notice and that should be fine.

373
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:47,694
And humans don't work that way.

374
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,315
That's kind of a naive way to approach it.

375
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:55,681
There are a set of people that you work with who do know exactly what you do.

376
00:23:55,781 --> 00:24:00,124
You know, they're close to you, they're reviewing everything you do, they sit next to you, they talk to you all the time.

377
00:24:00,645 --> 00:24:03,647
These people won't need any convincing when you're doing more senior work.

378
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:04,588
They're already going to know about it.

379
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,353
But right now, as you and I sit here in this room together,

380
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:18,037
there is someone influential on your team who is more senior than you, who has basically no idea what you do.

381
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:23,019
and that person has a perception of you and it's probably outdated.

382
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,420
And if you've been kicking ass and hoping for recognition,

383
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,560
that person is going to cause you difficulty.

384
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:33,001
If humans were completely rational,

385
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:36,262
that person would recognize that he knows nothing about what you do

386
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:38,122
and in conversations about you, that person would say,

387
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:39,922
hey, I don't have any factual evidence to back this up,

388
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:41,062
so I'm going to sit this one out.

389
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:44,243
That is not how humans work.

390
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:46,463
In fact...

391
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,552
if you read the news you may know sometimes having less factual evidence

392
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:51,353
makes our opinions

393
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:59,419
stronger. That person's perception of you

394
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:03,262
is compelling to him. He can't help but feel it viscerally.

395
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:06,344
That's just how humans work. And so if someone suggests

396
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:10,747
hey we're gonna give this person a promotion, that person can't just sit

397
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:12,188
back and be like okay that's cool

398
00:25:12,348 --> 00:25:13,189
you know you know better than me

399
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,731
at the very least, even if that person's being responsible, he's probably going to say,

400
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:20,172
you know, okay, well convince me at least.

401
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,733
And convincing him is going to take time, it's going to take effort, putting together

402
00:25:23,793 --> 00:25:26,814
proof, talking through it, going back and forth, documenting it.

403
00:25:27,454 --> 00:25:31,415
That's bureaucracy, which is overhead, which is inertia, which is holding you back.

404
00:25:33,536 --> 00:25:38,057
You can complain about how unfair this is, but the truth is, it is your fault this person

405
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:41,278
sees you this way, because you teach people how to treat you.

406
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:48,098
His perception of you is largely based on the way you frame your interactions with him.

407
00:25:48,978 --> 00:25:51,739
To change his perception, you have to change the framing.

408
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:53,639
Remember that earlier quote,

409
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:56,460
unless there is an obvious reason to do otherwise,

410
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,901
most of us passively accept the frames that we are given.

411
00:26:01,942 --> 00:26:03,602
Those frames aren't going to change themselves.

412
00:26:04,623 --> 00:26:06,804
When he talks to you, he's going to frame it as,

413
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:09,284
I'm more senior than you, not because he's a jerk,

414
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:10,945
but because that's how he sees things.

415
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:12,465
That's his view of the world.

416
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,921
And unless you're really paying attention,

417
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,442
you will use his frame when you respond

418
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:18,483
without even realizing it.

419
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:23,746
For example, he might write to you and say,

420
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:28,748
sounds like things in your area are running behind a bit.

421
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:30,889
I need you to send me the current schedule

422
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:32,450
so I can figure out how it impacts my team.

423
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,272
I just made this up, this is not actually a real quote.

424
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:38,434
But it seems pretty reasonable, right?

425
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:39,454
It's not like he wrote to you and was like,

426
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:40,395
get me a coffee.

427
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:46,723
But let's take a minute and analyze the frame of the message.

428
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:47,784
So look at the first sentence.

429
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:51,545
Sounds like things in your area are running behind a bit.

430
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:55,707
He could have phrased this as a question, like,

431
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:58,728
hey, someone said your schedule's changed. I just wanted to ask you what was up.

432
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,449
But he didn't. He said it as a statement.

433
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:04,790
He told you how your work is, which is talking down.

434
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:07,791
And then there's the second sentence.

435
00:27:08,872 --> 00:27:11,933
I need you to send me the current schedule so I can figure out how it impacts my team.

436
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:14,843
Again, there's a power dynamic there, right?

437
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:15,683
He could have qualified it.

438
00:27:15,704 --> 00:27:17,825
He could have said, hey, when you have time, or, hey, sorry

439
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:18,706
for the short notice.

440
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:19,747
He didn't do that.

441
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:21,548
And he could have phrased it as a question.

442
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:23,309
He could have said, could you send me your schedule?

443
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,992
Or he could have shown deference by being oblique,

444
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,354
like, hey, it would really help me out if I had your

445
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:31,016
schedule, and he didn't do any of that.

446
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,959
The only way he could have been more hierarchical about

447
00:27:34,979 --> 00:27:37,901
it would have been to actually issue it as a direct order,

448
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:39,242
but he came pretty close.

449
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:45,379
If you reply to this email,

450
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,460
and you do not actively change the frame in your response,

451
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,680
you are confirming his frame.

452
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,800
Even if you just write back and say like,

453
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,281
sure, okay, sounds good, I'll send that to you.

454
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:55,281
You're implicitly telling him,

455
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,782
this is the right way to treat me,

456
00:27:57,822 --> 00:27:59,262
this is the right way to see me.

457
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:02,583
The way that you view our relationship is correct

458
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:04,564
because I didn't bother to try to challenge it.

459
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,845
So at this point, you have to stop and think about

460
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:10,125
what you want the power dynamic to actually be.

461
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:12,666
So take Tannen's vertical axis here.

462
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:17,916
Let's say you want to relate to this guy as a peer, so you want to push down towards equality.

463
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:19,616
Okay, frame it that way.

464
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:30,838
I find this part actually takes a certain amount of active visualization,

465
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:32,918
so you kind of come up with the frame in your head.

466
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:35,359
So in this case, let's say it's you and I are peers.

467
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:40,820
You have to roll it around in your head until you start to believe it.

468
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,321
you have to really kind of try it on and see how it fits.

469
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:46,383
And it's very important because

470
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:49,006
if you've just been going with the flow for a while,

471
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:51,608
like it or not, you have his frame stuck in your head.

472
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:53,790
You have to convince yourself

473
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,552
before you have any hope of convincing anyone else.

474
00:28:57,273 --> 00:28:58,655
And so that is where I would give advice.

475
00:28:58,675 --> 00:28:59,996
Like, don't be deferential here.

476
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:02,959
In fact, turn the tables by being a little bit patronizing.

477
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:05,001
You know, he's talking down to you, talk down to him.

478
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:09,117
right back and say, oh that's funny, you know, I was about to write and ask you for the same thing.

479
00:29:09,157 --> 00:29:12,820
Anyway, I'd be glad to make some time to help you understand things a bit better.

480
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,861
Let's grab coffee this afternoon.

481
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:21,206
Do you, I mean, do you see, I think it's subtle, but I mean, hopefully you see how, you know,

482
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,867
where that's a little bit patronizing.

483
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:27,330
But it's not about being mean, right, or like out-alphaing someone.

484
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,473
It can be playful, right, you can be kind of teasing about it.

485
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:33,315
Like it's not aggression, it's kind of a sly wink to it.

486
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,471
this is the way that a peer would talk to him.

487
00:29:37,971 --> 00:29:39,132
You know, there's that old saying of

488
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:41,774
dress for the job you want and not the job you have.

489
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:44,817
It's kind of like, speak from the position that you want,

490
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:47,359
not the position you've been boxed into.

491
00:29:51,683 --> 00:29:53,404
The only qualification that I would give to this

492
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:54,845
is that people will reject frames

493
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:56,747
if they are wildly different from their own.

494
00:29:56,787 --> 00:29:59,089
Like if your CEO sends an email to the whole company

495
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:00,630
and you write back privately to him

496
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,071
like you guys are like pals,

497
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:03,593
you're probably gonna get fired.

498
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,290
But slight adjustments over time will work.

499
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,551
You know, it takes effort because you have to step back every single time and analyze

500
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:16,252
and respond thoughtfully and get yourself out of the habit of just playing into somebody

501
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:17,053
else's frame.

502
00:30:17,553 --> 00:30:22,014
But you have to do it because it's your responsibility to teach other people how they should treat

503
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:22,214
you.

504
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,975
You know, don't sit by passively and let people frame you into a little box.

505
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:26,535
Take charge.

506
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:34,537
All right, that was peer relationships and hierarchical relationships.

507
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:41,005
I would like to talk about one more of these archetypes this afternoon, and I think it's

508
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:44,307
especially an important one for those of us who manage people.

509
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:50,873
So it is cliche, and I think rather obvious, for companies to say, we think that people

510
00:30:50,953 --> 00:30:53,074
are the most valuable asset we have.

511
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:56,657
And companies have ways that they can show that.

512
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:59,680
They can invest in perks, they can invest in management training, they can treat their

513
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,280
people well.

514
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:02,462
They have a lot of ways to show that they care.

515
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:09,632
As a leader, as a manager, as a human being, as a person, what do you do to show that you care?

516
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:13,315
And this is where I think the subtlety lies.

517
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:17,338
Many managers and leaders that I see claim to care about their employees,

518
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:19,700
but actually end up using a frame like,

519
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,783
I care about your work result, or I care about making you happy so you don't quit, right?

520
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:29,827
There is a different frame, and that is, I care about you.

521
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,899
When I talk to people about this, sometimes they'll argue, they'll say,

522
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,760
well those are really the same thing, right?

523
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,842
Because happy people do good work, so it's just good business sense,

524
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:42,143
and they're all really interconnected.

525
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:46,366
I agree that these things are inseparable,

526
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,729
but I don't agree that they're the same thing.

527
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:50,509
They're different things.

528
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:52,731
And that's important because if you want to be genuine,

529
00:31:52,771 --> 00:31:54,692
what I have found is that they cannot overlap.

530
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:58,535
What do I mean by that?

531
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:02,027
When you're having a conversation, if your frame is,

532
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:03,647
I care about your work results,

533
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:06,008
that means it is not, I care about you.

534
00:32:07,548 --> 00:32:09,109
They are mutually exclusive frames.

535
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:10,929
If the person you're talking to has the sense

536
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:13,029
that your first priority in this conversation

537
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:16,170
is her work result, she knows that she is not

538
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,550
your first priority right now.

539
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,771
Let's say the two of you are having some meeting,

540
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,431
you're trying to suss out some design problem.

541
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:23,912
It takes some.

542
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:27,514
you know, it's pretty rough compromises from both of you, things are pretty tight, but

543
00:32:27,594 --> 00:32:30,656
after a while you work on it, you come up with a plan that you're, you know, you think

544
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:31,457
is pretty solid.

545
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:36,681
You can tell she knows you've both done the right things, but she's really frustrated

546
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,163
and disappointed about the compromises that she's had to make.

547
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:45,228
And let's say, because you're an empathetic and decent human being, you can feel her frustration

548
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:46,929
and disappointment and you wish that you could help.

549
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:52,436
What I'm saying is because you've just spent a whole meeting framed in terms of the work product,

550
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:54,878
it's challenging to immediately shift over to saying,

551
00:32:54,978 --> 00:32:55,778
I care about you.

552
00:32:56,699 --> 00:33:01,082
It's easy for your words to ring hollow if she feels like you're still focused on the work results.

553
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:04,905
And then even if what you're saying is, I want to express my genuine compassion,

554
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:09,228
she may just hear you making some kind of vulgar gesture or faking concern,

555
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:11,030
or it may come across as like,

556
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,192
hey, I really hope that your frustration does not interfere with your work.

557
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,081
So from that I would say expressing personal caring for people at work is best done, in

558
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:26,381
my experience, by carving out a separate space for it.

559
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:31,963
So I myself spend a lot of time at Top Pot Donuts, which is a two block walk from my

560
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:36,625
office, and I get weird looks from the employees sometimes when it's like my third visit of

561
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:37,025
the day.

562
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:39,866
But I do not go there for the donuts.

563
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:40,786
I resist the donuts.

564
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:45,548
I go there one-on-one with colleagues because it gives us some distance, some physical distance

565
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:49,629
from work, and thereby makes it easier to frame our conversation as a personal one.

566
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,555
You know, in the example I just gave with a frustrated colleague,

567
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:55,957
I'd probably let the meeting end, give it a couple hours,

568
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:57,397
and then send a quick email saying, like,

569
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:59,078
look, that meeting was pretty rough.

570
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:00,959
I feel kind of bad about it.

571
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,640
I think we did the right thing, but like, ugh,

572
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,921
you know, you want to grab some coffee and chat about it.

573
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:08,142
And while I keep mentioning coffee,

574
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:09,603
obviously the coffee is not the point.

575
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:14,045
The important thing is that you carve out protected space

576
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:17,427
during your workday where you can interact with people

577
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,608
where the frame is, I care about you.

578
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:24,411
Be a good listener. Express your concern. Learn about them.

579
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,653
Do all the things humans do when they're building relationships.

580
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:30,955
And that goes for all of your colleagues.

581
00:34:31,455 --> 00:34:33,657
And if you're a manager, I think it goes double for your reports.

582
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:39,020
This is why one-on-one meetings with your reports, if you're a manager, are so important.

583
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:43,063
But it's also why it's so important not to let them just turn into status meetings.

584
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:46,325
Because if you let your one-on-ones become status meetings, what you're communicating is,

585
00:34:46,725 --> 00:34:50,127
this space is about the work result. This space is not about you.

586
00:34:53,002 --> 00:34:58,446
It gets a little bit tricky because sometimes status updates can actually be a good way to jumpstart a one-on-one if you don't really have anything to talk about.

587
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:06,052
But you should be viewing the status update as a kind of entry into the more human space and always pushing for that.

588
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:12,236
Sometimes it is as easy as just starting with, how are you?

589
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:16,946
But then sometimes you'll do that and what you'll actually get is a status update like,

590
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:18,988
oh, you know, I'm fine. I'm ahead of schedule on this thing.

591
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:20,069
I'm worried about this other thing.

592
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:21,930
I was talking to this guy about how we're going to do this other thing.

593
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,693
And that's totally fine. You can be a good listener.

594
00:35:24,713 --> 00:35:27,355
You can sit through that. You can absorb it.

595
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:31,358
And then when the person is done talking, you just smile and say, that sounds great.

596
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:32,259
How are you?

597
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:40,545
In my experience, from cases I've seen from managers I've had in those I've worked with.

598
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,344
This is one of the big things that separates passable managers from ones where I felt like

599
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:46,144
they were really great.

600
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:51,429
I think it's really tempting as a manager, and especially a new manager, to keep your

601
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:56,433
interactions with your reports entirely in kind of a work frame, and to defend it as

602
00:35:56,473 --> 00:35:59,175
like, well, my job isn't to be their best friend.

603
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:02,738
My job is just to get the best results out of them that we can.

604
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,763
But if you keep all of your conversations to these work-related frames, you'll never

605
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,064
really get to know them as people.

606
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,621
And I don't know how you can possibly expect to manage someone well if you don't really know him.

607
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:23,104
I think at some level the obvious reason why people don't employ this frame more often,

608
00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:28,266
or it's so easy to kind of conveniently avoid it and slip into those other kind of near-enemy frames,

609
00:36:28,346 --> 00:36:32,887
is that caring about people is scary because it's intimate and it means being vulnerable.

610
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,869
But strong working relationships are personal relationships, right?

611
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,470
And personal relationships do involve.

612
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:40,819
caring for one another.

613
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:43,361
So you have to carve out that time and make it a habit.

614
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:52,229
All right, well those were the three archetypes

615
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:52,970
I wanted to talk about.

616
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,591
Hopefully some of those scenarios were interesting

617
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,653
or thought provoking or gave you some new way

618
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:57,914
to see a familiar situation.

619
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:00,377
Like I said in the beginning,

620
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:02,038
I think so much of this work is just starting

621
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:03,620
to develop that sensitivity,

622
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,261
you know, the kind of like spidey sense

623
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:06,222
to know what to look for.

624
00:37:06,777 --> 00:37:10,018
So when you find yourself sitting in a meeting or in a conversation,

625
00:37:11,118 --> 00:37:12,619
suddenly the thought will kind of pop up like,

626
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,839
hey, this is one of those times.

627
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,920
And when you have that thought pop up, it's great,

628
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,300
because it gives you an opportunity.

629
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,461
You have the ability to suddenly make a conscious choice about how you respond.

630
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:26,742
Towards the beginning of this talk, I said framing is a tool,

631
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:28,122
and it takes two things.

632
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:29,603
It takes skill and it takes wisdom.

633
00:37:29,643 --> 00:37:32,603
So I just spent the last 40 minutes talking about the skill.

634
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:35,424
Now I'd like to talk a little bit about the wisdom side of things.

635
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:44,056
Because it's one thing to analyze this stuff technically, but I find that viscerally people still respond to it negatively.

636
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:48,178
You know, like maybe you were listening and in your head you were thinking like,

637
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:50,579
oh my God, like this guy over-analyzes like crazy.

638
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,442
If you did, you should know you're not the first person to levy that accusation against me.

639
00:37:58,363 --> 00:38:00,284
And there's still that question of Dale and Eugene.

640
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:02,565
You know, I kind of like spent some time up front trying to convince you,

641
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:03,866
hey, there are a bunch of Dales out there.

642
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:07,283
who are using this knowledge nobly, who are trying to do good with it.

643
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:11,904
But I think all of us really know a number of people who

644
00:38:11,944 --> 00:38:15,265
are like that who don't. And I think that's reflected in

645
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:18,726
the basic vocabulary we have in the English language when we talk about this

646
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:20,387
stuff, this stuff like manipulative,

647
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:27,289
or scheming, or calculated. We want to believe that it's enough

648
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:31,150
just to have good intentions, that this kind of analysis is unnecessary, is

649
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,570
overthinking, and in doing so

650
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:36,996
We implicitly assume that those who do do this must be malicious,

651
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,798
must have some kind of ulterior motive.

652
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:46,347
I believe that the opposite is true. I believe that this practice is a noble one.

653
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:50,732
I believe that it is not just okay. I believe that it is vital

654
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:53,215
and that doing it deeply enriches our lives.

655
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:05,336
This is the wood shop that I grew up with as a kid.

656
00:39:07,717 --> 00:39:09,558
Both of my parents are skilled woodworkers

657
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:11,379
and it was my mother's profession for a long time.

658
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,700
So I had this shop in my basement when I was growing up.

659
00:39:15,861 --> 00:39:17,162
As soon as they thought I was old enough,

660
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,843
my parents taught me how to use all the tools safely,

661
00:39:19,903 --> 00:39:22,164
what precautions to take, how they worked, what they did.

662
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,626
My mother's work was folk art,

663
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,487
which was a business that left her plenty of free time

664
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:29,148
to spend with us kids for a good part of the year.

665
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:31,486
The price was that in the months approaching Christmas,

666
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:33,067
she was basically living down there

667
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:34,288
and working every waking moment.

668
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:37,750
During those busy times, she'd pay us to help.

669
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:40,351
Most of her work was with standard

670
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:41,732
three-quarter inch thick pine stock

671
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:42,933
and it always needed sanding.

672
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:44,634
And I was a precocious negotiator,

673
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,055
so I talked her up to like a nickel

674
00:39:46,095 --> 00:39:49,257
or maybe even a dime a piece to sand her work,

675
00:39:49,357 --> 00:39:50,877
front, back, and any of the flat edges

676
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,338
on that belt sander that you can see

677
00:39:52,378 --> 00:39:53,339
to the left of the photo.

678
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,001
When the work was there, I could make like 10 bucks an hour

679
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:59,202
sanding that stuff, which at that age was a ton of money.

680
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:02,250
I got so good with it, I was super fast at it.

681
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,793
And I learned every detail, I learned every nuance of that belt sander.

682
00:40:06,594 --> 00:40:09,697
Sometimes the belt starts to slide off one side or the other, you have to adjust the

683
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:11,358
front roller just right to keep it centered.

684
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:16,223
And when you're using it, the belt will fill up with wood dust and there's this stick of

685
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:20,426
dense black gum, like the world's largest pencil eraser, that you press against the

686
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:20,707
belt.

687
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:25,471
You kind of watch it strips off the caked up pine dust and reveals the deep red sanding

688
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:26,152
belt underneath.

689
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:31,404
I started with the belt sander because it was one of the safer tools, but in time I

690
00:40:31,444 --> 00:40:31,945
learned them all.

691
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:34,888
We had a shop smith, which you can see at the left.

692
00:40:34,928 --> 00:40:38,212
It's a big motor, it slides along these metal rails and they make all these attachments

693
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:38,532
for it.

694
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:43,678
A bandsaw, a lathe, a drill press, a jigsaw, basically any wood tool you can imagine you

695
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:45,080
can get as a shop smith attachment.

696
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:48,323
And they last forever, which is why the company is now out of business.

697
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:54,896
So I learned them one by one, you know, I'd draw little snaking lines on wood with pencil

698
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:56,956
and practice tracing them on the bandsaw.

699
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:01,237
I'd learn how to hold a chisel against a wood blank when it was turning in the lathe, you

700
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:04,238
know, learning the right motor speed for each tool, learning how to care for them, how to

701
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:05,078
fix them when they broke.

702
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:09,159
And along the way I learned to really respect the tools and their power.

703
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,120
I still remember the sound the bandsaw made when you turned it on.

704
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,921
You flip the switch on the motor, it's this really loud metal clack, and then this kind

705
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,722
of whining, pitching noise as the saw blade spins up.

706
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:23,908
No matter how many times I used it, at that noise,

707
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:26,749
I always felt the slightest twinge of fear when it started.

708
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,730
But it was good because it kept me alert

709
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,911
and made sure I was paying attention.

710
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:33,933
Along the way, I also learned great respect

711
00:41:33,973 --> 00:41:35,634
and even love for the wood itself.

712
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,456
Just six months ago, I made these tables

713
00:41:38,516 --> 00:41:40,637
out of black walnut in my backyard in Seattle.

714
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:44,039
I spent probably 100 or 200 hours surfacing

715
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,080
and finishing the wood, and almost all of that time

716
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,522
was between me and a simple block plane

717
00:41:48,982 --> 00:41:50,223
or hand sander in the wood.

718
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:55,062
I made a few initial cuts with a table saw, but other than that I did everything with hand tools.

719
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:59,986
I got to know every subtle curve in the surface of each table.

720
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:04,329
Each plank was different with a unique beauty in the grain and edge.

721
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,973
And I look back on those hours as a collaboration between the wood and me,

722
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:12,576
working together to bring out the potential in that grain and to make something beautiful.

723
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:17,720
It takes craft to make art.

724
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:22,654
It takes skill with any medium and any tool set to make something beautiful.

725
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:25,955
And communication is a craft just like any other in every way,

726
00:42:27,155 --> 00:42:27,815
except for one.

727
00:42:30,775 --> 00:42:34,876
In craft and in art, we are accustomed to being the craftspeople and the artists.

728
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:38,117
But in human relationships, we are also the medium.

729
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,597
We shape each other.

730
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:42,417
We work on each other.

731
00:42:43,618 --> 00:42:45,498
We can help to smooth off each other's rough edges.

732
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:48,458
And with great skill and enough care, we can refine one another.

733
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:52,227
We can help to bring out the beauty and potential that exists within each of us.

734
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:56,551
But through misuse we can and we all do harm one another.

735
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:59,654
And so when we meet someone who uses these tools consciously,

736
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:03,518
our reaction is suspicion, is apprehension.

737
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:09,984
And this is as it should be. Fear is a normal reaction to a situation that could cause us harm.

738
00:43:11,585 --> 00:43:12,766
The fear is not the problem.

739
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,469
The problem is when we let that fear stop us.

740
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:21,259
The proper response to fear is gratitude, is appreciation.

741
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,001
Appreciation that it's there to warn you about danger. Appreciation that it's keeping you alert.

742
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:33,922
And then after that, the proper response is to continue to act just with extraordinary care.

743
00:43:35,723 --> 00:43:39,523
A life lived in the shadow of fear is one where we misunderstand what the fear is telling us.

744
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:45,694
With communication, we misunderstand when we think the fear is telling us that the tools themselves are evil,

745
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:48,056
or the people who use them are villainous.

746
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:49,656
It is not.

747
00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:52,918
It is simply letting us know that we need to be careful.

748
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:00,302
The skill of communication,

749
00:44:01,463 --> 00:44:03,904
and the knowledge that comes from analyzing human interactions,

750
00:44:03,944 --> 00:44:06,285
these things are tools that we can use to do great things.

751
00:44:07,426 --> 00:44:09,647
If we let our fear dissuade us from using them at all.

752
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:11,596
we forfeit the chance to do that good.

753
00:44:13,437 --> 00:44:17,341
Okay, you ask, but what about those people we all know who do use these tools to do harm?

754
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:21,204
Who use them for their own personal material gain at the expense of others?

755
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:26,449
I think it's easy to feel anger and contempt for these people, and when we have to work

756
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:28,931
directly with them we can feel threatened, we can feel upset.

757
00:44:30,192 --> 00:44:32,234
But perhaps we should instead feel compassion.

758
00:44:34,816 --> 00:44:35,797
When we learn a craft,

759
00:44:36,945 --> 00:44:40,928
Every moment of that learning is an opportunity to open our eyes to great beauty.

760
00:44:41,488 --> 00:44:43,490
When I was a child and I didn't know anything about woodworking,

761
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,472
I'd look at a piece of furniture, all I would see was the utility.

762
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,333
This one's for holding books, that one's for holding clothes.

763
00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:53,076
Practicing woodworking opened my eyes.

764
00:44:53,176 --> 00:44:57,719
Now I look at furniture and I see the utility but also the care and the craftsmanship.

765
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,061
The beauty of the wood itself and even like a little camaraderie for the person who made it,

766
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:04,103
knowing, oh, this section must have been really difficult.

767
00:45:04,712 --> 00:45:07,373
or being able to admire the quality of a specific joint.

768
00:45:08,574 --> 00:45:11,475
That appreciation, that ability to encounter something

769
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:14,697
and see not just the outer surface of the thing, but also the time

770
00:45:15,117 --> 00:45:17,838
and care and love that it's made of. That

771
00:45:18,158 --> 00:45:21,279
is our sensitivity to all of the beauty and joy and love in the world.

772
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:27,542
There is one catch. Our practice will teach us nothing

773
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:30,544
unless we bring our attention to those moments. We have to be willing to see.

774
00:45:31,124 --> 00:45:34,445
We have to let the experience change us. If we practice carelessly...

775
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:36,383
then our eyes remain closed.

776
00:45:36,663 --> 00:45:41,187
And so while it's frustrating to see a skilled communicator who uses his words to harm or

777
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:47,411
climb ladders to earn a bonus at someone else's expense, when my mind is open I look at a

778
00:45:47,451 --> 00:45:48,752
person like that and it breaks my heart.

779
00:45:51,454 --> 00:45:55,737
To have such skill with words, he must have practiced for so long.

780
00:45:57,078 --> 00:46:02,743
And the whole time he had such opportunity to see the beauty in other people, to see

781
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:03,643
the beauty in himself.

782
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:06,894
and the joy in relationships, but he didn't.

783
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:10,958
You can't explain those things to someone who doesn't see them.

784
00:46:10,998 --> 00:46:13,601
It's like trying to explain color to someone who's been blind from birth.

785
00:46:15,863 --> 00:46:17,104
So he doesn't even know what he's missing.

786
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:20,307
He thinks the goal is acquisition.

787
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,631
Tries to fill his life with material wealth because that's all he knows.

788
00:46:31,143 --> 00:46:36,024
If you find yourself working with someone like this, I might humbly suggest a little meditation to develop compassion for him.

789
00:46:36,064 --> 00:46:42,526
And it goes like this, when we do not know happiness, and we try to fill its void with pleasure, we suffer.

790
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:54,810
Okay, so if communication and the study of human interaction is a craft that opens our eyes, what exactly does it open our eyes to?

791
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:59,071
Well, just like woodworking taught me deeply the nature of wood.

792
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,615
Communication deeply teaches us the true nature of people.

793
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:05,597
And the more we know something, the more genuinely we're able to love it.

794
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:13,643
At the end of the day, I think some of our aversion to this analysis is subconsciously part of us doesn't want to see our true nature.

795
00:47:14,203 --> 00:47:16,785
We don't like the idea that we can be manipulated.

796
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:19,687
That someone else can trick us with a simple wording of a question.

797
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:24,811
We want to believe that our preferences are rational and well considered,

798
00:47:25,491 --> 00:47:27,072
and that our behavior is governed by reason.

799
00:47:29,794 --> 00:47:30,934
But these things are not true.

800
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:35,276
And believing them does us no more good than it would a woodworker to pretend that wood

801
00:47:35,296 --> 00:47:37,376
does not burn or cannot be broken.

802
00:47:40,377 --> 00:47:43,798
We are creatures, you and I, and these are our vulnerabilities.

803
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:50,700
We are afraid of vulnerability, but it is the truth of our nature, and only by acknowledging

804
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,361
it can we truly love one another.

805
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:57,522
The more we practice, the more we start to see just how much of our interaction with

806
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:58,202
each other every day

807
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:03,466
Are these ways of staying safe, you know, they're nothing but boilerplate, habit, neurosis,

808
00:48:04,187 --> 00:48:08,270
polite strategies for saying the right things but keeping our distance.

809
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,171
We greet one another and we converse.

810
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:13,893
But if we aren't really present, it's like our words are just kind of read off a script.

811
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:19,597
The power of this work is that seeing gives us a choice.

812
00:48:19,638 --> 00:48:21,779
We can choose not to give the boilerplate response.

813
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:23,560
We can choose to respond with sincerity.

814
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:25,382
We can choose connection.

815
00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:28,952
And that's why I believe so strongly in the value of this work.

816
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:32,577
I hope something I've said this afternoon has been helpful to you.

817
00:48:32,717 --> 00:48:33,578
Thank you very much for coming.
