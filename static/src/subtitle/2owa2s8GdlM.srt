00:00:07,183 --> 00:00:08,685
Hello, I'm Scaff Elias.

2
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:14,569
I work at a company called Three Donkeys with Richard

3
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:15,009
Garfield.

4
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:17,110
You've probably heard of him and not me.

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,193
And I worked at Wizards of the Coast for a long time, for

6
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:21,914
many, many years.

7
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:25,616
About 10 years ago, we started this consulting business and

8
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:29,919
just sort of go around and help people with their games.

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,761
I was supposed to ask everyone to silence their cell phones.

10
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:34,763
Thanks.

11
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:38,763
Yeah, the one piece of advice the assistant gave me

12
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:39,823
was to not choke.

13
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:43,745
So I will attempt to not do that.

14
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:46,906
As recently as 24 hours ago, I thought

15
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:49,467
this was a 60-minute talk due primarily

16
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,487
to a lack of intelligence.

17
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:54,529
And so good luck, as the audience.

18
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:56,930
You're going to have to do your best Calvin Johnson

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,471
impersonations and catch what I am throwing.

20
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:02,096
So, luck and skill in games.

21
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:06,977
The talk's primarily about how luck and skill interact with each other.

22
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:08,318
And why do we care?

23
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:12,759
We care because a lot of times you'll hear complaints, there's too much luck in a game,

24
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:18,701
there's too much skill in a game, and it matters a lot to your audience, and it matters more

25
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:22,902
and more to your audience as time goes on, the longer they associate themselves with

26
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:23,242
your game.

27
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:28,745
Virtually every definition of game that you'll find

28
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:32,266
will state that some amount of indeterminacy is required.

29
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:37,007
And those definitions that don't state it explicitly imply it.

30
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:41,348
It is a necessary part of what it means to be a game.

31
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:46,270
And what creates indeterminacy, well, randomness does.

32
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:54,629
So we get to luck and skill, and we try to start defining these.

33
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:56,950
And we find that, first of all, they're

34
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,070
very difficult to define.

35
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,771
Colloquially, we have some understanding of these.

36
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,512
When we try to nail down very strict definitions,

37
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:07,632
it can often turn out that they lead

38
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:08,852
to counterintuitive results.

39
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:11,213
And I think that's a problem.

40
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:15,010
Exactly how to define it, we're not

41
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,091
going to be too careful with.

42
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,253
But how they interact with each other

43
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,635
is sort of what we'll be talking about.

44
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:24,457
So overt randomness in games.

45
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:26,499
This is actually easy to see.

46
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,520
It's easy to define.

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,440
It happens a lot.

48
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:31,743
You can have dice, cards, random number generators.

49
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,685
And that's clearly going to add a degree of randomness

50
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:35,106
to your game.

51
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,584
Some things that may be less clear

52
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:42,107
are game-theoretic randomness that

53
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:49,553
comes from, say, simultaneous decisions, other players,

54
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:50,334
politics.

55
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:53,276
There's a lot of other ways besides sort

56
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:54,437
of overt randomness.

57
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,961
And then, of course, there's physical and mental

58
00:02:58,981 --> 00:02:59,522
limitations.

59
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:01,483
Your memory.

60
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,793
Your accuracy, throwing darts at a dartboard,

61
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:08,035
that's clearly random.

62
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:10,818
Again, it's not completely random,

63
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,541
but for all practical purposes, it's

64
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:16,805
random within a certain set of parameters.

65
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:19,408
Your speed, your strength, these are the sorts of things

66
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:21,510
that create randomness in games.

67
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:30,704
way to have randomness in a game is maybe you have a simple choice between two doors.

68
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:33,744
Door A leads to victory and door B leads to success.

69
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,465
Or, sorry, failure.

70
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,546
And so it's pretty clear, right?

71
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,886
The ogre's behind one door and the treasure's behind the other.

72
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:43,747
It's completely random.

73
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:49,788
But what if you had some information about the doors that maybe you don't even see at

74
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,008
first?

75
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:56,630
There's a very complex way that you could have figured out what was behind door A.

76
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,500
one door and what was behind the other.

77
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,681
And this choice that was random to you,

78
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,462
if you decide that you can't figure out these equations,

79
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:07,483
is it really random?

80
00:04:07,524 --> 00:04:08,784
Is it really randomness in the game?

81
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:09,865
Or is it a matter of skill?

82
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:12,626
So oftentimes, when you ask people

83
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,547
to name a game that has no luck in it,

84
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:19,330
chess is the first thing that pops up.

85
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,691
Because there's no overt elements.

86
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,532
There's no hidden decisions.

87
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:28,195
And so it seems, it feels like, this

88
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:32,437
should be a game where it's a game of pure skill.

89
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:37,220
My business partner Richard has often said, oh, maybe one day

90
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,941
he'll play Garry Kasparov at chess.

91
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:42,623
And to sort of prove that there's randomness in chess,

92
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,023
he'll just play randomly.

93
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:49,337
and win. And it's clear that he can do this.

94
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,438
Garry Kasparov has not won every chess game he's ever played

95
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:56,379
and as long as there is some set of moves

96
00:04:57,059 --> 00:05:00,340
that will lead to victory against him,

97
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,020
Richard can stumble upon it. Unfortunately,

98
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,321
his chances are better winning the New York State Lottery 15 times in a row.

99
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:11,342
So he shouldn't go betting a lot of money on

100
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:14,446
playing against Gary.

101
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:18,392
But the point is that there is randomness in this game,

102
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:24,821
unless, of course, Gary has the entire move tree memorized

103
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:27,105
in his head, and he has a response regardless

104
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,246
of what that random move is.

105
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:35,489
It feels for a game like chess that it should be pure skill.

106
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,454
And sometimes we forget that chess

107
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:42,797
is quantitatively different than tic-tac-toe.

108
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:44,258
It's not qualitatively different.

109
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,303
And tic-tac-toe is a game where you can observe people playing.

110
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:51,126
And it's very similar to the situation of the Concealed

111
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:52,347
Doors, where

112
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,312
You and I may not experience randomness when we play it,

113
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:58,512
but children do.

114
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,734
And it's very interesting.

115
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:05,596
There's been some reports done on this,

116
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,697
of watching children play.

117
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:10,179
And you can find that the results are mapped very

118
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:10,739
similarly.

119
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:15,007
in character to the results of chess players playing

120
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:17,290
against each other, where you'll have a set of people where it's

121
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,371
virtually purely random.

122
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,492
Some people are better.

123
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:21,895
They're able to see a little bit in the decision tree,

124
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,056
so they're making less mistakes.

125
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:26,720
And then some people have the game essentially solved.

126
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:31,105
We're probably too far behind that, but the past.

127
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:34,687
our memory of tic-tac-toe to remember when it seemed random,

128
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,449
when it seemed difficult. And we had to make a guess when we

129
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,130
didn't for sure know what the next best move was.

130
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:44,593
So the point to this is that the amount of luck in a game

131
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,975
is not a function of the game itself.

132
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,076
It's a function of the game and the player.

133
00:06:51,097 --> 00:06:54,079
And that's something that's very important to understand.

134
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,581
Let's take another pure skill game, like chess.

135
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,671
It's not the most fun game, but it's still a game.

136
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:06,472
And you've got 30 seconds to compute the 50,347,200th digit

137
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:06,972
of pi.

138
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,393
Does anyone want to play?

139
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,606
And you take a guess.

140
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:21,868
It's obvious to us.

141
00:07:21,948 --> 00:07:25,252
It may not be so obvious if we look at a game like chess,

142
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:26,914
that there is randomness in it.

143
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:31,520
But it is obvious that in this game, there is randomness in it

144
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:35,044
because this is impossible to compute in the amount of time.

145
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:37,167
However.

146
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:40,850
Again, without changing the character of the game,

147
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:44,292
we can say, what's the fourth digit of pi?

148
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:46,333
And now when we're playing this game,

149
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,475
this is inside the scope of the human mind

150
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:52,236
and with a little simple memorization.

151
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:54,577
Now all of a sudden, this game that was purely random

152
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,458
has no more randomness associated with it.

153
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,560
The point about this game is that.

154
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,639
It's not just about the game and not just about the players,

155
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,520
but it actually changes over time.

156
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:10,063
Even if you sort of understood the complexity

157
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,984
of the human brain to a much higher degree

158
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,565
than we'll ever understand, and even

159
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:17,247
if you understood exactly the calculations required

160
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,208
to play the previous game.

161
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:24,590
If when you play the fourth digit of pi game in 2000 BC,

162
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,611
it's purely random.

163
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:28,352
It's no different than when those people are guessing

164
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:30,033
the 50 millionth digit of pi.

165
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,613
And when you play it around 250 BC,

166
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:34,975
it all of a sudden becomes an incredibly skill testing game.

167
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:38,877
Archimedes around this time starts figuring out within,

168
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,178
his guess would be between three different digits.

169
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:44,699
And now, in 2000 AD.

170
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:52,726
or 2013, there's, again, no randomness left in the game.

171
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:57,228
And there's a very little bit of skill, but there is some.

172
00:08:57,989 --> 00:08:59,710
And the interesting thing here is

173
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,911
that you can't determine by looking at the game,

174
00:09:02,972 --> 00:09:05,253
or even the capabilities of the players,

175
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:07,154
you can't determine how much randomness

176
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:07,775
there is in the game.

177
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,616
It's something that varies over time.

178
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:15,397
So we think we have an idea of what these pure luck

179
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:16,178
things mean in a game.

180
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,078
But what does it mean to have skill at a game?

181
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:22,359
Well, the dictionary definitions of skill

182
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:23,859
are the ability to do something well.

183
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,160
Another way to say it is it's an intrinsic ability

184
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,101
to achieve a differential outcome in a game.

185
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:35,102
And note that all of these things, with the word well,

186
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:36,082
or, um,

187
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,622
trying to achieve one outcome over another,

188
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,406
hinge on the fact that skill is essentially a comparison.

189
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:44,909
And so the measurements of skill that we have,

190
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,691
like an ELO rating system or whatever,

191
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:49,414
are always comparisons.

192
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:51,857
That's the best way to get at what it means

193
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:52,678
to have skill in a game.

194
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,701
When you ask people,

195
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:59,956
Is this game more skill testing than another game?

196
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:01,797
Does game A have more skill than game B?

197
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:03,097
How do we measure that?

198
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,378
Is there a simple way that we can do that?

199
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:10,439
Well, when you ask, say, students in a class

200
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:13,379
or sit around and have a discussion about it,

201
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,620
some of the things that pop up are, what's

202
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,800
your maximum win percentage?

203
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:23,421
There's an intuitive thought for people that.

204
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:29,977
If a game is very skill testing, the best player,

205
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:32,178
a pro at that, should essentially always beat

206
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:33,239
the worst player at the game.

207
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,180
It's pretty clear if the best player in the world

208
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,801
has a 50% win chance against the worst player in the world,

209
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,862
let's say the game is cutting for high card,

210
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,983
there's no skill in the game.

211
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:48,265
And the higher that number goes, in some sense,

212
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:49,705
there is more skill in the game.

213
00:10:50,765 --> 00:11:10,952
Another common way of defining how much skill there is in a game, and this is actually a very interesting and effective one because it leads to, say, social structures that might develop around the game or the metagame of the game, is how many different buckets can you put people into where bucket two has a 75% chance of beating the bucket from people one?

214
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:12,692
How long is that chain?

215
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:17,130
The longer that is, I think almost everybody would say

216
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,172
there's more skill in that game.

217
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,295
The ELO rating, which I think probably most people are

218
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:23,977
familiar with, it's the chess rating system.

219
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,158
Lots of video games use it.

220
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:26,579
It's been altered over time.

221
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,103
Actually can reconstruct, if the assumptions that ELO made

222
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:36,048
are true, can reconstruct that level of the chains of skill.

223
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:40,191
And what it does is it sort of assumes a random performance

224
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:40,852
on people's part.

225
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,704
And actually, he's pretty good at modeling

226
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,585
a lot of different games.

227
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:47,888
But the complete set of information

228
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:51,411
is actually a much, much, much more complicated thing.

229
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:55,254
If you really want to know how much skill there is a game,

230
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,616
you would need to know the true expected win

231
00:11:57,656 --> 00:12:01,199
percentage of every single player versus every other

232
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,120
player over time.

233
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,042
This is not something you're going to be able to get.

234
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:06,343
This is virtually impossible.

235
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:09,366
And how the curves of player performance change

236
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,929
is actually very interesting, because it is not

237
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:16,191
easy to a simple linear parameterization

238
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:17,432
of the level of skill of people.

239
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:21,255
So you have to choose what you're

240
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:22,577
going to measure, because you're only going

241
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:23,557
to be able to take a slice.

242
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:24,818
And you have to choose wisely.

243
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:30,425
Let's take, for example, this game we'll call rando chess.

244
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:33,228
We like to use sample games because sometimes it actually

245
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:35,049
gets to the heart of the matter more than, say,

246
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:36,511
a real game does.

247
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:39,293
So you play a normal game of chess,

248
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,614
and then afterward you roll a die.

249
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:44,678
And then on a one, whoever lost the game,

250
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,241
they are declared the winner.

251
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:55,389
Well, rando chess clearly has more luck than chess does.

252
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,550
But does it have less skill?

253
00:12:57,891 --> 00:13:00,452
When you think about it, any sort

254
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:02,913
of these reasonable definitions of skill

255
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:04,774
that you had beforehand in your intuition

256
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,616
are that really, actually, it doesn't have any less skill.

257
00:13:07,956 --> 00:13:08,816
And what do I mean by that?

258
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:11,277
All of your previous skills are still useful.

259
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:15,800
Your player ranking of every single player in the world

260
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,000
has not changed at all.

261
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:21,985
you still have the same world champion.

262
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,607
You still have all of the chess books.

263
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:24,968
You still have all the opening moves.

264
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:27,170
You still have every little bit of effort

265
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,812
and every little bit of skill that you

266
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:30,553
would want to acquire to win chess.

267
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:34,157
That's all still existing in the game of rando chess.

268
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,923
And the point to that is that this skill versus luck

269
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,005
is actually a false dichotomy.

270
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:46,927
Really, you should think of it more as a graph where

271
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,628
you have a certain amount of skill in games

272
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,029
and a certain amount of luck in games.

273
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,812
And games can be sort of placed anywhere on that.

274
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:04,617
Go has a lot of skill, as does poker.

275
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:05,978
But poker has more luck.

276
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:11,179
So what did change in Rando Chess?

277
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,340
The game clearly changed.

278
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,661
Skill, by a reasonable definition of it, didn't change.

279
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:19,342
But what did change was, as luck went up,

280
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:21,343
skill became harder to measure.

281
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,284
In order to achieve that same ranking,

282
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:27,625
you would actually need more trials than before.

283
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:31,507
Another way to say that your skills is harder to measure

284
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:34,288
is that you get less payoff in terms of your victories

285
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:35,288
for the same amount of skill.

286
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:45,771
So when you add luck to a game and you make skill harder

287
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:47,372
to measure, what's happened?

288
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:48,013
Is that bad?

289
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:53,476
It may very well be bad, because maybe your players

290
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:56,678
expect a very high payoff for the amount of skill

291
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:57,779
that they've acquired at the game.

292
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:00,080
They have, after all, put a lot of effort into it.

293
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:05,244
And key to understanding this is understanding

294
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:08,326
what the value proposition of your game is for your players.

295
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:14,174
For instance, if you're playing a competitive game

296
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:17,019
and there's some payoff or skill.

297
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,837
As those players continue to play that game or that genre

298
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:25,658
of games over time, and they put more and more time and effort

299
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:27,939
into mastering that game, they may very well

300
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,659
expect a higher and higher payoff for their skill.

301
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,220
And that's how you get things like fighting games becoming

302
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,821
more and more skill testing over time.

303
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:39,521
If you're a dedicated customer of these sorts of things,

304
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:43,822
again, for a competitive game, where inherently in the setup

305
00:15:43,982 --> 00:15:46,943
it's you versus the other person on an emotional level

306
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:47,603
as well as.

307
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:49,744
sort of a rules level.

308
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:55,109
It's not unlikely that you're going to be very upset

309
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,690
when your payoff for skill gets lowered.

310
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,194
So, should we remove all indeterminacy from games?

311
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,398
When you do that, you can run into trouble

312
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:09,239
if you make your game too skill testing.

313
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,020
You can play the game, who's taller?

314
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:15,104
And then when you do that, it's no longer a game

315
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:16,825
because you've removed the indeterminacy.

316
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:18,989
Really, it's more of a measurement.

317
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,710
And measurements are fun to play at most once.

318
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:28,193
When you look at games.

319
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:31,278
on our luck versus skill graph, you

320
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:33,520
can see things like a foot race.

321
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:36,142
There's really not that much randomness in a foot race.

322
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:39,225
People's times do vary, but they vary

323
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,586
by a relatively small amount.

324
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:43,628
And that's why, back to the measurement thing,

325
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:45,410
how many times is it fun to take a measurement,

326
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,973
you'll see grade school children will play foot race.

327
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:53,576
And they'll play it once or maybe twice.

328
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:56,339
And there's not a lot of people in high school or.

329
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:02,596
post-college or elderly people playing the game foot race.

330
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:04,578
And there's a strong reason for that.

331
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:07,461
And that's because it's not that fun to play time

332
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:08,442
after time after time.

333
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:11,144
Whereas you can have games that have more skill associated

334
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:11,465
with them.

335
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:14,348
And again, by more skill, you can

336
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:16,630
take a sort of empirical measurement

337
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,313
of the amount of training that people do to become

338
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:20,294
world-class sprinters.

339
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,955
as compared to world-class soccer players,

340
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,997
and see that it's less in order to achieve

341
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:29,098
the top of the profession.

342
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,180
But there's a lot more luck in these sorts of things.

343
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,722
And you can look at this chart and say, oh, I kind of

344
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:40,384
understand intuitively that I may not

345
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:43,426
want to reduce my indeterminacy by too much.

346
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,481
I don't want to skip over this too quickly,

347
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:50,283
but there are other benefits of luck and randomness in games

348
00:17:51,023 --> 00:17:52,404
that we are not talking about.

349
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:55,305
There's a million benefits to randomness in games.

350
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:59,207
For instance, people are just enthralled

351
00:17:59,227 --> 00:18:00,388
by unexpected outcomes.

352
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,809
Specifically, though, since we're talking about the luck

353
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,931
and skill interaction, that's a subject for another talk.

354
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:16,596
So when you add luck to a game, because you've

355
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:20,298
looked at this chart and you see, oh, well, look,

356
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:21,179
golf's sitting there.

357
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,041
A lot of people play golf more than play foot race.

358
00:18:26,502 --> 00:18:28,883
And what are some of the benefits

359
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:29,824
of adding luck to a game?

360
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:34,006
Well, one of the benefits is that when you play

361
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:38,269
a game that has luck in it, we saw this a lot with Magic,

362
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:39,649
The Gathering.

363
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,111
People would tend to blame.

364
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:48,133
their success is on skill and they would blame their defeats

365
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,494
on luck. That's great. That's an amazing psychological crutch

366
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:53,956
for your players that makes people much happier playing the

367
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:59,338
game even though they're losing. Because there is an overt

368
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:03,300
randomness to it, it gives them something to very clearly fall

369
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,122
back on. The problem is over time, you sort of, the more and

370
00:19:08,142 --> 00:19:10,303
more experienced players are, the less and less this illusion

371
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:10,743
will hold up.

372
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,426
and they understand that it really is their fault.

373
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:17,549
But the great benefit of this is that early on in a player's

374
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:20,912
career, they may get ego boosts when they're first

375
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:21,912
starting to play the game.

376
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:27,016
Another benefit of adding luck to the game is the amount of

377
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:30,579
people that you can have fun with, that is to say, play an

378
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,759
indeterminate game, goes up.

379
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,723
In a game with really low luck, you can have

380
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:40,824
Most games be too hard or too easy,

381
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:42,005
and they're not fun to play.

382
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:43,806
Again, it's closer to a measurement.

383
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:46,869
It's a very difficult problem to solve today.

384
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:49,071
With the internet and computers and matching systems,

385
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:51,713
you can find that just right person

386
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:53,655
if your audience is big enough.

387
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:59,120
And the problem is that even after you

388
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,962
find that exact right person who you're

389
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,163
going to have a fun game against.

390
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,662
You might find the right person in terms of skill,

391
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,023
but are they the right person?

392
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:11,005
Are they the friend that you want to play with?

393
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:12,786
Maybe you want to play with your family.

394
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:14,247
You want to sit around a living room.

395
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,730
So this ability of matching the internet and computers

396
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,651
to solve this problem doesn't help.

397
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:23,554
If I want to play with Timmy and my game is so skill testing

398
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:27,477
that it's not fun to play, then I

399
00:20:27,497 --> 00:20:30,340
have to think that maybe I'm playing the wrong game.

400
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:36,469
As we mentioned before with the fighting games,

401
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,193
payoff for skill is something that players, especially

402
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:46,997
in games where reward for skill is extremely important,

403
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:51,019
say poker, over time they may expect to get

404
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,060
a higher and higher payoff.

405
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:55,142
But because luck can broaden audiences,

406
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:59,545
Phil is probably not so upset that.

407
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,073
poker has less payoff for the skill that he's put into it.

408
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:10,116
He would much rather be the prince of the set of all poker players, top 10 or 20,

409
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:14,819
than he would be the undisputed number one of an audience the size of, say, Go players.

410
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:24,953
The situation is a lot more complex than you can see from something like the ELOS system,

411
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:31,438
because a one-dimensional parameterization of the amount of skill that people have doesn't necessarily...

412
00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:36,924
really tell you what's going on. However, and you can actually

413
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,385
see that. There's some sample things here you can see. For

414
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:42,087
instance, there might be an element of luck in the game

415
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:46,609
that's only accessed if you have high skill. Maybe when you go

416
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,789
really, really far into the game, you're an amazing, amazing

417
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:51,471
player, then you're able to access this bonus level. Once

418
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:55,332
you hit that bonus level, there's a random, you know, 99%

419
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,454
of your score gets access to that bonus level. What that sort

420
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:02,035
of thing will do is if you add that to your game.

421
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:06,939
You have reduced, you've increased the luck between top

422
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,960
players playing against each other and you haven't changed

423
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,561
it at all for your lower level players and you haven't

424
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,783
changed it at all for when your higher level players play

425
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:16,224
against your lower level players.

426
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:18,885
Same sort of thing can also happen because

427
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:22,327
Some elements of randomness can only

428
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:25,829
be accessed by playing poorly, like maybe a Shell and Mario

429
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:26,730
card or something like that.

430
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,112
So how your skill curve of each person

431
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:32,553
and how they interact with each other,

432
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:34,534
and how much skill there is, and how much randomness there

433
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:36,775
is in their interactions is actually

434
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:38,396
a very complicated situation.

435
00:22:39,897 --> 00:22:40,877
We'll take this example.

436
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,799
Maybe you have a real-time strategy game.

437
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:51,000
you can have randomized prices or technologies in it.

438
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:57,165
Before randomization, maybe it's very clear

439
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:58,185
what the best strategy is.

440
00:22:58,226 --> 00:22:59,727
The best strategy is to build a tank.

441
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:01,388
And you have three different players.

442
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:05,251
And their ratings are, you have two excellent players.

443
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:07,393
The game is primarily based upon, say,

444
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:10,315
hand-eye coordination, tactical skill, that sort of thing.

445
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:12,457
Your strategic choices aren't really that important.

446
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,011
But then you play, and the prices

447
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,892
have become randomized between all these objects.

448
00:23:18,992 --> 00:23:21,593
So all of a sudden, maybe dragons

449
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:22,654
are a viable strategy now.

450
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:26,436
They were overpriced before, but now that's the way to go.

451
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:31,799
Well, you've clearly added skill to the game.

452
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:34,700
For the player to decide in the beginning

453
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,722
what the proper choice is is an area of skill and mastery.

454
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:43,938
So maybe player A can now beat player B more often.

455
00:23:43,978 --> 00:23:45,880
That 100 point rating differential between them

456
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,961
might expand.

457
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:50,224
The levels in your skill chain might actually go up.

458
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:55,448
At the same time, maybe the best skilled player in the world

459
00:23:55,989 --> 00:23:58,411
can only pick the right thing 90% of the time.

460
00:23:58,431 --> 00:23:58,691
And player C.

461
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:03,297
picks the right thing 10% of the time.

462
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,939
Well, if the strategic choices outweigh all of the hand-eye

463
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,161
coordination and all of the tactical skill

464
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:11,583
that you could develop at that game, guess what?

465
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,386
The win differential, the expected win differential

466
00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:17,927
between player A and player C will now go down,

467
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:21,430
even though it went up with player A versus player B.

468
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:26,053
So how do you use all this information?

469
00:24:26,574 --> 00:24:28,235
Since basically what you.

470
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:33,507
sort of, the more you look at it, the more you realize how complicated the situation is.

471
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:40,531
Well, I would start by saying you have to know who your audience is.

472
00:24:40,571 --> 00:24:42,512
You have to know what your intended audience is.

473
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:45,133
And what's your key value proposition to them?

474
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:49,415
Do they expect that it's a highly competitive game?

475
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:52,117
Do they expect a high reward payoff for their skill?

476
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:56,298
Is it going to be played around the family dinner table?

477
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:59,421
I mean, if it is, you better make sure

478
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:04,447
that you can have a highly indeterminate game among almost

479
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,788
any set of people that are there.

480
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:07,830
Is it going to be played over the internet?

481
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,111
Is it going to be played solo?

482
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:10,833
All of these things will tell you.

483
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:15,637
how much randomness you ideally would have in your game

484
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:19,659
in order to get a significantly consistent amount

485
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,282
of indeterminacy in each instance of that game.

486
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:27,084
Does your revenue model require replays?

487
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:29,526
This is a really important consideration.

488
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:32,948
Again, back to the foot race example.

489
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:35,509
If your revenue model says.

490
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:40,432
I want this person to come back and play again and again and

491
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:44,234
again and again. You want to stay as far away from that

492
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,916
measurement as possible unless perhaps you have a truly

493
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:51,578
enormous audience. So you know that you can always match that

494
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:55,279
person up perfectly against someone who is almost at exactly

495
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:58,281
their skill level. It's a very hard thing to do, but it is

496
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:02,382
possible. Another important consideration is do your IP and

497
00:26:02,442 --> 00:26:04,463
marketing match your skill and luck interaction?

498
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:12,536
Mario and the dragon from RTS sample game number seven

499
00:26:13,597 --> 00:26:16,339
are not the sorts of things which appeal

500
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:19,322
to the type of players that are going to want to play

501
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:23,145
a game like Go, which has an extremely, extremely,

502
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:27,888
extremely long skill chain, very high reward ratio

503
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:29,530
for the skill that you achieve at the game,

504
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,011
and it's extremely competitive.

505
00:26:33,684 --> 00:26:35,287
And sorry that the talk was so short.

506
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:36,488
I had to skip over some things.

507
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:41,536
Richard and Robert and I wrote a book, Characteristics of Games.

508
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:42,818
A lot of this stuff's in there if you

509
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:45,301
want to read more about it.

510
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:48,286
Any questions?
