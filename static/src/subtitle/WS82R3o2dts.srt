Hi, my name is Douglas Pennant and I am a developer and player of games.

2
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:11,382
I'm also colourblind, which can make some games difficult or impossible to play.

3
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:16,383
All games are unique and use colour in slightly different ways,

4
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:21,144
so each game will need an individual, personalised solution

5
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:23,845
to make the game accessible to colourblind players.

6
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:29,966
Recently, more and more developers have been striving to support colourblindness in their games.

7
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:35,420
But it can be very hard to solve a problem you cannot actually see.

8
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:44,026
And to make things worse, the feature itself may be completely invisible to your colourblind colleagues and players,

9
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:47,629
making this invisible problem even harder to solve.

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,934
At GDC this year, my aim is to educate as many developers as possible about the disability,

11
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:57,296
going into the science behind the condition.

12
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,453
looking into how it affects the different games and how it affects the playing experience,

13
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:08,578
and also covering some methods you can use to predict some of the problems and make your games

14
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:14,322
a lot more colourblind friendly. And yes, I will have lots and lots of pictures to help illustrate

15
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:20,226
all of this. If you would like to understand better how to make your games colourblind

16
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:26,070
accessible, please come and see my GDC talk, Solving an Invisible Problem, Designing for

17
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,371
Colourblindness in Games.

18
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:30,550
Thank you very much, and I'll see you in San Francisco.
