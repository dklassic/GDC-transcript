1
00:00:02,988 --> 00:00:09,073
Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to start exactly on time because this is a long talk

2
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:15,118
with a lot of slides and I'm going to be talking fast, so as Captain Kirk sometimes says, buckle

3
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:21,743
up. So I'm going to be talking about the subject of a geographer's guide to building game worlds.

4
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:26,367
A lot of people know me as the executive director of the International Game Developers Association,

5
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:26,908
or IGDA.

6
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,629
Actually, in my career in the game industry, I'm actually a geographer and cartographer

7
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,650
who's worked in the industry for over 20 years.

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,612
When I was at Microsoft for 13 years, I ran a team that I created called Geopolitical

9
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:39,292
Strategy.

10
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:43,893
My job for the company was to protect them against political and cultural risks.

11
00:00:44,374 --> 00:00:49,655
And in that process, I became a creative partner with Microsoft and with the game developers

12
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:53,797
to basically help them create worlds that are going to work in the different markets

13
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:54,937
in which you want to make money.

14
00:00:55,397 --> 00:00:59,839
Now, obviously, I'm looking more from a reactive side, and I've given talks before about this

15
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,620
topic that I call culturalization.

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,780
Mainly from the perspective of things that you should not do.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,382
But what I wanted to do in this talk was be more prescriptive and talk about things you should do.

18
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,562
So when you're thinking about making a world,

19
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:15,583
I'm going to kind of touch on very high-level things that you should be thinking about,

20
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:19,764
and especially introducing a couple of concepts that may or may not be new to you,

21
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:22,185
but they're concepts that we use in geography quite a bit.

22
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,381
One of the things I will preface this and say is that there's no way I can get to a great deal of depth in this,

23
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:31,582
because this is a massive subject, as you all know.

24
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:33,804
Building worlds is very complicated.

25
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:35,845
So this is going to be kind of an overview.

26
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:38,967
I will try and leave time for questions as well.

27
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:42,050
But like I said, I'm going to kind of touch on the high-level issues,

28
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,491
but undoubtedly there's a lot of details in here.

29
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:49,430
So, we're very familiar with a lot of game worlds.

30
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,951
How we define game world is sometimes up to a subjective interpretation, but there's a

31
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:59,152
lot of different things that we've been exposed to in the game industry over the years.

32
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:05,394
Amazing recreations of real world history, real world locations, amazing things that

33
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:10,395
you can build and create on the fly and basically lose your kids in this.

34
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:18,891
you know, really cool visualizations of worlds that don't necessarily have to have all the level of detail,

35
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:24,395
which we'll talk about here, but they're still effective for what the world needs to accomplish.

36
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:28,099
And of course, other worlds that are just completely otherworldly.

37
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:31,762
They are ones that don't exist, they exist in the imagination,

38
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:36,926
they exist in the science fiction universe or wherever, but they also are interesting to realize.

39
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,869
And of course, even a lot of casual games, something, this is a world.

40
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:47,632
I'm using that term in a general sense of the theater or the arena or milieu or whatever you want to call it

41
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:52,134
in which our games are created, in which the narrative takes place, in which the action takes place,

42
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:54,756
in which the player engages with your creative vision.

43
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:58,097
And so this is just as valid as the other slides that I've showed.

44
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,958
This is a world that has a certain logic to it.

45
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:08,998
And of course something like this, which is a pretty accurate representation of a Los Angeles-like city.

46
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:12,644
And so there's a lot of different things we can look at.

47
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:14,808
Now, going back to this map...

48
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:17,363
I'm sure all of us know what this is.

49
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:24,326
A lot of us, this is probably one of the first things we've ever been exposed to in terms of a created world

50
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:27,888
and a created universe, and something that felt incredibly real to us.

51
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,270
Now this is actually Tolkien's original drawing of Middle-earth that he did.

52
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,232
And if you look in a little more detail, and of course, I mean, a lot of us could probably draw this from memory that we've seen it so much,

53
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,774
whether you've read the books or you've watched the movies or whatever the case may be.

54
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:50,501
But there's a reality here that he has built, and of course it's not just the map alone that creates the reality of Middle-earth.

55
00:03:50,561 --> 00:04:00,429
It's also the narrative, it's the characters, it's the history, it's the lore, it's the language, it's all the other layers that Tolkien created to make this a very real-feeling kind of place.

56
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:06,921
And so, I will get back to this map a little bit later, but I know for myself, as a total geek,

57
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:13,367
and also someone who's very interested in maps, it was Tolkien's map that actually led me to pursue cartography as a career,

58
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:21,395
because I just love the fact that he made something completely unreal look completely real by using a method of cartography.

59
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:28,226
And of course there's a lot of other storytellers that have come along that have done their own versions.

60
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,508
A lot of fantasy worlds.

61
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:34,672
How many fantasy worlds when you open up the first book of the series there's a map?

62
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:41,298
Because it's like the writer is trying to show you that this is a realized version of my imagination.

63
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:44,901
I love this Google Maps version of Westeros. It's really cool.

64
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,263
You know, whatever it might be, there's all of these fictional realms that people have

65
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,785
created a lot in literature, in film, or wherever you want them to be.

66
00:04:53,805 --> 00:05:00,369
And I could go on for days and days with examples, but basically in a lot of these cases, the

67
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:04,432
realism that they're trying to create in the world that they're trying to build for you

68
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:08,875
to present their narrative, to present their story, is to give a sense of authenticity.

69
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,717
It's almost like when they're showing you the map in their book or whatever it might

70
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:15,159
be, it's almost as if they're saying, I was there.

71
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:21,081
I saw these things. I made this map. It's almost that's why one of the brilliance of

72
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:26,143
Tolkien's vision is that Tolkien's map. It's almost like it feels so real that he was there

73
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:32,365
He actually did the cartography because he went there and so to be able to convey that sense because as cartographers

74
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:36,707
That's exactly what we do. We have serving we have instruments that collect data

75
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:40,268
We have satellites to do imagery of all these different methods now that collect

76
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:43,553
the data and the cartographer compiles them into a map

77
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:46,618
that basically is a way to say, hey look, we know what's there

78
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,003
or the cartographer themselves would say I was there

79
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,428
although in these days it's not really the case anymore because so many things

80
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:54,831
are automated with cartography

81
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:59,158
And of course, being a geek of, you know, this is in Norway,

82
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,140
we also ascribe fictional place to real place as well,

83
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,541
because they become so ingrained in popular culture,

84
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,622
and the world that was realized on the screen

85
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:11,723
is also a world that has been somewhat realized on the ground.

86
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:15,365
Or like going to Tunisia and being there on Tatooine,

87
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:18,506
which I know Tunisian friends, they know it's Tunisia,

88
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,927
it's not Tatooine, stop calling us Tatooine.

89
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:26,589
But it's just such a real place because of what was constructed and the narrative that was built around it.

90
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,751
One of the things I really want to emphasize about worldbuilding, it is not about realism.

91
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,172
It's really about realization over realism.

92
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:42,095
Because I think a lot of times, when I've talked and worked with a lot of developers on many, many franchises over the past 20 years,

93
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:45,836
a lot of them tend to focus on the realism aspect, that worldbuilding...

94
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,197
equals detail. That's not the case at all.

95
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:53,158
Detail is a function of what serves the narrative later on, and we'll talk about

96
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:53,958
detail later,

97
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:57,999
but it's really about the notion of realization. What does the world need to

98
00:06:58,059 --> 00:06:58,860
be to serve

99
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,120
the narrative that you want to create and what the experience

100
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:03,221
you want to convey?

101
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:10,525
And so really it's a function of taking the narrative goals that you have, because generally speaking there is a narrative.

102
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,267
Even in a game, something like Angry Birds, there is a narrative in that game.

103
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:20,470
And, you know, maybe at first it really wasn't there, but you can kind of get some sense of it.

104
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,231
Even in like, you play something like Bejeweled Blitz.

105
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,733
It's not necessarily meant to be a narrative-driven game,

106
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:30,336
but there is a kind of underlying lore in that game,

107
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:33,098
like the different levels and the names of the levels and things like that.

108
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:36,060
And it kind of makes you wonder, what does this relate to?

109
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,741
It doesn't really matter because I'm going to go play again.

110
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:38,762
But, um...

111
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:44,697
So you take the narrative goals and you also take the goals of the experience, because these are distinct things.

112
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:48,560
So, for example, I'm not going to go into this topic because there's no time for it,

113
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:55,526
but a lot of VR right now, a lot of VR demonstrations that we've seen, to me, are experiences, they're not narratives.

114
00:07:55,827 --> 00:08:00,611
There are things where you have a certain feeling, a certain experience within that space,

115
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:06,576
but it's not really conveying a narrative, a plot, or some kind of, you know, we're getting there, we are getting there slowly.

116
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:12,959
But in a lot of games that we make, though, it is a combination of this notion of we have a narrative for the space,

117
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,861
and we have a space in which we want certain things to be experienced by the player.

118
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:22,244
Those things may not always relate to the core narrative. Sometimes they will, and sometimes they won't.

119
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:25,765
But ultimately, it kind of helps shape what does the world need to be,

120
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:29,967
what does it have to be realized in order for this world to work for your vision.

121
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,521
So there's a quick recipe for realizing worlds.

122
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:36,002
So we're going to talk in some detail about some of these.

123
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:39,103
So, and this is, I'm presenting this like a recipe.

124
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:41,624
So first you start with a suggestion of familiarity.

125
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:44,765
So, you know, going back to Tolkien's map as an example,

126
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,885
his map looks like it could be something real.

127
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:49,646
It's not completely fantastical like Dr. Seuss.

128
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:53,387
I mean, it looks like something that could be familiar to us

129
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:56,588
because we're used to seeing maps that are drawn like that,

130
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:58,389
or we're used to seeing mountain ranges like that.

131
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:05,951
We also take a hint of complex systems. So a lot of worlds, we know that our world is incredibly complex.

132
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:09,652
There are so many interrelated systems and complexity out there.

133
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:13,994
We cannot represent all of those in a game, but we kind of hint at those by different things.

134
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:17,195
There's all kinds of techniques that we do that, by artifacts that are in the environment,

135
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:21,076
by hints that are dropped in the narrative, by characters that show up,

136
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:25,897
and maybe the characters reveal a certain aspect of that world that the player had no idea existed.

137
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,831
We also have a dash of cultural evidence.

138
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:32,412
So oftentimes, because a lot of games do involve some kind of culture,

139
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:37,014
whether it actually involves people, whether it involves aliens or animals or whatever it might be,

140
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:40,815
there's a sense of culture that there's been an inhabitants,

141
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:43,476
there has been some kind of presence in this game.

142
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:46,978
It's not just an open biosphere of animals and plants.

143
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:50,379
There's something else there that kind of makes it evidence.

144
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:54,841
I mean, I think like the Halo games were, in my opinion, were very cool in this way

145
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:55,401
because they were...

146
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,646
the Forerunner artifacts that were strewn around the Halo ring

147
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:01,270
that kind of gave evidence that something had happened here

148
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:05,637
but we never really got to know, at least in the initial games, what was going on.

149
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,062
And we need a big chunk of logical consistency in the recipe.

150
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:14,406
And I will talk more specifically about, I'm going to talk more specifically about cultural

151
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:18,830
evidence, logical consistency, and the other one, which is a pinch of topology.

152
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,794
Topology means connectedness, and if you've heard the term topology, oftentimes we hear

153
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:30,039
in network topology, where network engineers talk about the connectedness of devices.

154
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:35,583
In geography, we use topology as a sense of connectedness of things, of attributes, of

155
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:36,144
places.

156
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:38,945
And again, I'll talk about that more.

157
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:40,825
Now cultural evidence.

158
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:44,907
So basically what this means is taking the minimum amount of content you need to convey

159
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:46,467
the presence of an in-game culture.

160
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:49,688
So this is really key to setting the context of the game.

161
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:53,229
So and I'll give an example in a minute.

162
00:10:54,669 --> 00:11:00,453
This requires logical consistency to be effective, and so you're going to need to know what that is.

163
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:01,633
We'll talk about that in a minute.

164
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:06,997
The highest risk to activity in game development today, in my opinion, doing this kind of work,

165
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,159
is this notion of building cultural evidence in a game.

166
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,041
So let me explain a little bit more.

167
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,413
Let's say for example, the writers, the narrative designers wrote the script.

168
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:20,718
So you've got the script, you know what the characters are going to do, you know what they're going to say.

169
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:27,225
You know the basic plot, maybe you know what vehicles are going to be needed, or weapons, or whatever it might be, artifacts, all that kind of stuff.

170
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:30,949
But then, you kind of let loose the designers and artists and say,

171
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:32,491
okay, make this world feel real.

172
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:38,636
Real make it feel realized make it feel like it actually exists in something, you know

173
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:44,981
That's not just you know, some line John's on paper lines John on paper without much detail in there

174
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,803
So we kind of backfill this notion of backfilling

175
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:52,367
So for example, like if you have like a middle medieval environment, you don't just have the buildings

176
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:57,151
You might have like stacks of hay. You might have some barrels. You might have some other stuff

177
00:11:57,171 --> 00:12:02,255
You might have some banners hanging from buildings and flags. You might have little animals running around

178
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:07,718
All of this kind of detail that fills in the world and kind of gives it a sense of actuality,

179
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,980
that's what I call backfilling.

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,864
And this is a very high-risk activity because oftentimes it's not checked by the main designers of the game.

181
00:12:15,904 --> 00:12:17,345
And so a lot of times...

182
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:21,168
Game developers are under so much time pressure to do this activity

183
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:23,871
that they just start throwing stuff in there as much as they can.

184
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,452
Of course, this depends on the game.

185
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:27,074
If the game is going to be hyper-detailed,

186
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:30,657
they're going to be under incredible pressure to fill in the game.

187
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,841
Think of a game like Skyrim and the amount of stuff that is in Skyrim.

188
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:39,605
Pots and papers and books with text in them and all that kind of stuff.

189
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:44,092
All of that has to be realized in the process of building the cultural evidence for that world,

190
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,218
because that's what helps Skyrim feel like an actual realized place.

191
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,427
And so this can be a risky activity because people just kind of randomly create things.

192
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,130
There's two key tips for creating evidence that I'll pass along right away.

193
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,911
One is you don't be lazy.

194
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:03,272
And I'm sorry, but that's the only word for it.

195
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:06,314
So, and I'll give you an example in just a minute about being lazy.

196
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:08,556
So you need to create everything with a purpose.

197
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:10,857
It's not just, we'll just throw some barrels in there.

198
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:11,878
It's like, why?

199
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:13,559
Why are the barrels there?

200
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:14,900
Which leads to the second point.

201
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
Ask questions.

202
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:17,601
So it's really important.

203
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:22,044
And I know it's very difficult in the game industry to ask an artist, for example,

204
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:23,825
it's like, why did you draw the character that way?

205
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:25,026
I don't understand that.

206
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:31,009
Because we have a mutual respect for creative vision, but at the same time there are certain

207
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,471
points at which it's completely valid to ask, why does it look that way?

208
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:37,072
What does that symbol mean?

209
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:38,853
What does that flag mean?

210
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,494
Why is that faction green?

211
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:44,636
I mean, questions like that, just because you have an understanding to basically...

212
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:49,338
Understand your own complexity and not just make it a random act.

213
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:54,220
And I'll kind of get into a little bit later why random acts of creation can be dangerous.

214
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,361
So here's a cultural evidence piece.

215
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:01,242
So this is a screenshot from Jade Empire.

216
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:06,324
And Jade Empire was a pan-Asian world that supposedly had nothing to do with our world

217
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:08,585
other than kind of felt like it was Asian.

218
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,566
And I won't go into all the complexity of making this game, but it was a real challenge.

219
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,648
You can see these glowing blue cylinders on the side there.

220
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,589
Well, this was an aspect of the backfilling of the game.

221
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,530
So what they did is because it was a pan-Asian environment,

222
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,152
they threw prayer wheels from Tibetan Buddhism into this hallway.

223
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:33,536
There wasn't Buddhism in this game, okay? This is not the real world.

224
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:39,161
So they threw these artifacts into the environment just to make kind of flesh it out and add something there.

225
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,284
And yet that was not part of this world. It's not valid.

226
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:47,067
And so, you know, this is what the actual prayer wheels look like.

227
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:50,610
And so the previous ones, they actually did look like prayer wheels,

228
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,532
but then they kind of fixed it and made this blue weird glow.

229
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:54,893
So it looks like this energy.

230
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:58,936
thing going on. But this is an example of an artist kind of throwing something

231
00:14:58,996 --> 00:14:59,597
there and saying, well,

232
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:03,079
this whole environment looks kinda like Tibetan Buddhism, so I'm gonna put prayer

233
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:03,660
wheels in there.

234
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,802
But those prayer wheels have a specific meaning in the real world

235
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:09,945
and they probably don't belong in a game that has a more fantasy setting.

236
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:18,825
Logical consistency. This is incredibly important. If there is one thing that I see game designers and artists and writers do wrong,

237
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:23,569
more than anything else when they're creating a world, is they don't build in logical consistency.

238
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:30,254
So this is basically the notion that rules exist and are applied to the space, time, and all elements within that world.

239
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:35,798
This is something Tolkien did really well, even though, yeah, there's some exceptions there, and I'm going to point one out in a little bit.

240
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:41,060
But there is a sense that the world works, that there is a system that works.

241
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,222
Just like the way our world, we know certain things work in certain ways.

242
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:47,843
We know how plate tectonics works, more or less.

243
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,144
We know kind of how the weather sort of works.

244
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:54,005
We know how transportation systems seem to go right or wrong.

245
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:55,786
We know all that kind of stuff.

246
00:15:55,846 --> 00:16:00,628
And so that helps a world feel real by building in ecological consistency.

247
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:09,024
There's a lack of contradiction in the system, so it's like you're not going to come across something that just makes no sense at all in the world.

248
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:13,385
It's like the things that are in the world feel like they're supposed to be in that world.

249
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:17,826
There's also a lack of conflict between the content elements that comprise the world.

250
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:24,407
So, you know, if you're not going to have something where it feels completely incongruous,

251
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:25,448
that you'd have a culture...

252
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:36,176
You know, you'd have like a culture that represents, that is like from the Nordic areas, from a cold area, living in a complete hot desert area.

253
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:40,300
Something like that. I mean, maybe there's a reason for it, but that's what I'm saying. Where's the logic?

254
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,424
So if you're going to do something like that, make sure there's a logic for doing it, because that kind of stuff...

255
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:48,407
you know, does tend to kick the player out of the experience.

256
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:49,627
And they kind of step back and say,

257
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:51,349
WTF, I don't understand this.

258
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:52,710
This doesn't make any sense to me.

259
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,671
It doesn't really have a sense of realness,

260
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:57,173
which in that sense of realness and the realization

261
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,734
helps draw players into the game.

262
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:02,517
And we also want to talk about the fidelity relationships

263
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:04,838
between, whoa, slow down there, Tex.

264
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,360
Sorry, I don't know what just happened there.

265
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:11,963
So, yeah, that's unfortunate.

266
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,550
So anyway, so we also want to talk about topology.

267
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,392
But here's an example of logical consistency.

268
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:23,434
So, this is kind of like the example from Jade Empire.

269
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:26,816
So this is from Cameo, which was on the original Xbox.

270
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:29,758
You can see here, and now this is another world

271
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,919
that had absolutely nothing to do with our world.

272
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:33,440
It's a complete fantasy world.

273
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,385
And so, is it logical that you would have grave markers that are wooden crosses in this world?

274
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:44,468
Maybe. Maybe there's a good reason why there's wooden crosses being used in this particular universe.

275
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:49,152
But I can tell you the answer was, is that this was a case of creative laziness.

276
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:52,134
The artist, when I pointed this out, saying, what are those supposed to be?

277
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,316
And they said, well, of course, they're grave markers.

278
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:58,359
I said, what do you mean, of course? There's no Christianity in this universe, so how would I know that?

279
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,801
And their answer to me was, what else would I use?

280
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:02,622
And I'm like...

281
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:07,030
I don't know, you're the artist, maybe you draw something different.

282
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:12,699
So that's one of those things where this is not logically consistent with the universe.

283
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:16,005
It has no place there, it's a content element that really should not be there.

284
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:22,817
And of course topology, so this is essential, this is kind of a more subtle point to world

285
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:26,740
building where there's a sense that things relate to one another.

286
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,802
It's not like you just have all these random content elements, random cultures, random

287
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,885
objects in the world that don't really seem to fit together.

288
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:34,425
And so...

289
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:41,047
I know I've heard some people accuse Tolkien, and I'm going to keep using Tolkien as an example,

290
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,067
because he is a good example.

291
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:46,648
I've heard some people accuse Tolkien of having a topology that sometimes feels weird.

292
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:51,689
Because, like, why are there dwarves and elves and humans and all these things living in this?

293
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:53,610
It doesn't seem to make sense.

294
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,890
But if you read the Silmarillion, he kind of explains all of that.

295
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,011
So he does have a whole backstory that explains why it's all there.

296
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:04,512
So part of it is that the people who say that, it's like, well, you didn't get the full story.

297
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:05,492
You need to go back and read.

298
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:10,955
But topology is important because it gives us a sense of that interconnectedness of different things,

299
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:13,396
like a culture, like the people to the land.

300
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:18,279
How do the people in the game, if there is a people culture, how do they relate to the environment?

301
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,021
Or are they just there without any kind of seeming connection?

302
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:27,343
And we know that helps build a sense of realness to the game.

303
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:31,966
And it applies to everything. It's not just about the relationship of places either.

304
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:35,148
I'm not just talking about the actual distance between a place.

305
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:39,171
That really doesn't matter because topology is agnostic of distance.

306
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:41,072
It's all about the actual connection.

307
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:43,854
What is connected to what and how is it connected to it?

308
00:19:45,604 --> 00:19:48,445
And so that's really important to kind of flesh that out.

309
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:51,946
And it does help to convey a sense of a much broader universe.

310
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:58,269
So even if you hint that there is a connection by dropping a line from a non-player character

311
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:02,551
or by finding an artifact that seems to be, that might relate to different things in the

312
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:07,134
game that kind of helps build the sense of lore, helps build a sense that this universe

313
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:10,795
is a lot bigger than the player might initially imagine.

314
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,713
So there's three core steps to world building that I want to cover.

315
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,194
One is to set the context.

316
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:21,237
So I'm actually going to spend a good deal of time on this issue of real world versus fictional world,

317
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:25,260
because this tends to be one of the areas where I see a lot of designers get hung up,

318
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,623
in terms of what they do next, in terms of how they build out their content.

319
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:32,685
The second one is determine the level of complexity.

320
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:37,169
So again, this is not about realism, it's about realization.

321
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:41,773
How much is needed to actually make the world serve the narrative and serve the experience

322
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:42,113
goals.

323
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:44,595
And then lastly is about creating with intent.

324
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:48,078
So then we talk about what you actually do, building the world layers.

325
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:52,021
I'm not going to spend as much time on that part because that can go on for weeks.

326
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:53,322
We don't have time for that.

327
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:53,983
So

328
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:58,106
Let's talk about this notion about real world and fictional world.

329
00:20:58,406 --> 00:21:02,829
Now, I realize this is a very strong dichotomy I'm putting here,

330
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:05,931
but I do fully realize that this is a broad zone of overlap.

331
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:10,414
It's very much the same way people are arguing about VR versus AR and blah blah blah.

332
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:13,176
It's like it's a spectrum. There's certain degrees.

333
00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:18,620
overlap. I mean you could have things that take place in the real world like a lot of games do but there's a very

334
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,044
fantastical, fantastical fictional things that happen on top of that real world.

335
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:31,590
But my reason for making this dichotomy though is really important because if you base things in the real world in our world

336
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,492
I keep saying real world. I don't want to get into some kind of

337
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:37,074
metaphysical argument about that term today, but

338
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:45,645
When you base things in our known world, it does have an effect on the content and the perception of the content

339
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:47,765
and a lot of other things that we'll talk about.

340
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:52,707
The fictional world, you have a lot more freedom, but it could also be dangerous because you also don't have boundaries.

341
00:21:53,207 --> 00:22:00,510
So you can basically kind of go off on a tangent and create something that might be completely problematic for people who are playing the game in our world.

342
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,371
That was confusing really fast.

343
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:04,711
Anyway...

344
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:10,062
In the world of cartography, we know this very well, this whole fictional versus real world setting.

345
00:22:10,182 --> 00:22:13,806
So, you know, these are two versions of Google Maps.

346
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,748
And Google was one of my clients.

347
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:19,412
And when I was there, we were perfecting what we call domain tailoring.

348
00:22:19,452 --> 00:22:22,976
So you can see here in the US locale, when you go to Google Maps,

349
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:27,501
and for most of the world, you see the northern area of India, Jammu and Kashmir, is disputed.

350
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:31,202
You can see the dashed lines around the disputed territories up there,

351
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:34,043
because it's disputed between Pakistan, India and China.

352
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:39,486
Well, in India, by law, you must show Jammu and Kashmir as Indian territory.

353
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:40,706
This is non-negotiable.

354
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:44,088
You must do this or else your product will not sell in India.

355
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:45,128
The government will ban it.

356
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:49,210
And so, what I call this, this is what I call a geopolitical imagination.

357
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,570
This doesn't exist.

358
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,951
It exists in the political world of the Indian government,

359
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:55,412
but it does not exist on the ground.

360
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:58,835
And so this is in a way, this is kind of a fictional world.

361
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:00,356
This doesn't really exist.

362
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:02,958
So it might be almost as fictional as Tolkien's map.

363
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,123
So there's some differences between real world and fictional world and creation that I'm going to touch on.

364
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:13,086
And again, for the sake of time, this is highly generalized.

365
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:16,189
So that's another thing cartographers do, is we generalize a lot.

366
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:19,492
Because you can't show everything on a map, so I'm generalizing my own talk a little bit.

367
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:20,473
So anyway...

368
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:25,296
Differences in world creation between doing real world and fictional world creation.

369
00:23:25,356 --> 00:23:30,360
So with the real world, the primary emphasis is often on replication and authenticity.

370
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,502
So you want it to feel like it's a real place.

371
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:35,744
There was a game like Six Days in Fallujah, which you may have heard about,

372
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:41,149
which never got released because it perfectly recreated the battle of Fallujah in 2004 in Iraq.

373
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,631
And it was controversial because of it, because it was a controversial battle.

374
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:48,574
And the publisher was just like, I'm not touching this, we're not going to release this.

375
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:53,316
And so it was very authentic and it replicated the city exactly

376
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:56,736
and yet, you know, that was a problem for it.

377
00:23:57,197 --> 00:24:01,638
In the fictional world, the primary emphasis tends to be more on the imagination and distinctions.

378
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:02,758
We want new things.

379
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:05,658
We don't necessarily want stuff that we've already seen in the real world.

380
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:07,639
We want to see things that have never existed before.

381
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,959
That's where we kind of crank on our imagination.

382
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,940
We want these things to be distinct from what we know in the real world

383
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,541
because that distinction actually makes them, you know, stand out more.

384
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:22,425
And in the consumption, basically on the player side, so the differences in the world consumption,

385
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:29,489
is when you're playing a real-world game, it's basically the focus is on realism and

386
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:33,691
the experience that feels genuine, like, wow, I'm really driving this tank, I'm really sniping

387
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:36,172
that person's head off, you know, that kind of thing.

388
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:37,573
I should use nicer examples.

389
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:42,836
And what's wrong with me?

390
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:49,207
And in the fictional world, it's often on, it's focused on discovery and escapism.

391
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:52,669
So like, of course we all know that No Man's Sky just was released,

392
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,733
and a lot of the both praise and criticism of the game is focused on that issue,

393
00:24:57,773 --> 00:25:01,015
that it's like too much discovery and too much escapism,

394
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:03,417
but some people love that and some people don't.

395
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,979
So then that's, you know, a whole different issue.

396
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,962
But that tends to be what a lot of fictional worlds are more focused on,

397
00:25:10,502 --> 00:25:12,624
because that's one of the values of it.

398
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,026
Discoverability, let me just touch on that issue really quick.

399
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:21,869
So what I mean by discoverability, which is another critical issue when we're creating content,

400
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:28,712
is when you have a content element in the game, let's say it's something that could be potentially offensive to a certain culture.

401
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:32,494
Or maybe it just is not in the right place.

402
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:33,454
Maybe it shouldn't be there.

403
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:38,996
But this was a game in Tekken Fighter where they had the inscriptions,

404
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:41,997
the Arabic script for Allah on the floor.

405
00:25:42,577 --> 00:25:45,599
And so, you know, now how discoverable is it though?

406
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:46,819
That's the issue here.

407
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,740
Because if you look at these tiles, when you're up here,

408
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,861
your eyes are up here fighting, are you going to notice it in the tiles?

409
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:57,085
And that is open to interpretation.

410
00:25:57,206 --> 00:26:00,629
Some people might notice, as some people did, and some people may not.

411
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:08,077
And so, sometimes you'll put content elements into your environment that might be controversial,

412
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:12,181
or they might be edgy or something, but sometimes you're not going to see them.

413
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:16,025
And this is actually one of the things I do a lot when I do my consulting work in this area,

414
00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:18,807
is I look for things that most people are never going to see.

415
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:22,992
And the only way I can do that is because I've got like God mode tools when I'm actually in the

416
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:27,236
environment during one of the game builds, so I can like turn around and look at places that

417
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:30,479
no one's ever going to see, or probably will never going to see.

418
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,412
So let's talk a little more about real world context, because again, I want to make this distinction.

419
00:26:36,532 --> 00:26:39,752
So, setting games in our world.

420
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:44,534
So the primary issues that we have with the real world when it comes to content,

421
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:48,235
number one is augmentation, and I'm going to give an example of all of these things.

422
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:52,436
So augmentation is like taking something that actually exists and adding to it,

423
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:54,676
like adding some fictional elements to it.

424
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,259
Accuracy, of course, is what it says.

425
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,260
Like, is the character accurate?

426
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,481
Is that building accurate?

427
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:02,964
Is that event accurate, the historical event?

428
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:07,207
Interpretation, so how different cultures interpret

429
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:11,351
a real world thing, whether it's a gesture,

430
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,733
you know, like this gesture, it means different things

431
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:14,494
in different countries.

432
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:18,797
Or appropriateness as well, like is this subject matter

433
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:21,099
actually appropriate to have in the game?

434
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:28,929
So like here's one from Ninja Gaiden 2 where it was interesting because in this game it was sort of a hyper, hyper real world.

435
00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:35,737
It was supposed to be the real world but I call it hyper real because a lot of the buildings were not the way they really are.

436
00:27:35,797 --> 00:27:40,042
So like this is a part of the Kremlin that was enhanced. It was like given extra layers.

437
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:44,804
And so it's like if you, this is, you know, so you would maybe recognize it as the Kremlin,

438
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:48,264
but maybe not because it's been enhanced in some way.

439
00:27:48,704 --> 00:27:54,025
And you know, this can be dangerous because if you take the wrong object and enhance it

440
00:27:54,065 --> 00:27:56,866
or augment it in a certain way, that might not work.

441
00:27:57,266 --> 00:28:02,046
Especially if it's a sacred site, if it's a church or a mosque or a synagogue or someplace

442
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:06,007
like that, or if it's a burial site or something like that, you have to be really careful

443
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:09,648
about what you do to actual locations because it can be very sensitive.

444
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:14,251
Accuracy too. Does anyone know who this is or who it looks like?

445
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:19,255
So basically they were modeling it after

446
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:27,441
So now the funny thing is though is that when the developers made this model, I said that's Bill Clinton and they said who?

447
00:28:28,354 --> 00:28:32,837
They said, what? Because the team, there was a Japanese team who made this character,

448
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,100
and so they weren't as familiar with the US president.

449
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,503
So, but I'm like, I'm like, I was like, I know he's not exactly the same,

450
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:44,205
but it's just like, but he also had a southern drawl when the character talks.

451
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:44,826
I'm just like.

452
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:49,987
This is like really similar, so you could, and so part of the problem too though,

453
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:53,088
now if someone was to perceive that this is Bill Clinton,

454
00:28:53,468 --> 00:28:57,108
one of the things that we had to take out of the game is that this president in the game

455
00:28:57,248 --> 00:28:58,889
used the term the final solution.

456
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:01,429
We all know the historical problem with that term.

457
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:03,350
And so that was a huge issue.

458
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,131
So you could be saying that well actually President Bill Clinton is in favor of this term,

459
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:09,771
which of course is not true.

460
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:13,192
So it's that kind of thing that people might perceive.

461
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:17,461
Interpretation. So here's a really interesting example of history.

462
00:29:17,921 --> 00:29:22,423
So in Age of Empires, this is what history really showed what happened,

463
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:27,165
is that the Yamatos in blue in Japan, they invaded the Korean Peninsula over there

464
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:31,406
and they took over the Choson Empire in red. That's what really happened.

465
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:34,168
So when Age of Empires was released in Korea,

466
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:37,309
the Korean Ministry of Information said that never happened.

467
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:39,382
So then what are you supposed to do?

468
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:45,405
So basically what we ended up doing eventually was creating a patch only for Korea that showed

469
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:46,185
the opposite.

470
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:49,046
So the Choson are actually invading Japan instead.

471
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:52,208
And so that's a matter of interpretation.

472
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:54,509
A lot of people would say, well that's completely erroneous.

473
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,091
It's like they should not do that in a historical game.

474
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:58,751
Yeah, but guess what?

475
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:02,874
Asian empires also had tanks in the Aztec empire.

476
00:30:03,474 --> 00:30:04,514
Aztecs never had tanks.

477
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:10,096
The Aztec tanks were cool, but that doesn't mean, you know, there are inaccuracies in Age of Empires.

478
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,696
It was not meant to be exactly precise history.

479
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:17,798
But this is obviously a huge issue when we basically have to turn around and say,

480
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:20,678
okay, well, they have a completely different interpretation of history.

481
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:24,059
Or appropriateness. This is pretty straightforward.

482
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,941
Killing Sikhs inside the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which is the most sacred site to the Sikh faith.

483
00:30:31,401 --> 00:30:32,481
That's pretty controversial.

484
00:30:33,219 --> 00:30:37,563
So that's like, you know, gunning down Catholics in St. Peter's in Rome, or

485
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:41,888
you know, gunning down Muslims in Mecca. It's like, you just don't do it. That's a

486
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:45,872
that's a sacred site. And so that's probably not going to be appropriate.

487
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:53,409
The other thing that's interesting is that these are not just single variable things.

488
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:57,291
A lot of these examples can be both inaccurate or inappropriate.

489
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:02,393
This one was interesting where they were striving for accuracy in this simulator

490
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:05,355
where you try and kill John F. Kennedy in Dallas.

491
00:31:05,855 --> 00:31:09,976
So you try and assassinate him from the book depository.

492
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:12,636
And so the guys who made this game said,

493
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:14,437
well, it's just a historical simulation.

494
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,697
It's like, but it also kept score.

495
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:19,758
And it wanted you to try and do a better job.

496
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:21,098
And it's like, well, that's a game.

497
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:25,279
So a lot of people felt this is highly inappropriate,

498
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,619
but it's also highly accurate.

499
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,020
They did an incredible job of recreating D. Lee Plaza in Dallas

500
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,901
and recreating the whole scenario.

501
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:37,307
Well, if you watch the Oliver Stone movie, though, then it's all baloney, right?

502
00:31:37,768 --> 00:31:41,074
So, let's talk about fictional world context now.

503
00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:46,978
So the primary issues that happen in the fictional world is sometimes we have generalization

504
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:52,559
that happens where the developers kind of lump everything together, where it's like

505
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:56,660
well all these cultures are the same, which kind of started happening in Jade Empire when

506
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,761
we were creating that game, is that the idea that it was going to be a pan-Asian culture

507
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:03,142
and yet in the initial form it was like 80% Chinese about...

508
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:12,205
5% Japanese, 5% Korean, and the rest was Indian, excuse me, Hindu.

509
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:16,447
And so it was kind of a weird mishmash of stuff, but it was heavily dominant in Chinese.

510
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:20,048
And so, but the way that they had originally created it was sort of generalizing all those

511
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:25,490
cultures as if to say they're all equivalent and they're all the same, which would be incredibly

512
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:25,950
offensive.

513
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:34,374
Emulation is, so this is probably the biggest issue in fictional worlds, and I'll give an example in a minute.

514
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:41,036
But emulation is basically where you create something in your fictional universe that feels very much like something that exists here.

515
00:32:41,636 --> 00:32:49,920
Probably the number one thing I've seen in all my years is when they have a desert culture in a fantasy game that, my goodness, they look awfully Arab to me.

516
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,782
Every single one of these cultures, every single one of these games

517
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:57,305
have the same Arabic, Bedouin-looking feeling to them

518
00:32:57,325 --> 00:33:00,228
and it's like they just can't seem to depart that.

519
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:05,392
Allegory is another big one as well, where basically you're suggesting something

520
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:06,753
through the fictional universe

521
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,334
and I'll explain that in a minute.

522
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:12,494
And then the use of artifacts, too. This is a huge problem.

523
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,597
This kind of relates to the backfilling and cultural evidence I mentioned before,

524
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:20,081
where basically you're just throwing stuff in the environment to kind of flesh out the environment,

525
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:24,945
but you're putting things in there that may or may not actually be useful in the fictional world,

526
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:27,567
or might not fit with the logical consistency.

527
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:33,209
So, a generalization, so this game got a lot of bad press because basically what they did

528
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:37,851
is they took these different sets of deities, like the Norse gods and the Egyptian gods,

529
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:39,931
but they also put in the Hindu gods.

530
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:44,693
Now, yes, the Norse gods and the Egyptian gods are, they are still worshipped by a very,

531
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:50,514
very small minority of human beings, whereas the Hindu faith is, you know, like about a

532
00:33:50,554 --> 00:33:51,175
billion people.

533
00:33:51,755 --> 00:33:56,099
So, you know, basically doing this equivalence and saying that, well, the Hindu gods are

534
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:59,862
just the same as these other antiquated gods, we're just going to throw them in a mix and

535
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:04,146
have them fight each other, that's a level of generalization that's not very acceptable.

536
00:34:05,768 --> 00:34:09,291
And so that can be potentially problematic, making that assumption.

537
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:14,964
or emulation again, not picking on the Hindu faith, but this is a good example

538
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:20,547
where this creature, this elephant demon, originally looked a lot like the god Ganesha

539
00:34:21,107 --> 00:34:26,030
and of course in this game, the elephant demon was an evil character that tried to kill you

540
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,471
whereas Ganesha in the Hindu faith is a very benevolent

541
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:32,089
very much a loved figure in their pantheon.

542
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:34,530
And so, to create a character that emulates this...

543
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,791
Now, the one you're seeing here is near the final form,

544
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:40,532
whereas in its original form it looked a lot more like this,

545
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:41,972
including another set of arms,

546
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,914
which was, I think, kind of an obvious thing that had to be lost.

547
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:49,195
But emulation happens a great deal when creating fantasy games.

548
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:51,576
And allegory as well.

549
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:55,837
So, if you don't know the story about the dervish and the arbiter character,

550
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:56,118
if you've...

551
00:34:57,717 --> 00:35:01,438
have not played Halo, just to set this up really quick,

552
00:35:01,818 --> 00:35:04,759
this character, he serves a group called the Covenant,

553
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,100
which is a kind of quasi-religious alien group.

554
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,181
They worship the Halo rings that can destroy the galaxy.

555
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:14,442
The Master Chief, main character of the game, is trying to stop them.

556
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:18,303
And so, you know, that's basically the really, really short story.

557
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:21,505
So this character that was originally called the Dervish,

558
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:24,166
Dervish is a title from Sufi Islam,

559
00:35:24,186 --> 00:35:30,088
a specific title, very much the same way that Pope is a very specific title from Roman Catholicism.

560
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,230
And so the original name of this character was Dervish.

561
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,691
He serves one of three leaders of the covenant,

562
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:37,451
one of whom is called the Prophet of Truth,

563
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:39,612
which is an often used synonym for Muhammad.

564
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:48,122
The Dervish serving the Prophet of Truth, and you've got the Master Chief, who is basically this quasi-American figure.

565
00:35:48,142 --> 00:35:53,128
I know it says UN Space Command on his shoulder, but come on, he's got an American accent and all that.

566
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:57,994
So, he's trying to destroy the Covenant and stop them.

567
00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:05,543
And where the allegory starts getting built up here is that this was the first major game being released by Microsoft after 9-11.

568
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:13,632
It was going to be one of the biggest games of the year, so it was very easy, at least for me, to see how people could perceive this as being an answer to 9-11.

569
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:17,496
Where it's like, oh, so the Master Chief is going to destroy Islam

570
00:36:17,556 --> 00:36:20,838
because you've got the Prophet of Truth and the Dervish helping the Prophet of Truth

571
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:22,179
and all this kind of stuff.

572
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,681
And so that builds up a sense of allegory,

573
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:27,583
that you're basically passing a message through the story.

574
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:30,525
Now, there's a lot of great ways to do allegory in fiction.

575
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:31,566
We see it all the time.

576
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:35,568
Like, the original Star Trek series was masterful at doing allegory,

577
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:38,370
where they were dealing with racial issues and gender issues,

578
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:41,973
but they did it in such a way in the science fiction realm that made it okay,

579
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,714
made it more palatable for the late 60s.

580
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:48,177
So we have to be really careful about the messages that we're sending.

581
00:36:48,217 --> 00:36:51,739
I'm not saying you can't put a message into your game, into your fictional universe.

582
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:53,020
We see it all the time.

583
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,360
You look at stuff like Dragon Age.

584
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,523
There's all kinds of stuff in Dragon Age about racial relations between the elves and humans

585
00:36:58,563 --> 00:36:58,983
and all that.

586
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:00,724
And I think it's great that they do it.

587
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:04,987
We just have to be really careful about what that allegory is saying and how it might relate

588
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:06,468
to something in the real world.

589
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:09,123
And then of course, artifacts too.

590
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:11,585
So here's a great example in this game, Pocket God,

591
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:14,526
where this artifact here, now the developer,

592
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,828
they got pushback from the Polynesian community

593
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:18,709
because a lot of Polynesian people were upset

594
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:20,890
because of the way these little natives look,

595
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,431
because it's a very antiquated version

596
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,573
of an indigenous person with a bone in their hair.

597
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:26,813
and a grass skirt and all that stuff.

598
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:29,414
But the real issue here is that the developer said,

599
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:31,175
well, this is no specific culture at all.

600
00:37:31,495 --> 00:37:32,235
It's like, really?

601
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:34,636
Well, you know, that thing right there is a Moai

602
00:37:34,676 --> 00:37:36,257
that only exists on Easter Island.

603
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,777
So by putting a Moai on the island,

604
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,818
you've instantly made this the Easter Island culture.

605
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:44,440
So that artifact pegged this particular game

606
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,500
to a specific culture.

607
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,121
Now, in later versions of the game,

608
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:49,781
they actually changed it so that it's a different statue.

609
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:51,062
It's not the actual Moai.

610
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:53,463
So just simple things like that.

611
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:59,194
Now, there are a lot of shared issues between the real world and fictional world, so logical

612
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:03,455
consistency again, I'm going to keep mentioning that because it's such an important issue

613
00:38:03,675 --> 00:38:04,676
in world creation.

614
00:38:05,356 --> 00:38:08,117
It's always an issue whether you're dealing with real world or fictional world.

615
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:12,458
Fictional world, it tends to be a bigger problem because you're creating things from scratch,

616
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:16,840
and so you have more effort to actually make that world feel real as opposed to actually

617
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,460
starting with a real world environment.

618
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,521
Changing the creation of cultural evidence, which I've mentioned.

619
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:26,606
Now, product versioning by language and locale is also very important.

620
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:31,308
So the Age of Empires example I gave you about Korea, by having to make that fix, you now

621
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:32,489
have two versions of the game.

622
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:34,890
You've got the world version and you've got the Korean version.

623
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:39,492
And so now you have to manage all of these versions, like these different perceptions

624
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:44,494
of your content, you know, so that's something that gets really complicated very quickly.

625
00:38:45,374 --> 00:38:48,635
And then of course the discoverability of issues, which I already mentioned.

626
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:55,448
So, talking about degree of complexity, so, what level of detail is required to realize

627
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,428
the game's world for the intended experience?

628
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,229
That's really the question you have to ask yourself.

629
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:03,310
And again, I'm going to keep harping on the notion it's not about realism, it's about

630
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,090
realization.

631
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:10,071
You may not have to do much of anything to make that world work for what you intend for

632
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:10,551
your game.

633
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:14,812
And so you really have to step back and think about it, what's the most minimal amount I

634
00:39:14,892 --> 00:39:16,733
need to do to make the game work?

635
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:19,673
And then you can think about maybe embellishing a little bit, if necessary.

636
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:27,257
So one of the things geographers are really good at is we are very good at the realization of worlds because we spend all this time

637
00:39:27,317 --> 00:39:31,859
Deconstructing this one and we deconstruct like no other that's what we do

638
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:37,902
And so we tear this world apart at least in our heads and we try and figure out what's where why are things there?

639
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:42,564
And all that kind of stuff now cartography has always done this cartography is about

640
00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:46,145
It's about rebuilding the world.

641
00:39:46,465 --> 00:39:48,906
Because all cartography is subjective.

642
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:52,668
If you look at a map and you think it's an accurate document, you're fooling yourself.

643
00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:58,190
Because every single map is gone, it goes through a subjective process through cartographers

644
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,351
who make decisions about what's going to show up on the map.

645
00:40:01,611 --> 00:40:06,332
Now, yes, cartographers are committed to showing ground truth to make sure that what you see

646
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:10,454
on the map is actually there, but you're not going to see everything that's there because

647
00:40:10,594 --> 00:40:12,395
you can't put everything on the map that's there.

648
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:17,577
And so what we do is we conveniently divide the world up into layers.

649
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:21,760
We've done this in our heads for centuries as cartographers,

650
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,402
but now with geographic information systems, it's made it very explicit.

651
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,443
Because this is how geographic information systems work.

652
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:32,807
The world is divided up into layers, they have a base layer that is quote real world,

653
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:37,711
it has the geoid and all the other stuff that it's built on, and they just have every kind

654
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:39,032
of layer you can imagine on there.

655
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,075
And in the same way when we build worlds, we kind of do the same thing.

656
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:47,159
Now maybe we don't think about it this way, but that's one of the things I would hope

657
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:51,282
people do think about it this way, because they really should start thinking about the

658
00:40:51,622 --> 00:40:55,366
kind of the layers of the world that they're creating, and you may or may not need some

659
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,267
of the world, excuse me, some of the layers.

660
00:40:58,377 --> 00:41:02,219
So I'm just going to talk about a few of these potential layers, well I'm not going to really

661
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,120
go into in detail, I'm just going to list them.

662
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,062
So you can see some of the potential layers, and I mean this is just scratching the surface,

663
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:10,843
I can go down this list that's going to go to the center of the earth.

664
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:17,466
It's like there's so many things you can potentially represent in your world, and you may not need

665
00:41:17,886 --> 00:41:21,228
all of these, you may need only one of these, you may need none of these, depending on what

666
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:22,288
kind of world you're creating.

667
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,411
Which is like, of course there's sub-layers for all this kind of stuff.

668
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:32,633
You take demographics alone, and you think about the level of demographics in terms of

669
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:35,395
genders and age, ethnicities, all of that kind of stuff.

670
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:37,596
So it's very complicated.

671
00:41:37,616 --> 00:41:42,258
It gets very complicated very quickly, but in my experience, I mean, this is a natural

672
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:45,700
thing for cartographers to think this way, but in my experience in working with game

673
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,962
designers and a lot of the people who do flesh out the world, I don't think...

674
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:54,745
encounter them thinking like this. Maybe it's not useful for them, I don't know. I've often

675
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:58,627
found that when I kind of talk through with them, when I give them my feedback, I sort

676
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:02,970
of break it down this way and say, well, I want to understand the way your world is built

677
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:07,072
because it's going to help me do my job better when I'm actually looking at your content

678
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:10,675
later. So if I can understand it in a way that kind of breaks it down like this, and

679
00:42:10,715 --> 00:42:14,537
a lot of times they found this more helpful because then they realize that maybe

680
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:21,519
Maybe in the way that the narrative unfolds in their world. Maybe the climate actually has makes a difference in their game

681
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,881
They weren't really thinking about the climate necessarily, but all of a sudden they're like wait a minute

682
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:29,142
There's all kinds of cool stuff we could do with weather that we weren't thinking about

683
00:42:30,957 --> 00:42:33,998
And of course, back to something like this, just to use this example again,

684
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:36,279
so I'm talking about geomorphology as an example.

685
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:40,281
So geomorphology, landforms, and how they get made, and plate tectonics and all that.

686
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:44,343
Now, as a kid, when I first read Tolkien, I thought this was a wonderful map,

687
00:42:44,403 --> 00:42:45,903
and I still do, I love this map.

688
00:42:46,204 --> 00:42:49,125
But now as a trained geographer, I look at this map,

689
00:42:49,185 --> 00:42:51,126
and I see those mountains around Mordor are...

690
00:42:52,138 --> 00:42:57,560
are ridiculous. They were not formed this way. Now of course, the Naguik and me, see I have this

691
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,521
inner battle between the geographer and the Naguik, because Naguik is saying, yeah but what about

692
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:07,043
maybe Morgoth went there and Morgoth used his magic and he made the mountains go up as a giant

693
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,524
wall around Mordor or something. That could happen, right?

694
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:14,246
And so, you know, it's just like, I'm not going to second guess Tolkien and why it looks that way,

695
00:43:14,646 --> 00:43:18,607
but it's kind of, when I look at the map of Middle Earth, it's one of those things where I'm like,

696
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:23,609
that doesn't feel real to me. But then again, it's like, it's so ingrained in my psyche at this point.

697
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:32,275
So I don't have a ton of time left. I'm going to talk about these last few problematic layers really quickly.

698
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:36,258
So these tend to be the layers that can be the most problem for you.

699
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:39,981
Now I've touched on some of this stuff already, that's why I'm going to go through it fairly quickly.

700
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:47,026
But these are the ones that consistently, time after time after time, have tripped up game developers when they've been building their worlds.

701
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:50,108
So history, of course, is one of the biggest ones.

702
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:54,451
When you're dealing with real world history, I already gave you an example with Age of Empires.

703
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,993
When you're dealing with fictional world history, it's about emulating.

704
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:00,775
I'm going to keep saying emulating because, again, I mentioned earlier,

705
00:44:00,855 --> 00:44:05,017
it's one of the biggest problems with fictional worlds where you're trying to emulate a certain thing.

706
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:09,380
Like, if you're going to do the Battle of Pearl Harbor, but you're going to do it in a fictional setting,

707
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:16,785
Maybe you can get away with it, but it depends what level of connection you want the player to have to that event.

708
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:23,512
So if you have some invasion in space that kind of emulates the Battle of Pearl Harbor, it's like how obvious you're going to make it.

709
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:25,934
So it depends.

710
00:44:27,816 --> 00:44:29,477
Oh, we already talked about that, sorry.

711
00:44:30,078 --> 00:44:33,241
So, something like this, this is for real world...

712
00:44:34,491 --> 00:44:38,815
example like this game came out or they want it to come out recently about the revolution in Iran.

713
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:42,418
Of course, the Iranian government does not like this at all. They don't want to relive this

714
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:48,344
history. They don't want to see this as a game by any means. I've actually played it. I thought

715
00:44:48,364 --> 00:44:54,729
it was pretty cool. I thought it gave a lot of insight into what was going on and the attitudes

716
00:44:54,769 --> 00:44:58,092
that were on the street and how it kind of fomented and grew.

717
00:44:59,593 --> 00:45:01,574
Faith, of course, that might be a no-brainer.

718
00:45:01,614 --> 00:45:07,317
That's one of the areas where with real world, obviously you steer clear or be very careful

719
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:10,019
with real world religions as much as you possibly can.

720
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:10,979
Extremely careful.

721
00:45:11,379 --> 00:45:15,381
But one of the things I see a lot in fantasy games or fictional games is the...

722
00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:22,123
They want the player to sense that there's a belief system, and so they often mimic a belief system that exists already.

723
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:25,064
And the most often mimicked is Roman Catholicism.

724
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:29,064
I've seen it time and again, replicated in all kinds of different forms.

725
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:37,566
Because I get it, you want to convey the notion of orthodoxy, you want to convey the notion of ritual and faith and all that.

726
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:42,667
And the Catholic Church is a very good example of that, but sometimes that can be overdone.

727
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:44,508
And so you have to decide.

728
00:45:45,401 --> 00:45:47,519
you know, how much you want to infuse your game with that.

729
00:45:49,717 --> 00:45:50,958
I'm going to skip this example.

730
00:45:53,178 --> 00:45:54,438
I will use this example.

731
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:59,540
So this is where they recreated the Manchester Cathedral in the UK in Resistance Follow Man.

732
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,441
You know of course this is a real world example, they wanted this to take place in the real

733
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:08,282
world but the problem was is that this being the Church of England's church, the church

734
00:46:08,342 --> 00:46:11,242
was not very happy with their church being destroyed in the game.

735
00:46:11,662 --> 00:46:15,463
And so now the Church of England actually has something that they call sacred digital

736
00:46:15,503 --> 00:46:18,544
guidelines that if you're going to use any facility of the Church of England you have

737
00:46:18,564 --> 00:46:18,704
to get.

738
00:46:18,764 --> 00:46:21,585
their approval, even if it's going to be in digital form.

739
00:46:23,065 --> 00:46:27,387
Or something like this, where this fighter in this game, if you may have heard about

740
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:34,069
this example, he said, this fighter is a Muslim, but when a fighter wins a match in this game,

741
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:36,189
they have random actions that the fighter does.

742
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,771
Well, in his case, the random action was he was doing this.

743
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:46,913
He would not do that, and he made sure that they were aware that he would not do that.

744
00:46:48,313 --> 00:46:53,454
Cultural identities, of course, this is where we have all kinds of issues around how gender is represented,

745
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:56,935
how nationalities are represented, how ethnicities are represented.

746
00:46:56,975 --> 00:47:00,896
The use of stereotypes is very much overdone still in this industry.

747
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,117
We can do a lot better than stereotypes.

748
00:47:03,457 --> 00:47:05,717
Stereotypes to me are basically lazy creation.

749
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:10,858
It's when people can't figure out some other way to draw a character or to put a different kind of character,

750
00:47:10,878 --> 00:47:15,620
they just take a stereotype off the shelf and throw them into the game because it's easy and it's quick.

751
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,722
But all it takes is a little more thought to put in there.

752
00:47:19,742 --> 00:47:25,165
And then also the whole idea when we create cultures in a fictional world,

753
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:26,886
we want them to feel plausible.

754
00:47:26,906 --> 00:47:29,768
So that means you have to spend the time fleshing them out,

755
00:47:29,788 --> 00:47:32,630
which again is something Tolkien did extremely well.

756
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,791
And one of the ways he did it was through language,

757
00:47:35,132 --> 00:47:37,573
because language and culture are so intertwined.

758
00:47:37,893 --> 00:47:40,935
He did an amazing job because he's a language professor.

759
00:47:41,415 --> 00:47:45,479
So he used his strength and he developed all these languages for the elves and the dwarves

760
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,882
and everything and that made them feel much more real and plausible.

761
00:47:50,063 --> 00:47:57,329
In Resident Evil 5, this is a case where the stark imagery of having this Caucasian male

762
00:47:57,409 --> 00:48:02,032
gunned down sub-Saharan African villagers was really problematic in the United States

763
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:05,295
because we have a lot of racial issues in the United States.

764
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:07,796
Now of course the developer was saying, what's the big deal?

765
00:48:07,836 --> 00:48:09,616
They're zombies, they're supposed to be killed.

766
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:13,997
But the developer didn't really realize because the developer is in Japan,

767
00:48:14,037 --> 00:48:17,318
and they have, you know, in Japan it's 98% ethnic Japanese.

768
00:48:17,638 --> 00:48:20,599
So you're not as aware of the diversity and racial issues there.

769
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:24,540
And so this whole notion of the dark continent and the great white hunter

770
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,400
that are very controversial in the western world

771
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,081
is just not something they've been exposed to.

772
00:48:29,661 --> 00:48:40,929
And of course, like Lara Croft, I think she's a great example of how she went from being sort of the poster child of sexism and ridiculous proportions to being an amazingly well-fleshed-out female character in a game.

773
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:52,758
And a lot of this is due to the vision of the later versions that we've had, and like the writing of Rihanna Pratchett, who's given her a whole emotional depth that did not exist before, and she's a very cool character.

774
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,794
And cultural systems as well.

775
00:48:55,894 --> 00:49:01,155
So there's the general tension that exists between cultures in the real world and again

776
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:02,815
emulation in the fictional world.

777
00:49:03,895 --> 00:49:05,576
Things like gestures I mentioned before.

778
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:07,836
Gestures are so culturally specific.

779
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:11,517
So even if you have gestures in a game, it can be problematic.

780
00:49:11,557 --> 00:49:16,078
So again, like I said, this one, you know, in the United States, or a lot of places people

781
00:49:16,098 --> 00:49:18,178
know that as rock on, you know, from rock and roll.

782
00:49:18,978 --> 00:49:22,739
In the state of Texas, it means hook them horns for the University of Texas.

783
00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:27,322
and I was told by my Italian friends that it means I'm sleeping with your wife in Italy.

784
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:35,246
So, you know, and then of course, here's an image from Dragon Age where it's like they're flipping the bird.

785
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:40,309
So like, okay, well would they do that in Dragon Age's world? I don't know.

786
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:44,772
Why wouldn't they do this instead? Or this? Or this? Or this? They're all valid.

787
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:45,552
So...

788
00:49:46,832 --> 00:49:50,394
And then of course geopolitics is another area we have to be very careful about, especially

789
00:49:50,414 --> 00:49:54,356
if you're using maps in your game or you're dealing with territories and all that kind

790
00:49:54,396 --> 00:49:54,796
of stuff.

791
00:49:55,376 --> 00:50:00,859
And in the fictional world, it's basically, again, if you're augmenting an existing geopolitical

792
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:01,400
scenario.

793
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,244
or you're enhancing it in some way, you've got to be so careful with this

794
00:50:05,324 --> 00:50:08,787
because there are some governments that watch this very carefully.

795
00:50:09,108 --> 00:50:11,751
So one example, of course, as you might suspect, is China,

796
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:17,437
where they banned Hearts of Iron because Tibet and Taiwan were not being shown as part of Chinese territory.

797
00:50:17,877 --> 00:50:20,919
Now if you've played this game, it's basically like the board game Risk,

798
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:24,140
and so you just try and take over the world, but they were mostly concerned

799
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,422
with just those two areas. And the interesting thing though is that these

800
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,203
games take place in World War II,

801
00:50:29,623 --> 00:50:32,685
and the People's Republic of China did not exist until 1949.

802
00:50:33,425 --> 00:50:36,066
So the government is actually reinforcing their perception of their

803
00:50:36,106 --> 00:50:37,527
sovereignty before they existed.

804
00:50:38,127 --> 00:50:40,809
So, which is kind of what they're doing right now in the South China Sea,

805
00:50:41,129 --> 00:50:42,210
if you've been following the news.

806
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:45,967
So finally, I am finishing here.

807
00:50:46,448 --> 00:50:48,489
So a couple of notes about creative freedom

808
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:50,210
and world building, and again, I apologize

809
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,832
this is going so fast because there's a lot to cover here

810
00:50:53,852 --> 00:50:55,873
and I'm barely scratching the surface,

811
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:58,235
but I want to emphasize it's really important

812
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,756
that you exercise your creative vision,

813
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:01,356
but you cannot expect that vision

814
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:02,617
to align with other cultures.

815
00:51:03,078 --> 00:51:04,678
And so whether it's a real world you're creating,

816
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:06,079
whether it's a fictional world you're creating,

817
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:07,440
you have to be really careful

818
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,881
about the world you're building,

819
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:11,703
or at least be conscious of the choices that you're making.

820
00:51:12,985 --> 00:51:18,606
And so, when you're doing the decisions about setting the context, is it real world or fictional world,

821
00:51:18,926 --> 00:51:22,507
where you're figuring out what complexities, so what degree of realization do I need

822
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:27,889
in order to make this world work for the purpose of my game, for the narrative purpose and the experience purpose,

823
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:33,250
and of course the creative process as well, so watching how you backfill the game and doing all the cultural evidence.

824
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:39,812
They have to be a very conscious, a certain stream of consciousness goes into that creative process.

825
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:42,073
And finally, I'll mention this as well.

826
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,863
Because we are a game industry, and I think most everyone who's in this room,

827
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:51,167
if you're in the game industry, you're in it because you want to make a living off it, right?

828
00:51:51,207 --> 00:51:55,551
You're not just a pure artist. You don't live in your parents' loft or basement.

829
00:51:55,651 --> 00:51:58,653
You don't just make games and put them out in the world as pieces of art.

830
00:51:59,174 --> 00:52:03,876
Some people do that and I think it's fantastic and I'm hoping to see more and more of that happen.

831
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:08,458
However, most of us are here because we are making a living off games.

832
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:15,061
And so when we are in the creation process, we have to weigh this dilemma between pure artistic freedom,

833
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:17,743
doing anything we want, which is perfectly valid.

834
00:52:17,963 --> 00:52:19,824
I don't care what you make. I really don't.

835
00:52:19,884 --> 00:52:23,125
I'm not the political correctness police. I don't care what you make.

836
00:52:23,846 --> 00:52:26,347
So I'm not going to be the one who says, well, that's bad, you can't do that.

837
00:52:26,747 --> 00:52:30,530
But if you want to make money off it, especially in certain markets around the world,

838
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,512
I will be the one who says, well, that's not going to work here,

839
00:52:33,592 --> 00:52:35,613
and it's not going to work there, and it's not going to work there.

840
00:52:36,173 --> 00:52:38,315
And so you have to decide what your goals are

841
00:52:38,635 --> 00:52:40,976
in terms of actually releasing this content into the world.

842
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:42,197
If you want to be artistic,

843
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,919
be artistic but you may not get as much money as you want,

844
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,061
or if you want to actually maximize your revenue,

845
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:49,922
then you might have to make decisions that

846
00:52:50,422 --> 00:52:52,404
not always agree with your original creative vision.

847
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:53,484
And it's a struggle.

848
00:52:54,025 --> 00:52:56,406
It's a struggle that a lot of game developers deal with,

849
00:52:56,787 --> 00:52:58,448
and so being conscious of that struggle

850
00:52:58,488 --> 00:53:00,369
and kind of thinking it through is really important.

851
00:53:00,689 --> 00:53:02,610
Because if you do release a game,

852
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,332
and it does get in trouble in a certain market

853
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,913
because of something that you, you know,

854
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:08,574
mistakenly put in your game,

855
00:53:08,674 --> 00:53:10,676
some kind of artifact or character or something,

856
00:53:11,176 --> 00:53:14,279
It helps to have some conscious decision making around it.

857
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:15,841
So you can explain why you did it.

858
00:53:16,141 --> 00:53:18,603
You didn't, you know, you can't, you could just say,

859
00:53:18,623 --> 00:53:20,665
well, I don't know, I didn't, had no idea what I was doing.

860
00:53:21,025 --> 00:53:23,688
But it's like, no, I did that because that artifact

861
00:53:23,728 --> 00:53:25,670
has a reason for being there in my world

862
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,812
and here's the reasons that back up, you know,

863
00:53:27,912 --> 00:53:29,393
they fit the logical consistency

864
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:30,695
and everything else that you developed.

865
00:53:30,815 --> 00:53:33,157
So there you go.

866
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:34,178
That's it.

867
00:53:48,252 --> 00:53:52,753
Are there any questions? We have about six or seven minutes for questions.

868
00:54:00,894 --> 00:54:07,156
Hello. I wanted to ask you about your opinion when someone is creating a fantasy world,

869
00:54:07,396 --> 00:54:13,577
examples, World of Warcraft, that they're actually mixing elements or switching

870
00:54:15,174 --> 00:54:18,035
elements. What I mean by that is if you look at the elf

871
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:21,698
civilization, they have mixed, for example, ancient Greece

872
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:25,820
putting into jungle instead and for the houses they have mixed

873
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:29,563
some Asian culture and mixing those together they create like

874
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:32,805
a fantasy culture and architecture. How do you think of

875
00:54:33,105 --> 00:54:35,887
that way of creating something fantasy?

876
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:42,542
I think when that kind of approach is taken, I don't think that's necessarily a problem.

877
00:54:42,582 --> 00:54:44,345
I think a lot of it is in the execution.

878
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:49,813
I think a lot of times for something like that, you have to have an underlying understanding

879
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:50,334
of why.

880
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:52,032
That would happen.

881
00:54:52,472 --> 00:54:55,754
Now I'm not saying you have to explain that why to the audience.

882
00:54:56,714 --> 00:54:59,436
But I'm saying you need to think through like why would that happen?

883
00:54:59,456 --> 00:55:02,558
I mean other than just saying well I'm just going to throw that culture with this culture

884
00:55:02,578 --> 00:55:07,501
and they're going to be like in some you know fictional place you know dealing with each other or something.

885
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:13,748
that to me kind of starts feeling like it breaks the sense of logical consistency.

886
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:19,132
But I'm not, you know, that can be okay, but as long as there's some kind of reason for it, I think,

887
00:55:19,613 --> 00:55:25,057
you know, some kind of rationale for why am I seeing, like, Greeks and some other culture together,

888
00:55:25,077 --> 00:55:27,859
you know, in a way that is just not...

889
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:33,283
normal, not something that you would expect, because those are cultures that are specifically

890
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:34,604
attached to the real world.

891
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:36,725
And we know what their context was.

892
00:55:36,865 --> 00:55:38,546
We know exactly what their context was.

893
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:44,190
And so it's like you have to kind of help explain why are they now in a different context.

894
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:47,953
And so that to me is kind of part of working through the logical consistency argument.

895
00:55:48,313 --> 00:55:50,635
It's kind of thinking, okay, just, you know, think of the reasons why.

896
00:56:02,745 --> 00:56:04,846
Hi, so very interesting session.

897
00:56:06,207 --> 00:56:08,608
My name is Francesco, we work for OneSky.

898
00:56:09,068 --> 00:56:15,831
Our company localize games for developers, studios,

899
00:56:16,131 --> 00:56:20,873
and we on a daily basis have this kind of questions,

900
00:56:20,893 --> 00:56:23,014
this kind of questions about culturalizations,

901
00:56:23,094 --> 00:56:26,855
make games suitable for that particular market or not.

902
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,717
What would be in general like your advice for

903
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:36,779
you know, like developers or studios that they are entering

904
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:40,760
like new markets, what are going to be like best practices

905
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,382
that they should follow before deciding if entering

906
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,022
the market with their game or not?

907
00:56:46,042 --> 00:56:48,943
Because this is also something that I came to discuss

908
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:52,665
with one of our customer in Hong Kong.

909
00:56:53,265 --> 00:56:56,306
He was asking me if basically his game was suitable

910
00:56:56,366 --> 00:56:57,707
for a market like Turkey.

911
00:56:58,007 --> 00:57:00,748
And I told him, be careful because in Turkey,

912
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:04,392
culture is slightly different from the culture here in Hong Kong.

913
00:57:04,993 --> 00:57:09,459
So they are people that they follow like up.

914
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,892
particular religion and they are quite attached to some science

915
00:57:14,452 --> 00:57:16,394
or to some, you know, values.

916
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:21,356
So that was my overall, my advice to him.

917
00:57:21,496 --> 00:57:23,457
Do you have, like, some best practices,

918
00:57:24,378 --> 00:57:27,680
something to follow, some suggestions that we can also give to our

919
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,182
developers when they have to enter, like, these markets?

920
00:57:31,302 --> 00:57:35,724
Yeah, it's a great point because, I mean, there's so much that has to go into

921
00:57:36,425 --> 00:57:39,586
the intelligence gathering of when you're going into a new market.

922
00:57:42,268 --> 00:57:46,852
I hate to draw the analogy, but it's very similar to a military operation.

923
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,135
I keep going on about tanks and guns and stuff today.

924
00:57:51,456 --> 00:57:53,477
But it is. It's intelligence gathering.

925
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:55,159
So that's what market research is.

926
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:58,321
Market research is meant to help you understand what's going on in the market.

927
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:02,585
Now, of course, market research as we know it is typically focused on consumer behavior,

928
00:58:02,885 --> 00:58:04,826
which is fine. You need to know that, too.

929
00:58:04,886 --> 00:58:06,928
So it's helpful to know what kind of games they play.

930
00:58:08,169 --> 00:58:14,731
So for example, the illustration I gave about Age of Empires in Korea,

931
00:58:15,171 --> 00:58:20,352
the decision to make that patch was driven a lot by the knowledge of the market research,

932
00:58:20,452 --> 00:58:23,853
knowing that the Korean players liked real-time strategy games.

933
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,394
Which, a year later, StarCraft came out.

934
00:58:26,614 --> 00:58:28,355
We all know what happened with StarCraft in Korea.

935
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,075
It became a national phenomenon.

936
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:36,124
And so that market research showed that we really should release the RTS game in Korea.

937
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:40,891
And so it's, you know, for business reasons, we should make that patch and do it.

938
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,935
And so that was informing our decision making around that.

939
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:49,494
Part of it too, I think you also have to look at the kinds of games that are being made locally.

940
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:55,537
And so this is one of the things where I think there's a huge distinction with companies that are having so much trouble getting into China.

941
00:58:55,557 --> 00:58:59,939
Yeah, some games are very successful, but look at a lot of the most popular games in China.

942
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:03,201
They're based on Chinese mythology and Chinese history.

943
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:08,783
You know, you've got a lot of the... they're drawing upon their own culture to cultivate an interest in the games.

944
00:59:09,204 --> 00:59:13,586
And so it's really important to understand what kinds of games people are going to find

945
00:59:13,646 --> 00:59:14,427
interesting there.

946
00:59:15,307 --> 00:59:19,870
Now a lot of times what you'll find too is that you'll see players that want to play

947
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:24,673
the big AAA game being released in the western countries, but their government won't allow

948
00:59:24,713 --> 00:59:27,535
it for some reason, like one of these cultural or political reasons.

949
00:59:29,276 --> 00:59:32,978
There might be a way to make a game that does the same thing, so you're kind of emulating

950
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:36,681
that game style, but doing it in a local way, using a local theme.

951
00:59:38,687 --> 00:59:40,108
So there's a lot of different ways around it,

952
00:59:40,128 --> 00:59:41,048
there's a lot of different,

953
00:59:41,088 --> 00:59:42,968
you have to think about the political climate,

954
00:59:43,308 --> 00:59:44,989
so like, look at some of the games,

955
00:59:45,029 --> 00:59:45,889
like do the research,

956
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:47,690
say what kind of games were banned there?

957
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:50,851
What are they looking for that they don't like?

958
00:59:50,971 --> 00:59:52,691
Or what games are doing really well?

959
00:59:52,811 --> 00:59:54,872
So what games are they allowing

960
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,712
and are actually doing very well?

961
00:59:57,452 --> 01:00:00,113
Game type, game content, all of that kind of stuff.

962
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:03,094
And so it really kind of mixes together

963
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:04,914
into understanding what is the expectation

964
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,735
that we need to serve.

965
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:08,536
And that's really what I focus on.

966
01:00:08,556 --> 01:00:10,877
I mean, well like when my consulting is usually

967
01:00:10,937 --> 01:00:12,718
because they want me to find stuff that's bad.

968
01:00:13,738 --> 01:00:15,579
But there's a big part, one of the things,

969
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:18,120
I didn't even talk about the whole field of culturalization,

970
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,461
but one of the things I often talk about

971
01:00:19,841 --> 01:00:21,422
is there's reactive culturalization,

972
01:00:21,462 --> 01:00:23,903
which is basically, excuse me,

973
01:00:23,923 --> 01:00:26,884
removing things that can be potentially problematic.

974
01:00:27,144 --> 01:00:28,965
But there's proactive culturalization too,

975
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:31,606
in which you're actively trying to make content

976
01:00:31,626 --> 01:00:33,847
that's going to be more appealing to a specific market.

977
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:38,529
Fewer companies are doing that now, but I think more and more companies are going to be doing that.

978
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:42,330
I mean, even like when we did Forza Motorsports way back when, the first version,

979
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:45,191
the different language versions had different car sets in them,

980
01:00:45,511 --> 01:00:48,151
because we understood that, like, the Italian version,

981
01:00:48,171 --> 01:00:52,053
a lot of the players there wanted to play, well, mostly Italian cars,

982
01:00:52,413 --> 01:00:56,834
and, like, in the US version, you had muscle cars, Mustangs, Corvettes, that kind of stuff.

983
01:00:57,374 --> 01:01:04,018
You know, any player could go get any car from the DLC store, but still, you wanted to serve up sort of what the local expectation was.

984
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:06,400
And again, that was just a lot of research.

985
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,121
And so, I mean, I could go on and on.

986
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:13,604
There's a lot I could say about this, but that's my short answer.

987
01:01:15,285 --> 01:01:15,525
Thanks.

988
01:01:16,488 --> 01:01:19,649
Hi, so first of all, thanks again for lots of information,

989
01:01:19,749 --> 01:01:20,970
very short time, very useful.

990
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:23,090
And I have a practical question.

991
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:28,832
So when imagining different settings, different cultures,

992
01:01:29,512 --> 01:01:32,393
not based on Western culture, which is more or less known,

993
01:01:32,613 --> 01:01:34,594
to some extent, to most Western developers,

994
01:01:35,194 --> 01:01:38,155
I would be a quick fix for research.

995
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,855
Because some teams maybe have the budget

996
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:42,176
to go and fly to other countries, to Timbuktu,

997
01:01:42,576 --> 01:01:44,136
or Cambodia, and do research.

998
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:46,778
but many don't have this possibility.

999
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:48,658
So what would be your suggestion?

1000
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:51,740
Like to go on the internet, look for books, practically?

1001
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,661
Well, I think there's a lot of different things you can do.

1002
01:01:53,681 --> 01:01:55,802
I mean, one of the things that I do is I often,

1003
01:01:55,822 --> 01:01:57,763
I mean, while I've been doing this long enough,

1004
01:01:57,803 --> 01:01:59,784
I've made contacts like all over the place.

1005
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:03,306
So it helps to have the local voice

1006
01:02:03,366 --> 01:02:05,327
or find some local voice that you trust,

1007
01:02:05,687 --> 01:02:07,028
people who are well-informed,

1008
01:02:08,068 --> 01:02:10,429
you know, they could, and get different opinions as well.

1009
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:14,792
For example, one of the things I used to do when I was at Microsoft to help gather opinions

1010
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:17,214
is I would reach out to academics.

1011
01:02:17,394 --> 01:02:21,777
But not just one, I would talk to a political science professor in that particular country

1012
01:02:21,797 --> 01:02:23,858
and get their viewpoint on the politics.

1013
01:02:23,878 --> 01:02:28,801
Then I would talk to a professor of media or professor of sociology or something, in

1014
01:02:28,821 --> 01:02:33,744
geography of course, and just kind of get a sense of, kind of build up for myself an

1015
01:02:33,764 --> 01:02:37,947
understanding of what is going on there and what the representation might be.

1016
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:42,091
But ultimately though, yeah, the academic stuff,

1017
01:02:42,111 --> 01:02:43,933
that's great, it's informative,

1018
01:02:43,953 --> 01:02:46,855
and it helps kind of build your knowledge base,

1019
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:50,539
but what really matters is how consumers are gonna react.

1020
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,240
And what are they gonna like?

1021
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,261
And what are they gonna dislike?

1022
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:55,644
And a lot of that is just finding people

1023
01:02:55,704 --> 01:02:57,005
whose opinion you can trust.

1024
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:59,507
Now sometimes you can do it through the internet,

1025
01:02:59,627 --> 01:03:01,129
but we all know what happens on the internet.

1026
01:03:01,769 --> 01:03:05,953
So, um, but one of the things you could do, like I've actually done this sometimes, like

1027
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:10,156
you could go like, there's some of the things like Google Answers or whatever it is where

1028
01:03:10,176 --> 01:03:14,780
you can like throw out a question to the world and say, hey, I'm thinking of making a game

1029
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,062
that does this and this, would people in Thailand like this?

1030
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:18,503
And see what people say.

1031
01:03:19,024 --> 01:03:22,046
Now obviously you're going to have to do a lot of work to separate the signal from the

1032
01:03:22,106 --> 01:03:23,968
noise there, because you're going to get a lot of noise.

1033
01:03:24,048 --> 01:03:28,512
But sometimes you actually get a nugget or two that helps you, helps inform you to like,

1034
01:03:28,552 --> 01:03:30,433
maybe I'll go down that research path.

1035
01:03:30,814 --> 01:03:32,295
because they may have said something that said,

1036
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:33,635
I never heard that before.

1037
01:03:34,176 --> 01:03:36,878
They said, well, yeah, right now a lot of our players

1038
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,699
are really into this type of game

1039
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:40,820
or into this type of content.

1040
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,022
Like maybe they're into historical games right now.

1041
01:03:43,742 --> 01:03:45,664
And so that's something you could pursue.

1042
01:03:45,684 --> 01:03:47,505
And so you kind of have to just kind of throw

1043
01:03:47,545 --> 01:03:48,926
a very wide net that way.

1044
01:03:49,967 --> 01:03:51,828
Obviously, market research is helpful because,

1045
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:53,289
but it also costs money.

1046
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,671
So that's the only problem with it.

1047
01:03:55,931 --> 01:03:57,272
Not that market research is bad,

1048
01:03:57,312 --> 01:03:58,713
it's just that a lot of us can't afford it.

1049
01:04:00,974 --> 01:04:02,775
But it's good, I mean, you can do a lot of,

1050
01:04:02,855 --> 01:04:04,675
I find a lot of market research out there.

1051
01:04:05,656 --> 01:04:07,417
There's a lot of stuff that's out there on the internet.

1052
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:10,018
You know, just kind of assess what you're finding.

1053
01:04:10,038 --> 01:04:10,858
I mean, really epic.

1054
01:04:12,018 --> 01:04:13,699
For lack of better comparison,

1055
01:04:13,739 --> 01:04:16,360
it's really like writing a PhD, unfortunately.

1056
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,481
Because it's like you have to take in

1057
01:04:18,581 --> 01:04:20,502
all of this different source, kind of sift through it,

1058
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:23,763
and kind of, that's actually why I love this work so much,

1059
01:04:23,823 --> 01:04:24,624
because in a lot of ways,

1060
01:04:24,684 --> 01:04:26,845
it's kind of like a crime scene investigation.

1061
01:04:27,445 --> 01:04:30,365
I've actually used the term cultural forensics before

1062
01:04:30,886 --> 01:04:33,066
to talk about like you're sifting through all of this

1063
01:04:33,246 --> 01:04:35,667
evidence and all of these signs that there's something

1064
01:04:35,707 --> 01:04:38,707
going on, but it's not quite, you're not quite sure

1065
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:41,208
exactly what it is, and you're not being able to find it

1066
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:43,468
out there through market research or whatnot,

1067
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:45,029
so you kind of have to figure it out for yourself.

1068
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:48,390
Then you have to sometimes just throw out a proposal,

1069
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,410
like I'm thinking about creating a game that does

1070
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,631
blah blah blah for this market, and then kind of see

1071
01:04:52,651 --> 01:04:53,651
how people react to it.

1072
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:56,912
So I don't know if that's helpful or not, but yeah.

1073
01:04:57,332 --> 01:04:58,032
Thank you very much.
