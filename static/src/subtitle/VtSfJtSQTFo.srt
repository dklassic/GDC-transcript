00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:06,155
Hi, I'm Brandon Sheffield.

2
00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:08,340
I am the director of Microsoft Games

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,043
and I'm here to talk to you about taste

4
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:11,967
and how to cultivate it in your games

5
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:13,170
and how you all have it probably.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,011
There are too many games like these.

7
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:19,612
They all look basically the same and give no sense of character or taste whatsoever.

8
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:23,193
You look at a screenshot and you think, yeah, I've seen that, I know what that is.

9
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:29,916
These games, on the other hand, regardless of whether you like them, come from a foundation

10
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:30,556
of taste.

11
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:35,338
You can see that someone had a perspective, something to communicate, and they went with

12
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:35,438
it.

13
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,522
You look at a screen here and you might think I haven't seen that, I'm curious about it

14
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:42,023
or that's too weird for me.

15
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:46,127
But either way, it's got your attention and as we all know, getting attention is extremely

16
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:46,668
hard right now.

17
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:49,130
We should make more games like these.

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,713
There's a greater risk but potentially greater reward as well.

19
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:57,358
And why be an independent game developer if you don't want to take risks and do interesting

20
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:57,698
things?

21
00:00:57,718 --> 00:00:59,300
You may as well just go join a company.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,323
If you show your taste and your passions, people will react to it.

23
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:08,885
People love to have opinions and they love to share their opinions against yours.

24
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:15,349
Especially these days with YouTubers and Instagrammers and Instagram stars and all these things,

25
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,631
people are increasingly defining themselves by what they like,

26
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:20,392
whereas they used to say what they do.

27
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:22,693
They used to say, I'm a carpenter or I'm a mechanic.

28
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:26,816
Now people say, I'm a foodie or, you know, I'm a film buff.

29
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:31,420
If you show your taste, they will react to it.

30
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:33,483
In between these two examples,

31
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:34,504
there's something more like,

32
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:36,147
this reminds me of something I liked

33
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:37,409
that I thought nobody else did.

34
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:41,315
You want people to feel as though

35
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,217
you made your game just for them.

36
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:49,137
Our game that we just released, Odeer, comes from the tradition of super scalers.

37
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:53,819
I can't necessarily say this is the best representation of completely different tastes because driving

38
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:57,482
games exist, but we did it in a different way.

39
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:02,084
The technology is old because it's all pseudo 3D.

40
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:03,265
There's no actual 3D in it.

41
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,947
It's all scaling sprites, and we added some weird shaders and stuff.

42
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:07,168
So we took...

43
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,610
something that was old and added some twists to it and it made people say, oh man, this

44
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,192
is just what I was waiting for, or you made this just for me.

45
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:18,395
On the other hand, we had tons of people say, what is this Atari trash?

46
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:27,421
But either way for us, it shows that we're staying true to ourselves and we made the

47
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:28,842
game that we wanted to make.

48
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:33,685
It's not important that people agree with you, but that you know what you like and you

49
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:34,065
make that.

50
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:39,784
If you mix the unexpected with the familiar, you've got a great platform to stand on.

51
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:46,788
Obviously, Overwatch is a great FPS that has layered on top of it someone's taste.

52
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:52,811
If this game, just being a great FPS, if that's all it were, if it used assets from the Unity

53
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:54,892
store that were generic, it wouldn't be nearly as popular.

54
00:02:56,293 --> 00:03:00,577
So people say that taste is something that you have or don't, and I completely disagree.

55
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:04,962
I believe it can be cultivated and that all of you are capable of self-analysis.

56
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:08,986
And I don't believe it's objective, it's entirely related to the individual.

57
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:12,490
So here are a few exercises to bring your own taste out.

58
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:13,831
Very important.

59
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:17,532
Think about your top 10 favorite songs or albums.

60
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:20,714
Write three sentences about them and why you like each one.

61
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:23,515
What was going on in your life when you heard them first?

62
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:25,155
Why did they resonate with you then?

63
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,856
Do they resonate the same way now?

64
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:29,197
Are there any tensions between when you listened to it

65
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:30,858
back then and when you listen to it now

66
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:32,038
and is that interesting in any way?

67
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,879
Watch a movie that your friend likes

68
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,380
but which you don't or the reverse.

69
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,141
Talk about your feelings while being respectful

70
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:39,081
of the other person's views.

71
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:43,872
Don't force yourself to break down why it doesn't work for one of you but does for the

72
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:44,112
other.

73
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:46,554
Don't focus on why someone else is wrong.

74
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:50,337
Focus on why you believe what you believe, why you feel what you feel.

75
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:53,700
Go to a thrift store and find three things of interest there.

76
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,061
You don't have to buy them or anything.

77
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,344
Just find interesting things that appeal to you or seem weird.

78
00:03:58,925 --> 00:03:59,925
What makes them interesting?

79
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,388
Who do you think owned these things?

80
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:03,509
Why did they get rid of them?

81
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:04,950
What were the circumstances there?

82
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:09,723
If you're lucky enough to be able to travel, go anywhere, even if it's a few towns over.

83
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:14,207
Avoid tourist spots and instead go to a specific restaurant, a thrift store, find something

84
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:16,729
on Yelp, somewhere else that's very local.

85
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,170
Don't take the easy road.

86
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,950
Get lost.

87
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:19,791
Walk around.

88
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,613
You'll learn a lot about people and about yourself.

89
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,020
So how do you apply this to games?

90
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:26,905
Once you know who you are and what you like,

91
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,047
it comes really naturally.

92
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:30,671
Why should this character be blue when it could be red?

93
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:32,894
Is there a reason for this person to be a man?

94
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:34,056
What if it were a woman?

95
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:35,738
What if it were genderless?

96
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:36,860
What if it had a dog?

97
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,982
What are people who you know who have dogs like?

98
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:41,702
How would they react in this situation?

99
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,503
Make sure you're asking and answering these questions constantly.

100
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:46,303
Make choices that matter in your games.

101
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,164
Don't do something because it's popular.

102
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:52,825
Do it because it means something to you or to your mom or to your team or to your third

103
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:53,365
grade teacher.

104
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:57,346
When you make something for yourself or for someone you know, it's more likely to resonate

105
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:59,006
with others because it will be genuine and real.

106
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:05,471
People respect taste. They crave a connection to it and want to be complimented for having thoughts and feelings.

107
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:09,254
Everyone has the capacity to do this. Some people have an easier time than others,

108
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:14,839
but everyone is capable of identifying what they like and acting on it. I don't care if your taste

109
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,320
Taste leads to a rhythm game with only smash mouth covers.

110
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,601
Just make something that means something to you.

111
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:24,564
If you make a game infused with your carefully considered thoughts, feelings, hopes, dreams,

112
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:28,826
and taste, your game will be so much more interesting than the next clone of something

113
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:29,246
popular.

114
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:32,048
There are so many bland and flavorless games in the world.

115
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:33,588
Let's not make any more of them.

116
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:34,889
Thanks.

117
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,089
Thank you.

118
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:52,320
One moment.

119
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:04,913
Next up is Tanya.

120
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:20,254
Hi everyone, I'm Tanya, the captain of Kit Fox Games, a small studio in Montreal, Canada.

121
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:25,316
You need to know how to take care of yourself and meet your hard deadlines.

122
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:30,897
Everyone in this room thinks probably that their number one priority is to make a great

123
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:31,237
game.

124
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:33,458
Yes, we all want to make a great game.

125
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:37,199
But it's actually your number three priority, I'm afraid,

126
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:40,420
because your number one priority, unfortunately,

127
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:42,201
is to not die.

128
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:46,603
And it's important that you survive

129
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:48,764
making this hopefully great game,

130
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:51,285
because your next game will be better.

131
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:57,106
Okay? Get that through your head that you need to survive because you're going to keep making games,

132
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:00,247
god damn it, and you're going to make them better and better every time.

133
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:07,909
So who here has trouble with deadlines? Oh wow, really? And do you have trouble taking

134
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:12,910
care of yourself while you're meeting the deadlines? All right, so I'm going to tell you a secret.

135
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,991
All right?

136
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:15,492
It's really hard.

137
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:18,313
It is really, really hard.

138
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,354
And I'm not going to lie.

139
00:07:19,374 --> 00:07:21,075
It's a constant struggle.

140
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:23,717
And any time you succeed, you should absolutely

141
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:27,059
take a moment and appreciate what you've done.

142
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,460
Because taking care of yourself is hard.

143
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:31,422
But you can do it.

144
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:32,622
I believe in you.

145
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:34,744
And you need to believe in yourself, too,

146
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:39,327
because that is step one of my miracle cure for death.

147
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,869
I know that it's possible because Kit Fox doesn't crunch.

148
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:48,252
We do a couple of weeks of overtime here and there as needed, but we made both Shattered

149
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:53,335
Planet and Moon Hunters without burnout and these other much superior games were also

150
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:54,396
made without burnout.

151
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:55,757
So it is possible.

152
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:56,537
All right.

153
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:57,458
So now everyone believes.

154
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:58,038
It's possible.

155
00:07:58,198 --> 00:07:58,458
Great.

156
00:07:58,819 --> 00:07:59,279
What next?

157
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,883
So the next thing is those of you who haven't set specific work hours, cut it out.

158
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:08,504
because it's bad for you and you do less.

159
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:10,885
You will actually accomplish more

160
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,647
if you stop working so much.

161
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,688
And you'll thank me, believe me.

162
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,950
If you're not prioritizing your tasks.

163
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,111
That's the next secret.

164
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:25,932
We're getting into deep secret territory at this point.

165
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,754
If you have a deadline coming up in a couple of weeks,

166
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:31,276
it's really important that what you're doing right now

167
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:34,718
is actually important, and not just urgent,

168
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:36,819
because if you start focusing too much

169
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,040
on the emails in your inbox

170
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,541
and the things happening tomorrow,

171
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:43,143
you'll never actually get into the steady workflow

172
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:44,323
that makes your game good.

173
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,371
So reprioritize as often as you need.

174
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,072
And estimate your tasks.

175
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:53,072
Some of you don't estimate your tasks.

176
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:54,392
Did you know that?

177
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:56,333
Like, you don't actually think,

178
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:57,733
how long is this gonna take me?

179
00:08:58,393 --> 00:08:59,734
And then when you're done with the task,

180
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:01,334
you don't think, how long did that take me?

181
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:02,795
Do that.

182
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:05,735
And that is secret number four, okay?

183
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:07,576
If you're not estimating, you should,

184
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:09,316
because it's a skill that takes time.

185
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:13,619
And if a deadline is coming up, and you can tell

186
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,661
it's more than two weeks away, you're not gonna make it.

187
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,223
So, okay, your first thought is going to be,

188
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:21,344
let's work more.

189
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:23,445
It's three weeks, three months away,

190
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:26,407
but you know, if I just work harder, it'll be fine.

191
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,008
No, you're gonna die, okay?

192
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:31,790
Because three weeks of 60 hours, scientifically,

193
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,032
is less productive, creatively, industrially.

194
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,573
It doesn't matter what work you're doing,

195
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:37,134
you're doing it worse.

196
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:41,196
and your brain doesn't realize it because it feels awesome

197
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:43,057
because you're putting in everything

198
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:45,158
and you're bleeding all over it and it's great.

199
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:46,538
But too bad.

200
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,220
Those of you who have the magical thinking problem

201
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,402
of thinking that you are special and exceptional to this,

202
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:54,342
you are wrong.

203
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:56,844
They actually did a study on people who think

204
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,725
they need less than seven hours of sleep.

205
00:09:59,285 --> 00:09:59,945
They don't exist.

206
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:03,407
Five out of 100 people who think that are correct.

207
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,227
So 95 wrong.

208
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:04,387
Yeah.

209
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:12,178
The good news is that these secrets are actually just standard production.

210
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,920
And production is a skill like any other skill and it's a really boring one that nobody thinks

211
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,842
is very exciting, I guess, because programming, designing and art is much more exciting for

212
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:23,722
my time, at least.

213
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:28,304
But as long as you keep trying to get better, then you will, because that's how skills work.

214
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:31,382
And it's important that you don't give up

215
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:34,365
because you're going to keep making games.

216
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:36,827
Even if you realize I haven't taken as good care of myself

217
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:38,968
as I deserve, that's all right.

218
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:41,370
Forgive yourself, be kind to yourself.

219
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:43,512
Because we are primates.

220
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:47,435
Primates need food and shelter and belonging.

221
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:51,578
Primates need to be taken care of in a way that games don't.

222
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:55,541
Burnout isn't really about working a certain number of hours.

223
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,583
Everyone has different work habits.

224
00:10:58,263 --> 00:11:03,927
A few long nights aren't going to kill you, but a few long months might, especially when

225
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:07,550
combined with death or disease or other problems that are real.

226
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:11,173
Burnout is the feeling of becoming slowly dulled

227
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,056
as layer after layer of exhaustion accumulates,

228
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:15,277
weighing down on you.

229
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:17,560
Burnout is the void left behind

230
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,662
where the rest of your career would have been.

231
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,545
Burnout is the exhausted bitterness

232
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:25,468
where your passion and your excitement used to be.

233
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:27,970
But you could choose differently.

234
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,934
You don't have to suffer to make great games.

235
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:35,751
The moment we are in right now will not come again.

236
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:40,576
We are here in Moscone Center of San Francisco, USA,

237
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:42,418
planet Earth, breathing this air

238
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,662
and contemplating these great games because we're alive.

239
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:49,166
And everyone here watching this at home

240
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:50,848
or in this room will die.

241
00:11:53,107 --> 00:12:02,714
So, even if we create a masterpiece beloved for a thousand years, our existence here and now will be gone forever.

242
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:14,823
So it's up to you to protect what time and love and joy you have left in you and not use it up making yourself feel more productive.

243
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:20,211
If it helps, envision your dedication to self-care

244
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:21,072
as a sword.

245
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:24,695
See the darkness of burnout gathering around you

246
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:27,358
as a shadow, stealing away your concentration

247
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:29,080
and your still-beating heart.

248
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,583
Be disciplined, warrior of light and courage.

249
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:35,326
Fight on, take care of yourself,

250
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:37,508
and survive to make more games.

251
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,329
Thank you.

252
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:55,241
Thank you, Tonya.

253
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:56,203
All right.

254
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:03,000
Please welcome Jared.

255
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,835
All right. Hey, y'all. I'm Jared Huntley. I'm a instructor, game programmer from Cleveland,

256
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:22,879
Ohio. I'm working on a game called Art Club Challenge. Co-authoring a book, I help manage

257
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,163
the local community in Cleveland. And today I come to you with my background as an indie

258
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:32,207
musician. I've probably played a couple hundred shows. Right now I play bass in my brother's

259
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:35,831
band, Jewel Big Green. At some point I was hit with this idea.

260
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:41,073
My brother is an indie musician. He travels around for self‑promotion. He's self‑funded

261
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:46,275
and he's pursuing a creative endeavor. I'm an indie game dev. I travel around for self‑promotion.

262
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:50,676
I'm self‑funded and I'm pursuing a creative endeavor. So...

263
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:56,702
all indie game devs are indie musicians. So if anybody asks you what you do, just tell

264
00:13:56,742 --> 00:14:02,829
them I'm a rock star. And you can point them to me. So after my discovery, I was doing

265
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:06,614
some research into the subject to see what else is different, what else is the same,

266
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,697
what we can learn from each other. So quick point.

267
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:17,288
I'm specifically talking about the genres of indie rock and metal because Cleveland

268
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:19,589
is the metal capital of the USA.

269
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,851
Anyways, what can we learn from indie musicians?

270
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:28,072
So, first, how do you get started in game development?

271
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:29,893
How do you get started in music?

272
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:32,656
The way to get started in music is just to pick up the instrument.

273
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:37,820
There's nothing that compares to picking up the instrument, playing out a tune, making

274
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,543
mistakes, learning how to function with it.

275
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:43,565
It's the same with game development.

276
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:46,348
There's nothing like making mistakes and just doing it.

277
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:53,213
It might be you get a music instructor, you might find lessons on YouTube, but there's

278
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:56,416
nothing that compares to actually playing with the instrument.

279
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:02,103
Next, this is an argument I've heard maybe a hundred times about the title of indie game

280
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:08,007
developer. I've heard people say, well, you need to have sold a commercial game. You need to

281
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:13,049
have studied it in school. You need to have this or that. This is my take on it. You make

282
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:15,491
games, you're a game dev. With music, you ‑‑

283
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:19,235
pick up an instrument, you're a musician. You're not a great musician. You have a lot

284
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:25,122
to learn. You have a lot to go from there. But there's no such thing as a hobby musician.

285
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:29,687
I don't see why game development should be any different. And especially in today's world,

286
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:34,053
I don't like titles that exclude people and make people feel like they don't belong.

287
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:42,434
Also, on that point, just because you make games doesn't mean you're immediately qualified

288
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:44,596
to run a profitable small company.

289
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:46,378
That's a completely different topic.

290
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,001
We'll visit that later.

291
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,505
And lastly, is inspiration.

292
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:58,034
I typically hear games described as X game plus Y game or X game plus Y game minus Z

293
00:15:58,054 --> 00:15:58,274
game.

294
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:02,216
What about games inspired by your favorite place, your favorite dish, the sound of your

295
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:03,096
grandmother's voice?

296
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:08,699
It's fairly common to have songs inspired by a hard breakup, an awesome trip or friendship.

297
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,742
I think great games that are doing things like this are Sybil, Imaginal, Emily is Away.

298
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:17,985
I'd love to see more games explore just these common human experiences.

299
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:29,339
So now that we've learned some things from how we're similar to indie musicians, what are some things that we can do to work together?

300
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,921
First is hire indie musicians. I see this fairly often.

301
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:41,526
just hiring a band to do music for your game. But one of the things that I'd like to add

302
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:46,249
on to it is don't overlook your local bands and your local music scene. On top of having

303
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:51,173
a custom tailored sound track to your game, it's part of your identity as a city, state

304
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:51,854
and country.

305
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:58,172
Next is creating an art manifesto. I know there's game collectives and game manifestos, but

306
00:16:58,192 --> 00:17:03,256
if you look at classical manifestos, they often included people from different disciplines. It

307
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:07,920
was about artists supporting movements with their chosen mediums. So what would an art

308
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,824
collective with a potter, an indie game, an indie musician and a dancer produce? Those are

309
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:14,786
the weird questions I'd like to see answered.

310
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:21,091
Lastly, go on tour with the band. Think about this scenario where you have an indie band that

311
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:25,954
does the soundtrack for your game and then when they go on tour, you go on tour with them. As

312
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:29,837
they're up there playing on the stage and they have their merch booth, you're selling your game

313
00:17:29,877 --> 00:17:34,000
in the back. It's a built‑in fan base. It could be an alternative business model.

314
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:38,006
So in closing, there's a lot of other fields

315
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:39,267
that we can learn from.

316
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:41,008
There's a lot of other cousins out there.

317
00:17:41,368 --> 00:17:43,429
I could've easily given a similar talk

318
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,370
on the aggressive inline skating scene.

319
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,732
There's a lot of different, we're not all gone.

320
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:49,552
There's a few of us.

321
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:51,593
Seriously.

322
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,576
But there's a lot of other cousins out there

323
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:56,456
that we can learn from.

324
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,357
I know that the game industry is different

325
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,297
and things are different,

326
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,959
but we're not as different as we think sometimes.

327
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,273
Also as I mentioned, Cleveland is a musical city, so it's no coincidence I'm up here talking

328
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:07,853
about music.

329
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:12,816
So diversity in the industry means supporting different people from different places.

330
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:16,438
As we support more diverse people, we'll get newer and more rad ideas.

331
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:20,380
And lastly, I'll leave you with one indie music tradition.

332
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,841
This one is as old as time.

333
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:27,364
If you're ever on tour passing through Cleveland, hit me up, let me know, we have a place for

334
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:28,445
you to stay, we'll hang out.

335
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:30,646
You all rock.

336
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:31,746
And thank you.

337
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:45,440
Thank you, Jared.

338
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,962
All right.

339
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:55,897
Please welcome Sadia.

340
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:07,124
Good evening, everyone.

341
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:10,745
My name is Sadia Bashir, and I'm the founder of Pixel Art Games Academy,

342
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:15,487
which is the first and only game development academy in Pakistan.

343
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,228
During my professional development,

344
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:22,129
there were no place to learn and experiment new ideas in Pakistan,

345
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:26,330
and I could feel the pain of learning everything on your own.

346
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,931
So I started this academy where people can actually learn

347
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,211
and experiment new ideas

348
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:34,412
and actually make new and awesome amazing video games.

349
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:37,493
So today I'm going to talk about a few things that,

350
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,254
my topic is three things that can save Indians

351
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,155
from a pitfall, and especially if you are in

352
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,876
emerging industries like Pakistan.

353
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:49,177
In most emerging industries, you don't really have

354
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:52,558
much of professional veterans, and you can't really learn

355
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:56,660
anything from professionals, maybe,

356
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,561
but most of the things you learn is from your own mistakes.

357
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:14,440
So I'm going to talk about few things that I learned from my own mistakes and also from my seven year experience in professional industry and my research thesis of contemporary practices of video game development in industry.

358
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:22,114
Often we think a great game idea is something that make our game successful.

359
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:26,839
And we believe in that creative vision that this is going to sell our game.

360
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,803
But a process is something that makes a complete product.

361
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:37,572
I have seen many studios and many projects fail just because they could not actually

362
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:40,776
utilize their resources properly in their process.

363
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:46,804
And this drove me, this get to me the bottom of, I'm sorry.

364
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:50,566
This drove me to get to the bottom of production processes

365
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:53,728
and learn what can make a product successful

366
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,549
and what can actually sink the ship.

367
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:57,570
So I'm going to talk about three things.

368
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,471
And the first thing that I would like to talk about

369
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,432
is conceptualize at an early stage.

370
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:05,314
Often we start our games from an idea from a team member

371
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:08,115
and we immediately try to prototype it

372
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:09,896
and implement in the form of prototype.

373
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:13,498
And here we miss an important step,

374
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:15,479
which is the conceptualization.

375
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,460
Chances are you have a great idea

376
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,541
and great vision behind your idea,

377
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:24,323
but creating your idea into a complete framework

378
00:21:24,403 --> 00:21:27,085
and a balanced game design is something that's imperative.

379
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:29,486
So here's a few things that can help you

380
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:33,268
to actually conceptualize your idea at an early stage.

381
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:37,594
Define your goals clearly from the player's perspective.

382
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,918
You should know that what thing can make your,

383
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,021
what would be that one thing

384
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:45,485
which actually help your player to,

385
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:48,890
which makes your game fun for a player as well.

386
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:52,935
Define the similarities of your game with other games.

387
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:56,499
It's perfectly okay to draw inspiration from other games,

388
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:59,182
but do not try to copy the entire idea.

389
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:02,906
Create a game progression, level of difficulty,

390
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:04,868
and level of achievement in your game,

391
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,871
and keep checking if your game is still fun.

392
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:11,924
Second most important thing is the freezing the requirement of your games.

393
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:17,848
Most of the time we keep adding new ideas and new features in our game even until the

394
00:22:17,948 --> 00:22:23,451
end of very end of our production processes and we ended up with the feature creep in

395
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:24,072
our products.

396
00:22:25,493 --> 00:22:30,336
It's very important to freeze the requirement and scope of your game at certain point of

397
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:36,260
your production processes to avoid feature creep.

398
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:45,797
Third and most important thing is about quality of a product and a quality of a process.

399
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:53,423
Most of the products, a quality of a product is very much dependent on the quality of a

400
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:58,227
process. Most of the game developers do not really think about formalizing their development

401
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:03,971
processes, which I think is the most important thing to do even before starting up your game.

402
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:07,854
In my research, most of the Indies shows that they use

403
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:11,036
ad hoc and agile game development processes for their games.

404
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:14,958
Agile development processes actually use much more

405
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,100
iteration in design and testing phase,

406
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,742
and you have to go back to the requirement

407
00:23:19,862 --> 00:23:21,843
and design phase for each iteration.

408
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:27,125
The most common problem with agile development processes are unlimited iteration, which often

409
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:33,487
lead you to untracked changes, unclear planning, future creep, and extension of development

410
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:41,329
processes, which may actually lead to an increased development cost, which by the way is bad

411
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:43,009
news if you are an indie developer.

412
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:56,178
So I would recommend you to use hybrid game development processes, which is the mix of agile processes and a traditional development life cycle processes, which is traditional software development life cycles.

413
00:23:56,698 --> 00:24:05,504
So in hybrid process, we aim to minimize the iteration between phases so you can actually minimize the cost of creating a game.

414
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:06,745
There are many...

415
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,569
There are many ways to create a complete game.

416
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,173
That will not actually guarantee the success of your game,

417
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:17,618
but it will guarantee that it will reduce the cost

418
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:20,361
of your game and it will help you to optimize

419
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,923
the use of your resources.

420
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:24,166
You may fail in the end,

421
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:26,228
but I hope it will not be a disaster.

422
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:26,829
Thank you.

423
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:57,029
Please welcome Marvin.

424
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:04,012
Applause

425
00:25:05,813 --> 00:25:07,093
Holy dilly, that's a lot of people.

426
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:09,734
G'day everyone, my name is Marvin Exposito.

427
00:25:09,754 --> 00:25:12,735
I'm a game designer from Brisbane, Australia.

428
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:17,137
I'm here to talk about subverting expectations and sharing with your dad.

429
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:17,197
Um...

430
00:25:19,138 --> 00:25:21,759
So I've been making games now for about two years.

431
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,581
I mostly make games based on terrible ideas.

432
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:29,923
So that's games based on incredible mundane boring things

433
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:32,884
like cats that get into trouble or maybe games that are slightly weirder

434
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:37,666
like giant muscly ducks getting into trouble or games especially

435
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:42,068
about things that are both weird and a little bit mundane.

436
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:45,169
And sometimes people send these suggestions to me on Twitter.

437
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:48,191
That's my Twitter up there, at bonerman underscore ink.

438
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:51,152
And here's an example of one of those games.

439
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:54,795
This is an office fart simulator where people,

440
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:56,796
where you need to fart in an office without,

441
00:25:57,997 --> 00:25:59,738
you know, avoiding detection.

442
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:00,979
Pardon me.

443
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,361
As you can see, your co-workers don't quite like it

444
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:06,622
when you drop your guts, as we say down under.

445
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:13,827
And this is a game about being an adult and paying your bills.

446
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:16,629
This is basically what happens to me

447
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:18,690
whenever there's a Steam sale on as well.

448
00:26:26,988 --> 00:26:30,509
The reason I bring these games up is these games are fake games.

449
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:34,390
They don't exist in the real world as a real playable game that you can download or buy

450
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,330
or whatever.

451
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,771
They exist solely to deliver a punchline, which is exactly how Shower With Your Dad

452
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:42,791
seemed later 2015, Do You Still Shower With Your Dad?

453
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:45,152
That's the full title, started out.

454
00:26:45,452 --> 00:26:47,873
It started out simply as this GIF.

455
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:54,754
It was a joke on Twitter that went too far and ended up being my very first ever commercially

456
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:55,454
released game.

457
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:57,795
Thank you.

458
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:05,077
And for my first ever commercially released title, I was pretty happy with how well it's

459
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:05,317
done.

460
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:09,039
So far to date, it's sold over 325,000 copies.

461
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:14,780
It's got a 95% positive rating on Steam from over 6,000 reviews.

462
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:21,222
And I attribute a lot of the game's success to the way that the game used subversion.

463
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:24,183
Now, when I'm talking about subversion, I'm not talking about...

464
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:26,124
What have I done?

465
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:29,520
this thing, which you might be familiar with

466
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,861
if you're a programmer or have worked with programmers.

467
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,982
I'm talking about the definition here,

468
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:38,624
which is where you establish a set of rules or a pattern

469
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:41,706
and then you undermine it or you turn it on its head.

470
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:43,607
And this is something that happened

471
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:45,267
through both the marketing of the game,

472
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:48,309
albeit accidentally, and intentionally

473
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:50,910
through the gameplay with positive results.

474
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,232
So this is what the Steam Greenlight campaign

475
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:55,893
looked a little bit like when it first came out.

476
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:57,994
So, when the game was first announced,

477
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:05,681
it had this incredibly gimmicky title

478
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,582
and this incredibly low quality trailer.

479
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,344
As I was recording this trailer,

480
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:11,806
people were actually sending me messages on Steam

481
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:13,907
and so you could hear the little notification noise

482
00:28:14,368 --> 00:28:15,509
as a part of the trailer itself.

483
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:20,791
So people had built up this image in their minds that this was going to be this garbage,

484
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:21,871
low-level, quality game.

485
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:28,393
But the main thing it did was it got critics and the press talking about the game.

486
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:33,154
So you can see there, normally when you see a game on Steam Greenlight, you'll see the

487
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:37,656
most views when it's first announced, and that kind of tails off over time.

488
00:28:38,276 --> 00:28:42,197
Because of the coverage it got, it actually got a second bump, almost as big.

489
00:28:43,117 --> 00:28:45,158
as the initial sort of press it got.

490
00:28:45,738 --> 00:28:47,099
And so people were talking about the game.

491
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:49,980
And at that point, this high-quality trailer,

492
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,402
which was a parody of Kanye West's Power,

493
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:57,504
except Shower was the theme, was released.

494
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:03,829
The video was done by a guy called Everdrede who's currently working on the Tingler as well with Zoe Quinn

495
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:09,695
And also did the trailer for Undertale, but this incredible high quality trailer came out a few days later

496
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,899
And you can see that well it didn't get as many views

497
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,504
Because of this high quality trailer it actually got more yes votes compared to the number of views

498
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:20,166
It was a higher quality of view

499
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:25,668
to the Steam Greenlight page than the initial low-quality trailer.

500
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:29,809
So I was able to maximize the audience of who saw or who heard about the game.

501
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:33,129
So by building up this facade and then subverting it,

502
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,550
I was able to make the marketing of the game a little bit more memorable.

503
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,311
And this is something that happens throughout the core game itself.

504
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:44,092
So if you're not familiar with the game, it's a fast-paced dad-matching game.

505
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:46,613
We have to guide your child to its dad.

506
00:29:47,393 --> 00:29:50,273
And there's a power-up there. You can see it's shaved the dad's.

507
00:29:51,614 --> 00:29:52,994
That's the entirety of the power-up.

508
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,515
But that's the core gameplay loop.

509
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:59,057
This is something that just happens as the game goes on.

510
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:01,278
But then eventually, the next thing you know,

511
00:30:01,358 --> 00:30:02,918
you're in a point-and-click adventure game

512
00:30:02,998 --> 00:30:05,439
where you are a pantsless cop dad.

513
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,501
And the idea is that you need to get the shower up and running again

514
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:11,641
because the hot water system isn't working.

515
00:30:12,742 --> 00:30:14,883
You know, very much inspired by Frog Fractions.

516
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:20,975
And the reason why these sort of moments are memorable to people is because it turns out

517
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:22,876
people really fucking love surprises.

518
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:28,260
So this is the results of a scientific study, I forgot which university it was but there's

519
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,542
a link down the bottom left there if you want to look up more about it.

520
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:34,625
What they did was they got these test subjects, these people, hooked them up to MRI machines

521
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:37,967
and then at regular intervals squirted liquid into their mouth.

522
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:40,349
It was either juice or water.

523
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,032
And everyone had a preference for either juice or water.

524
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:49,498
But what they found was that if you squirted liquid at an unpredictable rate, that actually

525
00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:53,863
drove enjoyment way more than if you got a preference for juice or water at a predictable

526
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:54,143
rate.

527
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:57,286
So people just loved the surprise aspect of it a lot more.

528
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,227
But the subversion is just one aspect of the game.

529
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:04,388
Obviously the incredibly long, ridiculous title

530
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:04,988
acts as a hook.

531
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:07,569
It's got a very accessible price point

532
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:08,589
which encourages gifting.

533
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,550
And the core gameplay loop, I reckon, anyway,

534
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,191
is interesting enough on its own.

535
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:16,771
But hopefully that inspires you to add

536
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,912
a little bit more surprise and subversions in your game.

537
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:19,392
Thank you.

538
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:35,583
Thank you Marvin.

539
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:36,484
All right.

540
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:49,833
Please welcome Gemma.

541
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,982
Hi, my name's Gemma, and I'm an indie developer.

542
00:32:01,582 --> 00:32:03,343
And ordinarily, in a venue like this one,

543
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:05,584
that might sound like a weird sort of confession

544
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:07,025
or even an attempt at humor,

545
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:10,046
drawing upon the shared background level discomfort

546
00:32:10,106 --> 00:32:12,367
many of us might feel about this career path

547
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:13,328
and medium we've chosen.

548
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:15,229
Some sort of gallows humor, I guess.

549
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:17,430
But for me, this is a genuine statement,

550
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,651
which I actually find myself having to reinforce

551
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:22,813
time after time to others as much as to myself.

552
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:24,073
For example,

553
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:27,910
A little while ago I was at a gathering of Stockholm indies,

554
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:29,812
one I've attended for a couple of years now

555
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:31,274
since that's the city where I live.

556
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:34,177
Chatting away in a 400 year old beer cellar

557
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:35,558
about this medium we all love,

558
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:38,381
when the developer I'm talking to starts in surprise.

559
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:40,944
You're an indie developer, he says?

560
00:32:40,964 --> 00:32:43,206
I thought you were just a student or something.

561
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:46,449
It's an assessment which is not negative per se,

562
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,651
but is also not at all rare for me.

563
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:53,527
In correcting him, I had to explain how I've been in industry for six years,

564
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:55,927
how instead I lecture students at universities,

565
00:32:56,207 --> 00:33:00,229
and how at the time I was working to found what is now a studio called Kaleidoscope.

566
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:03,870
Despite having worked on around a dozen indie-scale projects,

567
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,071
people still get surprised when I tell them that,

568
00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:09,112
apparently despite appearances, I am an indie.

569
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,933
And I suspect I'm not the only one for whom this is the case.

570
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:15,650
It's a problem which at first felt like one of gender bias,

571
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,413
given that I do identify and present myself as female.

572
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:21,316
Then I began to wonder about somehow broadcasting

573
00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:23,698
my own imposter syndrome, telepathically

574
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,722
infecting the outside world with taints upon my own confidence.

575
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:30,503
But when I worked to get over that particular kind

576
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:32,684
of nonsense, I began to wonder if it's perhaps

577
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:33,765
because of something else.

578
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:37,046
What if the reason some of us don't pass for Indie

579
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:39,148
is because our community and culture

580
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:40,468
is still being misrepresented?

581
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,070
Whilst we can all sit here and know that,

582
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,252
from practical experience, and at least to some degree,

583
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:48,433
the Indie sphere is a diverse one,

584
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:51,835
the outside world, and therefore the stereotypical view

585
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:54,357
of an Indie developer, arguably still see

586
00:33:54,397 --> 00:33:55,898
what we do as something like this.

587
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:59,730
namely white men either crunching away in bedrooms

588
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,571
and small offices surrounded by toys,

589
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:04,233
or cafes and trendy co-working spaces

590
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,894
surrounded instead by modern art.

591
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:08,876
That said, part of our development process

592
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:10,677
does take place in a London cafe,

593
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:12,158
so for Kaleidoscope at least,

594
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:13,839
there is a small element of truth

595
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,260
in Jonathan Blow's muffin there.

596
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:20,349
My point being that whilst these are not bad things in and of themselves,

597
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:23,811
there are a slew of cultural trappings wrapped up in particularly the formal

598
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:28,294
interpretation of what indie is, which at best misrepresent most of us and how we

599
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:31,897
work, and at worst glamorize some rather horrifying working practices.

600
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:36,100
Though amusing at first, images, articles, and ideas

601
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,480
like that of the ramen scoffing bedsit dweller

602
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:41,402
still saturate search terms relating to our own career

603
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:41,762
niche.

604
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,543
Nothing about this should really be aspirational.

605
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:47,224
And yet for some, this notion of caffeine addicted,

606
00:34:47,324 --> 00:34:50,265
stay-at-home indies who have to be reminded to put clothes on

607
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,866
and go outside in an embarrassing number of articles

608
00:34:53,546 --> 00:34:56,908
is somehow the lodestar which we and they are navigating towards.

609
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:03,413
Insofar as we have any label, I'd rather espouse and aspire to the positive aspects of it, thank you very much.

610
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:08,798
But why are these ideas of India's label and how Indy we are even important?

611
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:11,681
I offer two main reasons, one of which is personal.

612
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:15,182
Indie game development and the communities within it

613
00:35:15,242 --> 00:35:16,563
are a part of my identity.

614
00:35:16,904 --> 00:35:18,685
And when somebody I'm meeting for the first time

615
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:21,547
cuts through pointless small talk to ask a good question,

616
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:24,108
like, what do you choose to do with your limited time

617
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,510
upon this earth, I like being able to say

618
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,092
that I enjoy interactive and accessible experiences

619
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:32,474
for people to enjoy, to learn from, escape to,

620
00:35:32,894 --> 00:35:35,776
or whatever it is that they and I fancy doing at that time.

621
00:35:36,897 --> 00:35:40,580
Another reason is broader reaching than that, and to bluntly summarize,

622
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:46,126
I don't think that something as inspiring as what we should do should be seen, again stereotypically,

623
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:51,671
solely as the domain of privileged individuals who can afford, financially or physically,

624
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:53,813
to spend months on voluntary crunch.

625
00:35:54,634 --> 00:35:59,857
Working out of a backpack and generally letting standards of living slip for oneself and for

626
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:04,761
one's collaborators just to get the game done doesn't work for everybody. Nor do I think

627
00:36:04,821 --> 00:36:09,204
anybody should feel pressured into that kind of lifestyle or be judged for having priorities

628
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:12,226
elsewhere and therefore not being able to match up to that ideal.

629
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,191
Do we really want indie to be seen as a single,

630
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:18,012
homogenous strand of game creation?

631
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,433
Or can we perhaps shift the focus ourselves?

632
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:22,834
A five-minute soapbox is a tough space

633
00:36:22,874 --> 00:36:24,415
in which to try and offer solutions.

634
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:27,797
But insofar as people do listen to us as indie creators,

635
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:30,018
I think it's our duty to talk more about

636
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:33,079
just what it is that we do, privileges, hardships, and all.

637
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,500
So as to dispel the illusion that we're still

638
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,881
all living an indie game-the-movie lifestyle.

639
00:36:38,992 --> 00:36:41,013
I'm afforded some social privileges myself.

640
00:36:41,393 --> 00:36:43,754
My place is that of one who can occasionally travel

641
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:45,975
to game jams and conferences, and can

642
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,096
devote a portion of her life to passion projects

643
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,397
and to advocacy work.

644
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,218
But in other ways, I am an atypical indie,

645
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:55,280
as I suspect the vast majority of us actually are.

646
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:01,764
So for venues beyond this one, let's see if we can shift the conversation a little bit,

647
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:06,006
move the idea of indiness away from something which is literally all-consuming

648
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:09,328
to one which is more realistic and frankly more respectful.

649
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:13,550
Because our chosen place is that of indies and this space is what we make of it.

650
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:14,591
Thank you.

651
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:30,253
Thank you so much, John.

652
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:30,934
That was great.

653
00:37:31,394 --> 00:37:31,714
All right.

654
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:37,880
Oh.

655
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:42,183
Jerry.

656
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:42,984
Jerry.

657
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:45,727
Jerry.

658
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:47,348
Wait for it, Jerry.

659
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:50,851
It's going to happen, Jerry.

660
00:37:50,891 --> 00:37:51,331
Hang in there.

661
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:01,435
All right, please welcome Jerry.

662
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,046
I don't think that bit ever gets old.

663
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:13,368
I'm Jerry Bellick.

664
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:16,570
I'm a professor of game design at Miami University.

665
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,812
I'm also working on my MFA in experience design.

666
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:24,295
And at Miami, I'm part of the interactive media studies

667
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:24,996
department.

668
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:28,318
We're hoping this fall that we will officially have our game

669
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,059
design degree in place.

670
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,521
I'm also an independent game designer.

671
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:34,122
Being a teacher does not eliminate

672
00:38:34,182 --> 00:38:35,543
that part of my identity.

673
00:38:36,323 --> 00:38:42,948
I primarily do work in the medium of alternative controllers, hardware, electronics, but what

674
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:48,992
I want to talk about is why we need to Venn harder in the industries of games and academia

675
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:52,594
because they are not crossing over nearly as much as I think that they ought.

676
00:38:53,475 --> 00:39:00,596
So I think one of the biggest problems is we are lacking enough synthesis of all of the incredibly unique

677
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:06,438
experiences that all of you have. It's starting to happen, and universities are starting to get

678
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:10,899
interested, and they're starting to figure this stuff out, but we are going to lose a lot of

679
00:39:10,939 --> 00:39:17,000
incredible stuff considering the huge percentage of people that have come into the game industry,

680
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,302
whether independent or in studios, through incredibly unique paths and different kinds of

681
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:24,162
of experiences.

682
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:26,844
So schools are taking it more seriously,

683
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,445
but we still got a really long way to go.

684
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:31,466
There are opportunities, however, for all of you

685
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,309
to be involved without giving up your professional careers

686
00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:36,590
and your industry work.

687
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,012
Academia wants you to stay involved in the industry.

688
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:42,473
It's important that you do because that is where

689
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:44,995
you're going to continue getting the kinds of experiences

690
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:48,897
and unique perspectives that are going to benefit

691
00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:51,499
the students and the game designers of tomorrow.

692
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,520
And you might accidentally like it.

693
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:55,923
It's not bad.

694
00:39:57,885 --> 00:39:59,447
Educators can keep this up on their own.

695
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:01,809
A lot of them don't have the experience in the first place,

696
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,493
and we need a constant cycling and influx

697
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:07,155
if we're going to keep that fresh.

698
00:40:08,377 --> 00:40:10,299
The disparity right now can feel a little bit awkward.

699
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:15,747
So at Miami, I teach game design, development, pipeline,

700
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:18,248
production, but as I said, alternative controllers

701
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:19,228
are kind of my jam.

702
00:40:19,828 --> 00:40:22,109
And I started a class this semester teaching

703
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,989
alternative controllers as a form of design,

704
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:27,450
and it is the most interesting work that I have seen so far

705
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,050
of any of my game design students.

706
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:30,951
There's some practical reasons for that,

707
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:33,472
but I also think that it has something to do

708
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:35,692
with alternative controllers being the lens

709
00:40:35,752 --> 00:40:37,213
in which I view game design.

710
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:40,673
It is how I have explored game design intimately.

711
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:44,795
where I am most passionate and I think students are really responsive to that.

712
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:48,757
You don't know what it is you know until you teach it and I think often you get

713
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:52,419
really surprised by what it is that you do know. There is so much fresh

714
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:57,681
territory and all of you have dug in such interesting places and we need you

715
00:40:57,781 --> 00:41:01,283
to take your personal lens and let students look through that for

716
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:05,825
themselves. There are so many insights that you may have that you think are

717
00:41:05,865 --> 00:41:10,127
trivial that would be profound in the hands of the right minds, brain hands.

718
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:16,242
I am sick of this argument when it comes to game design degrees.

719
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:18,782
It drives me absolutely insane.

720
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:20,063
We're trying to get them jobs.

721
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,103
We're trying to teach them unity.

722
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:22,103
No, they've got to make games.

723
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:23,544
It's bullshit.

724
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,785
I don't believe game design is a technical vocation.

725
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:29,125
It is art.

726
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:29,865
It is design.

727
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:30,525
It is craft.

728
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:31,406
Tools are great.

729
00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:35,167
Their design work should motivate their exploration into the technical.

730
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:36,867
So what is a game designer?

731
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:41,367
I don't know, but we can't forget to teach the design part of game design.

732
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:46,912
Design exists for people, to evoke, to provoke, to help, to heal, to create meaning.

733
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:52,276
So how can we complain about derivative, boring, cookie-cutter work, copies of copies, if students

734
00:41:52,316 --> 00:41:56,619
are handed powerful tools but never taught how to think deeply about their work and about

735
00:41:56,659 --> 00:41:57,279
themselves?

736
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,981
I believe they do have the life experience.

737
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:02,922
Undergrads are young, but they have still seen a lot.

738
00:42:02,963 --> 00:42:03,843
They've done a lot.

739
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:06,464
But they need our help to understand it

740
00:42:06,564 --> 00:42:09,326
and to parse all of that information that swirls

741
00:42:09,406 --> 00:42:11,167
around their weird little souls.

742
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,381
So we're still trying to figure it out.

743
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:16,063
And I don't know that I have the answers.

744
00:42:16,323 --> 00:42:18,765
I have ideas about what the answers might look like,

745
00:42:19,146 --> 00:42:20,687
but I can't do it alone either.

746
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:22,609
We need collaboration,

747
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:25,011
especially between industry and academia,

748
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:27,474
and lots more crossover between them.

749
00:42:27,994 --> 00:42:29,876
Getting more professionals involved in education

750
00:42:29,936 --> 00:42:32,238
is not just for the students, it is also for the faculty.

751
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:33,740
Triple A independent.

752
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,141
game designer, developer, artist, journalist, producer, whatever your role is, it doesn't

753
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:43,022
matter. The variety pack is ideal. So what can you do? Well, there's adjunct teaching.

754
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:47,223
You can teach little courses over a semester and you get a few grand and you get to meet

755
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:51,584
lots of students and lots of teachers and lots of people and it's great. Universities

756
00:42:51,624 --> 00:42:56,065
are usually deeply understaffed. We really need that. Do more than one class in a semester.

757
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:57,005
Just make a package deal.

758
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:03,629
I did a semester-long residency at Eastern Kentucky University.

759
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:08,291
Got a full teacher's salary for the semester, got lots of benefits, did workshops, did all

760
00:43:08,311 --> 00:43:09,031
sorts of fun things.

761
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:09,851
It was brilliant.

762
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:11,572
And I got to be in a new place for a whole semester.

763
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,693
My talented friend Lisa Brown did that at Harrisburg University for a whole year.

764
00:43:15,713 --> 00:43:17,314
And does she want to be a teacher her whole life?

765
00:43:17,354 --> 00:43:17,414
No.

766
00:43:17,434 --> 00:43:18,514
She's a teacher.

767
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:18,874
She's a teacher.

768
00:43:18,894 --> 00:43:19,214
She's a teacher.

769
00:43:19,234 --> 00:43:19,674
She's a teacher.

770
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:20,034
She's a teacher.

771
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:20,515
She's a teacher.

772
00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:22,376
but it was great and the students are better for it.

773
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:24,779
You get benefits, funding, all that good stuff.

774
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,300
Collaboration with faculty.

775
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,242
Video call sessions with classes.

776
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:31,224
Right now we are working on a game capstone,

777
00:43:31,264 --> 00:43:32,426
which is really, really hard to do.

778
00:43:32,966 --> 00:43:34,768
Trying to emulate the trials and tribulations

779
00:43:34,808 --> 00:43:36,549
of small teams or studios working to create

780
00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:38,611
professionally viable game experiences.

781
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:40,613
And Young Horses is doing that.

782
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:45,156
It's taking only a few hours of their time, but they're allowing us a way to examine what

783
00:43:45,196 --> 00:43:45,857
it is they want.

784
00:43:45,897 --> 00:43:46,838
What are their values?

785
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:48,479
What it is that they care about?

786
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:54,363
And how do we create something or pitch something that actually makes that happen?

787
00:43:56,105 --> 00:44:04,247
Teaching may sound super duper scary, you may feel unqualified, ineloquent, and a bunch of strange people staring at you, imposter syndrome, all that good stuff.

788
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:10,168
So here's some tips. You know who else is scared? Undergrads. They're super scared. Way more scared of you than you are of them.

789
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:18,710
You only need to be a step ahead of them in most things. The real stuff is your experience, your wisdom, your lessons learned through blood, sweat, tears, and time.

790
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,171
So let's go back to our event really quick. What we are missing—

791
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:28,015
What we are missing to push the current and future students to open up to express themselves

792
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:31,717
and to make games even harder to define is all of you.

793
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:36,059
To help build the bridge, overlap the space, and share your unique experiences and perspective,

794
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:38,080
the future of games is counting on you.

795
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,260
So join us.

796
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:44,283
Take a little break from the hustle and bustle before, you know, someone destroys education.

797
00:44:52,506 --> 00:44:52,866
Thank you.

798
00:44:54,216 --> 00:45:03,504
and get in touch with me if you need more ideas. Thank you, Jerry. All right.

799
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:13,572
Please welcome Bree.

800
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:27,387
Oh, God. Okay. Hi, my name is Bree Code and I wanted to share with you everything I've

801
00:45:27,407 --> 00:45:32,008
learned about public speaking because somehow I've managed to travel full time for the past

802
00:45:32,088 --> 00:45:38,090
year and a bit speaking at conferences but I have absolutely no talent for this. The first

803
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,051
time my boss asked me to speak on camera, I forgot my own name.

804
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:42,846
I did.

805
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:47,447
15 minutes before the second talk I ever gave, a man asked me if the seat next to me was

806
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:51,789
taken and I was so nervous I couldn't understand his question and I couldn't answer and I just

807
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,190
stared at him until he walked away.

808
00:45:55,391 --> 00:45:58,712
But with each mistake like this I've changed the way I do things and I have like a really

809
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:00,192
strict process.

810
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:07,155
So a week before the first good talk I ever gave, I met with my friend Jason to get feedback

811
00:46:07,335 --> 00:46:09,196
and he patiently listened to me talk about it.

812
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:13,044
how great my slides were and how great I was for finishing them a week early.

813
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:18,839
And then when I was done, he told me that out of my 60 slides, only one was interesting.

814
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:21,399
He told me that I had to rewrite the whole talk,

815
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,081
and he was right, because that slide

816
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:24,502
was the only slide that was honest.

817
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:27,284
I learned from Jason most things I know

818
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:28,285
about how to write a talk,

819
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,346
but especially I learned to start by thinking

820
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:32,348
about what I care about and to work from there.

821
00:46:33,128 --> 00:46:34,629
Every talk I've given that fell flat

822
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:35,850
was one where I was trying to say

823
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,112
what I thought people wanted or needed to hear,

824
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,474
and now I just talk about what I care about

825
00:46:40,574 --> 00:46:41,375
and it gets much better.

826
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,683
I also decide who my audience is.

827
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:48,828
I discovered that my talks are less clear and less effective when I try to speak to

828
00:46:48,928 --> 00:46:49,328
everyone.

829
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:54,094
So now I just speak to inspire underrepresented people and not to try to convince any dudes

830
00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:57,959
who are stuck in their bad ways that they're wrong, because like our sworn enemy said,

831
00:46:57,979 --> 00:46:59,241
there are a lot of bad dudes out there.

832
00:47:01,233 --> 00:47:02,934
Once I know why I care about a topic

833
00:47:03,374 --> 00:47:05,295
and who I want to talk to, I make an outline.

834
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:08,856
The outline is simple, but I follow a very specific order.

835
00:47:09,937 --> 00:47:11,537
First, why do I care about this talk?

836
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:13,398
What am I trying to accomplish?

837
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:14,419
Why do I care about that?

838
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:17,820
Second, what is this thing that I care about?

839
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,780
What are the details?

840
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,721
What is my argument?

841
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:23,903
Third, what does this mean for you all and for myself?

842
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:26,404
What are the practical applications of this information?

843
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:27,224
What are the next steps?

844
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:31,609
And I'm a typical programmer, I'm methodical,

845
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:33,270
and I'm detail-oriented, and I'm boring.

846
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,171
And what I write, the first draft, is really boring.

847
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:38,972
But I found a management study of techniques

848
00:47:39,012 --> 00:47:41,472
that turn boring leaders into interesting leaders.

849
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:45,634
If you Google, can charisma be taught, you can find it.

850
00:47:46,234 --> 00:47:48,514
And I methodically go over each point in my outline,

851
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:49,715
and I apply these techniques.

852
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:52,996
I turn my ideas into stories, or lists, or questions,

853
00:47:53,116 --> 00:47:55,377
or metaphors, or contrasting points,

854
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:57,197
and then people seem to like them better.

855
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:01,794
And then once my outline is ready and it's more interesting,

856
00:48:01,914 --> 00:48:03,615
I just take each point of my outline

857
00:48:03,655 --> 00:48:04,595
and put them on a slide,

858
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:06,076
and it generally works out

859
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,738
to about one to two slides per minute.

860
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,540
And then I go through and replace each idea with a picture.

861
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,262
I get rid of as much text as possible,

862
00:48:14,322 --> 00:48:17,764
and I do that because I accidentally spent one talk

863
00:48:17,804 --> 00:48:19,505
just reading my slides to the audience

864
00:48:19,545 --> 00:48:21,066
and not saying what I'd planned to say.

865
00:48:21,086 --> 00:48:22,887
That was really terrible.

866
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:24,649
And then in a talk this fall,

867
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:27,090
halfway through I lost access to the notes on my screen.

868
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:29,816
because there's always technical difficulties at conferences.

869
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:32,079
And then I was horribly stuck without my notes.

870
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,785
So now I know that the pictures not only need to be guides for the audience,

871
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,087
but also for myself.

872
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:40,468
And then when my slides are done,

873
00:48:40,508 --> 00:48:43,770
I practice a lot and get feedback.

874
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,951
And I discover important things when I practice,

875
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:48,313
not just with the writing, but with myself.

876
00:48:49,153 --> 00:48:50,774
The first time I wrote a one-hour talk,

877
00:48:50,834 --> 00:48:53,356
whenever I practiced, I kept panicking halfway through

878
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:55,157
in my own apartment by myself.

879
00:48:56,037 --> 00:48:57,778
And I couldn't figure out why,

880
00:48:57,798 --> 00:48:59,219
because I'm very comfortable in my apartment.

881
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,641
And by practicing enough times,

882
00:49:01,701 --> 00:49:02,922
I noticed that I was always panicking

883
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:04,402
exactly at the 20-minute mark.

884
00:49:04,863 --> 00:49:07,124
And I realized that I was just never actually stopping

885
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:07,905
to take a breath in.

886
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:13,249
And I thought I was panicking, I was just out of breath.

887
00:49:14,509 --> 00:49:15,530
And then that made me panic.

888
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,411
So now I remember to breathe.

889
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:19,912
It's amazing.

890
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:21,853
Which brings me to my final point.

891
00:49:23,673 --> 00:49:26,195
I will always be nervous before my talks.

892
00:49:26,795 --> 00:49:28,196
Emotions exist for a reason,

893
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:30,338
and we get nerves before we talk

894
00:49:30,378 --> 00:49:32,159
because that energy helps us to deliver

895
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:34,280
at least a slightly more energetic talk.

896
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:36,882
So now when I feel nervous, instead of thinking,

897
00:49:36,902 --> 00:49:38,443
oh God, I'm so nervous, what if I faint

898
00:49:38,483 --> 00:49:39,924
in the middle of this, it's gonna be terrible,

899
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:42,646
I think, oh God, I'm really nervous

900
00:49:42,686 --> 00:49:44,547
because I'm doing a talk and I need the energy,

901
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,329
and then I'll feel better when it's done.

902
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:49,071
And this helps me deal with that overwhelming anxiety

903
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:51,312
that made me forget my own name on camera that first time.

904
00:49:52,245 --> 00:49:54,526
and I'm still really uncomfortable on stage.

905
00:49:54,606 --> 00:49:56,527
I forget to stand up straight, which I probably did,

906
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:57,268
and I forgot again.

907
00:49:57,288 --> 00:50:00,909
And sometimes I forget to talk into the microphone.

908
00:50:01,089 --> 00:50:04,811
I've done that more times than it's really embarrassing.

909
00:50:06,192 --> 00:50:08,193
But I'm working on this, and I welcome your advice.

910
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,114
And you can contact me on Twitter anytime

911
00:50:11,154 --> 00:50:12,575
if you have questions or advice,

912
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:14,415
or if you need encouragement for your own talks.

913
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:15,196
Thank you.

914
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:27,985
Thank you, Bree.

915
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:38,345
Please welcome Colm.

916
00:50:47,066 --> 00:50:49,228
Hi, everyone. My name is Colm Larkin,

917
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,491
and I'm the founder of Gamberness,

918
00:50:51,851 --> 00:50:54,454
an indie studio from Dublin, Ireland.

919
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:57,697
So I'm going to tell you a little story today

920
00:50:57,717 --> 00:50:59,720
about sharing your work, sharing your games,

921
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:02,382
and why that's important and why that helped me.

922
00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:06,287
I made a game called Guilds of Dungeoneering.

923
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:07,288
Came out in 2015.

924
00:51:10,532 --> 00:51:12,273
It was with a very, very small team.

925
00:51:12,893 --> 00:51:13,754
We had no budget.

926
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:17,115
And against the odds, I guess, we were quite successful.

927
00:51:17,735 --> 00:51:20,957
And for me, my favorite parts of that success

928
00:51:21,137 --> 00:51:23,378
were appearing in print magazines

929
00:51:23,398 --> 00:51:25,279
and when we released on mobile,

930
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:26,559
being on the front page of the App Store.

931
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:27,440
That was amazing to me.

932
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,961
And as I think back about why I was successful,

933
00:51:32,642 --> 00:51:34,843
I believe it was because I was sharing my work.

934
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,721
When I started making Gilded Engineering,

935
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:41,282
I decided to develop in the open.

936
00:51:41,922 --> 00:51:44,984
And I started a thread on TIG Source, which

937
00:51:45,064 --> 00:51:47,785
is a game development forum, and started just

938
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:49,846
sharing playable versions of the game

939
00:51:49,886 --> 00:51:51,447
and asking for feedback from day one.

940
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:53,288
And that was great.

941
00:51:53,408 --> 00:51:55,909
And I was basically following in the footsteps of people I admire

942
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:59,871
and games I admire, like Fez and Minecraft and Papers, Please.

943
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:05,762
And not only that, but I shared the idea for Guild of Dungeoneering

944
00:52:05,802 --> 00:52:09,605
before I ever started working on it to get feedback on that.

945
00:52:10,706 --> 00:52:14,669
And for me, sharing let me stop wasting my life

946
00:52:14,689 --> 00:52:17,431
not making games and actually finish some games,

947
00:52:18,412 --> 00:52:19,573
well before Guild of Dungeoneering.

948
00:52:20,113 --> 00:52:22,935
Let me become confident.

949
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:25,517
And then when I did make a commercial game,

950
00:52:26,137 --> 00:52:27,619
I believe made it much more successful.

951
00:52:29,192 --> 00:52:35,295
So I just want to take a little time and talk to you about three things about sharing that I think are very important.

952
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:40,217
So the first one is that your idea is not that special.

953
00:52:40,998 --> 00:52:47,900
So it's pretty common to have this romantic notion that you need an incredible idea to make a successful game,

954
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:50,342
or that the idea is the only thing that matters.

955
00:52:50,822 --> 00:52:51,942
And I don't think that's true at all.

956
00:52:53,523 --> 00:52:55,025
I think execution is key.

957
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:59,890
Iterating on your idea with feedback and sharing early,

958
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,413
I think, helps you shape the vision of your idea

959
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,594
into something interesting.

960
00:53:04,175 --> 00:53:07,339
I don't think an idea is actually all that important.

961
00:53:08,474 --> 00:53:13,198
And the second thing that I think is important about sharing

962
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,501
is that no one is going to steal your idea.

963
00:53:17,162 --> 00:53:21,225
So this is a very common fear, I think even maybe an excuse

964
00:53:21,846 --> 00:53:24,688
we make to ourselves so we don't have to share things.

965
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,611
you know, someone is going to see your idea

966
00:53:28,631 --> 00:53:30,272
and make a better game.

967
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:31,572
And I don't think that's true.

968
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,313
I mean, even if you share your idea

969
00:53:33,613 --> 00:53:36,195
and someone goes and makes a game based on that idea,

970
00:53:36,815 --> 00:53:38,576
your two games are going to be completely different

971
00:53:39,076 --> 00:53:39,937
by the time they come out.

972
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,878
And if, you know, the worst happens

973
00:53:41,938 --> 00:53:45,099
and someone just wholesale copies your game and your idea

974
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,240
and everything you've, you know, been sharing,

975
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:48,821
well, I've got some good news for you

976
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:51,222
because you basically have the moral high ground there

977
00:53:51,242 --> 00:53:52,463
and you have this public record of,

978
00:53:52,923 --> 00:53:53,844
you know, what you've been making.

979
00:53:54,644 --> 00:53:58,267
you get to go get some free PR and tell your story to the press, and that's cool.

980
00:54:00,009 --> 00:54:05,714
The final point I want to make is basically to share your work embarrassingly early.

981
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:08,376
I think embarrassing is a very important word there.

982
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:13,260
If you start sharing things you're proud of, you think are great,

983
00:54:14,492 --> 00:54:16,312
you've made a mistake, you're sharing too late.

984
00:54:17,372 --> 00:54:18,532
It's very important to start sharing

985
00:54:19,432 --> 00:54:21,153
when you're really embarrassed about what it is you're showing.

986
00:54:21,573 --> 00:54:22,833
And there's a few reasons for that.

987
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:26,734
So if you start sharing really early,

988
00:54:27,314 --> 00:54:28,614
there's a few great things that happen.

989
00:54:28,654 --> 00:54:30,094
So you'll save yourself time,

990
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:33,055
you won't end up going down some kind of rabbit holes of development

991
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:34,035
thinking this will be good,

992
00:54:34,235 --> 00:54:35,715
because you're getting feedback immediately

993
00:54:35,795 --> 00:54:37,235
on whether that sounds interesting.

994
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:42,116
And you'll get more basic feedback on basic parts of your game.

995
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,297
So like the idea itself.

996
00:54:43,857 --> 00:54:46,759
the concept, the setting, the very bare mechanics,

997
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:50,862
well before looking for feedback on more late stage stuff

998
00:54:50,902 --> 00:54:53,724
like polish and graphics quality.

999
00:54:54,525 --> 00:55:00,910
And this part is very hard, and practice makes perfect.

1000
00:55:02,856 --> 00:55:04,717
start doing this and it will get easier.

1001
00:55:04,898 --> 00:55:06,319
And the reason I think it's so hard

1002
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:09,341
is that you are basically sharing your rough work,

1003
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:11,162
your really bad work,

1004
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:13,144
and you're kind of comparing it mentally

1005
00:55:13,204 --> 00:55:16,066
to the best finished work of people you admire.

1006
00:55:16,086 --> 00:55:18,188
And that is very difficult.

1007
00:55:19,068 --> 00:55:20,529
And I would suggest just trying it

1008
00:55:20,649 --> 00:55:23,171
and forcing yourself to do it because it gets easier.

1009
00:55:23,732 --> 00:55:25,994
And more than that, it really helps.

1010
00:55:26,514 --> 00:55:29,496
So I believe sharing and doing this has made...

1011
00:55:30,177 --> 00:55:35,760
me a better game developer has made the games I'm making better too. So I hope you try it.

1012
00:55:36,121 --> 00:55:36,421
Thank you.

1013
00:55:37,622 --> 00:55:45,467
APPLAUSE

1014
00:55:48,609 --> 00:55:50,250
Thank you Colm. All right.

1015
00:56:01,852 --> 00:56:03,493
Please welcome our final speaker, Jane.

1016
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:13,778
Hello, everybody.

1017
00:56:14,198 --> 00:56:17,459
My name is Jane Ng, and I do 3D art at Campo Santo.

1018
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:19,300
We shipped Firewatch last year.

1019
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,762
I usually talk about environment art stuff, but today I'm going to talk about something

1020
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:24,642
very different.

1021
00:56:25,443 --> 00:56:27,644
I'm going to talk about this.

1022
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:35,117
This is a real candy bar. If it's not clear what's going on there, the tongue part is the candy.

1023
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:42,619
So do you think it matters if that candy is any good at all? No, right? Because very few

1024
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:49,282
people will want to try to eat that, right? This is a terrible product. And this is what I

1025
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:54,883
really want to talk about today. Product and why it shouldn't be a dirty word for Indies.

1026
00:56:56,149 --> 00:56:58,891
Now, a while ago I saw this tweet and I forgot who it was from.

1027
00:56:59,051 --> 00:56:59,711
It doesn't matter.

1028
00:56:59,892 --> 00:57:04,515
I'm sure most of you have heard or seen something like this in your own circle.

1029
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:11,201
There is, in my opinion, a general aversion to talking about our games as items of commerce.

1030
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,783
But we really should just stop feeling weird about it.

1031
00:57:14,784 --> 00:57:19,368
In fact, if you sell your game in any way, shape or form on any platform and you need

1032
00:57:19,388 --> 00:57:24,232
to pay your bills, and I suspect a lot of us in this room do or want to, then we need

1033
00:57:24,252 --> 00:57:24,912
to talk about it.

1034
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:25,113
Thank you.

1035
00:57:25,865 --> 00:57:30,108
Why? Because this is the age of Let's Play videos and refunds.

1036
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:33,050
A lot of people, even people who love your game,

1037
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:36,331
don't have to buy anymore to check it out or experience it.

1038
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:42,938
Now as indies I've always been very grateful how supportive we are to each other.

1039
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:47,781
And you know, you always can get help with your game idea or if you need feedback on

1040
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,142
a prototype, you know, there's always help.

1041
00:57:50,743 --> 00:57:56,086
But I rarely see anyone ask, hey, what do you think of my copywriting?

1042
00:57:56,607 --> 00:58:00,509
Or even would you pay money for this if you saw this on Steam?

1043
00:58:02,163 --> 00:58:04,524
I know it's a very uncomfortable thing to ask

1044
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:05,825
or even to think about,

1045
00:58:05,965 --> 00:58:08,526
because it is very uncomfortable to acknowledge

1046
00:58:08,566 --> 00:58:12,168
that a great game experience is not the same thing

1047
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:14,048
as a good entertainment product

1048
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:15,569
that people might want to buy.

1049
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,190
Now in our ideals,

1050
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,471
we think that great games should be rewarded,

1051
00:58:20,491 --> 00:58:23,092
that we think people should buy great games.

1052
00:58:23,952 --> 00:58:25,673
And we want it to be true so much

1053
00:58:25,853 --> 00:58:27,654
that we sometimes forget that this is not,

1054
00:58:27,714 --> 00:58:29,375
in fact, a causal relationship.

1055
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:34,034
In game design, we are often urged to make decisions

1056
00:58:34,254 --> 00:58:36,476
in the interest of the player, and that's great.

1057
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:39,458
And all I'm saying here is that we spend a little time

1058
00:58:39,859 --> 00:58:42,841
considering our game outside of the game experience itself

1059
00:58:43,262 --> 00:58:45,784
from the perspective of your potential player,

1060
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:48,206
someone who has not even played your game.

1061
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:51,449
Now, how would your game look to this potential player?

1062
00:58:52,049 --> 00:58:53,070
Is it attractive?

1063
00:58:55,056 --> 00:58:58,800
I strongly believe that you can have a game that people want to own that is also 100%

1064
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:00,121
yours.

1065
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:05,987
Evaluating your game honestly from the perspective of a consumer is not compromising the creative

1066
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:07,708
integrity of your game at all.

1067
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,971
And this is not just a business thing.

1068
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:14,575
So don't fret about how, oh, but I don't have a business person.

1069
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,621
In fact, I think a lot of this is really more

1070
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:18,722
of a design problem.

1071
00:59:19,262 --> 00:59:22,025
And don't forget that product design is a big field

1072
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:24,386
outside of games, and a lot of the lessons

1073
00:59:24,446 --> 00:59:25,908
do apply to video games.

1074
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:29,610
The good news is, most game developers

1075
00:59:29,851 --> 00:59:31,532
are very well equipped to tackle

1076
00:59:31,612 --> 00:59:33,493
multidisciplinary design problems.

1077
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:36,135
And a lot of aspects of making a good product

1078
00:59:36,676 --> 00:59:39,018
can involve your whole team, and it can be really fun.

1079
00:59:39,678 --> 00:59:42,280
And there's no one right way to make a good product.

1080
00:59:43,377 --> 00:59:49,018
The amazing thing about being indie is that you can do it however you want with your values.

1081
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:54,060
Now some key points about some aspects of great products.

1082
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,921
Actually this is way too big of a topic so I'm not going to talk about it and I'm also

1083
00:59:58,961 --> 00:59:59,601
not an expert.

1084
01:00:00,342 --> 01:00:05,683
And while we can probably agree on what is terrible, what is great is relative and it

1085
01:00:05,723 --> 01:00:06,663
depends on your audience.

1086
01:00:08,514 --> 01:00:10,436
And the key thing is to not neglect it.

1087
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:12,418
Do spend some time thinking about

1088
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:14,961
what makes a great entertainment product for you.

1089
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,385
For me personally, every time I see a game

1090
01:00:18,465 --> 01:00:20,047
that I want to throw money at,

1091
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:22,610
then I feel like that developer is doing something right.

1092
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,753
And I do try to spend a little time thinking about

1093
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:28,236
why I feel that way and try to learn from it.

1094
01:00:30,444 --> 01:00:32,606
So a good product is seductive.

1095
01:00:33,247 --> 01:00:34,849
A good product makes people want it

1096
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:36,951
on their physical or digital shelf.

1097
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:39,513
And you need to consider your whole package

1098
01:00:39,734 --> 01:00:42,436
and it needs to be attractive to people you think

1099
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:45,179
would like the game inside the packaging.

1100
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:49,604
So in short, just make sure your great game

1101
01:00:49,784 --> 01:00:51,666
isn't a Jar Jar Binks candy talk.
