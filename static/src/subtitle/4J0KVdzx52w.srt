1
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:05,314
So, hello everyone.

2
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:07,255
I think we can get started.

3
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:10,856
Please turn off your phone and let's do it.

4
00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:15,157
So, today I'm going to talk to you

5
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:17,098
about dialogues and systems.

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,299
My name is Remy Boischot and I'm a game designer

7
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:23,560
fascinated by the intersection of gameplay,

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,420
systems, and narrative,

9
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,541
with a special interest for dialogue systems.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,541
We've done some work on system-driven dialogue,

11
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:34,822
which I hope you will find interesting.

12
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:37,724
And this is what I'm going to present you today.

13
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,665
So I work at a studio called Hangar 13

14
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:43,146
in Novato, California,

15
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:46,128
about 30 minutes north of San Francisco.

16
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:49,969
And on October 7th, we released,

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,111
last year, 2016, we released a game called Mafia 3

18
00:00:54,672 --> 00:00:57,073
on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

19
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:01,998
I am from France, and I pursued a master's degree

20
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:04,180
in management and game design

21
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:08,503
in Super 4 Game Rubica, France, where I graduated in 2012.

22
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:12,586
During my student time, I performed an internship

23
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,289
in Dark Potato Studios in Singapore.

24
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,412
At the end of my studies, I accepted a position

25
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:21,693
as a junior game designer at 2K Czech

26
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:25,156
in the wonderful city of Prague, Czech Republic.

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,252
And a few years later, I was transferred to Hunger 13,

28
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:30,533
where I work today.

29
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:37,338
So Mafia III is an upholdment game on organized crime set

30
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,803
in 1968 in a city called New Bordeaux, Louisiana, USA,

31
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:45,365
inspired by the real city of New Orleans.

32
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,429
You play the game as Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam veteran who

33
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:52,450
wages war on the local mafia.

34
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:57,510
In Mafia 3, after being betrayed by the mob,

35
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,152
you have to conquer three districts from the Mafia,

36
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:03,793
which enables you to collaborate with three underbosses.

37
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:07,215
Vito, the main protagonist from Mafia 2,

38
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:08,835
here on the left,

39
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:12,377
and two major new characters in the franchise,

40
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:15,058
Burke, on top here, and Cassandra.

41
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,460
Lincoln, the hero, is on the right.

42
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:22,759
So after all the underbosses have been unlocked,

43
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,721
your objective is to conquer six new districts,

44
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:29,624
which you can allocate to any of the three underbosses.

45
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,368
How you divide territory influences the economy,

46
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:38,610
the rewards, the weapons, and the perks that you get,

47
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,693
but it also has a great impact on the characters' reactions,

48
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:45,335
the game structure, through unique missions,

49
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:47,316
and the ending of the game.

50
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:50,727
So quick survey here, who in the audience

51
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:52,267
have played Mafia III?

52
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:54,448
Okay.

53
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,190
So for those who haven't played the game,

54
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,631
after you've unlocked all three on the bosses,

55
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:02,331
the structure goes like this.

56
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:07,933
First, you go after individual rackets run by the mob.

57
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,294
For example, the construction rackets

58
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:11,455
in the downtown district.

59
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,375
After you've conquered a racket,

60
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:16,976
you have to call one of your underbosses.

61
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:21,260
They will each give you unique rewards.

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,442
After the call, men from the faction you have chosen

63
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:28,405
populate the racket, which becomes a friendly location.

64
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:33,628
For example, the Haitian faction, run by Cassandra.

65
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:38,021
Note that this faction change is temporary.

66
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:41,604
So the ender bosses agree to help you in the short term,

67
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:45,487
but a racket is fully under control of a character

68
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:48,049
only if the whole district was conquered

69
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,949
and assigned to them.

70
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,771
We'll come to that shortly.

71
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,574
There are two rackets per district.

72
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:57,856
You conquer the second racket in downtown,

73
00:03:58,296 --> 00:03:59,157
the blackmail market.

74
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,624
And after the second racket is conquered,

75
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,445
again you have to call one of the boss.

76
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,107
You can choose to assign the second racket in the district

77
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,208
to the same on the boss, although the rewards offered

78
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:15,270
are a bit less interesting, or to choose another one.

79
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,051
Conquering both rackets of a district

80
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:22,292
unlocks a unique mission, in which you can take out

81
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:25,434
the district boss, who reports directly to Sal Marcano,

82
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:27,675
the mafia boss in New Bordeaux.

83
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:32,064
Just after the mission, a complex dialogue sequence

84
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:36,148
called sit down is triggered to permanently

85
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:37,028
assign the district.

86
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:39,471
All characters will try to convince you

87
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:41,313
to give them the new territory,

88
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,816
and they will have a reaction based on who you choose.

89
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:49,501
So there are two possibilities coming in a sit down.

90
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:53,144
First possibility, both rackets were secured

91
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:54,065
by the same character.

92
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:58,122
or you have split the district between two underbosses

93
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:00,824
who each secured one racket.

94
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,806
So the racket assignments through the telephone call

95
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,488
is a sort of promise that you do to a character.

96
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,930
And when you choose an underboss to run a district,

97
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,532
the decision is final, and all rackets in the district

98
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,573
are reassigned based on your decision.

99
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:23,316
So I'm going to show you in-game what a sit-down looks like.

100
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:29,650
In the situation you're going to see, you have conquered Downtown and it's the first

101
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:36,517
district that you have taken down. Downtown is split between two characters. You call

102
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:43,303
Vito to hold the first racket and you call Cassandra for the second one. Now pay attention

103
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:43,944
to what they say.

104
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,682
This is our first step toward breaking Markano and taking over the city.

105
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:59,062
I hear what y'all got to say, but I decide who gets the turf.

106
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:00,783
And in the end, my decision is final.

107
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:02,223
Well, hear this, Lincoln.

108
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:05,184
You can make any final decisions you wanna make.

109
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:10,445
But splitting the action in one of these districts between my men and theirs ain't happening.

110
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:12,265
This turf comes to me.

111
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:14,226
White boys are your problem.

112
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,331
Jesus, shut the fuck up. My guys aren't down there boozing with the neighbors or igniting some

113
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:26,854
kind of race war. They're making money. For you. That's all that matters. So forget all this

114
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:32,095
hippie bullshit and let's get to work. And don't let it change your mind lad. I can handle

115
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:38,737
both rockets without any of the bitchin' these two got going on right now. So because

116
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:43,479
both Cassandra and Vito hold one racket, they each expect the district to be theirs.

117
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:47,598
Burke, on the other hand, is less aggressive about it.

118
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,680
So here the decision is still completely open for the player.

119
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:54,302
You can still choose any of the underbosses.

120
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:59,825
So today I'm going to talk specifically about

121
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:03,687
two main components of the system-driven dialogue work

122
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,308
that we have performed on Mafia III.

123
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:08,069
First, the loyalty system.

124
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,930
Before the dialogue experience.

125
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,906
We built a relationship system first,

126
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:14,627
based on territory division.

127
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:18,608
And I'm going also to talk about dialogue design,

128
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:22,550
and specifically how we built a library of dialogues

129
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,631
that would reflect the loyalty system in a meaningful way.

130
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:30,693
Before we begin, small definition of system-driven dialogue.

131
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:34,954
So for me, system-driven dialogue reflect the rules

132
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:36,495
and status of a game system.

133
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:39,304
conveying expectations, relationships,

134
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:42,446
consequences, and history between characters.

135
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,908
And all of that is being driven by a set of rules,

136
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,391
states, modifiers, possible interactions, and choices.

137
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:56,034
Some examples that use system-driven dialogues.

138
00:07:57,074 --> 00:08:00,036
The Civilization games with varying relationships

139
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:03,938
with each AI rival.

140
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:08,110
the football manager series, where you have to talk,

141
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,451
motivate, and negotiate contracts with your players,

142
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:14,852
and The Sims, even though they use an abstract language

143
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:16,772
to convey moods and emotions.

144
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:22,594
So in games, these types of dialogue are only reflected by,

145
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:26,315
usually only reflected by a limited amount of lines,

146
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:30,396
sometimes with voiceover, but usually only with text.

147
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:35,962
In Mafia 3, we built a big library of voiceover dialogues

148
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:38,245
driven by a complex state of rules.

149
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:42,890
And Sit Downs is our attempt to explore emotional

150
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,513
and gameplay depth in system-driven dialogues.

151
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:50,058
So before we start here, I want to present you

152
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:51,259
the development timeline.

153
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:54,418
and decisions exactly how they happened,

154
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:56,939
but rather they are shown easier to digest.

155
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,540
The reality is a bit more granular than what I present.

156
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:03,622
I know I have some colleagues in the audience.

157
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,262
Please don't call me a liar.

158
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:09,084
Or at least wait until the end of the presentation.

159
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,586
So my initial mission was to design the relationship system

160
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:17,847
that would drive the logic behind all the choices

161
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,388
and their consequences on characters

162
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:20,848
and the game structure.

163
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,931
I knew a few things, starting working on the loyalty system.

164
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:30,312
There are three underbosses to choose to assign territory.

165
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,454
Six open districts to assign in total.

166
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:38,455
And two rackets to assign per district, so 12 in total.

167
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:43,777
The rackets are assigned temporarily in the phone call

168
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,438
and the final decision for the district

169
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:47,939
in sit-down sequences takes priority.

170
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,060
Based on the choices performed, up to two underbosses

171
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,521
can decide to leave the crime operation completely,

172
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:59,763
only leaving you with one underboss at the end of the game.

173
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:04,444
The player can accomplish side activities

174
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:07,345
for each character to improve the relationship with them.

175
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:11,127
And the final result of the loyalty system

176
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:14,828
influences the multiple endings of the game.

177
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:17,369
So these were my design constraints.

178
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:21,424
From these constraints, we set some creative goals

179
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:22,185
for the future.

180
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,808
We wanted first to design a real system

181
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:28,811
behind these choices, not having anything scripted

182
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:30,793
or forced or cheated.

183
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:35,177
We wanted tension to escalate throughout the game.

184
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,881
Actual consequences on the game structure and the economy.

185
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:42,424
On the bosses being able to drop out

186
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:44,906
of the operation was a good start.

187
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:52,556
And we wanted dialogue delivery, animation, poses,

188
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:55,838
and facial expression as the primary form

189
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:57,279
of the system feedback loop.

190
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,482
So we didn't want any relationship score, bar,

191
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,603
or text to drive the experience.

192
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:07,266
I wanted players to focus on dealing with egos

193
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:09,127
and demanding personalities.

194
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:12,429
And that was for me one of the most challenging goal.

195
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:16,170
And then we wanted no dialogue game,

196
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,291
as in interactive dialogue systems.

197
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:21,072
All interactions with the loyalty system

198
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,654
are based on territory division,

199
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:26,655
so rackets and district assignments.

200
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:28,896
And optionally, side activities.

201
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,778
So keeping everybody happy would mean

202
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:34,819
doing some compromises in terms of the

203
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,699
short-term rewards that you would be getting.

204
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,942
Each character would offer a different set of perks.

205
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,298
appealing to different kinds of players.

206
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,521
So these were my player-facing goal.

207
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:53,665
I had also defined goals for the underbosses themselves.

208
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:57,168
After all, I was designing a simple AI system,

209
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,931
so I needed a direction to define the basic concepts

210
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:03,252
that would drive their persona.

211
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:08,596
So these AI concepts are reflected through modifiers.

212
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:13,714
The first concept for the underbosses is greed.

213
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,818
They get some points for gaining a racket.

214
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,841
They get some points for gaining a district.

215
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:24,344
They lose points for losing a racket.

216
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:29,428
The second concept is impatience.

217
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,351
Underbosses dislike being ignored,

218
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:35,673
and when they are not chosen for a district,

219
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:36,895
they lose points.

220
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:42,187
Since there are three characters for each district

221
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:45,209
to assign, there are more points to lose than to gain.

222
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:47,350
And with this simple balance,

223
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,031
escalating tension was achieved.

224
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:55,553
So this can be overcome by making cautious racket

225
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:58,014
and district choices and doing side activities

226
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:59,235
for each character.

227
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:04,117
And finally, characters didn't need to be aware

228
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:07,299
of more things than what they were exposed to.

229
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,000
So if I call an underboss.

230
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:13,274
to secure a racket that won't make

231
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,995
the other characters upset.

232
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:17,436
They don't even know they haven't been caught.

233
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:21,919
So these AI concepts are rather simple and natural.

234
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,080
I don't need a lot of explanation done in game

235
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,642
for the player to understand these rules.

236
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:30,463
So I knew my modifiers.

237
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:33,985
Now I needed to define the different states

238
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:35,766
influenced by these modifiers.

239
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,102
I started with the base states

240
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,304
that are purely modifier driven.

241
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:43,646
Imagine a zero to a hundred scale.

242
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:49,872
And these states were content, neutral, and angry.

243
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,355
So these would be the states of the characters

244
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,556
for a majority of the time.

245
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:56,239
Underbosses start neutral.

246
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:00,483
Then we have what we call overwrite states.

247
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:04,427
These are influenced by modifiers,

248
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:06,551
but can ignore the usual logic

249
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:09,857
by having some specific rules.

250
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:13,784
The first override state is ultimatum.

251
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,611
It's triggered as a sort of last chance

252
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:21,812
to make this right with a character who had enough.

253
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:25,074
It was introduced to make sure that the tension escalation

254
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:28,935
was not too extreme, and only one character

255
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:31,976
can reach the ultimatum states throughout the whole game.

256
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:36,138
When things are really bad with a character,

257
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:38,038
the worst state is triggered.

258
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:40,984
Things are serious now.

259
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:43,025
The underboss quits the operation,

260
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:46,346
sends heat squads against you in the open world.

261
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:50,707
All the faction characters in the city attack you on sight.

262
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:52,448
Here, there's no turning back.

263
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:55,689
Characters at war unlock a unique mission

264
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:57,730
which enables you to kill them.

265
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,672
And once you've killed an underboss, they are dead.

266
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,922
The associate takes over the operation

267
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:10,984
and the situation returns to a status quo.

268
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:16,168
Although the perks from this faction are frozen

269
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:17,509
for the rest of the game.

270
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:21,572
So with the loyalty system defined on paper,

271
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,213
we needed a prototype.

272
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,937
We included Mafia real open structure.

273
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:30,519
You're not forced to complete a district

274
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:33,001
you started playing, so the game can be finished

275
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:34,542
in numerous ways.

276
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,902
We included all hideout and racket assignment choices,

277
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:42,344
their consequences on the state of the underbosses,

278
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:45,366
and how they would be reflected in the dialogue.

279
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,088
Some balancing capability,

280
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,689
including the completion of side activities

281
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,311
for bonus loyalty points.

282
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:56,853
We used Twine for the prototype,

283
00:15:56,893 --> 00:16:01,616
and it was really great because it's very easy to use.

284
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:03,397
Now,

285
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:06,887
We needed to collaborate with the writing team.

286
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:09,009
We were just two designers on the prototype.

287
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,611
So with the writing team, we defined a vision

288
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:16,072
for the scene itself, for the sit-down scene itself,

289
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,934
where and how it takes place.

290
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:21,936
So we selected an old abandoned mansion

291
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:24,377
in the bayou that you can see on this concept art.

292
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,965
Then we needed to define how the scene

293
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,467
would actually take place.

294
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,249
We had a prototype with design text,

295
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:36,031
but what is it going to actually look like

296
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:37,112
in the final game?

297
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:43,017
First, Lincoln walks in and is greeted by one character.

298
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:45,379
Lincoln makes an introduction,

299
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,561
announcing the district at stake

300
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:49,423
or any other big announcement.

301
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:54,078
Then each character makes a pitch, back to back,

302
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:57,440
trying to convince the player to give them the district.

303
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,844
So first character, second, and third.

304
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:05,826
Then it's time for the charts.

305
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,968
The player can see the rewards and penalties

306
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:11,110
for each character, and they say something

307
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,531
each time you highlight them.

308
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:18,215
Here focus on Vito and his rewards, Burke and Cassandra.

309
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,171
After you've selected a character to run the district,

310
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,212
Lincoln announces the decision.

311
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:28,195
Each character reacts back to back.

312
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:33,038
First reaction, second, and third reaction.

313
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:36,860
And finally, Lincoln sends everyone home.

314
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:42,744
So as a recap, you can see the skeleton of a sit-down here.

315
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:46,344
Sometimes we break these rules when we have big,

316
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:50,248
special moments, like a character going into an ultimatum

317
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:52,590
or wild state, but this is how it works

318
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,133
for the majority of sit-downs.

319
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:00,636
So now we need to define how we would approach

320
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:01,976
dialogue scoping.

321
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:05,237
In the prototype, we had simple design text

322
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,919
with variables and conditions inside the text.

323
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:13,640
So for example, I have two rackets and I am content.

324
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,901
But I didn't know how these variables would translate

325
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:20,362
when we would scope the actual dialogue lines.

326
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:24,150
So through the dialogues, we needed to convey

327
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,731
three pieces of information.

328
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:29,654
It was important for the dialogue to first serve

329
00:18:30,154 --> 00:18:30,615
the system.

330
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:34,618
Dialogues needed to convey the loyalty states

331
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:38,301
of the on the bus, how many rackets this occurred

332
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:40,442
in the district, two, one, or zero,

333
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:45,006
and state transitions, positive and negative changes

334
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:45,846
in the system.

335
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:50,997
So there are interesting examples of actual viable

336
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,079
audio design in sports commentaries,

337
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,262
with announcers talking about game scores

338
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:58,844
and statistics in a smooth and natural way,

339
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:01,247
but it's very hard to produce well.

340
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,249
And here, we were created of a narrative

341
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,933
and emotional experience, not really talking about stats.

342
00:19:09,794 --> 00:19:12,317
So the resolution was clear, we would define

343
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:15,727
individual dialogue assets, which would reflect

344
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,528
the combination of the loyalty states,

345
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:22,409
number of rackets held, and any other condition

346
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:24,970
that the underbosses would react on.

347
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,631
Then it would be all about the writing and the performance.

348
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,633
We would need a lot of individual assets

349
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,494
to support the game system, but we believed

350
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:37,535
it was the right direction, sorry.

351
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,787
We would also have to define a broad dialogue library

352
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:45,550
that could survive designer iterations and create variety.

353
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:51,275
And because we would have such a big amount of lines,

354
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,739
thinking in branches would be unmanageable.

355
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:57,641
So when I talk about branches,

356
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,924
think interactive dialogue systems

357
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:03,206
like Mass Effect or The Walking Dead.

358
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:08,949
In these games, the dialogue structure branches out and in,

359
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,030
depending on the choices performed.

360
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,851
Here, we would approach the dialogue design

361
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:17,993
with a database mindset, rather than controlled branches.

362
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:21,435
In addition to the loyalty states

363
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:23,396
and number of racket secured,

364
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:27,238
we needed additional direction for the dialogue scoping.

365
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,489
The first direction is that all transitions

366
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:34,371
from one dialogue to the other must sound smooth

367
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,712
when played back to back.

368
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:38,933
And there are many possible permutations.

369
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:42,976
All the underbosses would talk individually,

370
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,316
there's no group talk.

371
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:49,779
And we would use talking positions for branches.

372
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,921
So for pitches and reactions, if you remember,

373
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:56,043
characters talk back to back.

374
00:20:57,245 --> 00:20:58,866
first, second, and third.

375
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:03,167
Here, whether our characters talk first, second, or third,

376
00:21:04,107 --> 00:21:07,588
enables us to write the dialogue

377
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,709
so characters bounces off of each other.

378
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:14,450
And that makes the dialogue feel more alive.

379
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:18,752
Branching dialogue has a set of advantages in the writing.

380
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:21,472
It definitely feels more natural.

381
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:26,434
So after the initial writing pass and dialogue scoping,

382
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:30,493
We implemented the dialogue in the prototype

383
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,213
and see how it felt.

384
00:21:35,454 --> 00:21:38,815
So now we are going to see how the numbers of hideouts

385
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:42,016
in the loyalty states are conveyed through dialogue.

386
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:45,637
My guys are working the action here just like you asked.

387
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:47,757
I figure you called us in for a reason.

388
00:21:48,852 --> 00:21:50,614
I also figure you ought to just keep us there.

389
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:52,436
Half this turf is in our hands.

390
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,859
Sending it anywhere else would be a slap in the fucking face.

391
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:58,181
What you need, pal, is someone who's

392
00:21:58,201 --> 00:21:59,702
going to tell you what you need to hear,

393
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:00,823
whether you like it or not.

394
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:02,985
And so far, you've been fucking me

395
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,307
ever since we took care of Greco.

396
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:06,308
That fucking ends right now.

397
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,813
So you can see that we can convey a lot through writing,

398
00:22:11,153 --> 00:22:14,116
dialogue delivery, and animation, and poses.

399
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,032
That writing pass gave a lot of character to the system

400
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:22,654
through the personalities of Burr, Cassandra, and Vito,

401
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:23,715
who you saw.

402
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:27,356
The dialogues were serving the system design

403
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:28,197
still really well.

404
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:31,478
There was no information loss from the design text.

405
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:36,281
However, we felt that the dialogues were too simplistic

406
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,822
to create an emotional response from the player

407
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:41,563
past the first couple of sit-downs.

408
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:46,710
Characters felt robotic, and although their loyalty state

409
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,471
could evolve, they felt stupid and unresponsive.

410
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:54,932
So at this point, we needed to define an update.

411
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:58,593
And I was told something that I actually

412
00:22:58,653 --> 00:23:00,293
love to hear as a game designer.

413
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:04,634
It was something like, define as many dialogues as you want.

414
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:08,555
If you want 500 dialogue lines per character

415
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:10,815
to make your system compelling, just do it.

416
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:12,516
Aim for quality.

417
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,072
Luckily, there was no producer in the room.

418
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:19,835
So I could follow that advice blindly.

419
00:23:22,037 --> 00:23:23,098
So the new goal was quality.

420
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:26,280
I had to create a set of more interesting dialogues

421
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,443
for the underbosses to say on top of the library

422
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,804
that we had already defined.

423
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:37,088
So here, I wondered about complexifying the system.

424
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,427
to produce different results.

425
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:43,930
After all, the loyalty system is an AI system,

426
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:48,235
and so having just one global state

427
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:51,619
contains neutral, angry ultimatum

428
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:55,423
to reflect a person's emotions is quite simplistic.

429
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:57,525
It was no wonder my characters

430
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,248
failed to create an emotional response.

431
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:05,997
But really I kept teaching more complex solutions.

432
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:09,659
First reason is that I can't really think

433
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:10,780
about complex systems.

434
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,661
I like to keep things in control.

435
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:14,943
And in control means simple.

436
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:21,119
But the big thing was that actually the system felt right.

437
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:24,340
I was actually happy with the outcomes of the system.

438
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,761
If I looked at the numbers, the spacing, the structure,

439
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:31,081
the consequences, the tension escalation,

440
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,442
the system felt right.

441
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:39,203
So my resolution was to keep the loyalty system as it was.

442
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:42,303
One state per character with the set of states

443
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:43,864
that I had available.

444
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:45,864
And then.

445
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,362
build on the player's perception to create agency

446
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:52,124
through an additional set of statistics

447
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:58,851
for the underbosses to better react on choices

448
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:02,615
and appear smarter than what they really are.

449
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:07,296
So I started brainstorming about interesting statistics

450
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:11,539
for the underbosses, and I wanted to make the first

451
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,801
and last sit-down feel unique.

452
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:16,624
The lines you heard in the first video

453
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:18,606
are specific to the first sit-down.

454
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,649
I wanted to explore that notion of greed again,

455
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:26,373
and for the underbosses to react and remember

456
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,575
when rackets were taken away from them.

457
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,717
I also went back to the concept of impatience.

458
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:36,660
Characters would complain that they have no district yet,

459
00:25:37,381 --> 00:25:39,143
and how many sit-downs they spent

460
00:25:39,423 --> 00:25:40,984
without a district assigned.

461
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,688
And I also wanted to explore more concepts,

462
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,990
which were not reflected by the game system,

463
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,551
but which I found interesting.

464
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:51,962
Jealousy, for example.

465
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:55,803
Underbosses would complain about one of their rival

466
00:25:55,903 --> 00:25:57,083
being chosen for a district,

467
00:25:57,883 --> 00:26:00,824
and if they were the least powerful underboss in the city.

468
00:26:02,524 --> 00:26:04,865
I also wanted to explore cockiness.

469
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:07,545
Characters would mention that they've gotten

470
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:10,806
the last district, and if they are the most powerful

471
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,387
underboss in the city.

472
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,552
And this doesn't even cover everything

473
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:16,973
that we put in the system.

474
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,495
There are lots of different reactions we defined

475
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,998
based on how cool and interesting events

476
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:26,700
and statistics that we thought.

477
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:29,623
So I'm going to show you examples

478
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:33,246
of what the extended dialog scope brought to the system.

479
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:36,168
In that example, we are going to see

480
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,630
different pitches from Vito.

481
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:41,612
For these dialogs, Vito is neutral.

482
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:45,550
He holds, Vito holds one racket in the district.

483
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,451
And then he reacts on additional statistics of the game.

484
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:54,972
So pay attention to each dialogue

485
00:26:55,152 --> 00:26:57,952
and try to guess what the statistic is each time.

486
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:01,993
We all make mistakes, ain't nothing more true.

487
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,134
Think for example, you asking me to secure the last district

488
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:07,454
and they're not giving it to me.

489
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:08,835
Your mistake.

490
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,435
Me allowing you to get away with it again?

491
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:13,169
That would be mine.

492
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:15,550
Only action I got right now is River Row.

493
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,851
And as exciting as that is, I'm ready for more.

494
00:27:19,691 --> 00:27:21,211
You got me working half this turf already.

495
00:27:21,632 --> 00:27:22,912
Piece of cake to give me the whole thing.

496
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:24,613
I'm not one for bitching and moaning.

497
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:25,953
Never saw much use for it.

498
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:29,234
That said, I got the least amount of power in this town,

499
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:30,335
and you're giving me half this turf.

500
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,255
Someone here's getting fucked.

501
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:33,856
Better not be me.

502
00:27:34,496 --> 00:27:36,056
El Burke ain't sobered up for when you gave him

503
00:27:36,077 --> 00:27:37,257
the last piece of the action.

504
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:39,238
I already got one of these rackets.

505
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:42,642
Give the mick a chance to dry out and send this turf my way.

506
00:27:43,243 --> 00:27:47,324
No disrespect, but giving potato lover over there part of this city is like throwing it away.

507
00:27:47,984 --> 00:27:49,404
I got half this turf secured for you.

508
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:52,245
So if you want this thing, we gotta make real money.

509
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:53,626
Send it my way.

510
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:56,267
Not everyone in this town is as open-minded as I am.

511
00:27:57,107 --> 00:28:02,309
So spreading the Haitians out across this city like giving them their last district is gonna bring some unwanted attention.

512
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:05,690
But me and my boys, with this bit of action you put us on...

513
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:08,416
We blend in. Here's the truth.

514
00:28:09,157 --> 00:28:10,178
Cassandra's dangerous.

515
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,359
Hey, I'm sorry, honey, but it's true.

516
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,822
She's looking for a war to fight, while I'm just trying to run a business.

517
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:19,404
I got half this turf locked up, and I want the rest.

518
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,747
You got a plan, a reason you're working things the way you are, and I respect that.

519
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:28,110
After busting my ass on the last district, I came in and took care of half of this one.

520
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:30,586
I see no reason I can't handle the whole thing.

521
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:33,148
Ain't no one at this table running more action

522
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:33,748
for you than me.

523
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:36,350
On top of that, my guys already got half the rackets

524
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,450
in this area locked down.

525
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:40,612
Just keep the shit coming my way, that's all I'm getting at.

526
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,915
So there are even, actually even more dialogues

527
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:46,236
that Vito could have said.

528
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:49,818
We have variations on each statistic

529
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:51,520
and each set of statistic.

530
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,802
So in total, we have about

531
00:28:56,353 --> 00:28:58,515
850 dialogue lines allowed by the system,

532
00:28:58,835 --> 00:29:00,177
all characters included.

533
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:06,622
In one sit down, only about 20 are selected.

534
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:11,206
So if you do the math, only between two and 3%

535
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:14,088
of the database is used per sit down.

536
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:16,710
250 dialogues per on the bus, and about 100 for Lincoln.

537
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:25,257
And so with six sit-downs in the game,

538
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,977
the player is going to only see about 15%

539
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:29,998
of the whole database.

540
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:34,699
We really tried to reflect the player's unique play through

541
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:35,919
and set of choices.

542
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:39,900
So the results we were getting from the extended

543
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,721
dialog scope were satisfying.

544
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:46,882
The characters felt more responsive, more alive, and smarter.

545
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:50,516
But really behind the scenes,

546
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:52,858
the system was still dead simple.

547
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:55,039
But what the characters would say

548
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,262
was perceived as a deep and complex system.

549
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:05,907
So at this point we had the extended assets ready

550
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,029
and we needed to accomplish one more step

551
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:11,671
before the actual final implementation of the full scene.

552
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:15,835
It was defining the rules of the dialogue flow.

553
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:19,896
And because of the extended dialog scope,

554
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:22,277
we couldn't really use Twine anymore

555
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:23,998
to figure out the rules.

556
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:28,140
The tool is not really ready to handle a big text database.

557
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,162
But we still really needed to see clear examples

558
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:33,602
of different sit-down sequences,

559
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,965
how the sit-down sequences would flow with actual writing.

560
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:40,846
And I had the assets ready,

561
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,426
so it was time to put them together.

562
00:30:44,687 --> 00:30:46,490
If you take the sit down flow again,

563
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:49,053
you can see that there is one character

564
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:54,200
selected for the greeting, but which one of the three?

565
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:57,725
During the pitch and reaction sequences,

566
00:30:58,086 --> 00:31:02,171
all characters talk back to back, but in which order?

567
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:05,642
I didn't want, here I didn't want to define

568
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:07,183
an arbitrary order.

569
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:09,264
I wanted the dialogue sequence to flow

570
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:10,505
as nicely as possible.

571
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,946
And that meant defining rules.

572
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:15,988
However, here I had really no tool

573
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:17,329
to help me figure it out.

574
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,831
So my solution was simple.

575
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:23,753
I would define different scenarios randomly.

576
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:26,857
And then select and structure the dialog assets

577
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:31,299
like puzzle pieces that would create a sequence

578
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:33,520
that felt natural, engaging,

579
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,641
and that would best reflect the scenario.

580
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:39,923
So from my results, and because I generated

581
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,484
a lot of different scenarios,

582
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:44,545
I then analyzed the results I produced

583
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,366
to be able to extract dialog rules

584
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:49,988
that would drive the sequence as a whole.

585
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,381
So we were ready for the final implementation

586
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:57,682
and see the results in the game.

587
00:31:57,822 --> 00:32:00,743
So let's go back to our initial example.

588
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:03,904
If you remember, it's the first sit down

589
00:32:04,604 --> 00:32:07,205
and the district is split between Vito and Cassandra

590
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:10,186
who both have one racket secured.

591
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,067
And to let to change your mind lad,

592
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:17,128
I can handle both rackets without any of the betchin

593
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:18,609
these two got going on right now.

594
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:23,075
You start dangling territory in front of me and then snatch it back.

595
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:26,478
This agreement we had, it ain't gonna last.

596
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,440
You gotta see all the angles, Lincoln.

597
00:32:32,002 --> 00:32:33,303
We got a long road ahead of us.

598
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:35,144
Don't make the wrong first step, lad.

599
00:32:37,026 --> 00:32:37,926
What's the word, Lincoln?

600
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:46,513
Gonna need Vito to run this turf.

601
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:49,398
This the kind of shit that breaks the spirit of folk.

602
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:51,919
You do well to keep that in mind.

603
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,319
My fucking time.

604
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,560
Always knew you had a good head on your shoulders.

605
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:59,302
If I stay here any longer, my head's gonna fucking explode.

606
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:00,543
We're done for now.

607
00:33:01,223 --> 00:33:02,464
You'll hear from me if I need you.

608
00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:10,988
So here in that sequence, Cassandra lost her racket.

609
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:12,168
She was content.

610
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:15,130
She transitioned to an angry state.

611
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:18,417
Vito was content and stayed content,

612
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:20,738
and Burke stayed neutral.

613
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:26,440
So being able to finally experience sit-downs in-game,

614
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:30,622
we validated some choices and learned a few things.

615
00:33:32,263 --> 00:33:35,484
Some playtesters actually asked for loyalty meters,

616
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:38,925
but it was such a small portion that we felt

617
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:40,826
it was more related to previous games

618
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:43,227
that they played rather than a design flow.

619
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:46,505
So from the dialogue, performance, and animation,

620
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,606
they were able to figure it out.

621
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:51,627
So no need for spoon feeding here.

622
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:55,809
One result felt apparent, though.

623
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:59,831
The underbosses flipped states very quickly

624
00:34:00,031 --> 00:34:02,672
and in situations which appeared unfair.

625
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,334
That wasn't really a problem with the prototype,

626
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:09,595
but it was very real when confronted

627
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:11,276
with the characters in game.

628
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:16,005
And as a general feedback, all results of sit-down sequences

629
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,188
felt like lose-lose situations, where

630
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,850
if the player chose one on the bus,

631
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,392
the other two always got upset.

632
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,895
I had to rethink the loyalty system then.

633
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,819
So this time, I knew that the issue was not only

634
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:34,760
about perception.

635
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,642
My game system was perceived as unfair.

636
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,585
And that was a core issue, not a superficial one.

637
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:46,507
And because I had defined the loyalty concept clearly

638
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:51,088
for the underbosses, remember, greed and impatience.

639
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:53,829
So here you see that greed,

640
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:55,549
the greed part is straightforward.

641
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,409
It's logical, everyone can understand it.

642
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,090
You get money, it gets better.

643
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,770
You lose money, it gets worse.

644
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,290
It's fair.

645
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:07,471
It's really the impatience part

646
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:09,091
that people had problem with

647
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:13,112
and make the underbosses seem annoying and ungrateful.

648
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:18,598
So I introduced a new concept, the gap.

649
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:23,222
Basically it means that another boss would have a penalty

650
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:26,825
only if he or she has been ignored

651
00:35:26,945 --> 00:35:28,626
at least two districts in a row.

652
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,970
You can see on the new table that if the gap is low,

653
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,111
there's no penalty applied

654
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:36,813
on a district not assigned decision.

655
00:35:37,774 --> 00:35:39,235
However, when the gap is high,

656
00:35:39,435 --> 00:35:41,296
a very strong penalty is applied.

657
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:45,557
So the gap had few advantages.

658
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:48,279
In the first district assignment,

659
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:51,200
no one would get mad unless they lost a racket.

660
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:55,082
And since the first sit-down is the first real contact

661
00:35:55,322 --> 00:36:00,425
with the loyalty system, no automatic drama is a good thing.

662
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,107
It focused crises much more,

663
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:07,269
rather than a constant penalty for not getting a district.

664
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:10,991
And the bosses would stay calm until they had enough.

665
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,403
and then they would get specific as to why.

666
00:36:15,124 --> 00:36:16,464
There's a big difference between

667
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:19,525
I wanted the district and I'm upset,

668
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:22,705
and it's been twice you've ignored me.

669
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,867
The system was still able to create escalating tension

670
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,327
with a balanced play through.

671
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:31,527
With three people in the room,

672
00:36:32,048 --> 00:36:33,348
I had the guaranteed crisis

673
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:35,108
at the second district assignment.

674
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:38,549
Whoever was not picked from the first two decisions.

675
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,241
So before I present you with the results

676
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:45,121
of that updated designer,

677
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:47,762
I'm going to go back to my initial example.

678
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,422
So if you remember, after the first sit down,

679
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:54,503
Cassandra was angry, she lost one racket

680
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:55,703
after the decision.

681
00:36:56,603 --> 00:36:59,104
Vito is content, he's got the first district.

682
00:37:00,324 --> 00:37:02,665
Burke is neutral, his state didn't change.

683
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:06,145
Let's fast forward to the second district.

684
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:11,265
I felt bad for Cassandra, and I assigned her two rackets

685
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:13,728
and the district to calm her.

686
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,853
And we are going to see the sit-down for the third district

687
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:20,974
assignment in the game.

688
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:24,517
I conquered a district called Barclay Mills,

689
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:27,139
controlled by a mob boss called Enzo Conti.

690
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:32,624
There, I assigned one racket to Burke and the other to Vito.

691
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:38,082
Cassandra feels better now that I've assigned her

692
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:41,023
some territory, but she's not great, she's neutral.

693
00:37:42,423 --> 00:37:44,684
Burke is angry, it's been two sit downs

694
00:37:45,384 --> 00:37:48,085
and he still hasn't seen any districts coming his way.

695
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:50,406
I've been completely ignoring him.

696
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:54,587
And Vito is content, he's got the first district

697
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:58,868
and he didn't lose any rackets, no problem here.

698
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:01,369
This is the situation I'm going to present you now

699
00:38:01,669 --> 00:38:04,090
and it's really a turning point in the structure.

700
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:10,626
You take your goddamn time, don't you?

701
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:16,248
Turns out there's at least one sane motherfucker in Marcano's crew.

702
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:18,209
Enzo Conti backed away clean.

703
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,611
No one's moving anything through Barclay Mills without paying up to us.

704
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:24,852
Asking my guys to lock down half this turf makes them anxious.

705
00:38:25,073 --> 00:38:27,814
Like, they don't know which side they're supposed to be cheering for.

706
00:38:28,594 --> 00:38:30,815
But giving us the entire turf sends a clear message.

707
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:32,776
Tells them you're gonna take care of it.

708
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:35,638
Ain't gonna keep this real fucking simple, Chucky.

709
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:39,378
Knocking me around the city like you are and keeping me from running rockets.

710
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:41,479
It's real unhealthy for you.

711
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,820
Everybody's got their play, brother.

712
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,583
But the truth is that I'm the one you called on to run the last territory.

713
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:51,004
So all that racket shit aside,

714
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:54,786
you know I can handle the day-to-day better than anybody else here.

715
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:58,588
Make the right choice here and I'll whip up some fresh bucatini for you.

716
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,250
Share the wealth, Lincoln.

717
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,591
Who's it gonna be, Lincoln?

718
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:07,954
Go against me here and I suppose I'm just a mongo-sop?

719
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:10,915
This one's all you, Burt.

720
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:12,316
Thank you, lad.

721
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:14,056
I'll do my part here.

722
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:15,697
I will get past this.

723
00:39:16,597 --> 00:39:19,858
So now I gotta go tell my guys their work was for nothing, Jesus Christ.

724
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:22,419
This ain't going over well with them, or me.

725
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,280
Don't let this happen again.

726
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,761
The ambiance here ain't enough to keep me coming back, brother.

727
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:30,902
I think I'll excuse myself for the time being.

728
00:39:30,922 --> 00:39:32,883
Alright, that's it. We're done for now.

729
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,441
So here, after choosing Burke, balance was kept.

730
00:39:40,142 --> 00:39:42,263
All characters received one district each.

731
00:39:42,543 --> 00:39:45,884
They're all neutral, although their value is,

732
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:49,126
their actual value is much less than the starting one

733
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:51,547
because of the tension exclamation.

734
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:53,988
Now I'm going to show you what happens

735
00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:56,409
if you choose another character than Burke.

736
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:01,912
Calling this one for Skeletta.

737
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:06,808
I've had enough of this shite. You're a lying, cheating bastard for dragging me into this.

738
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,549
You pray to my fucking sympathies and I'll never forgive you for it.

739
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:12,850
Come on, Irish. Relax.

740
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,811
You've been around the block enough to know it's just business.

741
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:23,194
There is only so much shit none an Irishman can take before he wipes it from his eyes and comes at you with both barrels.

742
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:28,055
I see you clearly now, Lincoln. And it's time you made this right.

743
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:31,196
Bert, come on now. Shit don't need to jump that far yet.

744
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:33,419
You made your point, Burke. Now that's enough.

745
00:40:33,979 --> 00:40:35,741
Y'all don't have to like the decisions I make.

746
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:39,403
And to be honest, your egos are the least of my fucking concerns.

747
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:43,566
Way I see it, you fall in line, or you fall out altogether.

748
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,268
Now let's go make some fucking money.

749
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:55,714
So here, Burke transitioned to an ultimatum state.

750
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:59,195
Even Vito and Cassandra tried to calm him down.

751
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:02,115
He requests the next district.

752
00:41:03,176 --> 00:41:06,437
And that last line from Lincoln is one of my favorite one.

753
00:41:06,977 --> 00:41:08,757
He actually has unique reactions

754
00:41:08,897 --> 00:41:10,578
from characters going ultimatum,

755
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:15,019
depending on how early the ultimatum state is triggered.

756
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:17,740
And this one was the most aggressive.

757
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:24,390
So I invite you to play the game and see how your choices

758
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,490
impact the other bosses.

759
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:29,072
The dialogue experience differs tremendously

760
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,613
depending on what you do and who you choose.

761
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:35,074
Now you've seen the resulting game,

762
00:41:35,435 --> 00:41:37,535
I want to give you a look behind the scene

763
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:40,417
as to how we structure, condition,

764
00:41:40,557 --> 00:41:42,838
and choose dialogue assets in Sit Downs.

765
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:46,039
I'm going to present you my methodology.

766
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:48,900
I'm sure there are many like it, but this one is mine.

767
00:41:52,158 --> 00:41:53,779
So here a case study on Vito.

768
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:57,301
If you remember, the total amount of dialogues

769
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:58,582
that Vito can say in a sit-down

770
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:03,546
is approximately 250 dialogue lines.

771
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:08,609
Let's look at how one dialogue line is defined in the data.

772
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,332
A dialogue is first a unique ID.

773
00:42:13,693 --> 00:42:16,455
We track how many times it has been played in the game,

774
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:20,998
when it was played last through a timestamp,

775
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:25,977
And then we can define one option called play once,

776
00:42:26,397 --> 00:42:28,219
which enables us to discard a dialogue

777
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:29,980
completely from the database

778
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:32,702
when it was played once in the game.

779
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:37,166
And finally, for each dialogue,

780
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:40,048
there is one or more conditions defined.

781
00:42:40,649 --> 00:42:43,971
So conditions are logics based on game state variables.

782
00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:47,574
When we pass a dialogue, all linked conditions

783
00:42:47,835 --> 00:42:50,176
have to be true for the dialogue to be available.

784
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:54,393
Let's take a look at what conditions are in sit down.

785
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:59,335
So for example, conditions are the loyalty states.

786
00:42:59,655 --> 00:43:02,856
Content, neutral, angry, or ultimatum.

787
00:43:03,696 --> 00:43:07,218
If characters are war or was dead,

788
00:43:07,578 --> 00:43:09,519
they don't attend the sit down meeting.

789
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,121
Then you have conditions related to the number of rackets

790
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:17,202
secured in a district, two, one, zero.

791
00:43:19,537 --> 00:43:22,858
And then really any other additional variable.

792
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:25,600
For example, it's the first district,

793
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,181
it's the last district,

794
00:43:27,761 --> 00:43:30,923
Vito is the least powerful character in the city,

795
00:43:31,463 --> 00:43:33,124
the most powerful, et cetera.

796
00:43:36,066 --> 00:43:37,287
That's for dialogue data.

797
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:41,169
Now let's go back to Vito's library of dialogues.

798
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:44,491
Because there are so many, we need to organize them.

799
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,321
So first, we put them in context.

800
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:50,304
All greetings together, same for pitches,

801
00:43:50,904 --> 00:43:53,006
focus dialogues, and reactions.

802
00:43:54,988 --> 00:43:58,050
Then, inside categories, we define priorities.

803
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:02,334
As many priority levels needed, depending on which dialogues

804
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:04,596
are more important than others.

805
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:08,879
For example, dialogues specific to the first

806
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:12,202
or last sit down in the game are always marked

807
00:44:12,242 --> 00:44:13,203
as priority one.

808
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,240
In priority two are dialogues related to characters

809
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,541
being killed since the last sit down,

810
00:44:20,162 --> 00:44:23,303
reactions to an ultimatum states, et cetera.

811
00:44:25,044 --> 00:44:28,085
Then you really define as many priority levels as you need.

812
00:44:28,826 --> 00:44:31,567
And finally, your set of generic dialogues.

813
00:44:33,188 --> 00:44:34,829
Your really base design.

814
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:37,270
They have less specific conditions,

815
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,911
usually down to the loyalty states of the character.

816
00:44:43,295 --> 00:44:45,855
And so that's how we structure dialogue data

817
00:44:45,895 --> 00:44:47,736
for the other bosses in sit-downs.

818
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,236
First, we organize by context.

819
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:54,437
Then within context, we organize dialogue assets by priority.

820
00:44:55,197 --> 00:44:59,098
For example, here, greetings have three different levels

821
00:44:59,178 --> 00:44:59,938
of priority.

822
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:02,859
Pitches have eight different levels.

823
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:07,000
For each dialogue, we track a bunch of statistics

824
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,800
and conditions on a mix of game state variables.

825
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:16,375
So that was from the data structure.

826
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,459
Now, when we detect that it's a character's turn to talk,

827
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,062
we run a selection algorithm passing all dialogues

828
00:45:24,202 --> 00:45:28,026
from a context to choose the most relevant dialogue to play.

829
00:45:29,528 --> 00:45:31,650
First, we look at the play once status.

830
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,472
If the play once option was ticked

831
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:36,494
and the dialogue has been previously played,

832
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:38,536
the dialogue is discarded.

833
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:41,906
Then we look at the game state conditions

834
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:43,286
linked with the dialogue.

835
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:44,887
All conditions have to be met.

836
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,248
If more than one dialogue returns true conditions,

837
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:52,488
we compare different priority levels.

838
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:54,188
If a priority dialogue,

839
00:45:55,249 --> 00:45:57,849
if a priority one dialogue is available,

840
00:45:58,629 --> 00:46:00,069
and another priority two,

841
00:46:00,169 --> 00:46:01,310
then we choose the priority one.

842
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,910
If dialogues have the same priority level,

843
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,551
then we compare the number of times they have been played.

844
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,039
We pick the one which has been played

845
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,380
the least amount of times.

846
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,101
If there is still a tie,

847
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:16,681
then we pick the least recently played dialogue.

848
00:46:19,422 --> 00:46:22,323
And finally, if there is still a tie,

849
00:46:22,564 --> 00:46:24,304
we pick a random dialogue from the group.

850
00:46:25,345 --> 00:46:28,186
The random part is interesting for me.

851
00:46:28,546 --> 00:46:32,287
In sit-downs, because of the enormous dialogue scope,

852
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:35,737
most of the dialogues actually have never been played.

853
00:46:36,177 --> 00:46:38,899
And so, the algorithm, very often,

854
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,982
has to pick randomly without a dialogue group.

855
00:46:42,762 --> 00:46:45,144
So it means that actually, as a designer,

856
00:46:45,404 --> 00:46:48,466
I know what characters can potentially say,

857
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:51,689
on which game state variables they could react,

858
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:53,210
depending on player choices.

859
00:46:54,096 --> 00:46:58,038
But in some situations, I really can't anticipate

860
00:46:58,918 --> 00:47:00,459
exactly what they are going to say.

861
00:47:00,759 --> 00:47:04,340
And it makes the sit-downs sequences feel very unique.

862
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:09,283
So the public reception was interesting to see

863
00:47:09,343 --> 00:47:11,624
on the loyalty system and on sit-downs.

864
00:47:13,404 --> 00:47:15,625
One of my favorite comments is this person

865
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:17,306
asking on the Steam forums,

866
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:20,207
where can I see the underboss's loyalty?

867
00:47:20,327 --> 00:47:22,008
Is it like a bar or something?

868
00:47:22,877 --> 00:47:25,959
And the other user responds, there is no bar or indicator

869
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,480
as to how loyal the underpossesses are to you.

870
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,161
You should get a good feel from the conversations

871
00:47:31,461 --> 00:47:33,322
when you are allocating districts

872
00:47:33,442 --> 00:47:34,902
to them all at the sit-down.

873
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:38,384
And these kind of comments really validates all the design.

874
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:41,805
Writing an animation work on the characters

875
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:45,967
as feedback direction, and it makes me really happy.

876
00:47:48,361 --> 00:47:52,907
Another favorite comment, the underbosses are just a bunch of greedy animals and I love them.

877
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:58,032
I don't know how he feels towards the MakeMafia grid again though.

878
00:48:01,096 --> 00:48:03,178
So some lessons learned throughout development.

879
00:48:04,907 --> 00:48:09,009
Since communication is so much a part of our everyday life,

880
00:48:09,209 --> 00:48:12,432
players seem to really dig interesting systems

881
00:48:12,512 --> 00:48:13,672
around dialogue and choices,

882
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:15,914
especially when they are integrated

883
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:18,015
in the gameplay experience.

884
00:48:18,736 --> 00:48:20,717
And sit-downs prove to be a popular feature.

885
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:24,760
Not overexposing your system

886
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,482
helps creating interesting play patterns.

887
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,003
With playtests, we figure, and the public reception,

888
00:48:33,464 --> 00:48:35,846
we figured that players had a really cool tendency

889
00:48:35,866 --> 00:48:41,211
to project lots of different and personal reasons

890
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,752
to choose another boss.

891
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:46,055
And through projection, they created a play pattern

892
00:48:46,336 --> 00:48:49,919
deeper than how the actual system actually works.

893
00:48:52,427 --> 00:48:54,108
And I didn't mention it in the presentation,

894
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:55,850
but late in the development,

895
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,392
we introduced a new state, loyal,

896
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,676
better than content, the best state possible.

897
00:49:02,897 --> 00:49:05,117
But as we were past the voiceover deadline,

898
00:49:05,637 --> 00:49:08,998
we had really no way to reflect it through dialogue.

899
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:13,899
And with no UI to reflect that, it

900
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:19,320
was not as well presented than the other states.

901
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,341
So that's definitely a big caveat

902
00:49:22,581 --> 00:49:24,222
when you are working with voiceover.

903
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:25,982
Deadlines are crucial.

904
00:49:26,482 --> 00:49:29,883
And it's a real blocker for any major late system design work.

905
00:49:30,503 --> 00:49:32,083
So yeah, plan ahead.

906
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,483
In short, the takeaways from this presentation.

907
00:49:37,584 --> 00:49:39,966
Define and know your constraints well.

908
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:42,308
Here, I needed to find interesting rules

909
00:49:43,249 --> 00:49:44,670
around territory division.

910
00:49:46,472 --> 00:49:48,794
Define the basic concepts that you want to explore.

911
00:49:49,174 --> 00:49:52,858
When you need an update, revisit these basic concepts

912
00:49:52,938 --> 00:49:55,020
and see how you can improve the execution.

913
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:59,176
Prototype, learn, implement, and iterate.

914
00:49:59,656 --> 00:50:03,019
It takes a while to get comfortable with a design,

915
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:06,381
to know it, and to know how to mature it.

916
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:09,344
We validated a lot of decisions

917
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:11,946
with the Twine prototype, for example.

918
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:16,589
When there are player issues with the system,

919
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:18,250
ask yourself this.

920
00:50:19,331 --> 00:50:22,494
Is this a core issue, or can it be solved

921
00:50:22,594 --> 00:50:24,275
by working on the pair session?

922
00:50:25,347 --> 00:50:27,629
of the player by building on top of the system

923
00:50:27,669 --> 00:50:28,610
that you already have.

924
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:32,854
So you can see that actually these are pretty classic

925
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:36,357
game design lessons here, even working on

926
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:40,461
narrative heavy features like the loyalty systems

927
00:50:40,481 --> 00:50:41,942
and sit downs.

928
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:47,047
So there's no question we can tell engaging stories

929
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:48,068
through game systems.

930
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:51,171
The biggest question now is how?

931
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,322
When we have the possibility to bring designers,

932
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:57,624
animators, writers, and actors together,

933
00:50:58,525 --> 00:51:01,347
we can't let traditional storytelling practices

934
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:04,369
take more importance than the actual game design,

935
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,851
or simply rely on proven concepts.

936
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:09,993
We're not making films, we're not writing books,

937
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:11,354
we create games.

938
00:51:12,535 --> 00:51:14,016
There's definitely room for improvement

939
00:51:14,376 --> 00:51:16,237
about how we can best use performance

940
00:51:16,938 --> 00:51:18,199
to serve a game design.

941
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:20,741
And the work we've done on Mafia III

942
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:21,801
is just a small piece.

943
00:51:23,026 --> 00:51:25,571
in the incredible potential of emergent stories

944
00:51:26,212 --> 00:51:27,194
through interactivity.

945
00:51:27,935 --> 00:51:31,001
And I really can't wait to create and play some more.

946
00:51:32,765 --> 00:51:32,985
Thank you.

947
00:51:56,888 --> 00:51:56,928
Hi.

948
00:51:56,948 --> 00:52:07,031
So, it wasn't quite clear to me,

949
00:52:07,051 --> 00:52:09,191
were any of the, is every speech action that you see,

950
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:10,171
is it all self-contained or is any of it

951
00:52:10,191 --> 00:52:11,552
built out of component parts?

952
00:52:13,092 --> 00:52:15,712
So, each dialogue ID is unique.

953
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:20,474
We organize them in blocks for visualization purposes,

954
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,494
but really it's defined per dialogue.

955
00:52:22,814 --> 00:52:22,934
Okay.

956
00:52:26,128 --> 00:52:27,789
Oh, hi. Thank you for the talk.

957
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:33,392
It seemed like it was a very design-driven narrative approach,

958
00:52:33,532 --> 00:52:36,513
so a writer wouldn't come in and specify what they wanted writing.

959
00:52:37,013 --> 00:52:39,714
You'd say, okay, here are the parameters, kind of fill in the blocks.

960
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:42,876
Did that cause any issues with writers

961
00:52:44,116 --> 00:52:45,997
not understanding the flow of structures,

962
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,978
and did you have any kind of cool debugging things

963
00:52:49,038 --> 00:52:52,360
where they were trying to test out a specific flow of a conversation?

964
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,341
And then, secondly,

965
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,600
Was there any instance where you thought,

966
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:01,802
I kind of want the NPC characters to converse

967
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:03,722
between themselves whilst making decisions?

968
00:53:03,742 --> 00:53:05,223
Because it seemed like very much just like,

969
00:53:05,563 --> 00:53:06,963
you play your thing and you play your thing.

970
00:53:07,244 --> 00:53:10,024
Was there any like, oh, I said something about you

971
00:53:10,064 --> 00:53:11,185
and they retort to that?

972
00:53:13,546 --> 00:53:17,267
So the first question is related to work with writers.

973
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,042
My goal as a designer working on this system

974
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:27,685
was to make writers work as comfortable as possible.

975
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:30,747
So I would define text conditions

976
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,348
and really expose the game system

977
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:37,230
and what I needed in dialogue Assets in Excel.

978
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:40,252
So really, hey, this is the combination

979
00:53:40,312 --> 00:53:44,114
of number of brackets that they hold,

980
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:46,115
the interesting game state condition

981
00:53:46,155 --> 00:53:47,536
that I want them to reflect.

982
00:53:48,396 --> 00:53:52,738
And all of that was just a very back and forth conversation

983
00:53:52,778 --> 00:53:54,419
and work between writers and me.

984
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:58,000
But really, the debug was done by myself and QA.

985
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:02,562
Actually, debugging dialogue is quite simple

986
00:54:03,063 --> 00:54:04,904
because if there's something wrong,

987
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:08,005
you figure it out very, very quickly.

988
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,446
And your second question?

989
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:12,707
It's two-way conversations between characters.

990
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:17,548
Yes, so characters being able to bounce off of each other

991
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:19,790
was done through talking positions.

992
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,212
So in pitches and reaction sequences,

993
00:54:23,773 --> 00:54:25,635
whoever speaks first, for example,

994
00:54:25,715 --> 00:54:28,538
bounces off of Lincoln line.

995
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:32,641
And then the character who speaks second.

996
00:54:33,662 --> 00:54:37,085
I don't know if you remember the first dialogue,

997
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:40,408
but Vito starts with something like, shut the fuck up.

998
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:44,286
And it actually doesn't matter whether it's Cassandra

999
00:54:45,487 --> 00:54:47,008
or Burke who speaks first,

1000
00:54:47,628 --> 00:54:50,410
and that's how we create that kind of illusion.

1001
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:52,812
Thank you.

1002
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:56,795
Hi, I may have missed something in what you're describing,

1003
00:54:57,175 --> 00:54:59,857
but I wasn't sure for things like the greeting

1004
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:01,498
where a single character speaks,

1005
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:04,661
is there any sort of priority given to a character

1006
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:07,463
who has more at stake or is more dissatisfied,

1007
00:55:07,803 --> 00:55:09,765
or is it purely random in each sit down?

1008
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,012
So it's a very good question.

1009
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:20,895
Actually, these are the rules for choosing who speaks.

1010
00:55:22,115 --> 00:55:24,716
For the greeting, I prioritize angry characters

1011
00:55:25,096 --> 00:55:27,817
than the previous pick for sit-downs.

1012
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:30,098
Ultimatum is the biggest priority.

1013
00:55:30,178 --> 00:55:33,139
Actually, characters in ultimatum states

1014
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:36,780
take priority even over Lincoln lines, and they interrupt him.

1015
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:40,768
For the pitch, it's the number of rackets,

1016
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:43,231
then the lowest loyalty level.

1017
00:55:44,312 --> 00:55:46,434
And the reaction is angry characters.

1018
00:55:47,695 --> 00:55:51,139
So yeah, the system really prioritizes

1019
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:55,403
angry characters over the rest, because it flows nicer.

1020
00:55:55,423 --> 00:55:56,465
Definitely.

1021
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:57,025
Thank you.

1022
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,783
I really enjoyed your talk.

1023
00:56:01,644 --> 00:56:01,864
Thank you.

1024
00:56:02,464 --> 00:56:03,965
And my question is,

1025
00:56:05,386 --> 00:56:08,429
you attached a gameplay reward

1026
00:56:09,529 --> 00:56:11,071
to choosing the different characters,

1027
00:56:11,311 --> 00:56:13,632
a distinct gameplay reward.

1028
00:56:14,273 --> 00:56:16,074
And I was wondering,

1029
00:56:16,975 --> 00:56:20,497
did you see a conflict that players had

1030
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:23,639
between choosing how they wanted the story to play out

1031
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,842
and supporting their own play style?

1032
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:28,283
And did you see that?

1033
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:33,528
as a good conflict or something that was kind of a bad choice that players had to make?

1034
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:36,331
And if so, did you do anything to try to minimize that?

1035
00:56:37,172 --> 00:56:44,360
So conflict in choices, economy, rewards versus characters is really the base of the design

1036
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,463
and that's how it creates interesting choices.

1037
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:51,432
keeping everybody happy, you don't really,

1038
00:56:52,093 --> 00:56:57,016
there are so many variables that can drive a decision

1039
00:56:57,296 --> 00:57:01,098
that actually differs really from players to players.

1040
00:57:01,278 --> 00:57:03,900
For example, in my specific playthrough,

1041
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,362
I focused on rewards first,

1042
00:57:07,522 --> 00:57:10,444
but then I felt bad for characters

1043
00:57:10,524 --> 00:57:12,325
and I started ignoring these rewards.

1044
00:57:13,005 --> 00:57:15,987
And so, yeah, it really differs from playthrough to playthrough.

1045
00:57:20,442 --> 00:57:22,097
Okay, thank you for attending.
