00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:13,094
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:17,317
Welcome to Breaking Barriers Combat Accessibility in God of War Ragnarok.

3
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:18,798
Thanks for coming by.

4
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:23,061
There's a lot to get through, so let's get started with an introduction and some background.

5
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:27,865
My name is Adam, and I'm a senior combat designer at Santa Monica Studio.

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:36,352
I'm excited to speak with you today about some of the accessibility features that the team built out to reduce barriers within God of War Ragnarok's combat.

7
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:42,334
I'll be doing a deep dive on just a handful of our accessibility features and explain how they came to be.

8
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:51,516
The details I'm presenting today is the result of a collaboration between Combat Design, UX Design, Camera Design, Gameplay Engineering, and more.

9
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:53,597
I'm presenting their work to you.

10
00:00:54,397 --> 00:00:55,157
Let's jump right into it.

11
00:00:57,288 --> 00:01:01,610
For those unfamiliar with the franchise, God of War's combat aims to deliver intense

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,690
character action in an approachable way.

13
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:09,212
Despite approachability being a stated goal, there are aspects of our gameplay that proved

14
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:13,413
to be particularly challenging to navigate as we aimed to expand accessibility.

15
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:18,595
We have many aspects of the game that are intentionally punishing in order to drive

16
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:19,095
engagement.

17
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,211
The player must keep track of multiple threats frequently

18
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:24,732
and respond in real time with well-timed defense.

19
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,753
How do we balance keeping these aspects of the game,

20
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:30,673
and where do we find opportunities to make accommodations?

21
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,555
I'll share a definition of accessibility

22
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:37,775
and the types of disabilities I'll be focusing on today,

23
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:39,236
so we're on the same page.

24
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:44,928
Accessibility is the practice of avoiding unintentional barriers that prevent players

25
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:50,074
with varying impairments from accessing or enjoying the game through design or bespoke

26
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,155
accessibility features.

27
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:56,962
Games constantly have intentional barriers, like needing to defeat an enemy or solve a

28
00:01:57,002 --> 00:01:57,883
puzzle to progress.

29
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:02,068
With accessibility, we want to avoid unintentional ones.

30
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:06,293
The primary type of disability I'll be discussing today

31
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:09,054
and how we design for them is motor disabilities,

32
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:11,414
those relating to control and mobility.

33
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:15,776
Some examples are limb amputation or tendinitis.

34
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:19,497
With less ability to engage with the game's controls,

35
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:23,039
many common actions become difficult or impossible.

36
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:26,820
In addition, some players experience fatigue

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,201
being only capable of playing for a short time.

38
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:33,655
Let's look at why motor disabilities can be a particular issue with God of War.

39
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:36,977
Here's an image of the control screen.

40
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,498
All the buttons on the controller are used.

41
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:45,182
Having a lot of actions and reasons to use them is all part of what makes gameplay fun and engaging,

42
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:46,422
both in and out of combat.

43
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:52,246
But this presents significant challenges for us as developers to provide an accessibility experience.

44
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:54,147
How do we approach this?

45
00:02:56,187 --> 00:03:00,090
There's some key context to consider from early in the project that impacted how and

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,632
when we approached these problems.

47
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:07,277
Early on, while there was a push for expanded accessibility that many could be on board

48
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:12,322
with conceptually, like with anything, there was also some healthy skepticism for a few

49
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:12,642
reasons.

50
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:17,006
In evaluating features, we generally considered these three things.

51
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:19,453
First is player value.

52
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:21,956
Predicting value was initially tough.

53
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:24,860
Many didn't know what the opportunity for improvement was

54
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,543
or how players would benefit from some suggested features.

55
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,907
We break out player value further into volume,

56
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:32,629
which is how many players use it,

57
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,252
and magnitude, which is to what extent

58
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:37,235
does this feature transform the experience

59
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:38,156
for those who use it.

60
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:40,717
Second is cost.

61
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:43,758
We had a good understanding of what it takes to make a boss

62
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:46,319
or an enemy, but much less knowledge of what it takes

63
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,020
to execute accessibility features.

64
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,041
This made signing up for a robust set of features difficult.

65
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:55,803
Third is whether or not the feature conflicts

66
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:56,803
with the design intent.

67
00:03:57,823 --> 00:04:00,324
Because of the first two features being so significant

68
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,865
on their own, exploring features that can conflict

69
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:05,146
with the intended design was much less common

70
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:06,187
early in the project.

71
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:08,988
How do we move forward from this initial uncertainty?

72
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:13,246
We looked at things that wouldn't conflict with the design,

73
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:15,668
that also had easier to understand player value,

74
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:17,830
to get our feet wet, so to speak.

75
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,733
Some examples for us were highly expanded control remapping,

76
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:23,374
which took a great deal of work

77
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:26,056
due to the way our engine previously handled inputs

78
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:28,238
and the sheer number of possible permutations.

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,481
Things that we could semi-automate, such as traversal.

80
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:35,243
We read the stick intent for contextual traversal

81
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:37,305
that would previously require a button press.

82
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:41,501
These both showed value at partial implementation,

83
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:44,182
even though full implementation took much longer.

84
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:47,483
So even if full auto-traversal is out of reach,

85
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:50,463
automating Manson's alone may be feasible as an improvement.

86
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,204
The experience gave us an understanding

87
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,264
of the complexity in the space

88
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:55,985
and confidence that we could succeed here,

89
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:57,345
leading us to take on more.

90
00:04:57,365 --> 00:05:02,026
And that leads us to the first couple of features

91
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:02,506
I'll discuss.

92
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:07,658
These are some of the trickier problems we tackled in enabling players with motor disabilities

93
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:10,439
to engage with the combat while not conflicting with the design.

94
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,362
Having a player-controlled camera is a significant motor disability issue due to requiring the

95
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:18,602
use of both sticks frequently.

96
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:23,545
Many players impacted by these disabilities can only really operate one stick at a time.

97
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,525
Because Kratos uses a strafe navigation set

98
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:30,306
and his attack orientation is relative to camera forward,

99
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:32,507
players can't use the navigation stick

100
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:33,848
to aim their melee attacks.

101
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:37,350
Our playable character being encouraged

102
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,791
to regularly switch back and forth

103
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,431
between melee and ranged combat

104
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,793
adds extra complexity to lock-on systems.

105
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,575
Players may choose to use lock-on exclusively,

106
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:48,336
sometimes or never.

107
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:50,837
So we needed to solve both cases

108
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,458
while expanding accessibility.

109
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,960
The entire combat system is designed to work without lock-on,

110
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,361
and the player can disengage at will.

111
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:03,923
Many players decide to use it 100% of the time anyway.

112
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:04,964
That's okay.

113
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:09,326
So it's key it works well in as many scenarios as possible.

114
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:13,948
And the regular lock-on has a lot of things that are important to it working well in the system.

115
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,251
In a game where we're encouraging the player to switch back and forth between melee and ranged combat,

116
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:23,252
it's natural to be locked on to the enemy and then pull aim.

117
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:26,593
And we allow you to freely aim even while locked on

118
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,853
to support managing fights with multiple enemies.

119
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:30,594
When aim is released,

120
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:32,934
the camera snaps back to the retained target,

121
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,555
which you can see in this video

122
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:37,596
as I incapacitate an enemy with the axe

123
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:39,716
before reengaging with the locked on target.

124
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:49,239
Lock on is helpful for players

125
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,819
who can't use bow sticks in combat.

126
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,984
But when viewed as an accessibility feature,

127
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:54,724
there were issues.

128
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:59,927
When targets die, having to find a new target is a big ask.

129
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,168
A player needed to press R3 again,

130
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,189
an input requiring force that's even on the right stick.

131
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,891
Enemies had to be on camera to be a valid lock-on target.

132
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:12,072
So if you physically cannot control a camera,

133
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:13,332
this is counterproductive.

134
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:17,374
Enemies disengage lock-on in certain cases,

135
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:19,415
like to enforce camera control as a skill.

136
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:24,354
Aim causing lock-on to temporarily disengage

137
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,976
presents a barrier for players with low dexterity

138
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:27,996
to use ranged attacks.

139
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:30,338
The enemy can move out from underneath the reticle

140
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,699
by the time they can throw their weapon.

141
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,281
There was an opportunity to expand this

142
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,122
for players with disabilities.

143
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:38,684
And the goal was to keep the default lock-on as is

144
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:40,745
and allow players to opt in to more help,

145
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:41,906
which comes at a trade-off.

146
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:47,009
So what do we do to improve lock-on for accessibility?

147
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,211
When a target dies, we can acquire a new target.

148
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:55,223
We continue to be locked onto the target, even during aim.

149
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:59,505
Enemies can't disengage lock-on, except in rare cases,

150
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,886
like enemies going completely above the screen.

151
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:06,269
We were also pushing mid-combat traversal a lot this game,

152
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:07,830
which reorients the camera.

153
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,411
We needed to introduce the concept of disengaging lock-on

154
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,913
and then reacquiring the target afterward, which

155
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:14,853
would come in handy later.

156
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:18,515
And we need to consider those off-screen targets.

157
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:23,749
Completely locking on to the target introduced a problem.

158
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,291
In this video, the right stick does nothing

159
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:27,352
while locked on and aiming.

160
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:30,354
But many players play with lock on always engaged

161
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:31,375
100% of the time,

162
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:34,058
meaning we needed to provide access

163
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:35,459
to precision throw gameplay

164
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,561
even with these lock on settings enabled.

165
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:40,103
That's where sub-target aim flicking comes in.

166
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,126
Initially, we thought we'd only allow you to flick

167
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:45,968
when it would guarantee a positive result,

168
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:48,090
common instinct when building assists.

169
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:52,654
This raised a lot of questions, made implementation complicated,

170
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:55,635
and required we made assumptions on what the player wanted to do,

171
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:56,836
which could prove false.

172
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:01,378
When we moved to a more generic model, this became easier to implement

173
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:04,739
because we could share data across characters more easily.

174
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,541
Also important is that this granted access to experimentation.

175
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,803
Nothing prevents you from trying to headshot or trip an enemy

176
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,264
that doesn't support those hit reactions under free aim,

177
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:17,385
so there's not a great reason to do so here either.

178
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:23,054
In addition to solving the need of reliably finding a lock-on target, we also turn a largely

179
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:27,395
analog endeavor, which is precision aiming, into a much less demanding activity for the

180
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:27,656
player.

181
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:33,718
With auto target, we don't have access to free aim, but we can move the stick up or

182
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:39,020
down to flick to various points of interest, like the creature's head for a headshot,

183
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,120
or their legs for a trip.

184
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:44,460
Melee focused games rarely do this, except on very large creatures.

185
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,602
But because of our emphasis on fun enemy hit reactions, this worked very well for us.

186
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,984
And when precision throws were mandatory in certain sequences, this feature was there to help.

187
00:09:56,765 --> 00:10:00,106
The player may not want to use lock-on due to its trade-offs or its input.

188
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:02,887
So let's get into a feature that helps players who are playing without.

189
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,234
Our close, intimate, third-person camera

190
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,116
resulted in enemies being off-screen

191
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,578
in scenarios they'd typically be visible in other games.

192
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,203
So Kratos always orients his attacks to camera forward.

193
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:19,066
So you can't use the navigation stick to aim at enemies.

194
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:21,969
Some players with motor disabilities

195
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:24,791
were able to either attack or control the camera,

196
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,653
but not do both at the same time.

197
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:32,287
In God of War 2018, we had a setting that re-centered the camera toward our target

198
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:36,969
when we successfully hit an enemy, which we knew helped beginner players with a less frequent

199
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:38,590
need to rotate the camera manually.

200
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,913
But we could expand this into an accessibility feature by always doing it when the attack

201
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:44,333
begins.

202
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:46,134
So how does that work in practice?

203
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:50,956
Here's a video of Kratos fighting a smithdraugr with this feature enabled.

204
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,321
The player can focus on attacking and defending

205
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,542
without the need to control the camera,

206
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,303
which is a perfect fit for this type of player.

207
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:01,064
Even if an enemy is behind Kratos,

208
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,725
the player can simply attack to rotate around and strike.

209
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:06,266
If managing lock-on was cumbersome

210
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:07,807
or it self-posed a barrier,

211
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:09,808
this would be a strong alternative.

212
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:19,112
Now, just like with anything else in the game,

213
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:22,497
We also need to validate the design of our accessibility

214
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:23,498
through playtesting.

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,941
We had a consultant with a motor disability

216
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:29,364
test out the combat with these camera assists

217
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:30,605
and other features enabled.

218
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:33,147
They were lower level quad.

219
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:35,449
They could still use their hands to some extent,

220
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,992
but also utilize their chin to engage with controls.

221
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:40,554
The feedback was highly positive,

222
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,796
and I'm going to share some direct quotes from that player.

223
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,428
It was hard for me to orient myself in battle

224
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:47,268
in God of War 2018.

225
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,390
The features really allowed me

226
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,890
to overcome the combat myself.

227
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:54,592
It helped me try different things I wouldn't normally try.

228
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:56,433
When I felt comfortable in battle,

229
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,074
I could focus on using more of it.

230
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,315
Let me try using Atreus now.

231
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:04,217
So due to not experiencing as many barriers

232
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:04,877
with the controls,

233
00:12:05,277 --> 00:12:07,058
they were able to engage more with systems

234
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,899
like controlling the companion in combat

235
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,060
rather than just focusing on getting through the fight.

236
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:13,806
This is a combat designer's dream right here.

237
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,908
We have an accessibility feature that helps the player engage

238
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:18,810
with the depth that we've gone through great trouble

239
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,391
to provide.

240
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:22,414
I think that's some serious player value.

241
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:27,078
We used information from this and other play tests

242
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,760
with players with disabilities to inform our next steps,

243
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,622
like the next feature I'll be discussing.

244
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:38,069
That wraps up the camera assists and how they help a player target and attack enemies.

245
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:39,749
But what about finishing enemies?

246
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,631
To go over that, I'll need to discuss stun grabs.

247
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:47,272
When a creature's stun meter gets full, they become crumpled.

248
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:52,775
The player can initiate a stun grab that would either do damage or execute the enemy, based

249
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:53,655
on their current HP.

250
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:57,036
The input for this is R3, or holding circle.

251
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,245
Now, these stun grabs fulfill that Kratos power fantasy,

252
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:04,347
and are also absolutely required to complete many boss fights.

253
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,629
Yet they presented a barrier for those with motor disabilities

254
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:09,991
due to the input being on the right half of the controller.

255
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:12,753
There was an accessibility opportunity here.

256
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:16,656
Now, you might think we could automate this stun grab.

257
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:18,597
And some on the team thought so too.

258
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:21,499
Kratos becomes invulnerable after inputting one

259
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:22,740
and during the grab itself.

260
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,500
So why not?

261
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:27,656
But an unmotivated action can be really jarring

262
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:30,377
with a close camera, and a stun state may even be triggered

263
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,257
by a companion acting autonomously.

264
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:36,418
The player intent and choice would be lost.

265
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:40,259
Additionally, we further pushed cases

266
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,039
where you would want to wait to stun grab,

267
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,519
like dealing damage to the enemy in the crumpled state

268
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,920
and then initiate a grab only when it became fatal.

269
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,560
To drive the point home, here's a clip

270
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,661
where Kratos and Atreus are fighting two Draugr.

271
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,417
I trip one of them and punch him into a wall,

272
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:57,017
which triggers the stunned state.

273
00:13:57,957 --> 00:14:00,718
I then attack the other Draugr while that one is crumpled

274
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,279
before initiating the stun grab.

275
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,700
This allows me to convert what would have been one stun grab

276
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,401
into two, thanks in part to Atreus' help.

277
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:11,622
We wanted to somehow capture the player's intent

278
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:14,163
even with this as an accessibility feature.

279
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:17,964
So we very quickly moved to the idea

280
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,805
of stick intent stun grab, later named MoveStick.

281
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,251
The player already needs to use the stick to move,

282
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,832
so why not use that same stick to stun grab the enemy?

283
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,312
Successes with traversal assist also

284
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,693
reinforced this idea, moving that button press.

285
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:37,154
This gave the player access not only to stun grabs,

286
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,555
but also the fun and depth around the stun grabs,

287
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,876
if they want to do something else before initiating one.

288
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,177
Further, having this stun grab check running repeatedly

289
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:47,897
while holding the stick also helped

290
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,638
identify technical issues with the setup.

291
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,012
This improvement led us to improve the implementation

292
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:54,712
for all players.

293
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:03,558
By now, we've had some of those accessibility wins

294
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:05,899
and tackled those first two issues I brought up.

295
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,481
The player value was clearly demonstrated

296
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:10,602
and we had more knowledge of what it took

297
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:11,643
to realize these features.

298
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,764
That third thing, aligning with the design intent,

299
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,086
would start to come up a lot more often.

300
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:21,973
Even when there could be a conflict with the intended design, would the opportunity be

301
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:23,834
great enough for us to explore anyway?

302
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:31,137
One example where the accessibility feature began to conflict with the design was the

303
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:33,478
extremely popular mini-boss checkpoint feature.

304
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,320
For main bosses, we often use phase transitions to deliver narrative or emotional beats of

305
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,961
fights and checkpointing afterward.

306
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:47,025
Checkpointing in our boss fights allows us to make each phase longer and more challenging

307
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:49,187
than if we required you to do it all in one go.

308
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:52,870
This is not the case for many bosses.

309
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,894
Enemies with large amounts of health are often used as an anchor in a group fight or as one-on-one

310
00:15:57,934 --> 00:15:58,354
challenges.

311
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:03,999
We had gotten feedback from our accessibility consultants about long-duration fights leading

312
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,443
to fatigue and that losing progress was particularly problematic in this context.

313
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:11,733
So there seemed like an opportunity to improve

314
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:14,495
for these players who needed it by adding a checkpoint.

315
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:17,397
We knew we wanted to restrict this

316
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,758
for the highest difficulty setting

317
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:21,280
because playing correctly for an extended duration

318
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,341
is actually a design goal of that difficulty.

319
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,103
With that one stipulation,

320
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:28,165
we got these checkpoints working in game

321
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:29,806
and they were selectable in play tests.

322
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:35,510
It was in the main gameplay section of the menu.

323
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,352
So almost every player would see it.

324
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:39,033
This is where problems came up.

325
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,018
The player awareness was low.

326
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:43,759
They turned it on because, sure,

327
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,300
who doesn't like checkpoints?

328
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,841
And then they played for several hours or days

329
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,343
without realizing it was still on, or when it activated.

330
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:52,924
I'll share a story from one of those players.

331
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:56,826
In God of War, you can unload your powerful

332
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,367
cooldown abilities to reach a threshold,

333
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:02,550
die to the mini boss, respawn at full HP

334
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,650
with all of your abilities,

335
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:05,572
and then just repeat the process.

336
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,353
Players would constantly do this,

337
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:09,374
getting a checkpoint, then another checkpoint,

338
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:09,874
and then another.

339
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:14,465
We had a player play through the game on a higher difficulty,

340
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:15,846
so they wanted some more challenge,

341
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:17,526
but they had the checkpoints enabled.

342
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,047
They gave feedback that the mini-boss was underwhelming.

343
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,048
And after checking the tapes, we noticed

344
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:26,408
that a mini-boss checkpoint was triggered,

345
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:27,889
trivializing the fight for them.

346
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,409
They were robbed of that challenge they were looking for,

347
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:31,230
and they didn't know why.

348
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:36,398
Tuning on the miniboss could have been done to address this feedback.

349
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:40,622
We would have harmed the design for players not using checkpoints, yet the core problem

350
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:43,064
of miniboss checkpoint awareness would have remained.

351
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:48,669
We were now feeling that this setting could also be conflicting with the design intent

352
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:50,711
of this difficulty, not just the highest.

353
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:56,275
To address this problem, we moved this to the accessibility menu so that players would

354
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:59,558
mostly find this if they were really struggling searching through settings for help.

355
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,032
We locked this out on both higher difficulty settings,

356
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:04,073
instead of just the highest.

357
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:05,894
First step the player should take

358
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:07,256
if they're struggling against mini bosses,

359
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:08,717
is turning down that difficulty.

360
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:11,019
With the improved messaging,

361
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,680
better location in the settings menu,

362
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,782
and locking it out on both higher difficulties,

363
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:16,423
the feature retained its purpose

364
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,765
while being far less likely to deny a player

365
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,407
of their desired challenge.

366
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:24,110
We also give the player a reminder

367
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,151
that the checkpointing is enabled on each death.

368
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:28,782
This improves player awareness of the feature

369
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:30,763
and reminds the player that it can be turned off

370
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:32,044
if they aren't having any trouble.

371
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:41,110
We've helped the player a lot with attacking

372
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,251
and finishing off enemies,

373
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:44,332
as well as dealing with those mini-bosses.

374
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:46,694
There's also the problem of defending

375
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:47,795
against incoming attacks,

376
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,176
which is what this next feature did.

377
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:54,139
Importantly, there was a clear design and conflict here

378
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:56,180
from the beginning, which we've been building towards.

379
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,869
I'll quickly share some details about evades.

380
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,251
In this video, when Kratos is blue, he's invulnerable.

381
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:09,634
And evades in God of War are split up into two parts, the initial sidestep and the full

382
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:09,874
roll.

383
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:14,336
In both states, Kratos is invulnerable for some frames and then becomes vulnerable to

384
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:14,576
hits.

385
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:17,837
There's also a directionality component.

386
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:22,519
Here's an example where I sidestep at the right time but get hit because it was done

387
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:23,320
toward the enemy.

388
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:26,855
Some attacks require the player to evade to the side

389
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:30,316
or backwards, not simply at the right time.

390
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:33,497
The player is often tasked with evading frequently

391
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:34,838
with a strict timing requirement.

392
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:38,559
Other games have accessibility features

393
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,240
that let you become fully invulnerable during rolls.

394
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,721
And in fact, some team members suggested doing this

395
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:46,602
for our evades, prompting consideration.

396
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,163
For our design goals, it's important that there's some risk

397
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:51,164
and timing involved.

398
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,005
It keeps defense engaging over many hours of play.

399
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:58,825
In addition, because of the existence of a companion in most encounters,

400
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:02,106
the player can earn damage without paying an animation cost.

401
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,447
If you could stay invulnerable indefinitely,

402
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:06,588
you can make progress and defeat enemies this way.

403
00:20:07,828 --> 00:20:09,289
What were our design instincts telling us?

404
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,511
Now, due to that conflict with our design goals,

405
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:17,492
our instincts were much like Kratos here.

406
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:22,253
The game and all of its content is carefully balanced around the existing frame data.

407
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:24,734
So a change like this would be detrimental to the combat.

408
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,619
But in discussions, this notion was challenged.

409
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:31,361
Do we really know for sure that any change here

410
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:32,982
would ruin the intended design?

411
00:20:33,743 --> 00:20:35,544
How can we know that if we've never tried?

412
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:38,266
Let's focus on the problem.

413
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:41,388
The timing constraint is actually an opportunity

414
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:42,649
for an accessibility gain.

415
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,292
And after all, the player's doing what we're asking,

416
00:20:46,352 --> 00:20:48,353
which is to evade, but they're too early.

417
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,096
If we could help the player out here, even a little bit,

418
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:53,297
what would that look like?

419
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:56,443
Thinking of the problem from this perspective,

420
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:57,884
here's what we produced.

421
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,027
With evade assist, we add some more invulnerability

422
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:02,787
to both states.

423
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,589
Here's a video of just the sidestep slowed down

424
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:06,790
for demonstration purposes.

425
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:09,452
This may seem subtle, but keep in mind,

426
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:12,074
this is a game where one frame is often the difference

427
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:13,575
between success and death.

428
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:15,376
We're giving the players several here.

429
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,838
They still need to have timing

430
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:18,999
and keep directionality in mind,

431
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:21,380
so they're engaged with the defense, but it's less strict.

432
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:25,865
We were able to validate this as we did with the previous features through playtesting.

433
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:30,267
This feature is also locked on the higher difficulties.

434
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:34,368
In the same way that defeating a mini boss all at once is an intended part of the challenge

435
00:21:34,488 --> 00:21:37,929
on the higher difficulties, so too is the timing aspect of evades.

436
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,051
Now I'd like to bring it all together by focusing on a post-game boss.

437
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:49,473
We have optional challenge bosses in the game, like the Valkyrie Queen here.

438
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,381
They represent the culmination of all of our systems

439
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:54,182
and are the ultimate challenge for the player,

440
00:21:54,762 --> 00:21:56,723
providing the experience that hardcore players

441
00:21:57,104 --> 00:21:58,905
and many of us as combat designers crave

442
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:00,105
when we play these types of games.

443
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:02,547
They have a high power level,

444
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:05,048
encouraging engagement with side content elsewhere

445
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:07,350
in the game and to be deliberate about build choice.

446
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,311
Their attack sequences are balanced

447
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,913
around Kratos' defensive abilities and their frame data.

448
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,914
They demand control of the camera,

449
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,235
requiring players to keep up.

450
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:19,402
They have a high health pool and a damage output,

451
00:22:19,782 --> 00:22:22,183
demanding the player play correctly for a long time

452
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:23,843
while making minimal mistakes.

453
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:28,665
At the end of it all, the player must input a stun grab

454
00:22:28,685 --> 00:22:29,345
to finish the fight.

455
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:32,667
Now, most of those assists I just discussed

456
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:34,667
are global features, so they'd be usable here.

457
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:38,829
We'd even gone out of our way to allow the enhanced camera lock

458
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:41,650
on features to reacquire these bosses after they returned

459
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,650
from going above the screen.

460
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:48,387
But allowing mini-boss checkpoints on these challenge bosses was controversial.

461
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:53,410
Some felt we shouldn't support checkpoints at all, due to this direct conflict with the

462
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,111
intended design.

463
00:22:56,052 --> 00:23:00,495
That journey of repeatedly failing, learning, and achieving victory is a highlight moment

464
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:02,957
for many players, even on the lowest difficulty.

465
00:23:03,658 --> 00:23:05,559
This was at risk if we were shortcut with this feature.

466
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:09,594
We knew players struggling at retail could internet search

467
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:11,234
for help at the first sign of trouble

468
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:12,735
and find mini-boss checkpoints,

469
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:15,335
rather than change their play style or upgrade their armor.

470
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:19,716
Now, when the line between difficulty tuning

471
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:21,537
and accessibility became blurred,

472
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:23,117
so too was the path forward.

473
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:24,738
So we needed to consider this carefully.

474
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:28,138
Now, a player might shortcut the challenge,

475
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,259
but they could also turn down the difficulty.

476
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:32,419
We already trust them with that decision,

477
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,760
even if these are meaningfully different in a few ways,

478
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,380
like those cool-down moves I mentioned earlier.

479
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,981
The fight's optional, but narrative is delivered after these fights.

480
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:46,183
Locking some players out of these experiences could itself be a design conflict with the

481
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:47,244
narrative goals of the game.

482
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:52,986
Players may rob themselves of that journey, but how do we know they will enjoy it less

483
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:57,428
if they selected it, or needed it due to fatigue or any other reason?

484
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:03,090
And to reach the checkpoint, they first need to make progress, as opposed to starting the

485
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,551
boss with reduced health in the first place.

486
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:08,725
They're only addressing the endurance part of the fight.

487
00:24:09,426 --> 00:24:11,287
Behavior and attack sequences all remain.

488
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:14,911
Importantly, the two higher difficulties

489
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:16,252
already disallow it systemically.

490
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:21,797
We were now more sensitive than ever to accessibility gains

491
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:24,279
after having seen huge wins elsewhere.

492
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:28,283
And if we hadn't resolved that player awareness issue

493
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:29,304
as I described earlier,

494
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:30,865
this probably would have been off the table.

495
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:36,371
But we decided to allow one checkpoint on these challenge bosses, which is pretty significant

496
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,212
considering they're tuned around no checkpoints at all.

497
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:44,876
Key to reaching this result and having a good conversation was validating the expressed

498
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:45,336
concerns.

499
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:51,159
While many of our concerns remained, this checkpoint would do more good for the players

500
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,501
who truly needed it than harm to a player who didn't.

501
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:03,258
In closing, this was a long and difficult journey.

502
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,119
There's certainly still room to grow and improve,

503
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,480
but we learned some great lessons from this experience.

504
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,122
Getting early wins built confidence in many areas,

505
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:14,683
allowing us to push further.

506
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:19,005
Validating the design through playtesting with players

507
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,445
and consultants with disabilities

508
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:23,266
was crucial not only to ensure we were delivering

509
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:24,727
the feature to the players who needed it,

510
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:26,628
but also to find new opportunities.

511
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:32,475
The trickiest problems were when a promising feature posed a direct conflict with combat

512
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:33,916
fundamentals and design goals.

513
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:37,017
These were challenging, but often the most rewarding.

514
00:25:38,698 --> 00:25:42,620
It was important to validate concerns and be empathetic to the arguments against possible

515
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,321
features, rather than dismissing them.

516
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:49,183
This kept teammates working together on the problem, rather than pushing each other away.

517
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,691
At the same time, it was important to challenge our design instincts and ask ourselves if

518
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:59,613
we truly knew for sure that the fundamental design would fail if certain features were

519
00:25:59,693 --> 00:25:59,893
added.

520
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:07,777
Throughout this journey, we became sensitive to accessibility, wins, making us reconsider

521
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:10,699
and earnestly push toward features we wouldn't have entertained at first.

522
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,722
Not only did we break barriers for the player, but also each other as players, as teammates,

523
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,543
and within our design thinking.

524
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:20,444
This made it very worthwhile.

525
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,002
Before I wrap things up, I wanted to highlight a few talks that took place earlier this week

526
00:26:30,242 --> 00:26:34,245
at GDC about the game's accessibility that will be viewable on the Vault in the coming

527
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:34,465
weeks.

528
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,948
If you want to learn more about how we validated our accessibility through playtesting, check

529
00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:45,651
out Playtesting God of War Ragnarok Accessibility Options by Sue, Senior User Researcher at

530
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:46,131
PlayStation.

531
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:51,794
If you want to learn more about how we designed accessibility for low vision players, check

532
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:56,418

533
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,219
UX design lead.

534
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:02,004
Last but not least, we're hiring for what's next.

535
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:05,427
If what I've gone over today excites you, please get in touch.

537
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:11,212
And that's the talk.

538
00:27:11,973 --> 00:27:12,573
Thank you very much.

539
00:27:24,698 --> 00:27:29,721
I believe I have three minutes for questions. If people can line up at the mics on each side.

540
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:39,187
No questions? All right then.

541
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:45,989
Got the pioneer over here.

542
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:47,933
Let's hear it.

543
00:27:47,953 --> 00:27:48,955
Great talk, thanks very much.

544
00:27:49,756 --> 00:27:51,459
Could you talk a little bit about

545
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,423
turning off accessibility options

546
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:55,406
at higher difficulty levels a bit more?

547
00:27:55,727 --> 00:27:57,149
Like what the thought process behind that was.

548
00:27:58,091 --> 00:28:01,212
Right, yeah, so you're asking why we turned off the settings

549
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,293
or disabled them on higher difficulty settings.

550
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,014
Right, so that was to protect the design intent.

551
00:28:06,914 --> 00:28:10,015
On those difficulties, we're asking the player of more,

552
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,716
and sometimes specifically what we're asking of them

553
00:28:13,496 --> 00:28:14,777
is something that the feature conflicts with.

554
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:18,058
We're okay with having those help and assists

555
00:28:18,258 --> 00:28:19,698
on the lower difficulties because there's not

556
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:21,599
a design intent conflict.

557
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:23,180
Does that answer your question?

558
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,840
Yeah, cheers.

559
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,400
Thanks.

560
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:33,951
So for the design team, what determines whether or not an accessibility feature is a toggleable

561
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:37,496
option in the accessibility menu or a feature that's baked into the game itself?

562
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:50,621
We made many improvements that didn't necessarily need a setting to be enabled.

563
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:56,686
For example, when I believe this is true, if an enemy gets stunned, they actually make

564
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:57,046
a sound.

565
00:28:57,927 --> 00:29:00,730
I don't think that was the case in the previous game, which helps.

566
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,793
We also have an audio cue that makes it much louder if you go into the settings.

567
00:29:05,474 --> 00:29:06,515
But other things like...

568
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:10,377
There were considerations for trying to make sure

569
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,339
that things were communicated both through audio and visual.

570
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,762
Where an earlier iteration would only communicate it through one,

571
00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:20,984
and that was just kind of baked into that content.

572
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:25,447
But, yeah, I guess it kind of depends on the specific feature.

573
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:27,348
I hope that answers your questions.

574
00:29:27,488 --> 00:29:28,209
Yeah, totally. Thank you.

575
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:34,913
All right, then. Seems like we're wrapped up.

576
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:37,388
Thanks, everybody.
