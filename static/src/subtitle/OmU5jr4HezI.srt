00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,158
Oh, hi.

2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,903
I'm Lucas, and I'm a senior concept artist at ZeniMax Online Studios, and you just caught

3
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:14,585
me finishing up this key art illustration for The Elder Scrolls Online.

4
00:00:15,706 --> 00:00:15,926
Okay.

5
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:18,089
Obviously, that's not really true.

6
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,393
This is actually just a print of a painting that I finished about a year ago.

7
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:28,018
The truth is that I really only work digitally nowadays, and in part, that's because the

8
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:32,342
conflicting demands of key art necessitate a very iterative process, which wouldn't

9
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:35,405
be realistic within the constraints of traditional painting workflows.

10
00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:40,830
At GDC 2019, I'm going to talk more about those demands and the actual workflow that

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,691
I use to address them.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,682
You see, marketing key art lies at the intersection of disparate interests which all have an influence

13
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:48,102
on the outcome of the finished product.

14
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:52,724
And the real skill in successfully executing narrative illustrations like these is based

15
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:57,046
on the artist's ability to navigate the demands imposed by competing stakeholders while still

16
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:59,647
arriving at a composition that manages to tell an engaging story.

17
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:04,631
So for more, join me at GDC on Thursday at 5.30pm for my session,

18
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,774
Illustrating Tamriel, Creating Key Art for the Elder Scrolls Online,

19
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,916
where we'll talk about those issues in greater depth.

20
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:13,660
I'll also pull back the curtain on my rather idiosyncratic painting process

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,723
and show in-progress images and alternate compositional sketches

22
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:20,687
that previously haven't ever been seen outside the studio.

23
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:22,849
I think it's going to be a lot of fun and I hope to see you there!
