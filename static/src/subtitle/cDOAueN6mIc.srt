00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:08,126
Good afternoon, my name is Vanessa Hemovitch,

2
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:10,727
and I am an associate professor of psychology

3
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:12,608
at DigiPen Institute of Technology.

4
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:15,510
And my research and the classes that I teach

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,952
focus on cognitive science, UX, UI,

6
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:21,193
and a lot of ways that psychology dovetails

7
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:22,553
with game design.

8
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:25,375
And I'm really looking forward to giving this talk today

9
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:28,857
and the role of schemas as a driving force, as we'll see,

10
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:31,298
with perception, information processing,

11
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:32,298
and decision making.

12
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,240
So for today, I'm just gonna sort of outline

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,020
kind of where we're headed.

14
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:41,913
And the idea of how is cognition relevant to game design

15
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:43,234
is something that we're gonna look at here.

16
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:45,975
And I wish I had three hours to do a masterclass,

17
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:48,335
but unfortunately I only have about 20, 25 minutes.

18
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,196
So I'm just gonna sort of boil this down

19
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:57,658
and schemas have a very complicated relationship

20
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:58,579
with human behavior.

21
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:02,944
They are easily formed, easily activated, and never really turn off.

22
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:07,106
And today we're going to explore the nature and the relevance of schemas to player behavior

23
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:11,789
and how and why they function to drive player perceptions and how they guide decision making

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,010
and things like player choice.

25
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:15,092
So what is a schema?

26
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:16,512
This is a good place for us to start.

27
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:19,655
And one example of this is obviously what you see here.

28
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:21,577
this cute little puppy dog.

29
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:24,161
And in research, a schema is defined

30
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:27,587
as an organized mental structure or representation of stimuli.

31
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:31,392
And schemas really do work to streamline our information

32
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,976
processing and categorize objects to help

33
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:35,118
them relate to one another.

34
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:40,185
General categorizations like this can more or less be considered universal.

35
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,626
This is a picture of a dog, not of an airplane,

36
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:45,247
and schemas tend to reside in our long-term memory.

37
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:50,109
That said, one more complicated aspect of schemas is their subjective nature.

38
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,570
So if I had everyone in the audience close their eyes

39
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,871
and imagine the concept of a dog,

40
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,172
we would see a lot of variety in this room.

41
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:58,653
I might picture a German shepherd,

42
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:01,094
and you might think of Snoopy or something like that.

43
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:03,886
So in terms of looking at schemas in action,

44
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,969
what we can see here is that when we first learn,

45
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,191
often when we're young, what a dog is,

46
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,573
a schema is formed, and this is called assimilation.

47
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,995
And this is the process of fitting information

48
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:16,216
that contains the features we associate

49
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:18,318
that defines this stimulus.

50
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:21,581
So for example, a dog typically has two ears, a tail,

51
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,702
four legs, and tends to bark.

52
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:27,065
And when we are out and about in the real world,

53
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:28,967
we see these stimuli.

54
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,031
And we carry forward what we've assimilated in long-term memory with us.

55
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:35,712
Is this a dog? Does it match the known criteria?

56
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:37,333
In this case, the answer would be yes.

57
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:41,475
So over time, what we do is we learn that life can get complicated,

58
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:44,096
and schemas evolve and develop into more specific

59
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:46,357
and hopefully more accurate mental representations.

60
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,198
And this is referred to as accommodation.

61
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:51,839
And it allows mental frameworks to adapt and progressively change

62
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:55,861
from simple concepts to more complicated representational concepts.

63
00:02:56,638 --> 00:03:01,246
like this. So we learned that schemas or dogs in this case contain a bit of variety and

64
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:05,213
our mental frameworks adapt. And by the way, we are doing this our entire lives. This is

65
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:08,298
not just something that children go through as they learn and grow.

66
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:13,148
experience invoke and change their schemas, so do artists and programmers,

67
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:17,732
players do as well. Really nobody is immune. So in cognitive science what we

68
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:22,457
do is we sort of work through schemas and activate them in different ways and

69
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:25,881
one is through what's called conceptually driven schemas and this is

70
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,182
known as top-down processing.

71
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:31,085
So here we see Homer deliberately invoking his mental framework of bacon,

72
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:34,507
which of course is delicious and I hope you're all not thinking about bacon

73
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:37,850
and can instead stay with me here as I continue to talk about schemas

74
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,891
and not talk about bacon.

75
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:42,573
And strategy is another good example of this as well.

76
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:46,636
So with top-down processing in a game, let's say like Rocket League,

77
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,762
What happens is what's called endogenous thinking.

78
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,144
And players learn strategy quickly.

79
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:56,447
And they learn best practices and procedures

80
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,450
to use these strategies, use this knowledge

81
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,951
to inform how to play the game.

82
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:05,949
For example, you should not really, in a game like Rocket League, send more than one teammate

83
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:07,489
into the initial strike.

84
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:13,030
You'll want to also maybe think about dividing the field and only watch the risk in terms

85
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,910
of chasing the ball.

86
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,591
Don't bunch up and keep the ball centered.

87
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,771
Maybe if you're going for a more aggressive strategy.

88
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:23,612
Personally, I find that the best offense is a good defense, and if you disagree with me,

89
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:26,073
I look forward to meeting you in the arena.

90
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,343
Gimas are also activated sometimes purely

91
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:33,206
from a sensory level, or when the environment delivers

92
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:34,648
a stimulus sort of at our feet.

93
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:36,910
And this is more of a what's called

94
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,692
data-driven type of processing.

95
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:41,155
And here Homer is sort of minding his own business,

96
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,617
and he happens upon the cola machine.

97
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:45,239
He might not have been thinking about

98
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,783
this attitude object before, but he definitely is now,

99
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,745
and it may even change or alter his behavior.

100
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:56,702
And for those in this room who have maybe experience playing Fortnite or other battle royale games,

101
00:04:57,082 --> 00:05:01,666
what tends to happen is sometimes the environment is so intense that player strategy just goes right out the window.

102
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:03,548
I'm going to drop into this zone.

103
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:05,970
No, there's 30 other players that are here.

104
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,750
Now what do I do?

105
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:07,671
Now where do I go?

106
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:10,333
And here the environment is telling the player what's going on.

107
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:14,882
And what they might get into is a little bit different

108
00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:16,123
than what they might have expected.

109
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:18,265
And they need to prepare themselves for what's coming.

110
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,587
So sometimes players have to adapt their strategy

111
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:21,768
based on how the game is going.

112
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:24,371
And schemas are what shoulder this burden for us.

113
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:28,175
Schemas allow us to shift between top-down processing

114
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:31,658
and bottom-up processing and meet the demands of the game.

115
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,440
So mentally, there's an app for that

116
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,641
and it's called a schema.

117
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,724
So in other games and I'm using destiny here as an example.

118
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:42,527
We oftentimes refer to on strategy-based schemas

119
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:45,629
for planning and the more that you are aware of these schemas,

120
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,591
the better you're going to play.

121
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:50,393
But that doesn't mean that players won't also be interested

122
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:52,634
if something does sort of pop up in front of them

123
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:54,896
like a golden treasure chest or a loot crate.

124
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,798
And there are things that will...

125
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:04,556
inform the player that they're close at the environmental level. It could be a sound cue that they're getting close to something that might be

126
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:12,523
interesting or worth checking out. So one question that I always pose to my students is, is it possible for

127
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:19,990
schemas in terms of top-down and bottom-up processing to coexist and truly be simultaneous?

128
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:23,774
And if we think about it, the answer is yes.

129
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:25,326
It is possible.

130
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:28,687
Knowing strategy and the schemas around that is a good thing.

131
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:31,768
Being open to the demands of the environment

132
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:33,908
and sort of knowing that we should react

133
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,589
to what the game throws at us is also a good thing.

134
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,430
So you may start with one strategy,

135
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,050
the game throws something else at you,

136
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,371
and schemas allow us to adapt and shift

137
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,871
between these different types of combinations

138
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:45,792
of mental processing.

139
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:49,033
So, games are not only able to do this,

140
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,873
they are notorious for doing this.

141
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,023
In the case of what we have here, Robo Recall,

142
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:55,585
there are plenty of game examples

143
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,348
where devs absolutely throw a wrench in the plans

144
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,831
of the best laid strategies that players have.

145
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,533
The player understands where to go,

146
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:05,957
the checkpoint is here, the game has informed them,

147
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:09,682
it could be a narrator, a narration, it could be an NPC.

148
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,431
and they already know where they have to go.

149
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:15,893
Unfortunately, enemy agents arrive on the scene,

150
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,314
they're probably blocking the path,

151
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:20,035
and the player's forced to sort of accommodate

152
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:23,057
and use that environmental input in a way moving forward.

153
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:25,378
And this is schema accommodation.

154
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
I have a plan, but the game world did something else.

155
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,842
So this is one thing that I wanted to kind of highlight

156
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:31,702
with this presentation.

157
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:34,344
Another one is how do we predict

158
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:35,885
what players are going to attend to?

159
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,501
People are complicated, and so are their perceptions.

160
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,963
But the good news is that science has repeatedly shown us

161
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:44,483
that we can, to a large extent,

162
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:47,205
predict certain aspects of human behavior.

163
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,466
And one way is to invoke schemas

164
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:50,946
that will guide information processing

165
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,747
through what's called conceptual fluency.

166
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:55,629
And in terms of understanding player perceptions

167
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,870
and predicting those perceptions,

168
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,951
conceptual fluency is one of those things

169
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:02,492
that's all about invoking schema consistency.

170
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:06,195
and designing game elements that rely sometimes pretty heavily

171
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:10,038
on how to navigate the game world and wrestle with stimuli

172
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,980
and adapt their strategies.

173
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,562
So players have a long history, as you can see,

174
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:17,765
with certain icons for schemas, and we build game icons

175
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:19,426
around those perceptions that can

176
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:21,608
and should be easily recognized.

177
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,450
And when we do recognize them, what happens is it aligns

178
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,493
with what we know and what we expect, and it's automatic.

179
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:30,295
Information processing is easy, and it feels good.

180
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:35,198
And really this is now sort of getting into the domain of UX versus UI,

181
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,919
which I don't have time to talk about today.

182
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,280
But I wanted to just sort of introduce this concept here,

183
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:40,861
because we are going to circle back to it.

184
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:44,703
So let's consider an example of how, let's say,

185
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:47,705
a typical player would interact with something like a game menu.

186
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:51,627
And the new game is generally listed at the top of the menu

187
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:53,208
with exit at the bottom.

188
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:56,170
And that's a schema that I think every single person in this room probably has.

189
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:02,436
And when those puzzle pieces click together with what I know and what I experience, this

190
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,337
generates conceptual fluency.

191
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:09,359
Here is another example from the Witcher series and you can see again we have a relative match.

192
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:13,201
That new game is listed at the top and exit or quit is at the bottom.

193
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:15,562
Here is another example where

194
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:16,903
things are aligning.

195
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,424
And in all three instances, the mental rule is in place.

196
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:21,525
And we have a schema match.

197
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:24,806
Information processing is easy, everything is as expected,

198
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,927
and cognitive load is relatively light.

199
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,868
However, what sometimes happens

200
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,829
is schemas don't always match to their environment.

201
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,868
Here suddenly there is a mismatch with this rendering,

202
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:37,250
and easy and automatic thinking is momentarily disrupted.

203
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,631
And as the player is asked to accommodate

204
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:40,651
to this new arrangement,

205
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,092
that violates some of their prior expectancies.

206
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:45,694
And cognitively we have to work just a little bit harder,

207
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:46,474
just a little bit.

208
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:50,376
This creates what psychologists call conceptual disfluency,

209
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,298
and conceptual disfluency leads to something

210
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:54,558
called attentional blink.

211
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,891
So when schemas are violated, mentally we often have to pause.

212
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:03,014
Orange juice and chocolate chip cookies is not in my wheelhouse.

213
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:04,795
My students say, go on, you should just try it.

214
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:05,555
I'm not having it.

215
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:06,316
I'm not going to do it.

216
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:07,577
It's too much for me.

217
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:10,339
I don't have time to tell you what's wrong with this combination,

218
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,379
but it's not a good one for me.

219
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,643
And when the disfluency is too strong, what happens is we reject it.

220
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,865
Here's another example of my students.

221
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,267
They send me emails, and they say, just go for it.

222
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:23,768
And again, I'm not having it.

223
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:29,007
it's feel free to do as you see fit I don't want to hear about it. So with

224
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:36,634
conceptual disfluency is another example again from my students this is something

225
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:41,378
called Cage of Thrones which is just a Google click away and most of the major

226
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:45,421
characters from Game of Thrones are photoshopped with the head of Nicolas

227
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:46,082
Cage on instead.

228
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:47,837
And to each their own.

229
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:50,459
The thing about Cage of Thrones that's interesting is that

230
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,340
Nicolas Cage doesn't really belong in Game of Thrones at all.

231
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:57,063
And it creates a very profound attentional blink.

232
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,305
And this, what's especially interesting is that these characters are so iconic

233
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,867
that if you put your hand sort of over the head of this character,

234
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:05,828
you could probably identify who it is.

235
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:08,649
And audiences don't even need to see their faces.

236
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:16,151
This hairstyle alone is enough of a cue to invoke a mental representation of a certain character,

237
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:22,392
and we see Nicolas Cage's face instead. And by the way, to be clear, Cage of Thrones is an equal

238
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:28,134
opportunity Photoshop endeavor, and no woman, man, or child who has a leading role in this series is

239
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:33,355
particularly safe. I just happened to pick two characters here that are popular, and there are

240
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:33,795
plenty more.

241
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:37,851
And it's perfectly fine to laugh when there is conceptual disfluency,

242
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:40,792
but the point to remember is that there's a schema violation,

243
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:42,613
and we do recover from them.

244
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,414
And they can be interesting,

245
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:47,035
but what happens that I hope that you would focus on

246
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:49,616
is that there's a shift from automatic processing

247
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,157
to a more controlled type of cognitive processing.

248
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:55,286
So getting back to games, as an example, oh I'm sorry,

249
00:11:55,806 --> 00:12:00,347
with Mario is that some of you may recall in Mario Odyssey

250
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:04,008
there was a bit of a slight wardrobe change.

251
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:06,549
I'm not sure if I can say the word nipple gate,

252
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:07,269
but I'm saying it.

253
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,150
Chest Goombas was also another reference point for this.

254
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:15,175
Poor Mario. I mean Mario deserves to have nipples, doesn't he?

255
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:20,721
He's an iconic character and this look generally had one of two reactions

256
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:25,807
and players did respond in a certain way that sort of violated their expectancies

257
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:28,230
of the traditional norm of this franchise.

258
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,253
And attentional blink shifts our thinking.

259
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:36,016
oftentimes to a more deliberate and systematic type of thinking.

260
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:41,680
And controlled analytical evaluation oftentimes will require consideration.

261
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,778
we can move from automatic processing to something else.

262
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,641
Now, science also shows us that we can predict human attention.

263
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:51,543
So it should be no surprise that there

264
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:55,285
are ways to study knowledge formation through schemas.

265
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:59,108
And again, it is our schemas that really do wield the power

266
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,169
for us to do this through something

267
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:02,210
called cognitive mapping.

268
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:05,993
And these are schemas that players create, often very

269
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,774
quickly, and revolve around their preferences

270
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,735
or perceptions across spatial environments.

271
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:13,466
They guide and inform player decision making and information processing.

272
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:14,829
And they can be automatic.

273
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,278
Sometimes they do require a little bit more deliberate or controlled thinking.

274
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,778
And in the case here of Titanfall,

275
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:24,039
this is a bit of an older image now, but still relevant,

276
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,081
players are using their schemas

277
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:27,782
to navigate their game spaces

278
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:30,284
to help them understand streamlined thinking,

279
00:13:30,364 --> 00:13:32,226
where they are, where they need to go,

280
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:33,847
and what might be in their way.

281
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,728
So for a game like this,

282
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,191
I understand that I can jump or parkour my way

283
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:43,375
from point A to point B, and through this exact route,

284
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:44,676
that's how I'm going to get there.

285
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,523
If we wanted to give somebody in this building directions to the movie theater,

286
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:52,486
you would go down the escalator.

287
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:55,949
We would invoke route mapping.

288
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,832
You take a left outside the door, you cross the street,

289
00:13:59,092 --> 00:14:01,074
and I'm totally making that up.

290
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:02,855
I don't know my way around this city at all.

291
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:05,398
But you get the general idea that we could give somebody directions

292
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:07,600
through this type of schema processing.

293
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:12,599
Now, another way that we see players sort of wrestle with information is through a topographical

294
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,764
map maybe in the mind's eye, even abstractly about where they are in terms of distance

295
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:18,366
and landmarks and territories.

296
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:23,892
So if I'm at ground zero in the case of this game, Fallout, how far am I from Diamond City?

297
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:26,495
And players ask themselves these questions internally all the time.

298
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:28,016
How long will it take me to get there?

299
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:31,318
And game maps help players to solidify these working schemas

300
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:32,179
about their environment.

301
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,701
So through survey mapping, sometimes it really is advantageous to,

302
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:39,162
or even critically necessary, to hand players that topographical map.

303
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:42,584
Just please be aware that the research is starting to show

304
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:43,985
that some players have preferences,

305
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,346
and they prefer to learn through route mapping,

306
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:50,088
while others have a tendency to sort of lean more towards survey mapping

307
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:51,649
in terms of understanding their environment.

308
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,330
It's a lot like some people are more kinesthetic learners,

309
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,710
some are more audio and visual,

310
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,611
and the data is starting to show that this also seems to be the case

311
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:01,071
for processing information at the game level

312
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,211
through these types of maps.

313
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:05,612
Now, in either case, there's a clear benefit to encourage players

314
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:07,593
to map their environment

315
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:11,053
and generate strong spatial frameworks around their schemas.

316
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:13,994
So, in the case of Overwatch, where is the choke point?

317
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:17,047
Is that going to be the best place to put my team?

318
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:18,528
How many can fit over there?

319
00:15:18,608 --> 00:15:19,508
Are we too exposed?

320
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:20,748
Where's the best vantage point?

321
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:23,609
And cognitive maps really do align with environmental data.

322
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,530
And something like Google Maps, they update regularly

323
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,471
based on player experience, time, and knowledge.

324
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,091
So we are accommodating our schemas

325
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:33,552
pretty much our entire life.

326
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:37,710
In games there have been a few examples where player mapping is not really

327
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,250
supported.

328
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,112
This is one reason why something like Mapstalgia

329
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,815
came along and I encourage you all to check out this website. It's fascinating.

330
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:47,816
This is where players reconstruct mental maps

331
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,258
of games that they played entirely from memory.

332
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:52,519
And I think some people cheat a little bit here and there, but

333
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,620
the level of detail is pretty impressive

334
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,362
and it also demonstrates the longevity of

335
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:59,023
these mapping schemas that we have.

336
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,404
And especially when they're tied to strong emotion,

337
00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:02,885
in this case nostalgia,

338
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:06,847
the ability to draw upon that prior knowledge

339
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:08,707
is fairly strong and it's also easy.

340
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,848
I particularly encourage you to check out

341
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:13,430
the Resident Evil map that's in Mapstalgia

342
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,930
because it is absolutely fantastic

343
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,312
and the level of detail is really, really good.

344
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,843
So going back to examples where games sometimes don't support this mapping

345
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:27,767
procedure. For me personally, when I'm playing Dungeon Master,

346
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:32,430
it can be a little bit more difficult to do because the player could create a

347
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,712
mapping schema, but it's not really supported there.

348
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:36,813
The walls all look the same.

349
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:40,395
The corridors left and right are very similar and mapping schemas can form,

350
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:43,357
but it's not easy today. We seem a little bit more.

351
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:47,523
able and willing to help players with their mental map schemas early on.

352
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:51,724
In fact, now our players expect it, and they expect it to be done well.

353
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:56,105
And this isn't a terrible idea, but we have to be very careful with our mapping

354
00:16:56,505 --> 00:17:00,926
not to push it too quickly with players. We need to, in the case of route mapping,

355
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:05,067
give them enough time to get their hands dirty in the environment and explore,

356
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:08,828
because that's how something like route mapping occurs. And if we just throw them

357
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:11,049
instant teleportation or the epic ride too early...

358
00:17:11,974 --> 00:17:16,676
that can be potential missed opportunities for them to really sort of get down and dirty

359
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:22,279
with the game environment and assimilate these schemas about space and ability to travel

360
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:25,761
and how long of a distance is between point A and point B.

361
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:31,334
Now, one of the last topics that I just have barely enough time to highlight here in the

362
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:36,056
interest of time is, again, the predictive utility of schemas for knowledge formation.

363
00:17:36,496 --> 00:17:38,797
So as an example here, I have six chairs.

364
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,039
And this is a concept known as category judgments.

365
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:47,321
We engage in stimulus recognition when comparing what is known with what we encounter.

366
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:50,242
And we make these category judgments all the time, all day.

367
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,283
This is one reason why our brains get so tired.

368
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,304
And here is a very simple stimulus with the example of a chair.

369
00:17:56,183 --> 00:18:01,385
So I think just about everyone in this room can agree that there are six chairs on the screen.

370
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:05,086
This is not some psychological trick. Sometimes my students think that I'm trying to pull one

371
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:11,369
over on them. But we have a schema for office chair and rocking chair. We also have preferences.

372
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:17,091
My personal preference is the chair on the bottom row in the middle. I love those chairs.

373
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:18,511
They're so ergonomic and they're great.

374
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,511
I'm thinking you can probably guess which chair is the favorite of my students,

375
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:24,771
and I will give you a hint.

376
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,832
It's in the top row and on the far left,

377
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:29,933
and that is one repeatedly that they enjoy sitting in.

378
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:35,135
Now, we might be surprised to find that top right,

379
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:38,816
top left chair in a game like The Stanley Parable.

380
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,737
Well, it's The Stanley Parable, so maybe that's a bad example.

381
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:44,045
But we have these models for recognition

382
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,686
based on the schemas that we find appropriate for them.

383
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:49,387
And these category judgments can really

384
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:51,168
be useful in terms of knowledge prediction.

385
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:52,889
So again, getting back to games.

386
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,390
One way that these, uh-oh.

387
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:00,959
Okay, so one way that these manifest is through

388
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:04,040
what are called template or feature matching schemas.

389
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:08,282
And in Minecraft, players develop a very efficient

390
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:10,183
working model or mental rule of thumb

391
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:12,304
that you need exactly three stone blocks

392
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:13,284
and two wood sticks.

393
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:15,865
And with template or feature matching,

394
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:17,626
typically it's a cookie cutter recipe

395
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,267
that only a certain combination of objects

396
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,888
will get you to sort of the end game here

397
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:24,229
for what you need to do in the game.

398
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,412
Skyrim is another example of this with the golden clock

399
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:31,736
where the task for players to complete is based on a template

400
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,259
and the game hints at what will match.

401
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,761
And if there is a match, the content unlocks.

402
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:38,723
And again, only this combination will do it

403
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:41,026
or the number or correct order of things.

404
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:46,814
In games like Riven, a personal favorite of mine, or even Monster Hunter or any game that

405
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:52,882
sort of throws a wanted poster at players invokes a very specific cognitive schema based on

406
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:57,849
distinct features and what players will do and we can predict this pretty robustly.

407
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:01,534
is they will compare the schema in their mind

408
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:03,795
with what is sort of thrown at them in the game.

409
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:05,576
Is it a match, yes or no?

410
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:07,537
And if the answer is no, we can predict

411
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:10,559
to a fairly strong degree that they will ignore it

412
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,760
or even outright avoid that stimulus.

413
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:15,422
And these schemas are activated so, so quickly.

414
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:18,043
It's almost impossible to see.

415
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:20,885
And we can study it through brain imaging,

416
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:22,746
but the point is, is that these schemas

417
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,428
really do propel behavior forward.

418
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:27,252
or backwards.

419
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:28,813
I don't want to approach that thing.

420
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:30,634
Or maybe, in fact, I do.

421
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:34,997
Now, these types of ways that we work

422
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:41,500
through different environmental stimuli can also

423
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,642
manifest through what are called recognition

424
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,823
by component schemas.

425
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:49,245
So schemas help us find the basic building blocks

426
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:51,446
of the things that we encounter in the everyday world.

427
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:56,766
And I'm all kinds of confident that if I didn't have the reference points on the far left,

428
00:20:57,046 --> 00:21:01,910
that you could sort of disentangle that messy stimulus or stimuli that are listed on the

429
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,130
right.

430
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,291
And the world is messy.

431
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:06,313
Game environments are messy.

432
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,153
They're challenging.

433
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:07,994
They're complicated.

434
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:14,612
And through these schemas, we have the ability to sort of break things down to their base levels

435
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,893
and repair them in our mind's eye.

436
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,957
And it's a little bit more cognitively taxing, but we can do it.

437
00:21:21,137 --> 00:21:23,139
And it is, in fact, quite possible to do so.

438
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:27,382
So, with that in mind, we are able to, when we encounter things in a game,

439
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:30,465
see, let's say, for example, these two models here.

440
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:34,728
And these two objects we can understand through sort of our prior knowledge.

441
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:37,050
These are the basic building blocks of the Halo Rings.

442
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,212
a train that is not feeling so good in Fallout.

443
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:43,853
In fact, a good horror game,

444
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:45,293
and Limbo is a nice example here,

445
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,574
will often take advantage of players' schemas,

446
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:48,734
especially in this way.

447
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:51,915
And we don't have to show our entire hand.

448
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:53,996
And that's the beauty of using these schemas

449
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:55,297
to really inform game design.

450
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:57,918
Because a partial cue is enough,

451
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,439
and schemas will fill in the box for us.

452
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,259
They will take over.

453
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:04,500
And particularly in reference to monsters,

454
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,401
players don't even need to see

455
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:07,121
the

456
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:10,979
the entire object in order to understand the danger that's involved, as you see here.

457
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:16,202
Devs, artists, and designers often allude to this, and they're invoking this type of

458
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:19,324
recognition by component schema without really knowing what to call it.

459
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:23,406
And we can do this with sound, we can do this with light, it doesn't have to be a purely

460
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:24,267
visual stimulus.

461
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:31,871
We can use these to sort of invoke activation thresholds and imply through a sound cue that

462
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:32,551
gets stronger.

463
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,653
You're getting very close to the loot crate,

464
00:22:35,073 --> 00:22:36,855
and we don't have to show them the entire thing.

465
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:41,379
A change in light will sort of guide players one way.

466
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,280
You're nearing the end of the maze,

467
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,301
but you're not quite there yet.

468
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:46,242
And while schemas are very good

469
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,164
for encouraging certain player behaviors,

470
00:22:48,204 --> 00:22:49,745
they're also very, very efficient

471
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,327
for other things as well, and one of them

472
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:53,348
is to help them establish characters

473
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:54,929
or even entire storylines.

474
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,112
So one way that this manifests, excuse me,

475
00:22:58,172 --> 00:22:59,773
is through what are called configural models.

476
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:01,475
And through these schema models,

477
00:23:02,343 --> 00:23:04,847
As you can see in the case of Assassin's Creed.

478
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:09,675
As long as the deviation isn't too far, and I'm thinking now of poor Mario again.

479
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:15,810
The idea of the mental model in the case of Assassin's Creed with this protagonist is

480
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:21,394
that sort of every game, every new game in the series, there's a little bit of a change,

481
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,095
but it's relatively the same.

482
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,078
There's always the cape and cowl and there's some type of gauntlet and there's usually

483
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:27,758
boots involved.

484
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:32,522
So these characters are iconic and we accept that they change over time as the series changes

485
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:32,922
over time.

486
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:37,891
But Batman can never have a red cape like Superman,

487
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,418
and neither one of them is really allowed to ever wear overalls.

488
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:47,019
Unless Superman is back at home in Smallville,

489
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:49,680
I guess that wouldn't be a total deal breaker.

490
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,360
But when deviations steer us too far

491
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,701
from the established prototype,

492
00:23:54,341 --> 00:23:56,021
players oftentimes will say, no, that's enough.

493
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:58,082
It's orange juice and chocolate chip cookies.

494
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:58,802
I'm not gonna do it.

495
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:00,722
And it is rejected as a concept.

496
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:02,862
In the case of Elite Dangerous,

497
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:04,983
clearly what we have here are configural models

498
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:07,783
that help to communicate to the player

499
00:24:07,803 --> 00:24:08,984
that there are different achievements.

500
00:24:09,604 --> 00:24:10,864
And they still look.

501
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,890
simple enough to the achievement prototype,

502
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,931
but clearly these are different.

503
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,911
And the overall concept is still easily understood

504
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:20,692
and not too much of a challenge mentally.

505
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:22,852
A more complicated example is what you see here

506
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:25,173
with Overwatch and other games as well.

507
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:27,033
These configurable models may need

508
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:28,394
a little bit more explanation.

509
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:31,834
But at the end of the day, the achievement schema model

510
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:33,355
that players have assimilated,

511
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:35,935
it still sort of is with them in their backpack.

512
00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:39,256
And it maintains fairly good consistency over time

513
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:40,516
as the achievements increase.

514
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:44,378
The design changes a little bit, but players are still able

515
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:47,299
to accommodate these changes and really sort of go with it.

516
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,161
Again, in the interest of time,

517
00:24:50,201 --> 00:24:52,061
there's a lot of other things that I could say,

518
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:54,042
but I sort of need to wrap this up here.

519
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:56,783
I hope that I've been able to share just a few ideas

520
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:59,385
about how schemas do manifest themselves in games,

521
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,285
and I'm gonna leave you with a few key points here.

522
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,567
One is that schemas are very, very important

523
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,888
to help us understand what it is that players are doing

524
00:25:07,408 --> 00:25:08,088
and predict.

525
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:12,045
how they are going to work with the information that we throw at them.

526
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:17,289
Onboarding, attentional focus, this is obviously a huge domain to explore,

527
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:22,072
but I hope that you would consider them from the perception of schemas,

528
00:25:22,673 --> 00:25:26,555
because schemas really do play a very important role,

529
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:29,197
and it is okay to violate those schemas.

530
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:34,477
In fact, it's pretty fun to do it and twist players' expectations and again, I'm thinking

531
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:38,340
of the Stanley Parable, it's just on my mind today, but we have to be very careful with

532
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,464
this because what can happen is an over-reliance on different types of thinking and they are

533
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:47,407
more systemic, deliberate, and more controlled types.

534
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,754
of thinking. Sometimes we want players to be on autopilot because that's a really fun

535
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:56,699
way to throw a wrench in their plans. And if we are violating their schemas too often

536
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:02,145
or too hard, that can really cause a problem. A flow is an automatic cognitive process and

537
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:06,349
schemas are very much within that realm of flow and help players to achieve flow.

538
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,451
There's a few golden rules with flow

539
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,432
that some of you may know.

540
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:12,153
We need clear and immediate feedback,

541
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:14,355
minimal distractions and so on.

542
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:16,736
But in terms of schemas, I'll just present

543
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,337
sort of one final point here.

544
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,459
If you want to virtually guarantee

545
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,760
the absence of flow in your game,

546
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,700
it's really easy to do.

547
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,962
All you need to do is place your players

548
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:26,142
under heavy cognitive load,

549
00:26:26,403 --> 00:26:29,004
because what happens is that is demanding

550
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:31,386
that the player activate schemas

551
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:33,307
to sort of keep up and change and accommodate.

552
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:36,050
And the point that schemas help players the most

553
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,432
is when they are trying to reduce cognitive load.

554
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,234
And if we invoke them too hard,

555
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:41,476
the task becomes too difficult.

556
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:44,359
And we want players to be boosted in their ability

557
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,061
to sort of work with new content.

558
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,103
Too much stop and think will also get

559
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:49,164
in the way of that process.

560
00:26:49,604 --> 00:26:51,406
And automatic schema activation

561
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:53,228
is absolutely one of the keys to flow.

562
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:56,927
Experience also seems to matter, and we can think about chess,

563
00:26:57,347 --> 00:27:00,570
where controlled thinking and strategy is super important.

564
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,013
And sometimes players have to work at that level,

565
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:05,655
but as they become good, it becomes an automatic process.

566
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:08,738
But at the end of the day, loss of immersion

567
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:11,381
does happen when players stop, and they

568
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:14,163
have to ask themselves, what am I doing, and where am I going?

569
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:17,132
And controlled cognitive processing is not bad,

570
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:21,033
but when we are interrupted, when there is uncertainty,

571
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,393
when we don't know what's going on,

572
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:25,074
there's a change of shifting from controlled,

573
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:27,755
sorry, from automatic to more controlled types of thinking.

574
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:29,195
Controlled thinking is not bad,

575
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:31,755
it just is not the optimal condition

576
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:32,896
in which to invoke flow.

577
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:35,956
So I hope this talk has been informative.

578
00:27:36,276 --> 00:27:38,937
I am really glad to see psychology

579
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,838
manifesting its way into games and games design.

580
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:46,279
kind of a bigger level. I think this summit is fantastic and if you aren't

581
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:52,402
on board with psychology it's fun and it's not scary and you should join us.

582
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:58,404
We have cookies. We probably don't have orange juice but there's plenty of

583
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:02,425
things that we can still explore. So I think we have just a few minutes if

584
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:05,847
there are any questions I'm happy to address those. We're going to get kicked

585
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:09,148
out in a minute or two. If there are no questions, thank you.

586
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,971
Yeah, first of all, that was an amazing talk.

587
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:21,412
Second of all,

588
00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:25,754
something popped into my head when you were talking about route mapping versus survey mapping.

589
00:28:26,714 --> 00:28:31,497
I wonder what your thoughts were on how The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild treats its map,

590
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:35,899
because it seems like there's a lot of both route mapping and survey mapping in that.

591
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,280
Yes.

592
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,601
And it does let you play around a little bit and get your hands dirty?

593
00:28:39,912 --> 00:28:44,113
There are a lot of things to say about that particular game.

594
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:47,634
One is that it is an example that attempts to sort of hit

595
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:51,816
the mark for, I'll just say, both player types that tend to

596
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:54,797
really enjoy route mapping and then others that prefer

597
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:55,517
survey mapping.

598
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:57,317
And they're kind of throwing everything in the kitchen sink

599
00:28:57,337 --> 00:28:59,258
at the player and letting the player decide, which I think

600
00:28:59,278 --> 00:28:59,998
is fantastic.

601
00:29:00,758 --> 00:29:04,039
I don't know how effortful that thought process was in

602
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,120
designing that concept, but it seems to be working.

603
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
But for some players, it doesn't.

604
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:13,945
really work at all. So, I say this to my students all the time, how on earth do I make a game that's going to make everybody happy?

605
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:17,688
And they seem to be hitting the mark enough and it seems to be working enough.

606
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,330
I look forward to the day when we

607
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:24,573
think of the different schema preferences

608
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:29,297
from the prototype stage, from the first stage. That partially answers your question.

609
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:29,697
Thanks.

610
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:31,759
And I'm happy to talk after, by the way.

611
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:38,994
Speaking of schema subversions like in Stanley Parable,

612
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:56,310
are you aware of any sort of research or work being done into seeing how games can work to help people challenge or rethink the schema that they have outside of the time that they play games?

613
00:29:56,451 --> 00:30:00,835
You know, the schema about the world or themselves or society?

614
00:30:01,357 --> 00:30:08,563
Beyond the game environment pro social gaming right there are a lot of pro social games right now being

615
00:30:09,143 --> 00:30:16,190
Created and pro social research utilizing games. I don't think we're quite there yet, but we're getting very very close and

616
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:21,735
if you would like to become a cognitive psychologist and help us with this endeavor that would be fantastic because

617
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:28,900
These are the questions that are now being started to kind of revolve around the community and I certainly don't claim to know all of the research but

618
00:30:29,781 --> 00:30:34,784
The pro-social side of gaming seems to be very high level right now, which is great

619
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:38,427
And you're talking about something that is distilled down

620
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:41,009
We will get there. We're just not quite there yet

621
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:41,649
Hi

622
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:52,953
When you create are creating a new system and say you find that it's sufficiently distant from existing mental schemas that it causes a lot

623
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:54,333
Of this dissonance and all these problems

624
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:58,775
Do you generally find assuming you can't stack it directly on top of those schemas?

625
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:04,798
that's better to get close and have those exceptions be a little bit outside the norm or to go a little further out and

626
00:31:05,018 --> 00:31:09,761
Have the person have to create new models for that entire thing. That's a wonderful question

627
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:14,463
Dark souls comes to mind just off the top of my head. You're dead. You're dead. You're dead. You're dead. You're dead

628
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:20,041
Some people responded very well to that, others needed a bit more time to adjust.

629
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:26,647
Sure, Stanley Parable, we've completely violated expectancies. I think the important follow-up to

630
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:31,752
that is how we design after the fact, because sometimes we just go for the punch of,

631
00:31:32,132 --> 00:31:35,836
this is totally not what you expected, and then what?

632
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:39,174
I think that's an important consideration to take into account.

633
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,335
I love a good schema violation.

634
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:46,337
It's better to maybe start a little bit smaller, but sometimes devs will come out swinging

635
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:49,099
and it can kind of go one of two ways.

636
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:56,582
Know your audience is important and good UX research will also help you get there, I will

637
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:56,782
say.

638
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:57,863
Excellent question.

639
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:58,383
Thank you.

640
00:31:59,184 --> 00:31:59,424
Hi.

641
00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:01,513
I'm too short.

642
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:06,438
So I'm worried that this is too similar to the last question,

643
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:09,982
but I was wondering, is there a way

644
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:15,527
to overwrite existing schemas without causing schema

645
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,710
discomfort or at least a minimum amount of schema discomfort?

646
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,454
And if so, how would you go about that?

647
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:27,856
I would like to think that hopefully I converted one or two people in this audience that psychology

648
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:32,499
is really cool and applies to games, so if I've won even one person over, I'm happy.

649
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,540
That's a fairly easy example.

650
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,262
To follow up on your question, reinforcement is really valuable, because if the player

651
00:32:39,322 --> 00:32:42,524
is encouraged to think a different way, it's a little bit harder for us cognitively to

652
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:42,764
do it.

653
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:45,985
It places a little more cognitive load on us, but if the rewards are there.

654
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:47,506
and I don't mean a carrot on a stick,

655
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:49,848
it could be an intrinsic motivator,

656
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:51,250
it could be group-based,

657
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,512
that's a really efficient way to sort of encourage players

658
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:55,954
to keep a more open mind.

659
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,596
And that's a very large question,

660
00:32:58,636 --> 00:33:00,657
but reinforcers come to mind

661
00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:02,679
as kind of a big helping hand with that.

662
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:03,720
Thank you.

663
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,621
It's a great question.

664
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,003
Yeah.

665
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:08,939
So, first of all, thank you.

666
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,463
And I have two questions, which I think will have the same answer.

667
00:33:13,023 --> 00:33:17,928
But one is, that was a lot of information really fast, and my hand hurts from trying

668
00:33:17,968 --> 00:33:18,469
to take notes.

669
00:33:18,969 --> 00:33:20,611
So, where can we go to learn more?

670
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:26,417
And also, I'm a consultant for companies that don't usually think about games, and so part

671
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,860
of what we do is go out and try and find...

672
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:33,868
evidence that we can use to back up our designs from ethnographic research to

673
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:37,175
other examples in the industry and so this is why they might have the same

674
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:41,182
answers. What would you recommend looking at to help justify using some

675
00:33:41,222 --> 00:33:41,743
of these ideas?

676
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,645
Well, I do know or I would hope that because this is being recorded,

677
00:33:45,745 --> 00:33:47,906
this talk should be made available in the vault,

678
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:48,806
that would be my hope.

679
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:51,788
The slides will also be made available as well.

680
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:53,189
If anybody can't wait,

681
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:57,291
I'm happy to e-mail you the PowerPoint slides at any point.

682
00:33:57,311 --> 00:33:59,231
So that's certainly an option as well.

683
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:00,772
The second part of your question was?

684
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:05,995
Well, actually, you just answered that as well.

685
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:08,516
But the first part was actually where can we go to learn more,

686
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:09,496
like dig more into this?

687
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:10,797
Oh, well.

688
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:16,938
UX is gathering momentum, UI, research, psychology,

689
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,119
sort of these two fields are colliding, which is great.

690
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,760
We have the traditional academics who study schemas

691
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,021
that are just now starting to sort of transition

692
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:26,862
into applying this more to games.

693
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:29,683
So you're a little bit, we collectively are a little bit

694
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:31,484
ahead of the curve here, which is fantastic.

695
00:34:31,584 --> 00:34:35,925
But in terms of a book, I will direct you

696
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:38,286
to Celia Hoden's wonderful book on.

697
00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:39,547
Supposing we've already ordered.

698
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:41,387
That is a very, very good resource.

699
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:43,308
We need a million more books like it.

700
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:46,410
One just on schemas would be a very large volume.

701
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,571
So the research is getting there.

702
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:49,772
The academics are coming.

703
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:53,154
But right now, a good Google search

704
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:55,375
is probably your best bet.

705
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:58,256
Always feel free to email me.

706
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,637
I'm happy to give specific resources for more

707
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:01,818
specific types of questions.

708
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:03,399
And I can wade through that research.

709
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:06,660
I do that a lot for people who get in touch with me.

710
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:07,461
Thank you.

711
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:10,426
All right, I think we're going to get kicked out of here.

712
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:13,313
So feel free to come talk to me.

713
00:35:13,373 --> 00:35:14,195
And thank you for coming.
