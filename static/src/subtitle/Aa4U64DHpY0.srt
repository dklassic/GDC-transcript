1
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:17,273
My name is Jen-Marie Owens. I'm the head of operations for Phoenix Labs. We make a game called Dauntless.

2
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:26,940
I've been with the company since we founded back in 2014, having started my career about 15 years ago at BioWare and then moving to EA Canada after that.

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,561
I have been a nerd herder as long as I can remember, and along the way I also got to become a baby herder.

4
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:39,182
I have a nine and a half year old and a six year old, and Phoenix Labs is my middle child.

5
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:48,364
And so we wanted to come bring this group of folks together today to talk about the challenges of being mothers in the games industry when you are a minority within a minority.

6
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:53,685
So we've brought together four great panelists to talk to you today about their experiences.

7
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:55,605
I'll go through and introduce them first.

8
00:00:56,653 --> 00:01:01,095
Then we'll go into our discussion questions, and then there will be time for Q&A at the end.

9
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:05,077
We were thinking we'll stop at about quarter to, so if you do have a question,

10
00:01:05,097 --> 00:01:08,558
feel free to line up at that time, and we'd love to answer your questions.

11
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,000
So our first panelist is Latoya Peterson.

12
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,940
She is our newest panelist to Games.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,782
Prior to that, where she is a co-founder of Glow Up Games.

14
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:25,164
She's the CXO there, and prior to that, she worked in news at places like ESPN and Al Jazeera.

15
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:30,192
She also has the youngest child on our panel with a six-month-old, and we're grateful that

16
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:32,375
she was able to join us despite that today.

17
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:34,237
She also has an eight-year-old.

18
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,604
Jenny Lee's made the longest trip to join us today from our panel, coming over from

19
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:41,967
Brighton, England, where she works at Boss Alien.

20
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:43,730
Oh, thanks.

21
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,226
Yep, I'm super pro.

22
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:51,467
She works at Fossilium where she leads engineering on Star Wars Hunters.

23
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:57,628
Prior to that, she was stateside in LA working at Riot Games and has one daughter who is about two years old.

24
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:03,629
Georgina is our Canadian panelist coming down from Vancouver like myself.

25
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:09,370
She started her career in games as a programmer and over the last decade has grown through many leadership roles.

26
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,551
Currently serves as the principal producer of core technology at Relic.

27
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,971
Which is what the slide says, if I change it.

28
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:20,773
And her kids are nine and twelve, and it gives us, the rest of us, a lot of hope that things

29
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,914
do actually get better along the way.

30
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:29,077
And lastly, Charlene Lescampe, who is the senior concept artist with me at Phoenix Labs,

31
00:02:29,237 --> 00:02:30,898
and the reason that today's panel exists.

32
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:33,299
She had the bravery to stand up and say,

33
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,001
I think this is something that we should talk about more,

34
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,882
but I'm not sure what the right format is.

35
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:40,706
When she's not coming up with amazing GDC topics,

36
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:41,967
or drawing beautiful pictures,

37
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:45,190
she's keeping up with her two and four-year-old boys.

38
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,950
Before we continue, I just wanted to really acknowledge

39
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,091
that throughout this presentation, we are going

40
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:55,612
to use terms like motherhood, maternity leave, and woman,

41
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,373
because those are the lived experiences

42
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:58,894
that we are able to represent.

43
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:02,095
We understand that these issues affect a lot of groups

44
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:06,457
of people outside of women and people who identify as female,

45
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:09,438
and that a lot of single dads also struggle with some

46
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:11,279
of these types of industry issues.

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,560
But for us to speak of our lived experiences,

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,761
we want to use the words that are correct for us.

49
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:18,443
That is what you will hear us referring to.

50
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:24,387
There are a lot of groups that could benefit from some of the adaptations and improvements

51
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:28,890
that we're going to talk about today, and in general, most things in advocacy, when

52
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,312
we improve things for one group, we improve things for all groups.

53
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:37,021
So as context setting, I'll let each of the panelists give you a small summary

54
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:43,687
of what their maternity leave experience and return to work has been as we come from a lot

55
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:47,871
of different countries and experiences, and that context really affects the way

56
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:52,015
that our motherhood experiences have happened and the challenges that we've faced.

57
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:53,897
So we'll start with Charlotte.

58
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,872
So I had two maternity leaves.

59
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:06,121
The first one was in 2017, and my second one was right

60
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:08,583
at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.

61
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:12,668
And so both of my maternity leaves lasted

62
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,950
Four months and a half, so being in the U.S., I was able

63
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,071
to accumulate some maternity leave from Blizzard

64
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:21,711
because I was at Blizzard at that time.

65
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:25,253
Maternity leave from California State,

66
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:28,494
short-term disability and long-term disability.

67
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:35,238
And so during my first maternity leave, my husband,

68
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:38,840
because of visa issues, was not allowed to work.

69
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,922
So basically, after I came back to work,

70
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:48,286
he stayed with my older one, which was incredibly helpful.

71
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:52,549
And for my second maternity leave, when I came back

72
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,571
to work, it was way more challenging

73
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:05,038
We were in summer 2020. We were right in the middle of the pandemic, so all the daycares

74
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:12,464
were closed. Everybody had to work from home. Plus, because California, there were fires everywhere.

75
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:16,206
We had absolutely no escape.

76
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:21,851
My husband had found a work at that time, so just picture that.

77
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:26,914
We were two parents working in the living room with two young kids,

78
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,518
with all the playgrounds closed, all the daycare closed,

79
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:35,501
and it was one of the most stressful years in my life.

80
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,284
Thankfully, now it's way better.

81
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:47,514
I'm working from home, but my kids are both at school and daycare, so now it's way more

82
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:49,136
balanced life for sure.

83
00:05:50,077 --> 00:05:52,981
You may have developed the patience of a saint through that year.

84
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:54,823
Georgina, how about you?

85
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:56,164
Hi everyone.

86
00:05:57,674 --> 00:06:02,239
Nice to see all of you here. It's wonderful that you've come in to see you in person.

87
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:07,384
So for my story, I started out in the games industry as a programmer.

88
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:13,630
I worked as a programmer, a lead programmer, and then a technical project manager when I had my daughter.

89
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:19,156
And I was at Radical Entertainment, which is an Activision studio at that time.

90
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:20,538
So when I had her...

91
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:26,046
I took a year off for maternity leave, so in Canada at the time, a year was the maximum

92
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:26,547
you could take.

93
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:29,649
It's actually 18 months now that you can take for maternity leave.

94
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,700
which is guaranteed by the government in terms of securing your job.

95
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:36,361
So I took a year off with her.

96
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:41,944
During my maternity leave, Activision actually laid off half of the studio.

97
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:45,005
My team was intact, so I wasn't laid off.

98
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,286
And then I came back to work on...

99
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:50,787
It was Prototype that I was working on before,

100
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:52,568
and I came back to work on a game called Prototype 2.

101
00:06:54,149 --> 00:07:01,712
And about a year in, some gaming executives and people from Radical founded a visual effects

102
00:07:01,772 --> 00:07:03,933
startup and I went to join them.

103
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:05,874
So I kind of left gaming into tech.

104
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:11,517
I had been thinking about leaving gaming for a while and some of those were personal reasons,

105
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:19,140
some of them were about just the conditions of the work environment that gaming has.

106
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,102
So I went and joined that VFX startup about a year later.

107
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:28,664
I had my son, also took a year off for maternity leave, went back.

108
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,786
I ended up spending eight years outside of games

109
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:36,108
and then joined games again

110
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,869
about two and a half years ago at Relic Entertainment.

111
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,230
Thanks. LaToya?

112
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,092
Cool. Before I start, so hi, I'm LaToya Peterson, co-founder of Globe Games.

113
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,633
Mitch Ukendake are my other fantastic founders right here.

114
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:51,724
I'd like to acknowledge the often invisible labor that allows us to come and do these

115
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:52,304
types of things.

116
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:55,286
So over in the corner in the yellow is Chiquita from Kitty Corp.

117
00:07:55,646 --> 00:07:57,468
And so GDC actually provides childcare.

118
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,269
She's holding my seven-month-old son, Gabe.

119
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:03,727
And they are a part of this as well to allow us to be on stage frequently.

120
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:05,929
This is labor of women and frequently women of color.

121
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,010
So I just want to acknowledge that.

122
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,473
In terms of my maternity leave story, so the first son that I have, my son Gavin,

123
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:15,756
who's pictured here, who's eight, I was working in news, which is very 24 hours,

124
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,477
a lot of very high pressure environment.

125
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:21,360
And I had the standard American maternity leave, which is four months.

126
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,062
And there is no guaranteed maternity leave in America.

127
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:26,463
It's not a thing that in the United States, I should say.

128
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:28,585
It's not a thing that is mandated.

129
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,687
You normally get 12 unpaid weeks,

130
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,549
and that's all that you're mandated,

131
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,711
so that was fairly generous considering.

132
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,613
It's interesting when I hear my colleagues on the panel

133
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:37,774
be like, oh yeah, a year, two years.

134
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:39,636
Not a thing that can happen.

135
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:42,558
And at that time, my husband was lead parent,

136
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,360
and so he ended up leaving his job

137
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,122
and staying home with Gavin for the first three years,

138
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,284
which really allowed me to continue to excel in my career.

139
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:50,306
He was the one that took the caretaking penalty

140
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:51,447
so that I didn't have to.

141
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,258
This time around, things have been a little bit different.

142
00:08:54,458 --> 00:09:00,081
My husband, having taken that caretaking penalty, was now at work and in a career that he enjoyed.

143
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,203
And so I did a lot more of the juggling this time around.

144
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:08,626
And we were also co-founding a studio at a very crucial point where we were about to launch and put our game into position for the first time.

145
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:13,228
So I'll talk about that a little bit more, but I ended up taking one month, and that was an informed choice that I made.

146
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,250
But it's definitely had ups and downs and some consequences.

147
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,671
And we'll talk about kind of like what are the realities facing,

148
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,933
particularly those of us who step out and try to do a startup,

149
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:24,975
and how that can go when you're trying to balance parenting and motherhood and,

150
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:28,837
or parenthood really, with all of these other things that you might want to do in your life.

151
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:31,319
Absolutely, thank you. And Jenny?

152
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:37,602
My maternity story is a little boring because I was at Riot and it's a large company, so

153
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:42,587
I was entitled to 18 fully paid weeks, no faffing with the state stuff, just all done

154
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:43,609
very easily through Riot.

155
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:48,434
And coming from England where the standard is at least six months and usually a year,

156
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,658
I shock people by saying I didn't take my full leave.

157
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:54,859
And the reason being, I was in LA and we got a daycare spot.

158
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,720
And when you get a daycare spot in LA, you take it.

159
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,681
So I went back to work early

160
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,721
and my husband took two months off as well.

161
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:03,282
So we had all this plan, like,

162
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:05,603
Trello board plan of who was gonna do what

163
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:06,663
and who's gonna take what leave.

164
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,504
All got cut short because we got a daycare spot.

165
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:12,105
So I ended up taking about, I think, 15 weeks.

166
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:13,825
Bright let you do a couple weeks part-time

167
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:14,585
to transition back.

168
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:17,346
And then pandemic hit and I ended up kind of using

169
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,267
the rest of my leave to do 50% work during the pandemic.

170
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:22,067
Thank you.

171
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:26,764
So while today is mostly about education and awareness about the challenges that mothers

172
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:29,945
can face in the games industry, we really hope that people can leave with practical

173
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:35,226
suggestions of improvements or adaptations that you as a parent or you as an ally or

174
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:39,227
you as a company could apply to supporting the mothers around you.

175
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:43,468
So for the first question that I really wanted the panel to go through, I'm wondering what

176
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:49,709
did you feel like was the biggest challenge that you have or are facing as a mother working

177
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:50,149
in games?

178
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,730
And we'll go to Latoya first.

179
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,928
Yeah, you know, the games industry doesn't have a lot of

180
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:58,989
acknowledgement of just that kind of a level of workload that

181
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:00,829
they're asking people to we talk a lot about crunch, we talk a

182
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,730
lot about all these different pieces of it. But when I came

183
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,890
from film, I came from television, there's a lot more

184
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,651
of a conversation around kind of things like core hours, where

185
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,831
you're not penalizing parents for not being able to make an

186
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:12,752
early morning meeting or a late evening meeting, because it's

187
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,172
conflicting with daycare, like those kinds of conversations

188
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,573
haven't seemed to quite happen yet in the games industry in the

189
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,753
way they have in TV and film.

190
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:20,944
Sharlene?

191
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:25,629
For me, one of the bigger challenges was definitely the lack of sleep.

192
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:27,631
Generally, like...

193
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:33,545
I would say before six months, it is rare that babies can sleep a whole night.

194
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:39,287
But because I was in the US, I was not able to take a six-month maternity leave.

195
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:48,710
And so basically when I came back to work, my babies were still waking up like two to

196
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,471
three, even sometimes four times per night.

197
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,251
And you still have to work eight hours per day.

198
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:02,094
What I did for my second maternity leave, and it was easier because working from home, was that

199
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:07,377
after lunch, for example, I would take a small nap, which was very helpful. And I wish

200
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:13,580
more companies would acknowledge that when you come back to work so early.

201
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:20,413
You don't have the same energy as after your baby is one year old, for example.

202
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:27,215
And it's totally fine because it's temporary. It's not going to last your whole career, right?

203
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:35,797
So I would love companies to acknowledge that and to let their young mothers coming back to work

204
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:40,738
being fine with, OK, you can take a nap after lunch and it's totally fine. And

205
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:44,299
maybe the very first month you're not going to work.

206
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:48,001
Exactly eight hours and it's totally fine.

207
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,583
As someone whose children did not sleep through the night until they were five years old,

208
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,745
I resonate with the lack of sleep comment.

209
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:59,927
We think maybe the six-year-old is going to start sleeping through the night soon.

210
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:02,208
Big hope on that one.

211
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:03,669
How about you, Georgina?

212
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,259
One of the challenges was childcare.

213
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:09,480
So I think for everybody, every new parent,

214
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,961
you know, what do you do with your young child,

215
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,742
regardless of their four months or a year or two years,

216
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:16,662
how do you do that?

217
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,683
In a lot of cities, it's expensive.

218
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:20,023
In Vancouver, it's very expensive.

219
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:22,504
Our solution, we were actually very fortunate

220
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:23,785
to have family help out.

221
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,265
So we pieced it together.

222
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:29,306
My husband took Sundays and Mondays off.

223
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:30,987
So I work Monday to Friday.

224
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:31,927
So he had Monday.

225
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:35,760
My mom helped with three days of the week and his parents helped with a day of the week.

226
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,221
So it sounds kind of like ideal, like wow, it's amazing.

227
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:43,622
But it's also challenging because they're not, like if you have a child care center,

228
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:45,063
it can actually be stable, right?

229
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:48,924
There's this person or this organization that's responsible for child care.

230
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:51,025
You know, grandparents can be flaky, right?

231
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:55,586
Like my mom took five weeks of holiday and so, like she went on vacation.

232
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:58,367
What do you do with your young child for five weeks?

233
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:01,268
How do you find temporary part-time child care?

234
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:06,750
in that situation. The grandparents also lived half an hour outside of the city

235
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:10,272
and we lived right by our workplaces. So

236
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:13,933
my husband would drive my daughter out to the grandparents

237
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:17,675
in the morning and then after work I would walk home

238
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,796
which was 10 minutes away and I'd drive out half an hour and have dinner with my

239
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:22,476
mom and

240
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:26,078
bathe her and put her in her pajamas and then drive home

241
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:30,299
and carefully transfer her from the car seat into the crib and hope she doesn't

242
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:30,820
wake up and

243
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,221
You do that for as long as it takes.

244
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:37,503
It's kind of crazy because you're like just on this crazy cycle of working all day,

245
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:38,424
running at the door.

246
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:41,085
You got all the time booked afterwards.

247
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:45,227
You figure it out, you collapse exhausted and then you do it again the next day.

248
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:51,550
So I think that's my child care story, which was, yeah, it was turbulent.

249
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:55,013
I think so many of those challenges in the moment you're just doing it.

250
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:59,318
It's just one foot after the other and then in reflection five years later you're like,

251
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,920
that was insane.

252
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,480
How did I do that?

253
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,361
How about you, Jenny?

254
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:10,452
We had the opposite problem in terms of we were, as many of us do, we moved to work at a studio

255
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:14,917
and we had no support system at all and we had to grow one organically by paying people money mostly.

256
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:18,321
But the thing I really want to talk about that I found challenging is the whole,

257
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:21,784
people don't talk about this enough I don't think, is actually getting to the

258
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:23,386
point where you have a baby is work.

259
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:29,932
Being pregnant is work. I couldn't take medication that I need that helps me actually function.

260
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:35,716
I had doctor's appointments all the time. I was high risk. And then I've had two miscarriages,

261
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:40,200
which is not something I tell my boss about because you don't necessarily want to be like,

262
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,902
hey boss, I'm going to procreate and bugger off for six months.

263
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:47,527
So like balancing these crazy unfair equations in your head of like,

264
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,650
do I tell work that I'm struggling with this thing?

265
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:53,894
Or will they see me differently? Will it hurt my promotion prospects?

266
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:57,918
And you know, I just turned 40, it took me a while to get around to the whole children thing,

267
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,661
so I'm very attached to my career and I'd like to keep it, thank you.

268
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:06,143
So I think, you know, looking at things like the overhead and emotional strain of trying

269
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:10,165
to get pregnant, having miscarriages, IVF, and then when you do finally get pregnant,

270
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:11,905
you're like, is everything okay?

271
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:16,967
And just that constant anxiety and extra load you're carrying around that, you know, your

272
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:20,088
partner's doing their best, but they're not living it every day the same way you are.

273
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:25,070
So if any folks in the room resonate with this, I've been there, happy to talk to you.

274
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:31,275
It can be easier than my journey, it can be harder than my journey, but it's not always Hollywood.

275
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:36,379
I will say that. And I found that just, I walked into that whole process not really knowing anybody

276
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,703
who'd been in my shoes and not having anyone to talk to, and having to build online support networks

277
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:46,627
through Reddit mostly to help me get through it all. And now I try and talk about it more

278
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:50,891
so people realise, yeah, I'm not the only person doing this, having this problem, having these experiences.

279
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:54,413
But it was very isolating at the time.

280
00:16:55,478 --> 00:17:01,342
I remember being the only person at the company who was pregnant or had the only woman going

281
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:05,644
through that and having to leave meetings to go throw up in the bathroom and then coming

282
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:10,767
back and trying to be ready to go and on it and like not skip a beat but also just being

283
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:15,670
exhausted and your ankles hurt and pregnancy was exhausting and you didn't want to bring

284
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,411
it up around folks.

285
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:17,811
It was really, really challenging.

286
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:19,012
I super resonate with that.

287
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,653
Mat leave options can really vary though, depending on what city or what state you're

288
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:29,978
in and what your company offers or doesn't offer to top up or support you in that way.

289
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:36,483
And so I think that you're also balancing those decisions with where you happen to be

290
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:41,488
in a project's life cycle and what type of work you do and when might be the most optimal

291
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,830
time to disappear for mat leave or not.

292
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,952
I can't be the only person who is like...

293
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,650
tried to calculate back from a ship date.

294
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,811
OK, well, I need to be back two months in advance,

295
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:53,913
and so nine months before that, but then put in some weeks

296
00:17:53,953 --> 00:17:56,314
for buffer in case baby comes early or late.

297
00:17:56,354 --> 00:18:00,156
And when should I aim to get back at the right moment?

298
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,197
And then a project slips its ship date,

299
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:04,498
and all your math goes out the window anyways.

300
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:08,020
So one of the things that is challenging

301
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,722
is that, as we've heard, it's not necessarily common.

302
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:16,115
for women to be going on maternity leave or going through these moments in their companies.

303
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,657
And so one of the things that we're hoping is what can companies do

304
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:26,620
and what can non-parent allies do to help normalize the idea of maternity leave

305
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,604
to make those transitions feel smoother or more organic as a part of the company

306
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:38,326
instead of these weird, carefully planned, and highly controversial moments.

307
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:40,207
Georgina, to you.

308
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:48,460
I think you may have heard reports of countries that have more paternity leave.

309
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,942
So I want to talk about paternity leave.

310
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:56,228
When I think about the Scandinavian countries, I think it's quite accepted that men take longer paternity leaves

311
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,990
and there's a lot of benefits for...

312
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:07,057
for women in the workforce by men taking paternity leave, as well as for the families and for the community at large.

313
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:12,321
In Canada, we do support paternity leave, like there's government support for it,

314
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:24,290
but typically, in my experience, men in the game dev industry who have taken PAT leave take about a month of time off to be with their child.

315
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:30,109
So I wanted to share this story with you of the technical director at Relic.

316
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,315
He's the technical director on the Age of Empires 4 game.

317
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,858
So we shipped that game last year.

318
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,001
I don't know if any of you know it.

319
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,725
It's a real-time strategy game, massive game.

320
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:43,306
Shipped really well.

321
00:19:43,946 --> 00:19:46,107
The team did a fantastic job with it.

322
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:52,291
So two years before the ship date, the technical director's wife was pregnant,

323
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:56,333
and they decided that he was going to take six months of paternity leave.

324
00:19:56,873 --> 00:19:59,995
So she was going to take the first six months off to be with the baby,

325
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:03,736
and then he was going to take the latter six months and be in the full-time child care

326
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:05,798
while she went back to work.

327
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:13,744
So they went and did that, and in hindsight now, there were successes from his story.

328
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:20,949
So for himself, he was actually surprised that he needed a mental break after working on this

329
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:24,331
game, which was five years in development, very intense back-to-back development.

330
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:31,458
And for him to take six months off actually gave him time to just have something different to think about.

331
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,981
So that was a real personal wellness benefit for him.

332
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:41,007
And he also got to spend a significant amount of time with his baby.

333
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:42,048
There's nothing quite like...

334
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:47,345
being the primary caregiver of a tiny little person that changes you.

335
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,906
And so that was something very special for him to do.

336
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:58,009
For his wife, obviously she got to go back to work six months earlier and continue her career.

337
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,449
So for his family, it was great.

338
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,130
For the Age of Empires team,

339
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,948
What they needed to do was create a transition plan.

340
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:07,969
So they knew he was going to be taking six months off.

341
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:12,791
It was stressful for the team, but they looked at who would take on the responsibilities.

342
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,092
He has a big job.

343
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:19,755
That work was spread around, and an acting TD was selected to cover

344
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:21,536
for him while he was on his paternity leave.

345
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:25,218
So that acting TD got an opportunity to step up, to shine.

346
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,981
He had a huge impact on the game, and it furthered his career.

347
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:30,961
He got a promotion out of it.

348
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:32,662
So it opened up an opportunity.

349
00:21:33,152 --> 00:21:33,933
for a new role.

350
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:41,136
And then for Relic, now we have a senior leader that's come back to work with a new perspective,

351
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,618
with a deep understanding of what it's like to be a parent, a new parent.

352
00:21:47,677 --> 00:21:50,259
And he brings that to his team and the organization.

353
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,384
He sets an example for future dads who want to take a longer paternity leave, or what

354
00:21:55,404 --> 00:21:58,567
it can look like, what good looks like for taking a leave.

355
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:05,373
And then he also normalizes maternity leave, because now women, you know, here's a man

356
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:08,856
as well, but now women taking a longer leave.

357
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:13,773
to look after their child and then returning to work is more normative within the company.

358
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:19,617
So it's, I think, a really great story that he was happy for me to share with all of you.

359
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:24,199
Yeah, it's really interesting, Kanija, that we have the opportunity for men to take covered

360
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,642
paternity leave, but it is really uncommon that it happens.

361
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:34,506
And the more often that we can get the idea of leave as a part of our ecosystem, the less

362
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:36,707
challenging it is for someone to put up their hand and say, like,

363
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,704
Hey, it's my turn and I need to go through.

364
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:39,665
We have a system.

365
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,809
We understand how to build a transition plan.

366
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:46,596
We understand how to bring people into a project and transition them out later.

367
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:48,579
We understand how the benefits work.

368
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:52,348
Every time a company is able to practice those skills,

369
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:54,490
it gets easier for the next person

370
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,031
who's going through that experience.

371
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:58,272
Being the first is always the hardest

372
00:22:58,392 --> 00:22:59,152
to go through a system

373
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:00,853
and your company's building it with you.

374
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:02,815
And I think it's really important,

375
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:05,216
you mentioned that he brings that new perspective

376
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:06,157
back to the team.

377
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,378
You know, we talk a lot in the games industry,

378
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:11,380
I think, about people bringing their whole self to work

379
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,361
and being able to be themselves in their spaces,

380
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:15,942
but we tend to think of that more as like,

381
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:21,598
It's okay for you to have different hobbies, and having multicolored hair is positive,

382
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:21,918
right?

383
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:27,300
But we don't necessarily think of it as like talking about your kids at work is part of

384
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,220
bringing your whole self to the office.

385
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,482
And we've, throughout my career, one of the things that I've tried to normalize is discussing

386
00:23:34,522 --> 00:23:35,782
my children actively.

387
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:41,618
In regards to my work day, and in regards to the work I do, and encouraging other people to talk about their kids as well.

388
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:47,941
So that the idea that we are parents in addition to game developers is just part of our regular discourse,

389
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:52,763
instead of this weird thing that we kind of try to pretend isn't distracting us.

390
00:23:53,423 --> 00:23:55,485
Or isn't taking up any time.

391
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,946
And, you know, I'm on top of it.

392
00:23:57,966 --> 00:23:58,487
I can do everything 100%.

393
00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:02,729
Like kids are a drain on our emotional energy,

394
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,771
our mental energy, our sleep patterns.

395
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:07,553
And the more that we can make that a part of the conversation,

396
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,754
I think that we can normalize the idea

397
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:12,816
of multifaceted humans in the workplace.

398
00:24:14,157 --> 00:24:16,879
But I think that regardless of how much time somebody ends

399
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,760
up taking off, most of us end up having

400
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,342
to do that transition back from.

401
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:25,805
I'm at home full time as a primary caregiver, not thinking about game development,

402
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:31,449
getting a new perspective to I'm working eight hours a day and I'm balancing childcare needs

403
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:34,751
and I'm trying to figure out what to do on sick days and Pro-D days and the summer break

404
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:36,833
and the spring break and the Christmas break.

405
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:41,936
And that transitional period can be really challenging.

406
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:46,680
And I'm wondering, Charlene, what did you do or do you wish that you had done

407
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,881
to better prep yourself for that change?

408
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:57,572
I think I was able to get a good preparation about that.

409
00:24:57,612 --> 00:25:03,374
Like for my first maternity leave, what I made is that I actively discussed, once I

410
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:06,675
said to my leads that, OK, I'm pregnant and so on.

411
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:09,256
In a few months, I'm going to give birth,

412
00:25:09,437 --> 00:25:12,278
and my maternity leave is going to last that amount of time.

413
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,220
Right after that, we started to discuss

414
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,422
about getting a more flexible schedule.

415
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:22,403
And so basically, when I was on Hearthstone at Blizzard,

416
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:26,445
we were lucky to have very good management and leadership.

417
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,547
And so when I came back to work in 2008,

418
00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:45,340
18. I was working from 7am to 4pm. So basically I was the only one with our art director at 7am

419
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:51,526
because he was an early bird too. While most of the team, most of the Hurston team was arriving

420
00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:52,426
at work around...

421
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:55,458
10 a.m., something like that.

422
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:59,079
And so I had also

423
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,620
pumped a bunch of milk

424
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,260
when I was

425
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,841
still at home during the maternity leave

426
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,761
because for me breastfeeding was very

427
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:09,822
important. And in addition to

428
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,843
that, there was a pumping room

429
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,803
at Blizzard in each building, I

430
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,043
think.

431
00:26:15,164 --> 00:26:20,328
So when I came back to work, I was sure that I would have some milk in advance.

432
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:26,932
So if I was too stressed, you know, to pump at work, I still would have one week, you know, of milk already ready.

433
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:35,878
And thanks to that pumping room, then I was able to breastfeed my older one until two years old.

434
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,539
So that was very helpful.

435
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:43,160
Like that's an advice I would give to future mothers or wannabe mothers.

436
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,081
Try to discuss about that with your management and your leadership

437
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:54,182
because preparing that in advance, having time and like the flexible schedule

438
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,922
is definitely going to be very helpful for you.

439
00:26:57,042 --> 00:27:02,864
I was so happy, like I was just a half hour working from work

440
00:27:02,924 --> 00:27:04,824
and so being able to see your kids that...

441
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,261
4.30 and not just for the bedtime was so amazing.

442
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:15,262
I did that eight to four shift for a long time for the same reason.

443
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:21,883
You mentioned this idea of flexible schedules and I think that it's a statement that is very,

444
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:27,824
very clear now that COVID has had a huge effect on working configurations and how we think about work

445
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:32,745
and the division of where we spend our time that is different than several years ago when we were

446
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:35,186
maybe going through that with our children the first time.

447
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:40,570
At a holistic like project level, I would say that making games

448
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,491
with everyone fully remotely is still a lot more difficult than making them in person.

449
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:48,732
You know, most games have ended up shipping slip dates over the last two years.

450
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:54,114
It's been really challenging on a lot of fronts for a lot of people on project levels.

451
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:59,576
But at individual levels, there are a lot of individuals who have thrived working from home

452
00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:02,437
more than they did working in an office space.

453
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:09,968
And I think for a lot of parents, it's been more of a mixed bag of blessings and curses

454
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,909
over the last two and a half years.

455
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:17,074
For myself, working at home with kids was very challenging because regardless of whether

456
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:21,738
another parent was already in the space, they expected me to be the primary parent.

457
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:26,722
And spending eight hours a day on Zoom meant that was either I was not paying attention

458
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:30,125
to my meetings or I was not paying attention to my kids, but everybody was feeling...

459
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:32,795
Disappointed with the amount of focus that they were getting.

460
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:36,939
And it wasn't like I could just push that time into the evenings or the weekends

461
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:40,362
because it was all time that had to be overlapping with other humans.

462
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:44,745
So for me, being able to return to the office was a huge mental health improvement.

463
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:45,506
And my kids.

464
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,417
We're a lot happier because the primary parent was focused on them.

465
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:55,039
They had caregiving that was not distracted by Slack or Zoom or so on.

466
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:59,540
But it's really varied for people what that experience has been like.

467
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,081
And so I put to the whole panel, like, what have those pros

468
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:09,703
and cons been for you in working at home through COVID?

469
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:10,803
Jenny.

470
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,962
I relocated countries during COVID, so it's been, it was definitely an interesting experience.

471
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:21,764
I think, you know, coming back from maternity leave right before the pandemic, about six

472
00:29:21,804 --> 00:29:26,886
months before I guess, and then having to ship a game during COVID from home while everyone

473
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:27,866
was still figuring everything out.

474
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:34,351
with all daycare shut was stressful, but I think I've got to a really good steady state now.

475
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:40,515
And it's a double-edged sword, flexibility. We're all going to say the word flexibility a lot in this panel.

476
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:45,118
But for me being able to deal with some of these curveballs that life throws you, like,

477
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:50,121
hey, my daughter's nursery school right now is understaffed. Teachers can't come in because they're sick.

478
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,742
They're asking us to keep our kids home.

479
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,443
OK, I don't have anywhere else to put the kids.

480
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:55,624
So, well, the kid.

481
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:56,804
So what do I do?

482
00:29:57,184 --> 00:29:59,045
Well, actually, my husband and I can look at our schedules.

483
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:00,486
We can say, OK, I'll take this meeting.

484
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:01,386
You take that meeting.

485
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,747
And we can be really flexible.

486
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,388
And we have very understanding teams that are like, OK, you know, as long as you get

487
00:30:05,408 --> 00:30:07,189
your work done, we're not going to police you.

488
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,471
We also have a lot of good paid time off and sick leave in the UK, too.

489
00:30:10,971 --> 00:30:12,812
So I think, you know, being able to say, OK, I'm going to...

490
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,053
I have to focus on one thing.

491
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:17,575
I don't do the thing where my daughter's working next to me.

492
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:18,755
That doesn't work for me.

493
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:22,338
My office is in a separate space from my house, so I don't walk to the bathroom

494
00:30:22,378 --> 00:30:24,299
and see the laundry and go, oh gosh, I've got to do that.

495
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,259
I've got to clean the kitchen.

496
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,681
And all these things that just pile up every day from being at home.

497
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:30,423
But having got to the steady state where, you know,

498
00:30:30,523 --> 00:30:33,084
I can deal with those emergencies, I don't have to commute.

499
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:34,305
I don't have to make a choice.

500
00:30:34,385 --> 00:30:37,327
It should my daughter's school be near my workplace or near my home.

501
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:40,028
And what do we do if you're in the wrong place on the wrong day?

502
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,830
And just all that overhead is gone.

503
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,835
And I really appreciate just having that real flexibility to design my life with my daughter

504
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:47,535
the way I want.

505
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:50,979
And I definitely think we've learned a lot and made a lot of improvements during the

506
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:51,460
pandemic.

507
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,685
But it was very different when you had an 18-month-old baby and a job and nowhere to

508
00:30:56,705 --> 00:30:57,306
put the baby.

509
00:30:58,046 --> 00:31:00,169
So those days are gone for now, thank goodness.

510
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,491
You're stressed.

511
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:04,073
How about you, Latoya?

512
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:07,159
Yeah, I mean, so there are upsides and downsides.

513
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,962
So working at home during COVID, one of the great things that was about it was that at

514
00:31:11,022 --> 00:31:14,284
some point you got to really understand what your kids are doing during the day and who

515
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:17,607
they are and how they interact, especially when everybody was on Zoom.

516
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:19,548
At one point, Gavin and I were coworkers.

517
00:31:20,177 --> 00:31:23,519
And it was just much easier to give him like a little desk in my office and he decorated

518
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:27,221
with Pokemon and had all the stuff together for us to be like just kind of next to each

519
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:27,781
other working.

520
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:29,763
And you know, over time, we kind of worked out the rhythm.

521
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:32,204
So I think that was the best era of what was happening.

522
00:31:32,805 --> 00:31:36,007
But there's also the flip side to it, which is like, you know, you're normally like managing

523
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:40,230
all these different things and different expectations and trading some time for another.

524
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,072
So like I think at one point, Anongo, who is one of the principals at the studio as

525
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:48,435
well, Anongo had looked at my calendar when Mitu and I were going through Tech Stars because

526
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:49,175
we did it remote.

527
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:51,769
And Gavin was full-time school from home,

528
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:52,930
because again, we're still early in the pandemic,

529
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,151
and everybody's like, well, just a few more weeks.

530
00:31:54,171 --> 00:31:55,032
Like, it's not gonna be that bad.

531
00:31:55,052 --> 00:31:56,513
Two weeks to flatten the curve.

532
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:57,533
Two weeks to flatten the curve.

533
00:31:57,553 --> 00:31:58,654
And then I was like, oh, just six more weeks.

534
00:31:58,694 --> 00:31:58,954
Okay, no.

535
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:01,516
So we were still in that like semi-optimistic era

536
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,657
that this was gonna end at some point.

537
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:05,599
And at one point, Anongo looked at my calendar

538
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:07,881
and she was like, that's not humanly possible.

539
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:09,342
Like, she was like, it's just all conflicts.

540
00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:12,244
It's just all just different blocks of people's conflicts.

541
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:14,245
And I was like, yeah, that's how my life feels right now.

542
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,507
So it was, yeah, it's definitely a challenge

543
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:18,648
because there isn't that division.

544
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:21,410
And you know that Jen was talking about earlier,

545
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,312
there's not that division between like,

546
00:32:23,372 --> 00:32:24,513
okay, here is when I am working

547
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:25,394
and here is when I'm at home.

548
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:27,175
Everything is kind of crashing together all the time

549
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,957
and you're just trying to carve out a buffer for deep work.

550
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:31,679
I feel like as a writer,

551
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,741
I haven't had headspace in two years

552
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:35,762
to be able to like deeply sit down

553
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:38,284
and do anything without something pulling at my attention.

554
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:41,387
But on the flip side, I also don't have a commute anymore.

555
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,389
We're not at risk in the same way

556
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:45,070
of like going out into the world every single day.

557
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:47,012
So, you know, there's...

558
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:49,100
Plus sides and downsides.

559
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:52,102
I know when my son went back to school after COVID,

560
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:53,943
I found in some ways I kind of missed it

561
00:32:53,963 --> 00:32:55,665
because at least I knew like where he was

562
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:56,425
and that he was safe.

563
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:58,627
And then like the post COVID world is very, very different

564
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,748
than I think the environment that we started in.

565
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,290
And so really negotiating that has been

566
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,492
almost more stressful than keeping him at home with me,

567
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:07,153
even though there were definitely rough days.

568
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:11,914
Definitely trade-offs. I like that you mentioned the idea of competing conflicts all the time.

569
00:33:11,954 --> 00:33:12,454
Oh yeah, oh god.

570
00:33:12,474 --> 00:33:16,636
Because I feel like as a parent there is no concept of free time left.

571
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:22,520
There's just choosing which thing you aren't going to do in what order

572
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,622
and trying to decide what goes to the bottom of your Moscow list and what goes to the top

573
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:32,465
and just balancing all of the needs and conflicts.

574
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:35,206
There have been quite a few times my husband has found me passed out

575
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:37,548
and I have the laptop open on the bed somewhere.

576
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:39,898
where I was like, I can just do this one more.

577
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:41,959
That's so exciting.

578
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,280
Charlene, how about for you?

579
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,902
For me, I would say definitely has been more challenging

580
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:54,043
than having kids outside.

581
00:33:54,063 --> 00:33:55,784
Like, I love working from home,

582
00:33:55,924 --> 00:33:59,065
but it's way easier to have them in daycare,

583
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,106
especially in the afternoon.

584
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:03,107
Like, you need a time to focus on.

585
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:06,548
And so when you have two young kids screaming behind you,

586
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:10,811
During some meetings, that's definitely challenging.

587
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:13,333
But some things that I really enjoyed,

588
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:19,018
even though 2020 was an apocalyptic year for me,

589
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:23,081
was that it definitely made breastfeeding easier,

590
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:26,724
because being in the same room as my younger one

591
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:27,945
was definitely easier.

592
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:33,169
But I hope this won't happen too often.

593
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,090
Hopefully.

594
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,852
I hope this is the last year like that.

595
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:39,656
So say we all. Georgina?

596
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:43,720
Mine's a little bit different because my kids are older, so at 9 and 12,

597
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,564
they're obviously much more self-sufficient.

598
00:34:46,644 --> 00:34:52,110
So the first year, you know, we're all transitioning and it's COVID and they stayed at home for five months,

599
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,692
homeschooling, challenging.

600
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,575
But I would say overall, there's just been a net benefit.

601
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:02,099
I live over an hour's commute, hour and 15 minute commute from the office.

602
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,442
And so that means working from home, I get 12 hours back in a week,

603
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,263
which is an incredible amount of time.

604
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:10,965
It means I'm having dinner with my family every night.

605
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:13,287
And I've always worked outside of the home,

606
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:15,489
so this has been a very different experience for me.

607
00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:17,511
And with my children the age they are,

608
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:21,994
it's been fantastic to be together a lot more.

609
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:23,475
And, yeah, and so...

610
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:27,591
At this age, I would say there are a lot more pros than cons.

611
00:35:28,272 --> 00:35:29,433
I like that you mentioned the commute.

612
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:34,336
I think that your relationship to your commute as a parent really changes depending on how

613
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:35,017
long it is.

614
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:40,680
For you, an hour commute is a huge amount of time lost from seeing your family and getting

615
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,361
out to dinner with them.

616
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,843
I'm really fortunate to have a 15-minute commute.

617
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:50,287
And I love my commute. It's the greatest 30 minutes of my day. It's silent. There's no one.

618
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:56,032
I just get to sit alone in a bubble. And sometimes I have a cup of coffee. No one can talk to me.

619
00:35:56,052 --> 00:36:02,957
I can't get a Slack notification. There's no... It's just this absolute peace for 15 minutes.

620
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:06,260
And I never appreciated that pre-pandemic commutes were like...

621
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,824
I'm rushing to drop off at daycare, and then school, and then this, and then that.

622
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:14,650
And it wasn't until I had worked from home and returned to commuting that I began to

623
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,355
appreciate those 15 minutes a day for what they were.

624
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:24,161
We mentioned a little bit earlier this idea of juggling multiple priorities, and I'm sure

625
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,564
lots of folks have heard this joke that comes across.

626
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:27,504
Joke.

627
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:30,585
That, you know, if you want something done, give it to a mother.

628
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:36,386
There's this idea that we have this, we have a superhuman ability to juggle priorities

629
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:40,367
that other people don't, and mothers will figure it out if you give it to them to solve.

630
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:45,609
And I think there's some truth in that and maybe some not, so I'm curious, Jenny, do

631
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:50,110
you feel like becoming a parent has made you better at your job in any ways?

632
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:55,030
I think so. I think there's a lot of things that change when you become a parent.

633
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,694
And for me, one of them was just setting a lot stronger boundaries around my work

634
00:36:59,074 --> 00:37:03,119
and saying, I am going, I have to get off work and go pick up my kid.

635
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,624
I have, like, I, for me, one of my strong boundaries is I do family dinner, I do bedtime.

636
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:10,828
And if someone schedules a meeting during that time, I'm like, nope.

637
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:14,590
And it's taken some training to make sure that doesn't happen,

638
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,031
especially because I work a lot with the US and they're awake and working.

639
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:21,092
But getting to that point where you're like, no, I've got that boundary.

640
00:37:21,632 --> 00:37:23,233
I prioritize ruthlessly.

641
00:37:23,693 --> 00:37:25,073
And I think this goes for all parents.

642
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:29,255
Like we've all had to learn this new job very quickly and it changes every day.

643
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:31,416
And just when you think you figured it out,

644
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:33,596
your kid grows up a little bit older and learns a new skill.

645
00:37:33,636 --> 00:37:35,257
And you're like, oh, how do I deal with this?

646
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:39,220
And just that whole confidence that I can figure things out and I've got it.

647
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:45,546
But I will say I'm in a lead role in engineering and so my job is pastoral, I look after people,

648
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:50,210
I grow their careers, I solve lots of crazy crisis problems every day and I have a lot

649
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:54,534
of flexibility and do a lot of meetings. Back in previously in my career when I was

650
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:58,598
writing code all day I would struggle with the current boundaries I have.

651
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:04,304
Because I can just see myself getting to 4.45 PM and I'm deep in the middle of some crazy bug,

652
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,847
and I'm looking at the clock and I've got to go pick up my kids.

653
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:10,351
And I know I haven't personally had to deal with that because I

654
00:38:10,932 --> 00:38:13,795
chose to have kids when I was a little more further in my career, but I can see that that

655
00:38:13,815 --> 00:38:17,319
would have been very difficult for me at that point in my career, and so figuring out how do you...

656
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:21,601
make that trade-off and how do you set those boundaries and keep them is hard.

657
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:26,963
But I have this advantage that as a leader I can set them, I can talk about them, I can openly

658
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:30,384
stick to them and hopefully it will help those folks who are a little further,

659
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:35,526
a little earlier in their careers also keep the same boundaries. So hopefully modeling it helps.

660
00:38:36,587 --> 00:38:42,549
When you mentioned dealing with crises, I think of both the best and worst parenting advice that

661
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:46,871
I have ever received was somebody telling me that it won't get better.

662
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:49,917
but it will get different.

663
00:38:50,738 --> 00:38:53,902
And at the time, I was deeply depressed

664
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:54,783
when they told me that.

665
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:57,467
And over time, I've actually become to take that

666
00:38:57,527 --> 00:39:00,070
as an extremely positive mantra that like,

667
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:04,255
in this moment, it may feel awful and endless,

668
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:05,777
and it will change.

669
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:08,318
It might be a different awful and endless,

670
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:11,219
but it will change and it will be a new problem to deal with

671
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:13,920
and I can just keep putting one foot in front of the other

672
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,301
and we will eventually come through that.

673
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:19,382
Again, Georgina tells us that it gets better, we hear.

674
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:21,143
We're very excited for this.

675
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:24,505
And I think that we've talked about

676
00:39:24,525 --> 00:39:27,046
a couple different specific companies

677
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:29,207
that have had good policies or bad policies,

678
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,448
but even if you happen to find a company

679
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:33,849
that really treats maternity and paternity leave

680
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:35,890
as a regular part of that employee life cycle

681
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,030
and...

682
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:38,026
You're fortunate enough to get to work in that space.

683
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:42,247
The games industry as a whole tends to have a lot of turnover and a lot of movement and

684
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:46,089
a lot of going from one studio and one project to the next, to the next, to the next.

685
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,050
And so you might not get to stay with that group of people for the long term.

686
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:55,991
And I think that we don't necessarily think about the domino downstream effects that that

687
00:39:56,011 --> 00:40:00,052
can have on mothers to need to be able to move between products.

688
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:02,778
projects and studios on a regular basis.

689
00:40:03,218 --> 00:40:07,163
And Charlene, I was hoping you might talk to some of those challenges that you saw for

690
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:09,966
you in that cycle of having kids.

691
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:15,009
If you ask me, I would have had kids sooner.

692
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:23,274
I feel like you don't have the same energy, the same health at 35 than at 25.

693
00:40:24,295 --> 00:40:27,717
And when I was 25, I was ready to have kids.

694
00:40:28,437 --> 00:40:30,398
I wish I had them at that time, but I was...

695
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:38,435
I was so scared about the stigma, you know, to have the plan to have kids in my company

696
00:40:38,495 --> 00:40:42,839
because especially at the very beginning of your career, like on an average, you're going

697
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:44,360
to stay two, three years.

698
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,643
And so after one year of experience in a company, you're like, oh.

699
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,825
But if I have to tell my boss that I'm pregnant,

700
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:56,327
sure, they probably won't fire me because there are

701
00:40:56,347 --> 00:41:00,169
laws about that, but there's still going to be stigma

702
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:03,730
and it's going to have an impact on my career and stuff like that.

703
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:12,177
I really wish we were able to have kids when we feel ready, rather than when we feel our

704
00:41:12,257 --> 00:41:13,277
company is ready.

705
00:41:14,317 --> 00:41:20,399
The point of view of your employer shouldn't have an impact on your desire to have kids

706
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:20,919
or not.

707
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:30,662
I wish companies were more able to help mother and future parents, actually, even for men

708
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:31,302
in that way.

709
00:41:33,543 --> 00:41:37,029
Also, something that I feel like is not totally fair,

710
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:39,252
and might be part of the reason why women

711
00:41:39,312 --> 00:41:41,034
are still less paid than men,

712
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:44,099
is that a lot of benefits are based

713
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,641
on the time you spend at work.

714
00:41:47,944 --> 00:41:52,345
Profit sharings and career revolutions, that kind of stuff.

715
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:55,946
The reason why you have less,

716
00:41:56,506 --> 00:42:00,927
you have like for higher management, you have less women.

717
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:04,008
I don't think it's, I want to believe it's not

718
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:08,549
because companies are thinking, oh, she's a woman,

719
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:13,150
so she's not gonna have, she's not gonna be a lead

720
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,310
or a director or stuff like that.

721
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,211
I don't think it is because of that.

722
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:17,671
I feel.

723
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:20,732
I think it's more because when you take a maternity leave,

724
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:24,433
then all these benefits are slowed down, unfortunately.

725
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:30,695
And I wish we would rethink that way.

726
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:33,636
Like, we would rethink things about that,

727
00:42:33,696 --> 00:42:38,677
like career improvement benefits, all this stuff.

728
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:43,139
Maybe it is outdated to think that it should be linked

729
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:45,780
about the time you spend at work.

730
00:42:46,368 --> 00:42:51,752
Yeah, that caregiving tax that Latoya referred to, you know, it applies not just to maybe

731
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:57,817
how your salary grows, how your vacation accrues, how bonuses or profit sharing pay out, but

732
00:42:57,857 --> 00:43:03,041
it also affects the type of work that you got to do on a project.

733
00:43:03,202 --> 00:43:07,105
If you weren't there during SHIP, you might not get credited on the project, depending

734
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,966
on your company's credit policies.

735
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:14,010
You might not also just get the experience of having gone through a SHIP.

736
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,471
that you can then take to your next project.

737
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:20,033
So you may be seen as not as capable

738
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,834
because you've missed certain parts of a project

739
00:43:22,914 --> 00:43:25,676
and that can affect your career growth opportunities,

740
00:43:25,796 --> 00:43:30,638
promotion opportunities, and there's this downstream fall-on

741
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:33,919
from choosing to take time off to have kids.

742
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:37,221
And I think that that's one of the things that is hardest to solve

743
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:40,822
because it is the most invisible pieces of the problem.

744
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:46,660
And so, Latoya, one of the reasons that I was so excited to have you come on this panel

745
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,064
is that you are a founder at a company, which is a unique space to take in the world.

746
00:43:52,345 --> 00:43:56,808
And from your intro, we heard that you talked about taking that a very short leave with

747
00:43:56,828 --> 00:43:57,209
your second.

748
00:43:57,229 --> 00:43:58,390
That resonates a ton with me.

749
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,572
I did the exact same thing with my second child.

750
00:44:01,092 --> 00:44:02,173
We were a startup.

751
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:06,496
It was limited dollars in the bank account, limited amount of time available to us.

752
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:08,098
So I made the same choice you did.

753
00:44:08,138 --> 00:44:09,439
It resonates a ton with me.

754
00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:11,401
But you and I have both discussed that's not.

755
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:16,407
We're really conscious that that's not the example that we want to set for the teammates

756
00:44:16,428 --> 00:44:18,208
who work with us and the women who come after us.

757
00:44:18,248 --> 00:44:25,871
And I wonder how you think about balancing that need to bulldoze a path ahead for people

758
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:31,773
while teaching them and setting healthy precedents for them to walk the path that didn't necessarily

759
00:44:32,654 --> 00:44:34,114
use the same patterns that we did.

760
00:44:34,614 --> 00:44:35,335
Yeah, absolutely.

761
00:44:35,435 --> 00:44:39,316
I mean, one of the hardest parts, so, you know, Matu and I co-founded the first all-women-of-color

762
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:39,916
game studio.

763
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:41,805
So, I think that's a huge accomplishment.

764
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:44,886
There's a lot that comes with that, including not getting the level of funding that, say,

765
00:44:44,946 --> 00:44:50,007
white founders who are in similar, quite frankly, sometimes worse positions with less chops

766
00:44:50,027 --> 00:44:54,548
than we had, not being able to have that type of financial buffer that allows you to give

767
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:56,568
generous leave, generous packages, generous comp.

768
00:44:57,348 --> 00:45:01,089
And in the interest of also just being transparent about the things that happen, at the beginning,

769
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:05,050
at the founding of the company, I also had a miscarriage on the way to a funders meeting.

770
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,971
And it was so bad that Mitsu actually came to the hospital with me, bringing clothes

771
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:09,591
and stuff like that.

772
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:10,211
And we had to.

773
00:45:10,683 --> 00:45:28,383
And so we're going to have to dust off and pick up and keep going the next day. So we've really sacrificed a lot to make glow up what it is. And one of the things that we're always conscious of is that we are pushing ourselves to the limits as founders, because we know like there's no one ahead of us that we have to blaze this trail and keep this thing that we built going and keep it alive.

774
00:45:28,423 --> 00:45:31,506
And so, when I said I made an informed choice to cut my

775
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:33,963
Maternity short, I knew what was going to happen.

776
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:36,406
I knew that maybe my milk supply wouldn't come in in the same way.

777
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:39,689
I knew that, you know, I was going to be cutting time with, you know, the newborn.

778
00:45:39,729 --> 00:45:40,751
I knew these things were going to happen.

779
00:45:40,811 --> 00:45:41,552
I also knew that.

780
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:44,195
We had come so far and we were at this crucial point

781
00:45:44,215 --> 00:45:46,156
we needed to ship and we just had to figure this out.

782
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:50,138
But you don't want to show that to your younger employees

783
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:52,419
or to folks coming up because you don't want them to think

784
00:45:52,439 --> 00:45:54,400
that that's what it's gonna take or that it's normal.

785
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,761
And it's been really difficult,

786
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:58,782
particularly because the values that we wanna live

787
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,223
and the experiences that we have

788
00:46:00,283 --> 00:46:01,864
or that we want to give people more.

789
00:46:02,584 --> 00:46:04,605
And then financially, you can't always.

790
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:06,246
So like one of the big things that we do at the company

791
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,126
is mental health days.

792
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,367
Like we can gift you some time.

793
00:46:09,093 --> 00:46:13,095
And especially when things get very heavy in the world, sometimes we'll just be like,

794
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:17,377
OK, we're going to shut down the studio two weeks from now for a day so we can all just

795
00:46:17,397 --> 00:46:18,237
kind of recover.

796
00:46:18,557 --> 00:46:22,479
And that's a thing that we can do that doesn't take huge financial resources.

797
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:26,320
But we're also trying to always be cognizant of it, like just the fact that, you know,

798
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,521
as founders, Mitu and I are on 24-7.

799
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:36,900
Just doing stuff like I'm rolling meetings and changing diapers and running down the street and trying to make all of this stuff work because we're in the middle of so many things.

800
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:44,689
But, you know, we have a pregnant employee right now and, you know, we're struggling because, again, there's not that structural support in the United States.

801
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,002
for just about anything, anything at all.

802
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:50,665
But particularly for parents in the workforce

803
00:46:50,685 --> 00:46:53,067
where it's like, oh, well, this employee is a contractor

804
00:46:53,407 --> 00:46:55,129
because we couldn't make her W-2.

805
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:58,211
Is she even eligible for short-term disability insurance?

806
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:00,353
Are we going to tell her that, okay,

807
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:01,594
we will give you the four months off,

808
00:47:01,614 --> 00:47:02,795
but it has to be unpaid

809
00:47:02,855 --> 00:47:05,298
because we don't know if we have these funds?

810
00:47:05,418 --> 00:47:07,199
Is it, how can we help you?

811
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,201
And there are certain things that, you know,

812
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:10,322
we just can't even do

813
00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:11,823
because of the structure of the system.

814
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:13,041
that we're working in.

815
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:15,442
So I think it's a mandate on our side

816
00:47:15,462 --> 00:47:17,123
to make sure that we are,

817
00:47:18,204 --> 00:47:20,465
as much as we need to push and innovate in the game space

818
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:21,765
and do things we wanna do,

819
00:47:21,945 --> 00:47:24,286
also being there to innovate on the side of,

820
00:47:24,346 --> 00:47:25,567
these are the things that need to change

821
00:47:25,627 --> 00:47:27,428
because we want to show that we can have

822
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,929
a healthy environment for people who wanna have families

823
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:31,150
and that we have a healthy environment

824
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,451
for all of our employees overall.

825
00:47:33,571 --> 00:47:35,712
But it's a difficult balancing act

826
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,733
and there's sometimes we do have to kind of explicitly be

827
00:47:37,753 --> 00:47:39,453
like, okay, do as I say and not as I do.

828
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:40,994
We're gonna send you home.

829
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,898
We're gonna keep working.

830
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:44,379
We don't want you to do that

831
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:45,800
because we already paid this price for you.

832
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,501
I think a lot of parenting is also do what I say,

833
00:47:48,541 --> 00:47:49,201
not what I do.

834
00:47:49,902 --> 00:47:52,143
Especially when it comes to snacks after bedtime.

835
00:47:52,243 --> 00:47:52,683
It was serious.

836
00:47:54,384 --> 00:47:57,666
In, you know, in just in putting together this panel

837
00:47:57,786 --> 00:48:00,768
and finding folks to come talk about the issue,

838
00:48:01,288 --> 00:48:02,449
it really highlighted the reason

839
00:48:02,509 --> 00:48:03,609
we were talking about the issue.

840
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,711
It was very challenging for me to find women

841
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:08,012
that I knew who worked in games

842
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,413
who didn't work at my company.

843
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:14,571
You know, Georgina and Latoya were both introduced to me by somebody else.

844
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:20,454
Jenny and I connected through a Discord channel for moms who work in the gaming industry,

845
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:23,375
and it was completely random.

846
00:48:23,475 --> 00:48:26,337
We never met until yesterday.

847
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,998
We just, through Discord, decided she was going to fly here to do this.

848
00:48:30,279 --> 00:48:35,161
And then as moms organizing to come here in person, making sure that there was childcare

849
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:38,562
and groceries and the kids were going to be fed for and the caregiving was in place, was

850
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:39,543
a whole set of.

851
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:44,061
Travel prep that, you know, a lot of our coworkers didn't have to do to be able to come here.

852
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,902
And still checking up on our families when we get home.

853
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:51,503
You know, every part of preparing for this was a reminder of why this was happening.

854
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:59,186
And I think it can often feel very lonely to be that first in the situation going through

855
00:48:59,206 --> 00:49:02,327
a process or to be in a minority on your team.

856
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:07,449
And it feels like it's a lot harder to advocate for your needs when you're the only one who

857
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:09,070
has those needs at that given time.

858
00:49:09,737 --> 00:49:13,619
And so Georgina, our last question and then we'll move to Q&A after that.

859
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:17,440
You know, you're a woman programmer, you're a person of color, you're a mom.

860
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,282
You have lived this life of being a minority and in so many different ways.

861
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:23,883
You're 20 years into your career now.

862
00:49:24,363 --> 00:49:27,445
I wonder when you look back what you would tell your younger self

863
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:29,506
about about the journey that you've gone on.

864
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:35,789
I started my first job as a programmer was at Electronic Arts Canada.

865
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:40,252
There were two female programmers, I was one of it, out of hundreds of men.

866
00:49:40,512 --> 00:49:47,276
So, I was often the only woman in a room, I'm very used to that.

867
00:49:47,814 --> 00:49:53,557
So that certainly shaped me in my career and just being used to being, okay, I'm in the

868
00:49:53,617 --> 00:50:00,321
minority, I don't have examples that are exactly like me, and you know, you just pull up your

869
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:02,122
boots and you keep going and you work hard.

870
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:05,864
You don't often want to call attention to yourself.

871
00:50:05,924 --> 00:50:09,527
I think early on in my career as a programmer, I really was conscious of the fact that

872
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:14,409
I never wanted anyone to think that I was hired as a programmer because I was female.

873
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:20,572
And, you know, everybody wants to hire a female programmer because you want to have some diversity in your group.

874
00:50:20,593 --> 00:50:25,595
But I never wanted to be that token. I wanted people to recognize I was there because I was just as good.

875
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:29,858
And I was just as good and I worked just as hard, if not more, to be there.

876
00:50:30,598 --> 00:50:33,960
So certainly that carried over, you know, as a mom.

877
00:50:35,221 --> 00:50:39,343
At Radical, I wasn't, I probably wasn't the first to take maternity leave,

878
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:40,664
but I was one of the first.

879
00:50:41,925 --> 00:50:44,907
There weren't a lot of women that took mat leave.

880
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:47,889
When I was in the VFX company, it was a startup.

881
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:52,632
I was the first, I was the only one who took mat leave from that company.

882
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:55,113
They crafted a mat leave policy for me.

883
00:50:56,454 --> 00:50:59,916
And I think when you're in that position, you know, I had that feeling of like,

884
00:51:00,156 --> 00:51:01,236
I didn't want to be entitled.

885
00:51:01,256 --> 00:51:05,679
I didn't want to ask for things, you know, that my colleagues didn't have,

886
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:08,100
the other programmers or managers around me.

887
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,121
They didn't ask for flexible working time.

888
00:51:11,221 --> 00:51:13,483
They didn't ask for these things.

889
00:51:13,563 --> 00:51:17,465
And I didn't feel like that I should ask for those things.

890
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:20,922
Because that would have only benefited me.

891
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:25,623
So now, 20 years into my career, I've kind of got some perspective.

892
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,605
What I want to say, you know, companies and games,

893
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:34,006
they want to retain every single woman who is listening to this talk today.

894
00:51:34,086 --> 00:51:35,887
So if you're out there and you're thinking about it.

895
00:51:36,604 --> 00:51:38,005
Your company wants to retain you.

896
00:51:38,085 --> 00:51:41,547
They may not have policies that seem friendly.

897
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:42,788
You may be thinking about leaving,

898
00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:44,789
but it's in the company's best interest

899
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:46,511
for you to stay and grow your career.

900
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,613
And so, you know, if there is something

901
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:52,155
that would make your life easier,

902
00:51:52,215 --> 00:51:54,296
that would make it possible for you to stay,

903
00:51:54,776 --> 00:51:58,199
that is a consideration that you should make

904
00:51:58,279 --> 00:51:59,400
and talk to your manager.

905
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:01,561
Sometimes it's difficult.

906
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:03,102
Your manager may not be receptive,

907
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:04,383
may not be someone that you can talk to.

908
00:52:05,015 --> 00:52:08,117
And so my suggestion would be to find an ally in the company,

909
00:52:08,578 --> 00:52:12,000
whether that's a senior person, a person that you feel could relate to you,

910
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,443
whether that's a person on your team, on another team, another manager,

911
00:52:15,483 --> 00:52:18,986
someone in HR, or whether it's a man or a woman, someone who can be an ally.

912
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:22,729
Because it's often easier to ask for something for somebody else.

913
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:25,311
I have a hard time asking for things, special things for myself,

914
00:52:25,691 --> 00:52:29,915
but no problem going, hey, so-and-so, you know, this is their situation.

915
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:33,017
And I think we should consider this.

916
00:52:33,973 --> 00:52:35,060
you know, set up for them.

917
00:52:36,757 --> 00:53:04,139
Yeah, absolutely. And I think that if you have a, if you are in a position in a company where you have the ability to radiate these things, you know, making sure that it's really easy for people to find out what your benefits plans are and what your maternity coverage is and the information about where you can breastfeed is publicly available, that women don't have to go search for it. They may be early in their pregnancy and not ready to talk about that, but they can still find the information on your internal confluence or whatever.

918
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:07,841
That lets them plan and understand what's going on.

919
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:11,363
Don't force people to come to you for that information.

920
00:53:11,804 --> 00:53:12,904
Radiate it outwards.

921
00:53:13,264 --> 00:53:16,046
Make it normal to talk about those things to the whole team

922
00:53:16,086 --> 00:53:18,428
because you never know who will eventually need

923
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:19,368
that information.

924
00:53:19,748 --> 00:53:21,549
And so just having it be publicly available

925
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:24,331
at all times can be really helpful for those

926
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:26,352
who are still learning how to advocate

927
00:53:26,392 --> 00:53:27,813
for their own needs, I think.

928
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:31,410
So we've got about five or 10 minutes left, I think.

929
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:33,252
And if anyone wanted to ask any questions,

930
00:53:33,272 --> 00:53:34,854
we're happy to answer them.

931
00:53:35,014 --> 00:53:39,199
And I think we're going to go to the wrap-up area after.

932
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,402
If you wanted to talk to us more,

933
00:53:41,482 --> 00:53:43,965
we'll go to the wrap-up area on the third floor.

934
00:53:46,087 --> 00:53:46,408
Gaze up.

935
00:53:46,428 --> 00:53:46,908
I'm going to grab them.

936
00:53:47,596 --> 00:53:48,958
I'm a little short, so.

937
00:53:48,978 --> 00:53:51,259
Hi, my name is Desiree.

938
00:53:51,279 --> 00:53:52,621
Thank you all so much for being here.

939
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:57,044
Latoya, I just wanted to say I brought a seventh month old to my first UDC five years ago,

940
00:53:57,144 --> 00:53:59,967
and I was constantly running back and forth to nurse, so I see you.

941
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:05,512
Me, too, was actually my academic advisor at NYU when I had my second baby,

942
00:54:05,712 --> 00:54:13,058
and I was like waddling into her office to discuss how I was going to handle my schedule when I came back from having the baby.

943
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:14,039
Anyway.

944
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:21,129
Something that I've noticed in the conversation about remote work is that before the pandemic,

945
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:28,413
I could not get positions anywhere because they wanted me to move to Barcelona, to Boulder, to

946
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:34,937
wherever it was, Seattle, California. And it kind of broke my heart to see the people who

947
00:54:34,957 --> 00:54:42,382
were accepting these roles were often single, young, white men who could afford to uproot their

948
00:54:42,442 --> 00:54:42,842
lives.

949
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:57,165
And they didn't have, you know, children that they were going to have to haul out of school or anything else. And I think that kind of gets lost in the conversation about remote when you have all these studios complaining that they're having a hard time finding people for mid-level or senior roles.

950
00:54:57,643 --> 00:55:01,864
But they're only willing to consider people who are local or people who can move, who,

951
00:55:01,904 --> 00:55:06,506
let's face it, are often either single or men who have wives who are willing to move

952
00:55:06,526 --> 00:55:06,906
with them.

953
00:55:07,446 --> 00:55:13,808
So I guess my question is, after saying all of that, moving forward now that we've seen

954
00:55:13,848 --> 00:55:20,371
that it's possible to ship titles with hybrid and remote work, how can we sort of advocate

955
00:55:20,811 --> 00:55:24,852
for more flexibility that will enable women to not only

956
00:55:25,512 --> 00:55:27,513
And so, I think it's important for women to enter the game

957
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,454
industry and stay in the game industry after they have kids

958
00:55:29,474 --> 00:55:30,294
to thrive.

959
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:31,455
And, yeah.

960
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,936
Yeah, I think to your question of like how can we advocate for

961
00:55:35,976 --> 00:55:39,378
the ability for folks to work remotely in this post-pandemic

962
00:55:39,438 --> 00:55:42,199
world, since that does often benefit women more,

963
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:46,140
one of the ways we do it is by talking about it like this.

964
00:55:47,121 --> 00:55:49,501
And by bringing it into our hiring conversations,

965
00:55:49,762 --> 00:55:50,442
our HR folks, and really.

966
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:58,516
Consistently bringing the topic up and discussing.

967
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,277
It's not, I don't want to work remote because I hate pants.

968
00:56:03,057 --> 00:56:06,498
I want to work remote so that I have the ability

969
00:56:06,518 --> 00:56:08,438
for my child to stay in the same school system.

970
00:56:08,778 --> 00:56:10,918
So that I can pick my kid up from daycare

971
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:12,999
because I live really far from the studio.

972
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:18,740
And really going into the reasons why that benefits people,

973
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,040
the types of people it benefits, to your point,

974
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,181
the groups of people who are maybe looking

975
00:56:23,201 --> 00:56:24,021
for that more than others.

976
00:56:24,723 --> 00:56:30,447
And just continuing to just advocate for it and shine that light on the problem set, I think.

977
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,111
Very cute, by the way.

978
00:56:38,652 --> 00:56:40,433
So I have four boys.

979
00:56:41,974 --> 00:56:45,537
And right now I'm basically the stay-at-home, work-at-home parent.

980
00:56:45,937 --> 00:56:49,439
My wife has a 50, 60-hour-a-week job that she works.

981
00:56:51,055 --> 00:57:01,326
So I cook, clean, play, my oldest is homeschooled, he's 13, and in the games industry it's very

982
00:57:01,386 --> 00:57:08,313
competitive to get into it with everybody who, you know, is also very talented as well.

983
00:57:09,073 --> 00:57:14,278
There becomes a problem where if I don't have enough time to compete with somebody who has

984
00:57:14,479 --> 00:57:15,860
all the time in social life.

985
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:23,261
It isn't trying to type while playing tug of war with something in your teeth with the baby at the same time.

986
00:57:25,423 --> 00:57:33,688
The only thing that I've been able to come up with to sort of let people know that I've basically decided to start life on hard mode

987
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:39,352
is just put in my LinkedIn, I've been a dad for 13 years. I struggle with that.

988
00:57:39,752 --> 00:57:46,076
What else can you do to sort of portray that this is something that you also have to contend with to sort of give yourself?

989
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:51,771
that a boost, like perhaps I don't have enough time to have a massive body of work, but I

990
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:53,472
work just as hard, essentially.

991
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:57,936
Yeah, so just to repeat the question in case folks didn't hear it, the idea is like, how

992
00:57:57,996 --> 00:58:05,221
can we as parents make ourselves appealing to hiring managers and in the interview process

993
00:58:05,301 --> 00:58:10,245
when we may not have the same amount of disposable time to spend on building a portfolio of work?

994
00:58:12,525 --> 00:58:13,286
No, all good.

995
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:17,450
I have a slightly privilege laden answer there.

996
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:22,076
In engineering, you know, if I were to change jobs and try and do coding

997
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:25,660
properly, I'd have to spend months preparing algorithm questions.

998
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,122
And it's the same kind of work as I get my portfolio together.

999
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:31,306
It's a full-time job to prepare for a software engineering job these days.

1000
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:35,648
And so for me, I would do the acid test of like, during the interview process, be like,

1001
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:38,909
hey, I'm a mom. I don't have time for that. Do you have a different interview process?

1002
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:42,990
Have you caught on? It's 2022. And if they say no, I'm like, well, you're probably not going

1003
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:47,231
to support me very well as a parent if I do come and work for you. Now, I do think that answer is

1004
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:50,752
a lot of privilege because I'm a bit more senior and I'm engineering where a lot of people are

1005
00:58:50,772 --> 00:58:55,093
starting to change that conversation. But the more that we can, within our companies and have

1006
00:58:55,134 --> 00:58:58,995
the parents within those companies advocate for changing the hiring process to be inclusive.

1007
00:58:59,315 --> 00:59:03,079
To have alternate paths for those that might not have a bunch of time and to recognize all

1008
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,202
the different things that those people can bring to the table, I think we can change,

1009
00:59:06,262 --> 00:59:10,426
but it's not an overnight thing. So those of us in the room that have that privilege are inside

1010
00:59:10,466 --> 00:59:14,990
companies and can change the processes. Let's start doing that and making things, we change

1011
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,553
it for mothers, we change it for fathers, we change it for everybody.

1012
00:59:18,928 --> 00:59:32,909
I just want to add quickly, like, you know, just definitely my husband was lead parent for three years. So understand like how that can be very tough trying to reintegrate or to go back to the workforce and one of the things that I think works best is that networking and proactively kind of trying to reach out.

1013
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:35,850
Because you're not going to be able to spend the hours in the portfolio that you used to.

1014
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:39,171
You're not going to be able to spend the hours of building new work and doing all the stuff that you need.

1015
00:59:39,191 --> 00:59:39,851
You want to tell me about it?

1016
00:59:40,951 --> 00:59:50,353
But one of the things that you can do is definitely figuring out if there are other folks, particularly like prominent folks who talk about having their families in the media, connecting with them, talking to them.

1017
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:56,674
Because they'll normally also know like, oh, here might be a path to a company that is more flexible and is looking for somebody with your skills.

1018
00:59:57,054 --> 01:00:01,055
And that's easier than us trying to like just do it in isolation, because you can't compete in the same way anymore.

1019
01:00:01,095 --> 01:00:03,135
And if you try to do that, you will just drive yourself insane.

1020
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:04,599
Yeah, well, I'm there.

1021
01:00:05,479 --> 01:00:06,600
But best of luck.

1022
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,982
First and foremost, LaToya, I want to snuggle that baby.

1023
01:00:11,423 --> 01:00:14,865
I got to snuggle him last night. He's very snugglable.

1024
01:00:15,185 --> 01:00:19,828
One of the things that we touched briefly on, LaToya touched briefly on, was mental health days.

1025
01:00:19,928 --> 01:00:25,172
And one of the things that we haven't touched on is the fact that mental health changes dramatically for mothers.

1026
01:00:27,233 --> 01:00:32,416
What I'd like to hear is how would you guys recommend us, especially me, I'm brand new to the industry.

1027
01:00:32,476 --> 01:00:36,078
I just changed a 10 year career over to my dream career, right?

1028
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:38,280
Just landed my dream job on a triple A title.

1029
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:39,620
I'm super excited.

1030
01:00:39,941 --> 01:00:44,363
How do we advocate for ourselves when we have mental health days or we need mental health days?

1031
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:46,264
Because postpartum depression is a real thing.

1032
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,366
Even mental health, especially for our fathers.

1033
01:00:49,426 --> 01:00:52,848
I want our fathers to feel very heard because I've seen so many struggle.

1034
01:00:52,888 --> 01:00:54,289
Like we struggle as parents.

1035
01:00:54,818 --> 01:01:00,702
How do we advocate for ourselves as parents to say, I need a break, I'm having a really

1036
01:01:00,722 --> 01:01:02,063
hard day, that kind of stuff?

1037
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:10,570
So for me, I think the only way to do that is to continue to do it.

1038
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:16,134
And I know that sounds like an extremely simplistic and naive answer, but I do believe that in

1039
01:01:16,294 --> 01:01:18,396
so much of advocacy work, it is the...

1040
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:24,956
persistence of conversation and the willingness to say it over and over and build a

1041
01:01:25,677 --> 01:01:30,162
coalition of people who are saying it and bring the attention to an issue. It is

1042
01:01:30,623 --> 01:01:34,888
challenging for companies to hear one person's

1043
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:39,292
challenge sometimes and it is also difficult for them to

1044
01:01:40,304 --> 01:01:44,389
to put the corporate responsibility towards solving a problem for one person,

1045
01:01:44,649 --> 01:01:48,133
whereas it is a lot easier for them to do it towards solving for a group of people.

1046
01:01:48,554 --> 01:01:53,900
And so if it is a topic that comes up regularly, if it is a group of people who bring a topic regularly,

1047
01:01:55,062 --> 01:01:57,323
In the fiscal responsibility of a business,

1048
01:01:57,444 --> 01:01:59,605
it becomes a lot easier to then put resources

1049
01:01:59,645 --> 01:02:01,287
towards it and respond to it.

1050
01:02:01,867 --> 01:02:03,909
And so I think that sometimes in these issues,

1051
01:02:03,949 --> 01:02:06,851
it is just the simple persistence of continuing

1052
01:02:07,231 --> 01:02:09,593
to have those conversations, to bring them to the light.

1053
01:02:09,633 --> 01:02:11,154
And then for those who are listening today,

1054
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,757
who are part of companies, to hear your voice saying that,

1055
01:02:14,117 --> 01:02:15,258
and take it back to their companies.

1056
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:17,519
And like, I keep hearing people mention this,

1057
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,561
maybe it's something that we should look into.

1058
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:20,762
Maybe it's something that we need to look

1059
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:23,064
at our benefits package, our vacation time,

1060
01:02:23,184 --> 01:02:24,005
our sick policy.

1061
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:28,590
And the more that we can spread that voice through, I think, the more of a chance we

1062
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:31,112
have of bringing the situations to the forefront.

1063
01:02:31,988 --> 01:02:32,788
Thank you for this panel.

1064
01:02:33,068 --> 01:02:33,649
Yes, thanks.

1065
01:02:34,189 --> 01:02:36,529
So thank you everyone for joining us today.

1066
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:39,891
I really appreciate that you all took your time to come and hear us talk.

1067
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:43,672
We'll go upstairs if you wanted to chat any further up in the wrap-up area.

1068
01:02:44,332 --> 01:02:47,293
And I'm always happy to connect with folks to talk more about this issue,

1069
01:02:47,353 --> 01:02:50,854
as I'm sure other folks here are outside of GDC as well.

1070
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:52,235
So please stay in touch.

1071
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:57,857
And if you're looking to find ways to support mothers in your companies

1072
01:02:58,217 --> 01:02:59,017
or to be a...

1073
01:02:59,555 --> 01:03:02,460
supported yourself. I hope that you've been able to take something away today

1074
01:03:04,102 --> 01:03:05,324
towards that effort. Thank you.
