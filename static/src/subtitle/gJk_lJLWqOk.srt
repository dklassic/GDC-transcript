1
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:06,887
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:10,209
Welcome to Designing Great Interactive Narrative on Mobile

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:11,570
with these brilliant people.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,012
Ironically, I do need to ask you, first of all,

5
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:16,914
to turn off the sound on your mobile phones

6
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,135
and just make sure that we're not

7
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:20,196
interrupting them in their flow.

8
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,678
Questions, we'll have a little bit of time at the end,

9
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:25,680
but first of all, I'm gonna ask them to introduce themselves

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,661
and to brag about a bit of work

11
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:30,203
that they're really proud of, starting with Cass.

12
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:32,985
You said you were gonna ask that question

13
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:33,885
and I totally didn't prepare.

14
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:37,897
Hey guys, I'm Cass. I'm a director of story at Episode.

15
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:41,981
For the people that don't know, that's an interactive narrative platform

16
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:46,466
where we both create interactive stories for free-to-play mobile games,

17
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:49,088
but we also open our platform for writers to create their own content.

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,892
I think I'm actually probably the most proud of is that we are an open platform and I joined

19
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:57,714
the team right when that was being discussed and kind of helped figure out how to make

20
00:00:57,734 --> 00:01:00,836
it open and how to make sure that everything that we created was something that we could

21
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:03,458
put live to anyone who wanted to play with it.

22
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:07,401
So I'm relatively proud to have worked on something that isn't closed.

23
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:09,462
It's open to anyone who wants to make games.

24
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:14,946
And I know personally about a dozen women around the world who now make a full-time

25
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:18,188
living making games on episode, which is cool.

26
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:18,809
Pretty proud of that.

27
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:26,924
Hi guys, I'm Marisa. I work for Big Fish Games in a small studio called 3 Minute Games, and

28
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:33,086
I manage the Lifeline brand. So I think the thing that I'm most proud of is the fact that

29
00:01:33,146 --> 00:01:38,407
Lifeline has been a jumping off platform for several authors. We started with a very small

30
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:42,748
number and we've now expanded and so similar to what Cass was saying as

31
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,692
It's really nice to be able to help people who have an idea and have the capabilities,

32
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:53,095
have the tools and the platform to be able to get out there and do that.

33
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:54,716
So that's what I'm excited about.

34
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:56,738
Hi, I'm Jon Ingold.

35
00:01:56,798 --> 00:02:00,500
I'm the narrative director of Inkle and one of the two co-founders of it.

36
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:05,644
I guess the thing we're most proud of is the fact that six years ago we started a company

37
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:09,806
to make interactive fiction and we're still doing it successfully with even more people

38
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:10,967
than we originally started with.

39
00:02:11,287 --> 00:02:16,851
But artistically, I'm most proud of probably writing the Sorcery series, which I was the

40
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:21,975
sole writer on, apart from a little bit of help from a guy called Graham Robertson on part four.

41
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:25,358
But I also co-wrote a lot of 80 Days and was the narrative director on that,

42
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,779
which is the one that everyone's heard of.

43
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:36,848
One thing we had a discussion about when we were planning for this talk is what we actually mean by interactive narrative because there's so many different ways that it can be used in gaming.

44
00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:44,569
We actually came up with stories where players get to make an active decision about what happens next, but that's still a really wide field.

45
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:51,151
So starting with John at the end, could you just explain what it means and how you use it in your game specifically?

46
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:56,332
So, like, an interactive narrative...

47
00:02:57,434 --> 00:03:02,158
for me has got to be more than the sum of its parts.

48
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,522
It's not enough to be something which has interaction within it.

49
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:08,945
I've seen the phrase used to describe stories with videos in,

50
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,448
and I don't see that as fitting under the mandate of interactive narrative

51
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:14,249
because it's not good enough.

52
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,775
And I've seen interactive games where you do get to make little choices, but the narrative

53
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:25,921
is so under the control of the author, it's so within that authorial scope, that as a

54
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:29,625
player I don't actually feel like I'm really there for any great reason, and that to me

55
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:30,326
fails as well.

56
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,689
So I think when we're trying to make interactive narrative, what we're really trying to do

57
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:36,432
is make a playable story which has a huge amount of player freedom.

58
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:38,854
within it and

59
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:43,436
So I tend to be looking for stories that allow the player to make

60
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:49,220
Discoveries and to have a sense of discovery and a sense of ownership over what they discover within that story

61
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,282
That couples with a sense of responsibility

62
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:58,465
so ideally a player playing one of our games is usually thinking what have I done and

63
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:01,636
and worrying that they might have got it wrong.

64
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:05,417
That slight sense of stress is incredibly important to me.

65
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:09,038
I think my job as a game designer is the same as my job

66
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:12,159
as a writer, which is to manage tension in the audience.

67
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,600
So for me, interactive narrative is a way

68
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,420
to generate tension directly in the head of an audience

69
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,501
based on the worry that what they've done

70
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:20,881
is not the right thing to have done

71
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:22,661
and that the consequences of what they've done

72
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:25,102
are going to be things that they will regret later.

73
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:29,980
Every writer is a very gentle tease or a very gentle torturer,

74
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,522
and interactive narrative is a way to achieve that.

75
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:34,944
Marise?

76
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:41,408
Yeah, I think, you know, the key word is the active part of the definition.

77
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:46,552
You know, reading used to be something that was more of a passive activity,

78
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:49,734
and then you had choose your own adventure books come on the scene,

79
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:52,436
and then all of a sudden you were a part of the action.

80
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:58,579
And I definitely think that with Lifeline, we kind of went, we took something that was

81
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:02,501
familiar to everybody, a text message, a conversation with your friend.

82
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:09,245
And we ended up taking that and making a story out of just having a conversation.

83
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:16,749
And your active participation in that is through messaging that protagonist and convincing

84
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:16,929
them.

85
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:20,551
to either go this way or to do that thing,

86
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,432
hopefully not killing them.

87
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:25,593
But that does put a little punch to it.

88
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:28,354
And we're kind of expanding that now,

89
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:30,235
which is really interesting to kind of see

90
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:31,956
because now we have stories where

91
00:05:32,537 --> 00:05:34,718
you are the main character in the story.

92
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:36,859
There's several ways that you can kind of do that,

93
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,400
but it's just giving the players,

94
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,321
making them players and not readers.

95
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:43,882
And that's really, I think, a big part of it.

96
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,462
I think an interesting thing when I think about interactive, just something that John

97
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:53,807
mentioned is how much in interactive do they need to be able to control the ending of the

98
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:55,349
story or control the direction it goes in?

99
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,430
I don't actually have an answer.

100
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,054
Versus feel like they are interacting in the experience that they're having.

101
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:04,338
I think about things like Sleep No More, the interactive theater production in New York,

102
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:05,940
and like, is that interactive fiction?

103
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:11,366
The VR game that recently came out, because they don't call it a game, Impossible Hours,

104
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:12,668
is that interactive fiction?

105
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:17,473
How much do I feel like I am in control of what's happening and interacting with what's going on?

106
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:22,736
Especially on mobile, I think we have a generation of new players right now who their life is

107
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:27,039
defined by Snapchat and their life is defined by Instagram and their life is defined by

108
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:30,441
really owning their persona and being the person that they want to be.

109
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,483
They're less into following celebrities, they're more into being the celebrity.

110
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:37,446
And so there's something really exciting about how games can allow people to do that and

111
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,847
how interactive fiction especially can allow people to do that.

112
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:41,689
And so thinking about, as you guys both said,

113
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,951
with taking action in it, I don't know in this room

114
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,753
yet if we need to create full freedom,

115
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:47,834
but we definitely need to.

116
00:06:48,294 --> 00:06:49,895
Interactive fiction is creating a space

117
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:54,019
where I feel like I am in control in places I may not

118
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,039
be in my actual life.

119
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,681
I can try things I may be afraid to try in the real world.

120
00:06:58,062 --> 00:07:00,584
I can explore different outcomes and see the kind of persona

121
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:01,284
that I want to be.

122
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,526
And having a lot of agency in my experience

123
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,469
is, I think, what just makes interactive fiction very

124
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,710
specific and very unique.

125
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:12,959
And how do you kind of reach that point in your studios?

126
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:15,401
What are your writers' rooms set ups like?

127
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:18,443
You know, what's the situation with writers and designers?

128
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:20,945
Like, John, I know you kind of do a bit of everything,

129
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:23,107
but if you could all just tell me, you know,

130
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:24,889
for the audience who may be,

131
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,551
haven't had the chance to work in that kind of scenario yet,

132
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:29,733
just how you set it up as part of the studio.

133
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:31,984
Well, shall I go first?

134
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:34,947
For us, it's been very much this process of scaling up

135
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,548
over the last six years.

136
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,571
First projects, the writer's room was just me.

137
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,914
And I was both writing it and designing the way

138
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:44,336
that the writing would be done.

139
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:47,299
So all of the content that we generated at Inkle

140
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,461
is done using our Ink scripting language, which

141
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:50,702
is an open source thing now.

142
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:55,624
But that was originally a very badly hacked together Perl script that I made at some point

143
00:07:55,664 --> 00:08:00,486
in the weekends in order to try and generate output that Joe, my co-founder, could get

144
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,466
running in an app.

145
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:04,488
And it was a real piece of sticky tape and string programming.

146
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,769
I shouldn't be allowed to program anything, really, but there was no one else to do it,

147
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:08,229
so I did it.

148
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:16,015
One of the joys of the company though has been the ability to expand that process out and to bring in new writers.

149
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:21,419
So we worked with Meg Gyanth on 80 Days and she did a phenomenal job and really supercharged that game concept

150
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,942
from something that we thought could be good to something that was genuinely sort of brilliant.

151
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,264
And that was a real pleasure to be able to enable.

152
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:32,446
But in order to do that, we had to compartmentalize the problem.

153
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:39,508
Interactive narrative is very complicated and very open and can go in a hundred different

154
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:41,229
directions and different styles.

155
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:45,610
So when we approached 80 Days, we were able to do it because we'd just made a game called

156
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,532
Sorcery 2, which had a full city that you could explore and kind of backtrack in and

157
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:52,873
meet people and have episodic adventures within.

158
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:56,176
And I remember saying to Meg at the time, she said,

159
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:57,457
but isn't the world quite big?

160
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:58,898
And I said, oh, we've managed a city,

161
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:00,560
how much bigger can the world possibly be?

162
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,262
It turned out it was quite a lot bigger,

163
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:06,125
but it gave us a structure,

164
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:09,288
literally a format that we could write into.

165
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,470
Like this is a city, this is how you start a city,

166
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,551
this is how you end a city,

167
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:14,572
this is how you cause a change to happen

168
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:16,014
within the player's statistics, whatever.

169
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:21,761
Similarly for journeys, they had a slightly more complicated structure, but we could give her that as a template and say,

170
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,045
you don't need to worry about the technical stuff unless you feel like it.

171
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,429
If you just want to write, you can just write. Here's the format, it will work.

172
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:34,777
If you want to do something more technical, and she did, then go, this is how you can research that and produce more complex content.

173
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:37,718
We did the same thing again on Sorcery 4, where I hired Graham.

174
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:41,399
As I said, he was a junior writer who'd never written any professional content before at

175
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:46,060
all, but he was incredibly good at learning the patterns that sorcery used, which were

176
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,220
very, very weird and very ad hoc structures.

177
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:53,561
We're currently working on a game called Heaven's Vault, which will eventually end up on mobile

178
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:56,502
and is a somewhat more ambitious interactive narrative again.

179
00:09:57,002 --> 00:10:01,744
And one of my biggest regrets on that project is that the way that we author it is so incredibly

180
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:05,566
complicated and it has taken so many iterations to get right that I haven't been able to bring

181
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:08,707
in any other writers because I keep changing my mind on how to write it.

182
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:13,509
Which is to say, I think the writers room for Heaven's Vault 2 will be a phenomenally

183
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:16,670
brilliant place that I'm really looking forward to getting to, but we have to get through

184
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,711
the first version first.

185
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:21,512
So from us, it's really quite technical actually and it's really not very political.

186
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:27,797
Mostly once we have a writer, we just tell them to get on with it and be brilliant and edit it when it's not.

187
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:32,660
Kassimarie, so how is it for you guys? What's the kind of setup in your studios?

188
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:36,183
Pretty similar. It started very small for us as well.

189
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:44,249
The original Lifeline was made by one author, one game designer who also doubled as a producer, one artist and one programmer.

190
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:49,473
And so it was just four people with a singular vision kind of sitting down and making that happen.

191
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:54,096
And then we started growing immediately after the success of that first game.

192
00:10:54,457 --> 00:11:00,262
And now we added a few more authors, and then the producers started working on our style guide.

193
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:02,484
We have an awesome narrative design team.

194
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:08,228
And then, really internally, we're just there to support the narratives and the authorship

195
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,891
that goes on externally, outside of our company.

196
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:16,936
So we have the rule set that we write, and we're able to take care of the technical stuff.

197
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:22,823
We'll chime in every now and again, and it's often in regards to making it more of a game

198
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:28,030
and pacing and things of that nature, but when it comes to the content, we just give

199
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,376
you kind of the platform or the tools, we give you the canvas, and you make the painting,

200
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:33,837
so to speak.

201
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:37,340
Yeah, it's interesting. For an episode, I think we took a lot. It's a little bit different.

202
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,046
We took a lot from the TV world. A lot of our lead writers are from a TV background.

203
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:47,292
We start before we go into a project, we ask a couple of key questions. One of those is,

204
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:51,557
is this a world our players want to play in? So when we're reading pitches, we're thinking

205
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:54,380
about there are some pitches that if they're a TV show, they sound great.

206
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:59,742
But I want to ask, especially on mobile, especially in free-to-play, do my players want to play

207
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:00,323
in this world?

208
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:07,165
A second question is, is the act of adding agency what makes it special?

209
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:10,066
Essentially, we don't have HBO's budget.

210
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,086
We can't invest.

211
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:14,024
whatever they're doing, $100 million in an episode.

212
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:17,568
So what we do have is this ability to have interactivity.

213
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:19,270
So we will ask this question of like,

214
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,552
hey, even though we don't have HBO's production budget,

215
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,696
does interactivity make this feel great?

216
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:27,339
The answer to both those questions obviously has to be yes.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,583
Um, at that moment we do, do, usually the lead, uh, creator, the showrunner, will start

218
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:37,125
developing out an outline in a rough pitch, usually with a product manager to make sure

219
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:38,766
that scope feels kind of appropriate.

220
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,727
When we have those two things down, we'll move into a room.

221
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:46,510
Uh, usually our rooms are about a week long, and they're focused very much on getting the

222
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,252
core beats of the story down, um, and asking key questions like, what are the key choices

223
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,013
that we want people to be able to make in this story?

224
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,215
And where are the moments that this is really gonna matter?

225
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,476
We aren't thinking too much about small branches.

226
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:03,259
at that moment. Um, usually in that room, there's the showrunner, uh, and then there's a,

227
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,222
like, supporting cast, usually a writer, and then someone who supports the showrunner's

228
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:10,464
weaknesses. So our showrunners can be people like me, who's a little more game design

229
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:15,387
background, but not narrative linear storytelling, in which case my co-person in the room

230
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:18,749
would be someone with more of a linear TV background. Uh, if we have one of our more

231
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:22,331
linear TV people showrunning it, I might come into the room to support, um...

232
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,064
and our rooms run for about a week.

233
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:27,126
At the end of them, the hope is to get a very rough outline.

234
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:30,910
That said, usually we'll then dive deep on a vertical slice

235
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,772
and do a single episode and just see how it's performing

236
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:35,173
to understand if we want to invest more.

237
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:43,524
And for people in the audience who might be kind of aspiring writers or looking to get into this kind of type of game work,

238
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:51,773
what are some of the key skills or things that people can be developing now that you're going to be looking for when they come knocking on your door for a job?

239
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,194
Kath, we start with you.

240
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,677
I'm starting. You should have Marisa start, she hasn't started yet.

241
00:13:56,498 --> 00:14:01,762
Um, I'm looking for you, writing now, especially with tools like Inkle, with Episode, uh, it's

242
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:07,107
so easy to go and make a thing. Like if anyone in this room is a writer and hasn't finished

243
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:13,372
a thing, you can send one of us, go finish it. It's not, it's really not hard to write.

244
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:18,736
Um, so the number one thing is just be writing. Um, be writing things that

245
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:21,518
are interactive, that I make great choices.

246
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,858
Think about how the choices feel.

247
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,619
I wanna see, I'm actually more impressed

248
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,700
if you write something short and simple and easy to digest,

249
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,821
but where every single beat feels

250
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:32,402
like you really thought it out.

251
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:34,203
You were like, I want them to feel this way

252
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:35,263
because of this choice.

253
00:14:35,703 --> 00:14:37,864
I've thought about how big the choice space is,

254
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:41,005
how much variety and diversity it includes.

255
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:46,690
Um, so that's my biggest thing, is like, create works, create short works, create works where

256
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,972
it feels like every beat is really highly crafted.

257
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:53,977
Um, for episodes specifically, uh, because this can be a mildly controversial thing,

258
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:55,538
I love the idea of freemium.

259
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,963
I think freemium has done some things poorly in the past, but I am so excited for how it

260
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:04,307
can let people get into the game, how we can think about how to empower tons of people

261
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,889
to be able to engage in a medium that used to feel very, very niche.

262
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:10,665
So if you're going to apply for episode, you probably need to enjoy freemium.

263
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:14,947
Don't worry, we will get to that discussion.

264
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:18,729
I know Marisa has a lot to say on this, so I'm going to make John go first.

265
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:28,054
Yeah, I mean, we don't receive very many pitches from writers, or rather, we don't read very

266
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:28,995
many pitches from writers.

267
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:32,759
We get quite a few, but we tend to shut them down quite quickly because we're not in a

268
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,242
position to offer that employment and I don't want to waste people's time.

269
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,407
But the stuff that I have seen, I'd actually, I think I'd echo a lot of what Cass said,

270
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:42,710
that firstly, you've got to finish stuff.

271
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,372
I don't care about how good your ideas are if you can't finish something.

272
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,334
Finishing is the key skill to being a writer, because actually your first thing is going

273
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,415
to be rubbish, even if you're very, very talented.

274
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:56,698
Your fourth thing is going to be worth reading, but you won't get there if you keep working

275
00:15:56,718 --> 00:15:57,358
on your first thing.

276
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:00,500
So if that's who you are, then you're a hobbyist and you're not a professional.

277
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,622
And that's a horrible thing to say, but it's true, and I know it's true, because I'm 36,

278
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:10,305
and in my 20s I did not have a successful writing job, and that's why.

279
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:10,825
Right?

280
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:27,835
Once you finish something, and I think something short is a good idea if you want to be sending it to people who are busy and like don't have much time to get into your world, your characters, we're not going to be very interested in reading a Tolkien-esque fantasy world with a million people in it.

281
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:33,661
Actually, what I'd like to see, if I ever see a pitch, is two people having a convincing conversation about a single topic.

282
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,261
because that's incredibly hard to write interactively.

283
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,942
It's actually quite easy to write linearly.

284
00:16:38,502 --> 00:16:39,642
And when we see that kind of pitch,

285
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:41,343
often what we see is a linear story

286
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,863
with some arbitrary choices thrown in

287
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:44,623
that don't make any difference, which is a fail.

288
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:47,944
But it's a really clear, clean, easy to digest fail.

289
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,584
So I appreciate that when people send that to me

290
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:50,545
because I can read it and go,

291
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,945
yep, no, definitely failed, won't give you a job,

292
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:53,525
thank you very much.

293
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,346
That was a great interaction from my point of view.

294
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,346
Not from yours.

295
00:16:57,526 --> 00:17:01,067
But it is a challenge which if you accept and win,

296
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,048
then I think that can be really convincing.

297
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:10,910
So, when we hired Meg, I read one of her independent pieces of interactive writing.

298
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,452
I think she has only done one, and I read it, and it very cleverly used the constraints

299
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:16,692
of the system that it was written in.

300
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:20,974
It's written in Story Nexus, which was built by Fail Better Games, who made Sunless Sea

301
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:22,874
and Fallen London, which is...

302
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:29,578
They're friends, but it is not the most elegant platform to write for, shall we say.

303
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:35,342
It is somewhat difficult to tame into the structure that you want to apply.

304
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:42,167
And what she managed to do with her piece called Samsara was build something which very cleverly exploited the weaknesses of Story Nexus

305
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:45,609
to make something which was simple, effective, but really easy to understand.

306
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:50,412
Also, it was beautifully written. And that was why we hired her. That's why we gave her a writing sample.

307
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:52,513
The writing sample we gave her was we said,

308
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,013
go and take this thing called Inkle Writer,

309
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,114
which was like a proto-web version of Ink,

310
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:59,095
which doesn't let you do anything apart from choices,

311
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:00,755
and write us a short scene.

312
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:03,336
And she managed to use her words so well

313
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,577
that reading that scene was a pleasure and full of delight.

314
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:07,077
The pacing was all wrong,

315
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:08,497
the length of the paragraphs was all wrong,

316
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:09,538
but it had some jokes in it,

317
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:10,838
it had some style to it,

318
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:11,878
it had some voice to it,

319
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,239
and that was enough to convince me

320
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,319
that she could take on what proved

321
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:16,960
to be the most significant project that we'd done,

322
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,921
with absolutely no other proof that she could.

323
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:25,163
deliver something or that she was going to be good at research or any of these things apart from the fact that I knew her

324
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:26,524
and liked her.

325
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:28,485
And similarly with Graham when we hired Graham,

326
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:35,389
he, I met him on a writing course actually, but he was producing a piece of work which was technically very intricate

327
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,750
and that was kind of his focus, but the writing was solid.

328
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:44,173
But the way that it used the writing interactively was really interesting and you don't often see that from new up-and-coming writers.

329
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:46,855
A sense of command of the craft.

330
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:50,437
of the technical craft. I'm quite a technical writer so I really respected that

331
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,778
and I'm really glad we gave him the chance that we did on Sorcery 4.

332
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,381
So yeah I think that's probably it.

333
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:01,283
It's probably about pitching to the studio correctly though. Inkle is always

334
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,064
going to be a slightly technical place

335
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:07,746
because the mindsets of Joe and I who founded it. We like doing cunning things

336
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:10,428
with narratives so if you're pitching to us we want to see some cunning things

337
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,830
but we're also very soulful people so we like human beings

338
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,091
in our stories. And I think you have to find out

339
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,252
who you're pitching to and research that company.

340
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:23,714
Yeah, that's great advice.

341
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:26,096
I would say the first thing you should do

342
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:28,097
is go out and get something that enables you

343
00:19:28,137 --> 00:19:29,518
to write interactive fiction.

344
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,441
Grab the Engel open source platform.

345
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:37,504
Go to Episode and make something there, or grab Twine.

346
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,906
Twine is an open source free platform

347
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:43,688
that a lot of users use, and that jumps right off

348
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:45,910
into my next point, which is find a community

349
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,451
of people who are also doing it.

350
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:50,732
get to know people around you who are working in interactive fiction.

351
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:58,374
One thing we learned very early on is that there's a bit of a barrier to entry for the normal writer,

352
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:03,776
not to say that in like a grouping way, but just somebody who's used to writing a book,

353
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:09,818
or a short story, or that format, may not have a good time writing interactive fiction.

354
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:13,199
there's a new rule set and so you have to be aware of that.

355
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:17,981
And so just getting in there and as both of my fellow panelists have said,

356
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:19,822
start writing something.

357
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:26,524
So definitely be aware of also the fact that you're going to have to plan quite a bit

358
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:28,065
if you want to write something good.

359
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:30,086
You're going to have to make flow charts.

360
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:31,848
You're going to have to do a story map.

361
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,569
You're going to have to do decision trees.

362
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:36,331
You're going to have to keep track of multiple variables

363
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,593
and multiple endings often.

364
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,856
So definitely stay organized as best as you can.

365
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:46,318
And if you don't have a way to do that yet, figure it out.

366
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,700
And so that's another step as well.

367
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:52,203
I definitely think you have to have a willingness to iterate.

368
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:53,964
It's something where.

369
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:56,965
you're not going to get it right the first time out the gate, I guarantee it.

370
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:04,566
And having the humility to accept that we all have room for growth is definitely a great

371
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:08,847
quality for somebody who's going to be a good writer, especially of interactive fiction.

372
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:15,368
I think we're pretty similar in that it doesn't hurt to have a technical mind or to understand

373
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:17,988
the technical side of how these games are built.

374
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:23,529
Maybe go grab some and see if you can take them apart, you know, work backwards.

375
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,651
and figure out why things are happening the way they are and why they're working. Um,

376
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:35,915
and then make yourself the user. Uh, think about it as a player and definitely, um, you

377
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:41,358
know, if you would ra- would you rather read a lot of exposition or would you rather, you

378
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:46,740
Learn that by doing and answering questions and being active in the story.

379
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,121
You can learn a lot when you stop and think about it as a player.

380
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:53,603
So play your stuff often. You are your own best play tester.

381
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:55,524
Or get it in front of other people.

382
00:21:55,664 --> 00:22:00,106
That's the great thing about a Twine community is that you can put that stuff out there

383
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:03,127
and you can get feedback on it almost instantaneously.

384
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:08,190
Um, we've worked with an awesome resource, Emily Short, she has a great blog, some of

385
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,172
you are probably familiar with her in this room.

386
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:15,015
Uh, go check it out because she will hook you up with some of the tools that you need

387
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:18,638
to do this and she'll also give you some of that sense of community.

388
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:24,682
And then send it to Episodes, send it to us, send it to Inkle and, you know, we'll work

389
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,383
with you and we'll give you feedback.

390
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:29,765
We're not gonna just leave you guys hanging, so we'll let you know what is working, what

391
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:30,626
may not be working.

392
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:34,771
And we can hopefully help you guys move to that next level.

393
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:36,093
Something I realized to jump in,

394
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:37,796
because it's also, we're talking about mobile

395
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,278
very specifically, I think if you're looking

396
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,240
at mobile very specifically, you should also be thinking,

397
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,222
and I know we chatted earlier,

398
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,044
so you guys were on the same page, about pace.

399
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,711
Biggest problem I get in pitches is pace.

400
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:49,152
Immobile is fast.

401
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:50,473
You've got five seconds.

402
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:54,075
So how are you getting me hooked in seconds?

403
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:57,017
A great exercise that I actually ask people about

404
00:22:57,037 --> 00:22:58,778
in my interviews, if you're in an interview with me,

405
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:01,620
have a prep dancer, is how are you gonna convert

406
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,801
something that was a TV show onto a mobile phone?

407
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:09,264
If your answer is just like, oh, I'm going to cut some things down, that's wrong.

408
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:13,506
So think about that you've got this tiny screen, what are you focusing on, what's important

409
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:14,226
to the character.

410
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:17,748
If you think you're going to tell the war scenes from Lord of the Rings on a mobile

411
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,069
phone, I'm going to argue with you that you are wrong.

412
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:20,950
You're probably not.

413
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,831
So how are you going to tell those scenes?

414
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:24,212
What do they feel like on mobile?

415
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,393
So when you're thinking very specifically with our title on mobile, think about your

416
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:31,596
pace and think about that device that you're building for and challenge yourself to create

417
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:33,396
something that was on TV or something that was a movie.

418
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,321
think about how you actively have to change that to make it feel like it's right for mobile.

419
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,802
That'll give you a good set of things to work with.

420
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:43,904
That's definitely, you know, we wanted to move on to the mobile part.

421
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:49,026
So, I mean, you brought up some of the great kind of challenges that all mobile games have,

422
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:53,528
which is pacing, the amount of time a player's going to spend, all the other sort of things

423
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:55,729
that they could be doing on their mobile phone at that time.

424
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:56,869
So how do you guys...

425
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,597
change the way that you tell your stories or adapt your narratives so that they do fit that kind of mobile world

426
00:24:03,637 --> 00:24:09,384
and what are some of the things that maybe people haven't thought of when it comes to making great narrative for mobile

427
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:11,106
and who wants to go first?

428
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:15,306
I'll jump in because I was going to jump in on exactly that point anyway.

429
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:21,129
I think one thing that people often don't realize is how incredibly tight the word limits

430
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,590
are on mobile.

431
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,753
I remember talking to Jonathan Myers who was the, I guess, the show runner on the Game

432
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:30,655
of Thrones mobile app, which was about five years old now, I think.

433
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:33,657
And he said that his quests were built out of three beats.

434
00:24:33,717 --> 00:24:37,799
The first one was, the first beat of the story was allowed, I think this is right, I think

435
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:38,139
it was 20 words.

436
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,144
The second beat was allowed 15 words, and the final beat, if you got through it, was allowed 25.

437
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:46,267
And that was the entire delivery system for the narrative.

438
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:47,628
And he said every single one of his writers said,

439
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,410
this is stupid, we can't do this.

440
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:51,752
And his reply would be, yep, yep, you can.

441
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,955
And it was very successful, and it was very popular.

442
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:57,358
Because you just have to find the rhythm, and you have to find the kind of words,

443
00:24:57,378 --> 00:24:59,100
and the kind of language that fits that,

444
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,562
because that's your job as a writer, is to write to spec.

445
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:06,306
That's not really any different than writing for the theater or writing for the screen,

446
00:25:06,386 --> 00:25:10,049
which is completely different than writing for the theater, even though it's still people

447
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:10,409
talking.

448
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,373
And I think that applies to all of our products, even though they're completely different shapes.

449
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:20,237
Like a lot of my time on 80 Days was spent taking beautiful, long paragraphs of prose

450
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:22,279
that Meg had written and chopping them in three.

451
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:26,462
because she tended to enjoy writing a little bit too much.

452
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:29,244
And so I'd have to put them behind a choice and pace it out

453
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:31,986
because the pacing is the most important part of that experience.

454
00:25:32,386 --> 00:25:34,327
And I think that really ties into that question

455
00:25:34,427 --> 00:25:37,249
of what the user could otherwise be doing on their phone.

456
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,631
If you're trying to get someone to read something on a phone,

457
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,173
you are competing directly with Twitter.

458
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:47,466
Now the thing about Twitter is you can read everything on Twitter by accident, and now

459
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:51,747
it's all awful and you don't want to read any of it, but that just is why you keep scrolling

460
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:54,268
and looking in the desperate hope of finding something good.

461
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:56,628
So it's actually not that bad to be better than Twitter.

462
00:25:57,068 --> 00:26:01,569
Everything I write is better than anything you read on Twitter with a very small percentage

463
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:02,309
error, right?

464
00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:04,650
That's statistically, that's basically true.

465
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,531
But I have to make sure that you actually read what I write.

466
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:11,231
So if I'm writing things which are shorter than things on Twitter...

467
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:13,535
then I'm probably gonna win that argument.

468
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:15,420
But then they introduced videos and images,

469
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,322
and that's a bit of a problem.

470
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:17,565
So suddenly you have to upscale

471
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:18,848
and make sure that you're attractive

472
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,031
and visual as well, whatever.

473
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:29,299
that sense that you are writing words in a hurricane of information to people who do read.

474
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,002
Everybody reads all the time. We read a tremendous amount. The idea that we cannot read is ludicrous.

475
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:39,805
It's utterly wrong. But people don't read much. They read a couple of words and then they move on

476
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:45,068
and you have to be able to get people in a couple of words, which is, yeah, it's pretty hard.

477
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,732
Well, and it's funny because Twitter is actually kind of a good tool.

478
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:54,579
Because if you put everything that you write into Twitter, does it fit or does it go over

479
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,359
your character count?

480
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,921
Also, would it be engaging?

481
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:59,524
Would people actually want to interact with what you just said?

482
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:03,829
That's actually a pretty good litmus test for what you're doing when you're writing

483
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,791
an interactive fiction.

484
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:11,594
Also, you know, think about what people are doing when they're playing on the mobile devices.

485
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:17,037
They're often doing it in interspersed throughout their day where, you know, they've got a few

486
00:27:17,077 --> 00:27:21,459
moments and then they can kind of sit down and they can do something different and get

487
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:23,960
their mind off of the rigmarole of daily life.

488
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,405
We've done surveys and Google actually did their own survey

489
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:32,151
and shared with us that our findings were the same, which

490
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:36,317
is a lot of people play apps that involve interactive

491
00:27:36,357 --> 00:27:37,499
fiction before bed.

492
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:40,062
It's the prime time for that.

493
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:42,344
And it's when you want to wind down.

494
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:45,065
It's when you want to have a few moments to yourself,

495
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,607
get a cup of tea or get a cup of whatever

496
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:50,488
might help you get to bed, a cup of warm milk.

497
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:54,210
And you just want to let go of everything

498
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,450
that happened during the day.

499
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:57,111
That's going to be a different story

500
00:27:57,171 --> 00:27:59,012
than if you want to amp somebody up

501
00:27:59,072 --> 00:28:01,433
and you want to make them feel really intense.

502
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:04,355
So definitely think about the application

503
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,396
of where they're playing and how they're playing.

504
00:28:07,196 --> 00:28:11,939
Um, and also the thing about mobile is that immersion can be more difficult if you're

505
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:16,441
playing things in large, er, small chunks rather than a large swath where you sit down

506
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:17,322
and play the whole thing.

507
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:22,444
Uh, so, you know, it's one of those things where if you can do things to make the player

508
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:26,987
suck them in, uh, you don't know when they're going to come into your game, so you have

509
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:29,488
to be thinking about that at every point along the way.

510
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:34,230
And so you should be writing something that should, could always pull them in and make

511
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:34,791
them immersed.

512
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:34,911
Yeah.

513
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:39,952
Um, one really good trick is to ask their name at the beginning of your game and then

514
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:43,773
just like when you're active listening, keep repeating it back to them.

515
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:46,974
Hey, player name, how do you feel today?

516
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,935
I'm going to respond to you directly.

517
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:53,896
I'm immediately sucked in and I feel like it's my personal experience rather than an

518
00:28:53,976 --> 00:28:57,737
experience that some random Joe on the street might be having as well.

519
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:01,705
that we've started doing a little related to the active listening. We'll look at the

520
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:06,148
first 50 lines in a story that we're about to put out and we'll literally just take one

521
00:29:06,188 --> 00:29:10,131
line and show it to a random person on our team. And we'll say, is this interesting,

522
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:13,133
do you want to keep reading? And they have no context at all. They have no idea what

523
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:17,096
the story's about, who it is, why they're talking to, who they're talking to. This idea

524
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:20,398
being that a player may leave at any moment and then come back at the next moment.

525
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:22,581
and they should have a line on screen

526
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:24,343
that makes them lean in.

527
00:29:24,824 --> 00:29:27,067
They may have even forgotten everything that happened before

528
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:28,609
because, oh my gosh, how many things

529
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:31,132
have you read online today that you can't remember

530
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:31,753
in this room right now?

531
00:29:32,352 --> 00:29:35,034
And so we want to make sure that that line tells a story by itself.

532
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:37,616
We'd love to do this with every line in our stories.

533
00:29:37,796 --> 00:29:39,017
That's thousands.

534
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,300
So we at least focus in that on those first like 50 to 100,

535
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,082
we are showing them by themselves to people

536
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,264
and just making sure that they all tell a story,

537
00:29:47,324 --> 00:29:49,646
they all ask a question, and they all make me lean in

538
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:50,507
and want to come back.

539
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:53,950
So that's kind of just a major kind of thing with mobile

540
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,693
to be thinking about is how engaged

541
00:29:57,733 --> 00:29:58,794
and how you get those people back.

542
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:02,018
I think your point on when they're playing is important to recognize with mobile.

543
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,919
A premium versus a freemium app they're playing for different reasons, when they're playing

544
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:06,860
it, why they're playing it.

545
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,261
Just make sure you know your audience really well.

546
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,061
Kind of own who your audience is.

547
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:14,963
If you think your audience is everyone who likes interactive fiction, maybe that worked

548
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:17,484
20 years ago when we were a small niche community.

549
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,324
It doesn't anymore.

550
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:22,806
So think about who very specifically are you writing for and then don't worry about everybody

551
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:23,106
else.

552
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:27,028
Get your story out to that person and know who they are and know how to reach them.

553
00:30:27,728 --> 00:30:29,450
and then kind of grow up from there.

554
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,972
And how do you guys kind of deal with,

555
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:34,794
because I know there's very different products,

556
00:30:34,854 --> 00:30:37,957
but giving people the catharsis of an ending

557
00:30:38,017 --> 00:30:39,339
but then trying to make sure they still

558
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,600
come back at some point.

559
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,601
John, I know it's different for you

560
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:44,824
because your games have sort of specific endings.

561
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:47,326
So yeah, how do you guys that are sort of

562
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,027
dealing with episodic make sure that

563
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,929
people are getting that satisfaction

564
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,831
but then have a reason to keep going as well?

565
00:30:55,762 --> 00:30:57,063
My short answer is we don't.

566
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:00,486
We are episodic content.

567
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:03,349
We do want to make sure, if you guys ever watched Lost,

568
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,532
one of my criticisms of Lost is it made me feel like

569
00:31:05,612 --> 00:31:07,634
I asked more questions that I got answered.

570
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:10,176
So we are thinking about in the crafting of every episode,

571
00:31:10,196 --> 00:31:11,878
we think about what's my goal this episode,

572
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:13,160
what are my stakes around that goal,

573
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,521
and have I accomplished it by the end

574
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,323
based on choices I've made throughout the episode.

575
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:20,427
And so we ask those three questions with every episode we put out, so that at the end of

576
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:24,591
the episode, you hopefully have a feeling of like, cool, I learned a thing, my choices

577
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:25,372
changed something.

578
00:31:26,393 --> 00:31:29,957
But we also then like hyper-focus on that cliffhanger and make sure you have a reason

579
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:30,737
to want to come back.

580
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:35,002
We do think about things seasonally, we generally do 12 to 15 episodes seasons.

581
00:31:35,382 --> 00:31:37,825
We write a season expecting there not to be a sequel.

582
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:39,726
We don't do a lot of sequels.

583
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:43,409
So we do write being like, cool, you're going to have some crazy ending, maybe you've got

584
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:46,831
six crazy endings, maybe different characters feel differently about you, and if we have

585
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:51,494
to write a sequel, that'll be a problem for another day, because we know that if you got

586
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:53,375
this far, we want you to feel great.

587
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:58,359
That said, we've looked at our data, I know Microsoft did a thing about data, most of

588
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,360
your players are actually not going to finish your story.

589
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,442
Uh, so now your goal is just to make them feel really great.

590
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:07,345
while they're playing your story, and then hopefully at that moment that they're about

591
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:11,509
to leave, get them into one of your other stories, because they're just not going to

592
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:12,070
finish.

593
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,213
The percentage of people that finish our games is really sadly low.

594
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,235
If you actually want those stats, I can probably send them to you privately.

595
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:20,597
I wasn't allowed to project them.

596
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,202
But yeah, so just pretend that it's always a great ending, and then get them into something

597
00:32:25,262 --> 00:32:25,382
else.

598
00:32:25,928 --> 00:32:32,870
Yeah, I think that point about people not finishing is really important actually, and that's something that we see a lot in general across all video games.

599
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,350
People don't finish them, but it doesn't mean that people are unhappy.

600
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:43,952
Most of the games that you will tell your friends, oh, I really love this game, that will be a game that you kind of mean to finish, but you haven't quite got back to yet.

601
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:48,953
And every passing day you forget how it works, and you found something else, and you drift off.

602
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:51,835
which is kind of the same as reading books, actually.

603
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,836
Certainly as a kid I used to have a huge stack of books

604
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:55,998
which were half-read, which I like,

605
00:32:56,298 --> 00:32:57,199
and I'm still reading now,

606
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:59,840
but I haven't picked up in about 25 years

607
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,021
and I have no idea what they're about.

608
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:04,123
I mean, our games are very different

609
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:07,045
than the freemium rolling season model, obviously,

610
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:09,527
but we still think about this stuff a lot,

611
00:33:10,107 --> 00:33:11,408
particularly at the end of 80 Days,

612
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:14,430
we deliberately wanted to make a game that was replayable.

613
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,051
So at the very, very end,

614
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:17,632
the last line of the...

615
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:22,235
of the story is pretty much Fogg saying, right, let's go again.

616
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:24,156
Then the app resets.

617
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:25,637
It puts you in London straightaway.

618
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,640
It flashes at you and it asks you to just tap that London button so that you've already

619
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,862
started your second journey before you get a chance to close the app down.

620
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:35,984
That's a very deliberate piece of fast flow.

621
00:33:36,044 --> 00:33:38,325
There isn't an option that says, do you want to start another game?

622
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:39,666
It just does that straightaway.

623
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:43,188
That said, we didn't expect anyone to actually replay it.

624
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,410
What we thought people would do would be to finish 80 days.

625
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:52,439
restart their next story, see that they could restart the next story, see that the opening of the story was slightly more efficient than

626
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:56,765
it had been the first time around because it was responding to the fact that this was their second journey, say,

627
00:33:57,026 --> 00:34:00,831
huh, that's really neat. This game is replayable, and then put it away and never play it again.

628
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:06,195
Because that's a great place to leave a player, not with the catharsis of a happy, satisfied ending,

629
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:08,617
not coming out and whooping and punching the air, but saying,

630
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:12,019
I'm in the middle of an interesting journey that I'm never going to go back to.

631
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,901
That's kind of the best way to leave a player, just as it is for all other video games.

632
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,223
Like, my favorite game in the world is Shadow of the Colossus.

633
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:21,665
I am still in the middle of that game. I've been in the middle of it four times now.

634
00:34:22,265 --> 00:34:24,426
And I love it. It's great. And that is the happiest place.

635
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:26,728
I don't necessarily need to see the ending of it at all.

636
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:36,216
That said, for Sorcery, which was four connected games, the first three parts we really needed to get people through to the end if we could because we wanted them to buy the sequel.

637
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:41,620
So that was a really interesting challenge. The first game was very quick and pushed you forward. We got a lot of complaints that it was too short.

638
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:47,666
The second game we made very long to fight those complaints. A lot of people didn't finish it and that was really a problem.

639
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:51,067
even though we did put a lot of trapdoors in that said pretty much

640
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:54,729
are you sick of playing this game here's an ending so you can play part three in

641
00:34:54,749 --> 00:34:55,289
a year's time

642
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:58,491
but a lot of people said no that would be that would be cheating so they didn't do it

643
00:34:58,591 --> 00:34:59,351
which is a bit of a shame

644
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:05,666
And then part four was an ending, and that was a real pleasure, because we just made it brutally difficult.

645
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:09,267
Because we could. Because if you actually care, well, you're gonna stick with it.

646
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:13,908
And if you don't care, I don't really care where you stop playing Sorcery 4 at all.

647
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:16,009
It doesn't matter to me in the slightest.

648
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:20,289
Perhaps that's why Sorcery 4 didn't sell as well as the others. I don't know.

649
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:27,651
But I think that's okay, because probably when it came out, we sold a lot of copies of Sorcery 1, and that's just how it goes.

650
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:33,123
Yeah, um, we're kind of in an interesting phase right now where Lifeline has, uh, historically

651
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:39,208
been a premium product, uh, where you paid up front to get the whole game and, uh, we

652
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:43,932
could kind of relax and not worry so much if you left the app, but we were running into

653
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:48,376
the same thing that Inkle, uh, ran into, which is how do you get those people back?

654
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:52,659
Where are they and how do you communicate with them when you have a sequel?

655
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:57,482
Because, you know, it takes time to develop these and so not having them around and not

656
00:35:57,542 --> 00:36:00,703
having an open line of communication to them is very difficult.

657
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:06,167
So that decision kind of was a really big catalyst for us to move into the world of

658
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:06,547
freemium.

659
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:15,729
We're still learning quite a bit, but what we're really excited about is that we do get the chance to bring them back regularly

660
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:24,891
and give them these small snippets of a story, and so you might find a chapter that you like, you might find a story that doesn't really resonate with you.

661
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:30,332
What we do know is that players are very, very focused on a specific genre.

662
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:37,154
So you want to have a nice kind of smattering of different genres available,

663
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:41,175
otherwise, you know, players aren't going to have anything to do, essentially.

664
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:48,017
But, you know, replayability can definitely keep them in a specific story that they like a lot.

665
00:36:48,657 --> 00:36:53,079
And, you know, everybody will kind of find their favorite, and they might come back to it time and time again.

666
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:54,400
It's like a security blanket.

667
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,383
So we try to make something that might resonate, even if it resonates with a small group of people, then it's done its job.

668
00:37:03,623 --> 00:37:07,585
We also, you know, kind of make it matter a little bit by putting some dead ends in there.

669
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:12,907
You know, a lot of people come up to me and tell me how many times they've killed Taylor in the original Lifeline games.

670
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:17,928
Um, you know, and it's kind of a fun little stat and a way to interact with it that's

671
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:18,748
personal to you.

672
00:37:19,248 --> 00:37:20,388
It's your own personal journey.

673
00:37:20,748 --> 00:37:26,229
Um, so, you know, we're just trying to take what we knew worked for a larger scale game

674
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:29,510
and we're trying to drive it down into a smaller scale.

675
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:35,211
And um, those story bumps I mentioned earlier are a huge tool that you can use to make sure

676
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:39,132
that each one of your chapters is kind of hitting those points that you want it to.

677
00:37:39,492 --> 00:37:42,073
Um, and then we kind of do a cliffhanger bottleneck.

678
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,217
at the end of each of our chapters to just give a little bit of a,

679
00:37:46,717 --> 00:37:49,800
uh, don't you want to come back next time and see what happens next?

680
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,064
So it doesn't hurt us if our players do play all the way to the end. We definitely

681
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:57,987
wouldn't complain, I think, either on the freemium or the premium side, but,

682
00:37:58,328 --> 00:38:02,131
um, you know, uh, just try and have content that

683
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:06,215
they can have choices in multiple genres that they can choose

684
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:08,597
from if they don't resonate with something you're writing.

685
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:15,598
Yeah, Cass, I know you sort of mentioned earlier that you like how accessible Freemium makes things,

686
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:21,189
and I didn't know if you could talk a bit more about that and just how you guys sort of make the most of that area that you're working in.

687
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:26,578
Yeah, um, I think freemium, it obviously, and I know especially in this audience, it has like

688
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:30,761
its little claws you have to be careful of, um, but I've loved with freemium just the audience

689
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:36,724
that we're able to reach. Um, I, my 13 year old niece now loves interactive fiction. She would

690
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:39,585
never have loved interactive fiction if there weren't freemium games on the market. She

691
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:43,927
wouldn't have known how to pick up a RemPi game, she wouldn't have known how to download

692
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:48,069
something from the Steam store, just cause she didn't, her peers weren't in those areas, she

693
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:51,111
didn't, people weren't engaging that, that wasn't the niece she was in in school.

694
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:55,976
So something I've loved about Freemium is the accessibility that it gives this industry.

695
00:38:56,796 --> 00:39:01,902
It also does make a lot of money, which allows us to pay a lot of writers and allows us to

696
00:39:01,982 --> 00:39:03,303
get a lot of great people.

697
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:07,665
support for the writing they're doing. We welcome writers to be working on side projects,

698
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:12,590
that's awesome. Um, and so just the ability to keep feeding this industry, to keep exploring

699
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,073
it, to keep understanding how we do it. I also think freemium right now is literally

700
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:21,138
freemium storytelling on mobile is at level one. Um, essentially it started taking off

701
00:39:21,178 --> 00:39:23,960
four years ago when episode launched and that was just...

702
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:30,243
v1, I'm excited to see what the next version is. I don't think it's necessarily exactly how it

703
00:39:30,263 --> 00:39:33,984
looks right now. Um, so I think this idea of like that you can reach a whole new audience with

704
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:39,986
freemium, um, this idea that they can play kind of no handcuffs on, uh, they can just come in and

705
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:44,187
dabble and see what it's like, um, and how successful it's taking off and how big it's

706
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,708
making this industry, um, makes me pretty excited.

707
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:50,532
Um, the major thing you do have to think about that I think a lot of us have probably gotten

708
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:56,218
wrong, I'll own that we have it wrong occasionally as well, is that freemium means you really

709
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:59,781
have to make them want to pay for it, uh, because they don't have to.

710
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:04,747
This isn't something where they're spending $10 and then giving you that $10 to essentially

711
00:40:04,787 --> 00:40:05,988
go along on this journey with you.

712
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:11,972
they'll leave whenever they want to. Um, I think a lot of games, uh, make that mistake where

713
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:16,035
they're like, cool, we assume that you're enjoying this, pay us $10, pay us $10, pay us $10 now.

714
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:21,379
You need $10 to pass this thing. And so it's balancing that line of making sure that they are

715
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,482
loving your story enough to want to pay for it and they don't feel bad if they don't pay for it.

716
00:40:26,522 --> 00:40:30,965
They still have a really great experience while you're allowing them to essentially have an

717
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:35,588
even greater experience through paying. Um, and that's a really tough line.

718
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:40,651
that I'm also just excited to see more people start bending and playing with and understanding

719
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:44,254
how can I essentially, because all of us essentially are, well not all of us, some of you are indie

720
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:48,436
which is great, I love that you have the ability to release your games entirely for free, but

721
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:52,579
many of us are in some way asking players for money, be it money up front or money while

722
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,502
playing and so just continuing to explore how we do that in a way that feels good, that

723
00:40:56,522 --> 00:41:00,905
leaves players feeling satisfied, that leaves them really happy with our experiences, that's

724
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:04,207
I guess why I'm excited about Freemium and I would love to see more interactive fiction

725
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:04,967
people kind of.

726
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:09,028
Dabbling in that space. Yeah, and is that changed your mind? Are you know?

727
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:14,970
Okay, I'm two sides of a coin. Yeah. I mean, yeah, they're very much. I love your games. Thank you

728
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,491
They're very much different. I love your games, too

729
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:22,792
they're very much different camps, but I I

730
00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:26,093
mean the complaints that a premium developer has against freemium

731
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:30,674
game design, you know, they're fairly straightforward, they're fairly obvious, they're not controversial.

732
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:36,716
You are designing with the pay point in mind the whole time. It obviously limits the kind

733
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:42,638
of experiences you can create, not in a, you know, drastic way necessarily, but, well,

734
00:41:42,718 --> 00:41:46,679
I don't mean, not necessarily in a good way or a bad way, but rather necessarily in a

735
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,080
drastic way. Like, there are certain games you just can't make in freemium because you

736
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,781
can't get the monetization right, so you just don't make them. Well, okay, so it's a slightly

737
00:41:53,821 --> 00:41:55,761
limited space in that respect. Um...

738
00:41:56,802 --> 00:42:05,387
I think the thing that I love about the premium market is also the thing that makes me incredibly

739
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:07,408
jealous of the freemium market though.

740
00:42:07,768 --> 00:42:11,931
To run a freemium system you need a lot of people paying a lot of attention to the monetization

741
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:12,631
all the time.

742
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:15,713
You need to be thinking about how to get your game in front of users all the time.

743
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,655
It is a service industry so you need to be providing an active service the whole time.

744
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:25,920
The general story of indies who try freemium is that they fail utterly because they don't realize that they need to be doing this.

745
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,723
They assume that they can release a game for free and the users will just find them, which of course they don't.

746
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:39,310
And they get completely demolished by the industrial scale freemium developers who have the time, the effort, the people and the resources to...

747
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:46,472
divert all of the attention towards their own products and keep people there. Remember, Freemium is a system that relies on capturing people,

748
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:49,232
which means they're not floating around in the marketplace for anyone else to collect.

749
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:54,753
So as an indie developer, Freemium is essentially closed to us. And I don't mind that,

750
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,814
particularly, but I am jealous of

751
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:02,475
the amount of money that it makes and the amount of writers that it allows you to support and the amount of production value that

752
00:43:02,495 --> 00:43:04,375
it allows you to support. That would be a wonderful thing.

753
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:09,138
but I know that it's a bit of a poisoned chalice,

754
00:43:09,278 --> 00:43:12,219
or at least it's a nice looking flower

755
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,860
with a huge root system below it, right?

756
00:43:16,882 --> 00:43:21,424
And anyway, what we do is we create.

757
00:43:22,606 --> 00:43:22,686
to

758
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,227
the table.

759
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:47,896
and when we release Heaven's Vault there will be one game like Heaven's Vault.

760
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:50,279
And there is sort of a few games that are like Sorcery,

761
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,761
and in a sense I think that's why Sorcery didn't do quite as well,

762
00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:53,702
is that people look at it and go,

763
00:43:53,722 --> 00:43:54,703
oh, I've played that before.

764
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:56,925
The reality is, actually you really haven't.

765
00:43:57,045 --> 00:43:59,328
There is no game like Sorcery particularly either,

766
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:01,930
but it's more subtle why it's different.

767
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:07,500
And I think what I love about premium is that you can produce completely unique games with

768
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,301
beginning, middle and end.

769
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:10,404
They're like nothing else and then go away and make another one.

770
00:44:10,444 --> 00:44:14,210
And so long as you don't employ too many people or take too long to do it, that's perfectly

771
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,716
financially viable and it lets us do all the experimentation we want.

772
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:21,417
it just means that we're a bit lonely because there's only eight of us in a room.

773
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:26,398
And like it would be lovely if I had a writer's room of 20 people, but as far as I see that,

774
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:30,799
I see that as a problem with the audience. Like you guys need to just be more interested

775
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:35,420
and interested in interactive fiction. We're doing the best we can, where are you? So I would

776
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,381
like to thrust all of that responsibility onto you lot and take none of it myself,

777
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:41,822
and that's my strategy for dealing with it.

778
00:44:41,902 --> 00:44:44,885
I think there's something fun too about like freemium can help that, it's like, I love

779
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:48,890
that I can now send my 13 year old niece to Ingle Games and be like, look, now you know

780
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,491
what this is.

781
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:50,793
Go play it.

782
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:51,594
Right.

783
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:54,737
Maybe what we need to do is we need to start advertising in your games.

784
00:44:54,918 --> 00:44:55,558
Bored of this?

785
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:56,620
Think it's repetitive?

786
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,621
Come and play an Ingle game.

787
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:57,861
Thank you.

788
00:44:57,881 --> 00:44:57,961
Bye.

789
00:44:58,766 --> 00:45:04,913
Well we can do the flip, like if this is a little too hard for you or you're getting a little lost, we're here to entertain you at night while you're trying to fall asleep.

790
00:45:06,275 --> 00:45:11,501
It is a terrible shame that we don't get the audience draw that a freemium product can have.

791
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:14,024
I did a talk at a high school in Cambridge the other week.

792
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:17,847
and they've had a copy of 80 Days in their library for three weeks, and I started off saying,

793
00:45:18,108 --> 00:45:22,131
you know, okay, so, show of hands if you've played 80 Days. Not a single hand went up,

794
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:23,392
but one 10-year-old said,

795
00:45:23,812 --> 00:45:28,276
it costs five pounds, so I didn't play it. And I said, it's in the library.

796
00:45:28,436 --> 00:45:31,578
And they said, oh. And,

797
00:45:31,998 --> 00:45:34,701
like, I can't even

798
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:38,203
get them to play the game when it is free, because it was in another room.

799
00:45:40,645 --> 00:45:43,627
And so the amount of friction there is really quite high.

800
00:45:44,428 --> 00:45:45,549
And these are kids who are interested.

801
00:45:45,729 --> 00:45:47,090
They're in the coding club or whatever.

802
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,771
So I would love to get more people playing the games, but

803
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,833
somehow I don't think going free is the

804
00:45:51,853 --> 00:45:52,673
solution for us for that.

805
00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:57,276
I would like to argue the point though that it is a lot about timing.

806
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:02,517
The reason that our original Lifeline was successful had a lot to do with the fact that

807
00:46:02,717 --> 00:46:08,658
we saw that Apple Watch was launching and we were, you know, we saw that we had a story

808
00:46:08,758 --> 00:46:10,598
that basically fit that format.

809
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:15,259
It was small, very bite-sized, it was a conversation, it was something you could play on the go

810
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:20,180
and so we converted it and as a result we did get featuring from Apple because we were

811
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,560
on one of their products that they were really excited about.

812
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:28,824
I would say that, you know, Inkle came along in what I would say the heyday of the App

813
00:46:28,844 --> 00:46:29,185
Store.

814
00:46:29,645 --> 00:46:32,767
There were a lot less devs out there, a lot less noise.

815
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:38,571
And so it allowed some really great products because, you know, Inkle is, you know, I love

816
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:38,991
Sorcery.

817
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:39,692
I'm a huge fan.

818
00:46:40,212 --> 00:46:46,596
And the fact that it was in the right time where it could be seen and it could be featured

819
00:46:46,676 --> 00:46:49,939
from Apple because their editorial team would see it, that was huge.

820
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:51,940
And that probably is a big part of the success.

821
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,463
Now we've kind of shifted over to this free to play side of things, but I kind of want

822
00:46:57,483 --> 00:47:02,945
to issue a life raft to all of you guys out there who might be authors who are interested

823
00:47:02,985 --> 00:47:10,269
in this, is the fact that now it's not, it's okay to work with a publisher.

824
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:14,851
It's okay to work with somebody who can do all of the stuff that you might not have the

825
00:47:14,891 --> 00:47:15,751
resources for.

826
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:21,835
Um, Freemium and Free-to-Play both do take large development teams, they take a lot of

827
00:47:21,915 --> 00:47:24,416
up-front work, and they do take deep pockets.

828
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:30,219
And so, if we can think about that, and if, you know, you think you've got a story that

829
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,462
fits Episode or Lifeline or another platform that's out there, because we're not the only

830
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:35,002
ones either.

831
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:35,802
Uh,

832
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,824
just get it in front of them and kind of bite the bullet.

833
00:47:38,884 --> 00:47:41,044
Because once you get it out there first,

834
00:47:41,464 --> 00:47:44,726
once you're a published author, then you can say,

835
00:47:44,766 --> 00:47:47,386
I've done it once, I've learned some lessons,

836
00:47:47,747 --> 00:47:49,927
and maybe even you made some good connections,

837
00:47:50,007 --> 00:47:52,668
and that will definitely help you out

838
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:53,308
at the end of the day.

839
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,402
Cool, well, I wanted to leave 10 minutes for questions,

840
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,782
so we'll probably wrap up there.

841
00:47:59,862 --> 00:48:01,804
So if you've got anything to ask the panel at all,

842
00:48:01,864 --> 00:48:03,024
please use the microphones,

843
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:04,745
what their favorite color is,

844
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:07,307
where you can get in touch with them

845
00:48:07,327 --> 00:48:08,147
to send those pictures

846
00:48:08,187 --> 00:48:09,668
that you probably already started working on,

847
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:12,110
anything like that, please just come up.

848
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,551
If not, I'll make them talk about

849
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:15,932
all sorts of terrible things.

850
00:48:20,255 --> 00:48:20,995
Don't be shy.

851
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:25,176
So I've got a question. This is sort of a general question.

852
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:31,439
So where I come from, there are like TV writers and, you know,

853
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:36,442
TV writers work with TV production groups in, you know,

854
00:48:36,802 --> 00:48:39,304
or theater writers with theater production groups.

855
00:48:39,704 --> 00:48:40,364
But there are no...

856
00:48:41,325 --> 00:48:47,793
establish rules or ideas or concepts about how video game writers or narrative writers

857
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:53,340
can work with, you know, video game companies or studios? And how do you propose that maybe,

858
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:59,647
you know, how do we improve that in our own country, in our own industry about that?

859
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:08,607
I mean, so the question was about how to improve the kind of the access of video game writers

860
00:49:08,627 --> 00:49:09,108
to video game companies.

861
00:49:09,128 --> 00:49:13,692
Yeah, because what you can describe is that writers can pitch to you and you can, you

862
00:49:13,872 --> 00:49:16,515
know, work with them project by project.

863
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:23,521
But in where I come from, I come from Taiwan basically, but you know, a lot of...

864
00:49:24,102 --> 00:49:30,744
Video games are made there, you know, they don't have this relationship with a group of writers or the writer industry, you know

865
00:49:30,764 --> 00:49:31,645
Yeah, I think

866
00:49:32,505 --> 00:49:38,407
Video game writing has always been quite difficult to get into because there hasn't been much space

867
00:49:39,368 --> 00:49:45,470
And when space is limited generally speaking the the walls and the doors are very closed and the companies work with the people that they like

868
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,471
They don't they're not interested in seeing anyone else

869
00:49:47,671 --> 00:49:50,272
they don't want to make opportunities because they haven't got any and

870
00:49:50,492 --> 00:49:55,494
I think, actually, to be fair, the work that you guys are doing in producing spaces that

871
00:49:55,534 --> 00:50:00,015
writers can come in and just do the writing, and also Choice of Games, who do a lot of

872
00:50:00,055 --> 00:50:04,076
interactive fiction on mobile that's more premium, but still very much a published,

873
00:50:04,856 --> 00:50:09,037
and that's incredible work, and it's creating great opportunities for writers out there

874
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:12,298
and building a genre, and it's really important and really successful, but I don't think it's

875
00:50:12,378 --> 00:50:13,719
anything that a writer can do.

876
00:50:13,899 --> 00:50:17,040
It doesn't matter how good a writer is if there is no space for them.

877
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,161
If you're a great playwright but there are no theatres, there's nothing you can do about that.

878
00:50:21,642 --> 00:50:28,745
You have to wait for someone to come along and prize open that opportunity for you.

879
00:50:30,386 --> 00:50:34,748
And I feel that quite strongly because for myself I wrote a lot of interactive fiction when I was in my twenties and in my teens.

880
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:38,969
and in the end, the only way I could get any successful career out of it

881
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:41,691
was to invent an entire company, with my friend here,

882
00:50:42,511 --> 00:50:43,811
in order to publish myself,

883
00:50:44,112 --> 00:50:47,113
which I still resent the fact that no one just gave me a job

884
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:48,533
because I didn't want to have to do anything.

885
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:53,055
So if we can pay that forward to anyone, that's lovely,

886
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:56,557
but it won't make up for my resentment of that.

887
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:57,877
So I feel it. I feel you.

888
00:50:57,897 --> 00:50:59,198
Thank you very much.

889
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:01,679
Take one from the right-hand side.

890
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:04,626
Hi, Julius Harper from the Walt Disney Company.

891
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:08,268
I had a question about an earlier part of the conversation

892
00:51:08,288 --> 00:51:11,930
where you guys were talking about new writers kind

893
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,150
of breaking into the space.

894
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:17,473
And you specifically highlighted always be writing

895
00:51:17,933 --> 00:51:19,594
and putting out pieces of writing

896
00:51:19,614 --> 00:51:23,116
that have what you described as meaningful choices as opposed

897
00:51:23,136 --> 00:51:24,516
to kind of the arbitrary choice.

898
00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:27,258
I just wanted to kind of dive into that a little bit more

899
00:51:27,338 --> 00:51:27,718
and ask.

900
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:34,532
I guess for you three, what were the most meaningful choices that you've had to make

901
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,437
within an interactive story?

902
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:44,310
I always, let's see, this is a cop-out answer, it's not the most meaningful choice, but the

903
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:49,013
one that I use a lot in interviews because I think it's interesting is Telltale in The

904
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:54,857
Wolf Among Us had an interesting choice where you could ask Snow White to keep the information

905
00:51:54,897 --> 00:51:58,740
she had secret or be okay with her sharing it with the sheriff.

906
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:02,983
This is an interesting example because it's actually not meaningful at all, but this is

907
00:52:03,003 --> 00:52:03,883
why I think it's interesting.

908
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:06,445
She will tell the sheriff no matter what because that is her character.

909
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,886
She is a good person.

910
00:52:08,846 --> 00:52:13,849
But they wrote the entire rest of the season, like changing your relationship with Snow

911
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:17,311
White and how much you trusted her and how much she trusted you based on the choice you

912
00:52:17,331 --> 00:52:20,573
made in that moment, which I thought was really smart because I'm thinking about, again, as

913
00:52:20,593 --> 00:52:20,613
a...

914
00:52:21,434 --> 00:52:25,596
all of us are thinking about scope. And like you can't always make every single thing in the world

915
00:52:25,636 --> 00:52:29,839
go in a million different branches, but to watch a company find a way to say like, look, we really

916
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:33,881
had to write a story where the sheriff found this out, we, we had to, we couldn't get this story

917
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:39,624
out without creating massive branching where he didn't. But we can write a thing that feels

918
00:52:40,064 --> 00:52:45,027
really, really meaningful. The second that was actually pretty impactful was, uh, mild spoilers

919
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:47,749
for Life is Strange, the suicide moment. Um...

920
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:52,854
It continues to stick with me after having done it, and I continue to shake up a little

921
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:53,675
bit when I get there.

922
00:52:54,396 --> 00:52:57,039
That's when Word actually did change the story, and it changed the story and just really,

923
00:52:57,459 --> 00:53:01,023
they planted all these seeds for it, and they built the whole episode around getting to

924
00:53:01,063 --> 00:53:07,430
that choice, which is just an incredibly powerful way to treat one choice really, really sacredly.

925
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,472
I thought they did a really nice job of that.

926
00:53:10,459 --> 00:53:15,382
Yeah, for me, the types of choices that really resonate are kind of on that D&D scale of

927
00:53:15,482 --> 00:53:18,965
lawful good, lawful neutral, chaotic, all that.

928
00:53:19,845 --> 00:53:24,609
And so like Mass Effect is not a mobile game, but it's definitely a good system.

929
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:28,891
And you know, you kind of see that in also some of the Telltale games as well.

930
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:36,457
I really like the fact that I can see my interactions changing based on does the story perceive

931
00:53:36,497 --> 00:53:38,538
me to be evil, good, or neutral?

932
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:38,958
And

933
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:45,165
It's really great that you can get this nice spectrum of kind of the differences in a story

934
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:48,869
and the nuances can change so much to change your experience.

935
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,881
Yeah, I think I would echo what both of you said, actually,

936
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:53,842
especially what Cass said.

937
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:59,147
That I have no interest in this concept of meaningful choices

938
00:53:59,187 --> 00:54:01,389
that you hear bandied around a lot, because to me it speaks

939
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:05,532
to the computer programmer in our players who wants to be

940
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:07,794
in charge, and wants to be in control, and wants to operate

941
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:10,036
the levers that run the trains, and wants to understand how

942
00:54:10,056 --> 00:54:12,058
many branches there were in the game, and what percentage of

943
00:54:12,098 --> 00:54:12,919
people went which way.

944
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:14,560
And I don't care about any of that.

945
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,781
That is all so wrongheaded.

946
00:54:16,262 --> 00:54:20,047
that actually what matters is that they have an interesting choice

947
00:54:20,147 --> 00:54:22,950
because otherwise they are going to do something else with their time

948
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,132
and you can't fault them for it.

949
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:28,277
And when you are in a story and you are asking what is interesting,

950
00:54:28,317 --> 00:54:29,779
the answer is always the same.

951
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:31,841
It is characters and human beings.

952
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,583
That's all we actually care about.

953
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:39,709
So as long as my choice allows me to empathize with a character in this game or affect the character in this game,

954
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:45,255
if I can be kind to someone or I can be snarky to someone, I will enjoy that choice and be interested.

955
00:54:45,295 --> 00:54:48,718
And if that person responds to me in a believable and passionate and humane way,

956
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:50,880
I will fall in love with them just a little bit.

957
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:55,225
And if you do that to a person three times in a row, they will remember your game forever.

958
00:54:55,245 --> 00:54:57,187
And there's no meaning to any of that.

959
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:01,968
And almost all the good choices in 80 Days don't make the damnedest bit of difference to anything

960
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:05,889
because it's really just whether you're kind to Fogg about the fact that he's a bit of a dimwit

961
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:07,449
or whether you're annoyed with him.

962
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:11,730
But those are fascinating choices because we like that character, because we like human beings.

963
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,671
And somehow when we start to program things, everyone forgets about the human beings in the room,

964
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,172
apart from the writers, which is why writers need to be working in video games,

965
00:55:19,472 --> 00:55:21,013
because they stick their little hands up and say,

966
00:55:21,293 --> 00:55:27,374
hang on, we're people. The computer is just an interface for one person to talk to another.

967
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:32,458
I find this really bizarre, and I get really passionate about this, because everybody talks

968
00:55:32,478 --> 00:55:33,960
to everybody on phones, right?

969
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,801
You know a telephone?

970
00:55:34,841 --> 00:55:38,204
When you talk to a telephone, it's a little metal box that pretends to have the voice

971
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:38,744
of your wife.

972
00:55:38,804 --> 00:55:42,868
You are not actually talking to your wife, you are talking to a plastic box that is simulating

973
00:55:42,908 --> 00:55:43,328
your wife.

974
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:45,430
But that isn't how you think about it.

975
00:55:46,271 --> 00:55:47,572
Because you're talking to a human.

976
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:51,553
So why in a computer game do we talk to the binary choices and the bits of code?

977
00:55:51,673 --> 00:55:53,614
Why are we not talking to the pretend human?

978
00:55:53,634 --> 00:55:57,396
I don't know what's wrong with us, but there's something wrong with us and we need to fix it.

979
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:58,576
So, people.

980
00:55:59,717 --> 00:56:00,017
Thank you.

981
00:56:03,214 --> 00:56:08,096
I just wanted to ask, how do you tackle branching narratives?

982
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:14,979
Like, do you start from a linear point of view and then break off from that and then go back to the main thing?

983
00:56:15,479 --> 00:56:20,801
Do you have, like, for multiple endings, like I know some of the Telltale games,

984
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:25,683
they have multiple endings. How do you go about tackling that?

985
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,891
Yeah, I think we all kind of use different methods for this.

986
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,593
But for Lifeline specifically, we definitely

987
00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:34,374
have the one main path.

988
00:56:35,415 --> 00:56:37,396
And historically, that's kind of how we've always done it.

989
00:56:38,136 --> 00:56:39,938
And then we branch off of that main path.

990
00:56:40,118 --> 00:56:44,140
But we want to make sure that we give a variety of endings that

991
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,720
are possible.

992
00:56:44,841 --> 00:56:48,963
And so then that one main path becomes three main.

993
00:56:49,003 --> 00:56:50,884
There's a large branch off of that,

994
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:53,446
and then a third large branch off of that main tree.

995
00:56:54,747 --> 00:56:57,849
And then basically when we're moving over to episodic,

996
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:00,792
we kind of chunk that up into pieces of a tree.

997
00:57:02,193 --> 00:57:04,855
So, you know, having three endings

998
00:57:05,076 --> 00:57:06,537
tends to work really well for us

999
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:09,259
because you can have what we call

1000
00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:11,481
the good, the better, and the best ending.

1001
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,844
The good ending might have some

1002
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:16,866
negative connotations to it.

1003
00:57:16,986 --> 00:57:21,169
It might have some outcomes that maybe, you know,

1004
00:57:21,389 --> 00:57:21,890
you weren't

1005
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:25,174
expecting, but at least it fulfills the story.

1006
00:57:25,194 --> 00:57:32,444
But then you can also one-up it and continue to build on that for different experiences.

1007
00:57:33,692 --> 00:57:35,774
We essentially do an emotion map that's linear.

1008
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:38,335
We track a linear emotional experience of the player,

1009
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:40,496
but then we brainstorm what are different things

1010
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:42,117
at each emotional moment that could get them

1011
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:43,078
into that emotional arc.

1012
00:57:43,558 --> 00:57:45,600
So most of our players will emotionally follow

1013
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,860
the same line, that's our goal,

1014
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:48,581
but we'll try and pitch like, well,

1015
00:57:48,621 --> 00:57:50,543
why might they be really excited at that moment?

1016
00:57:50,563 --> 00:57:51,823
Maybe this, maybe that, maybe the other thing,

1017
00:57:51,943 --> 00:57:54,045
and then we'll draw the lines between those things.

1018
00:57:54,425 --> 00:57:56,046
The best story was one where we can actually do this

1019
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:57,987
with the lines, that gets really hard,

1020
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,688
and I don't promise that we do that very often.

1021
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:01,309
That does sound really cool, by the way.

1022
00:58:03,145 --> 00:58:04,746
I don't know how to answer that question.

1023
00:58:04,806 --> 00:58:06,486
It's really, really, really complicated,

1024
00:58:06,606 --> 00:58:08,567
and it totally depends on the context of what you're doing.

1025
00:58:09,368 --> 00:58:12,929
I think in general, the only glib answer I can give

1026
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:15,391
is you have to play test and ask yourself

1027
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:18,372
at any given moment, am I being offered opportunities

1028
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:18,952
that make sense?

1029
00:58:19,212 --> 00:58:21,573
Am I being offered opportunities that are all interesting?

1030
00:58:21,593 --> 00:58:24,095
And is there something glaringly obvious

1031
00:58:24,135 --> 00:58:25,335
that I should be allowed to do here

1032
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,436
that I'm not being allowed to do?

1033
00:58:27,636 --> 00:58:28,717
Which doesn't mean you should give the player

1034
00:58:28,737 --> 00:58:30,057
complete freedom, but it does mean

1035
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:31,838
that you should think really carefully

1036
00:58:32,979 --> 00:58:35,602
Are you trying to maximize the number of times when the player goes?

1037
00:58:35,622 --> 00:58:40,947
Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to do and I can do it and see what happens because if they're predicting the choices

1038
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:44,490
Then it starts to feel like a mechanical game rather than an arbitrary one

1039
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:50,196
And that's that's this that's the sweet stuff and then you just cope with that and the branching for me

1040
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:54,600
It's very much a tool for coping with giving the player freedom. Not a thing to achieve in its own, right?

1041
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,143
I don't really care how many endings there are I care about

1042
00:58:57,623 --> 00:58:59,304
are the moments satisfactory.

1043
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:03,768
But I'm quite jealous of you guys for having more clearly defined answers and patterns,

1044
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:04,509
because that's quite cool.

1045
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:07,091
I mean, that's coming from a mind of make a bazillion of them.

1046
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:07,491
Yeah.

1047
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:10,794
When you have to work with multiple people, you got to give them the rules.

1048
00:59:10,874 --> 00:59:11,874
Really lock it.

1049
00:59:11,974 --> 00:59:12,495
Yeah, yeah.

1050
00:59:12,535 --> 00:59:13,536
No, I like that.

1051
00:59:13,556 --> 00:59:14,516
Here's your sandbags.

1052
00:59:14,557 --> 00:59:14,957
Oh, sorry.

1053
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:18,600
I'm afraid we're going to have to wrap it up because that is the end and we will get

1054
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,020
kicked out.

1055
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:23,243
There will be, these guys I think will probably hang out in the wrap out room for a little

1056
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,005
bit if you do have stuff you want to ask them.

1057
00:59:25,085 --> 00:59:27,827
So sorry if we didn't get to your question but they'll be there.

1058
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:28,307
I have something to say.

1059
00:59:28,327 --> 00:59:28,427
Sorry.

1060
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:29,468
You spoke about Disruptor Beam's writing team.

1061
00:59:29,488 --> 00:59:30,069
I would like to speak on the...

1062
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:30,369
I'm sorry.

1063
00:59:30,389 --> 00:59:30,909
I have something to say.

1064
00:59:30,929 --> 00:59:31,630
I have something to say.

1065
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:35,193
We spoke about Disruptor Beam's writing team, I would like to speak on the...

1066
00:59:35,945 --> 00:59:38,928
team is a member of the team that worked on Game of Thrones.

1067
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:43,471
It's unfair to characterize all of us as being somehow not

1068
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:45,132
capable of writing for mobile.

1069
00:59:45,452 --> 00:59:47,934
We did an excellent job, and we shipped the game,

1070
00:59:47,954 --> 00:59:49,956
which Jonathan Myers did not.

1071
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:52,758
I would like to let all of you know that we

1072
00:59:52,778 --> 00:59:55,280
shipped a wonderful game, and that every member of that team

1073
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,323
is amazing, we are diverse, and we are fantastic writers.

1074
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:01,965
So please don't take away from this panel that

1075
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:06,408
that writing team was in any way not capable because we absolutely were and I

1076
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:09,650
appreciate that you wanted to give an example but we are not a good example of

1077
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,892
that so I apologize but that needed to be said.

1078
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:15,295
Thank you very much. No, I really appreciate the correction. It's just an anecdote that I heard.

1079
01:00:15,655 --> 01:00:18,457
I don't know the details of it. I didn't mean to upset anybody.
