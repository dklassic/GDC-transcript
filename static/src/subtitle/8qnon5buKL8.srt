1
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:06,119
All right.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,201
Cool.

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:11,984
Well, I've got to say, first of all, that I'm really stressed

4
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,086
because this is not really what I was expecting.

5
00:00:14,326 --> 00:00:16,087
I was expecting a much smaller crowd.

6
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,272
Thank you, thank you.

7
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:28,678
Hello, my name is Joseph Snabria,

8
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,400
and I'm an art director and a concept illustrator working

9
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:32,561
in the entertainment industry.

10
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,679
And for the past 23 years, I've been fortunate to have worked

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,380
at some great studios throughout my career,

12
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:42,483
developing some epic intellectual properties.

13
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:44,825
And in recent years, I've begun freelancing,

14
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:47,206
expanding my work into film, commercials,

15
00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:48,687
and a variety of projects.

16
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:54,331
Thank you for coming to my talk, which is The Passion Project,

17
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:57,774
a Catalyst to Creativity and a Cure for the Stagnant.

18
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:02,177
It's a talk about how my passion project has impacted my work.

19
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:09,505
and why having a passion project can be one of the best things for an artist looking to

20
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:09,805
grow.

21
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:20,508
So when I was approached to speak at GDC, I asked, what would they be interested in me

22
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:21,148
talking about?

23
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:26,269
So the response was, maybe I could talk about my experience working as a freelancer.

24
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:28,989
And I thought, sure, I could probably talk about freelancing.

25
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:31,730
But most of the time...

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,211
folks are interested in how I got there.

27
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,454
So I thought I would focus on those opportunities,

28
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:38,836
on how those opportunities came to be,

29
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:42,260
and talk about what I did to expand my work to other fields.

30
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,683
Now, this is a conversation I've had numerous times

31
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:47,065
over the years with artists.

32
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:49,965
usually who are trying to break in,

33
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:52,007
but there's also artists who have been

34
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:53,408
in the industry for a while

35
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:54,929
and have a few years of experience,

36
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,372
but they're frustrated with their current situation.

37
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:59,133
They either wanna go into leadership,

38
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:01,235
perhaps work on another type of game,

39
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:05,458
or they just kinda feel like they've been casted in a way.

40
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,903
So I thought this would be a great forum to cover this subject and talk about how one

41
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,686
passion project led to a number of great opportunities.

42
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:25,792
And so thinking about how things have gone for me in the past, I realized that most of

43
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:29,996
my achievements and gains over the year, they stem from a personal interest in the work

44
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,418
that I put into pursuing those passions on my own time.

45
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:36,725
And over the years, I've noticed this has also been the case for a few artists.

46
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:40,367
Like I've met artists at DreamWorks, a story artist,

47
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:43,889
and he had an interview with DreamWorks,

48
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,591
and really what got him the job was his personal comic book

49
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:49,372
that he had been working on.

50
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:52,573
It's not really what he was being hired for.

51
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:56,246
but they were impressed by the passion and what drove them.

52
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:58,348
And essentially, that's what people are looking for.

53
00:02:58,728 --> 00:02:59,689
You want passionate folks.

54
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:01,910
You're not looking for folks who can do a job.

55
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,132
And I think that's one thing that a lot of students miss.

56
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,474
Or folks who are frustrated with their situation,

57
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:08,275
they say to themselves, well, I could be doing that.

58
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:10,757
Well, that's not really the point.

59
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:12,518
The point is, are you passionate about it?

60
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:17,213
So this talk is not just about passion project,

61
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:19,675
it's really about how I as an artist adapted

62
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:21,356
and rediscovered passion,

63
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:24,678
and how that passion led to unexpected projects,

64
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,981
and connected me to a new audience, like you guys.

65
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:33,885
And also made me a better and more effective visual artist.

66
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:38,688
For me, I was always working on some personal art,

67
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:40,529
but the work I put into it was sporadic,

68
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:42,290
and the results were kind of lackluster.

69
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:46,096
Not having any structure and not really clear

70
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:48,378
on what I was really interested in or passionate about,

71
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,019
it was difficult to really make any progress

72
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:50,980
on developing skills.

73
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:53,882
A little background information.

74
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,545
Over the years, obviously, roles and teams

75
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:58,686
have really changed a lot.

76
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:01,709
So I've done just about everything on the art team.

77
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,732
I started as an animator, then did backgrounds,

78
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,855
then character art, then technical art.

79
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:11,605
and then eventually lead artist and then art director,

80
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:13,806
and then that's when I started doing concept art.

81
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,527
So the concept art is more of a recent thing.

82
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,488
So going back, what I really needed to do

83
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,089
was to change my whole attitude

84
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,129
and approach to personal art.

85
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,431
What I needed to do was just draw what I was inspired by

86
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,452
and focus on what interested me at the moment

87
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:32,192
rather than chasing fads,

88
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:36,193
mechs and all the things that may be hot at the moment.

89
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:40,023
Then I started thinking in terms of a project,

90
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,243
rather than just work.

91
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:44,646
So I can manage it a lot better and create an overall plan.

92
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,028
Ironically, I was really good at organizing big teams

93
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:49,309
and keeping them motivated,

94
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,370
and making sure that we're always making progress,

95
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,352
because these games are very expensive to make.

96
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:57,714
But when it came to my own work, that just didn't happen.

97
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:02,738
So, these two things working together.

98
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:07,068
Well they basically made me a lot more consistent with my efforts.

99
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:13,370
So what I learned was honest hard work done consistently over time, that would be the

100
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,131
thing that would greatly ramp up my skill.

101
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:23,092
It wasn't the tech, sorry I know this is GDC, but it was just consistent work.

102
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:29,174
And I wasn't doing all-nighters, I wasn't just basically pushing myself into the grave,

103
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:30,875
I just tried to be consistent.

104
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:36,079
Now, like most artists, I started sketching when I was a little kid.

105
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:40,346
And I would sketch comic book heroes, space rockets, just everything.

106
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,691
But as I grew up, I found myself sketching less and less.

107
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,350
Now this kind of happens naturally.

108
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,972
As kids, we just do whatever.

109
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:48,792
Nobody cares.

110
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:51,114
And as a result, you're not self-conscious

111
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:51,975
and you don't edit yourself.

112
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:53,436
You're just enthusiastic.

113
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:56,439
But as you grow up, you start to realize,

114
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,499
especially in my experience,

115
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,701
that sketching maybe is not a good thing

116
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:00,262
you should be doing.

117
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:02,003
My dad got really pissed off one day

118
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:05,426
when he found out I had filled up my notebooks

119
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:08,929
with all these sketches of Spider-Man.

120
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,932
And so that kind of like always made me feel like

121
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:14,593
maybe I'm not doing something right here.

122
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:19,895
So it would be years later that that passion for sketching would reignite.

123
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:26,340
Now, I use sketches to help develop and refine ideas.

124
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,781
Oops, sorry.

125
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:36,588
And I would sketch events and record the moments.

126
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:42,772
And then I would start to explore ideas and just have fun filling the pages.

127
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:45,068
basically learning how to improvise.

128
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:48,389
So this image here is one of those Inktober sketches,

129
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,850
just started in one, not in one corner,

130
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,270
but one spot and just kind of built out.

131
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,831
And this kind of happens really

132
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:57,372
with all the hard work that you put into it.

133
00:06:57,732 --> 00:06:58,772
All the studying you're doing,

134
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:01,353
you don't need to have the reference in front of you,

135
00:07:01,573 --> 00:07:04,974
but I've done lots of environment sketches and paintings,

136
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:05,574
and that's what.

137
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:10,090
allows me to improvise, just like a jazz musician, let's say.

138
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,971
They study their scales, they know their instrument inside

139
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:13,231
and out.

140
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:15,952
Once they've got the mechanics down,

141
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:19,093
they're free to just kind of express themselves.

142
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,474
And I think that's the main thing here.

143
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:27,816
And naturally, then I extended my studies

144
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:28,816
to lighting and color.

145
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,697
This is a subject I was really interested in,

146
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,977
but I just never had the opportunity, or I guess

147
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:34,078
made the time to study it.

148
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:40,163
And so I would take any opportunity to practice,

149
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:43,287
and as I improved, so did my passion for sketching.

150
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,449
So this is something I would do like lunchtime.

151
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,794
Because I'd done a few years of painting outdoors,

152
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:52,918
I was comfortable being able to do it in that time frame.

153
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:55,260
And because I was doing it more often.

154
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,116
you get better, you get better, you have more fun.

155
00:07:58,176 --> 00:07:59,197
It's just like a video game, you know,

156
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:01,298
you can't just go straight to level 50

157
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,180
and decide that you're gonna be successful

158
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:07,022
or really be realistic in those expectations.

159
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,603
You have to start small and build up.

160
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,607
Now the project, well that took some time to figure out.

161
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:17,334
And that was until I visited Stuart Engy's bookstore,

162
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:21,498
which is down in Torrance, California, for the first time.

163
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:23,339
Now, for those who aren't familiar,

164
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,401
this is a bookstore that specializes in illustration,

165
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:28,082
imported graphic novels,

166
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:30,444
and collectibles from the animation industry.

167
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:33,286
And one of the things that they carry

168
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:35,548
are the convention sketchbooks.

169
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:37,830
For those who don't know what those are,

170
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,372
these are small, self-published books,

171
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:42,353
usually by the artist,

172
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:44,175
and they're sold at conventions.

173
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:48,196
that would be my passion project.

174
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:51,497
So I made it a goal to make my own sketchbook

175
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:54,538
and sell them at the CTN Animation Expo.

176
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:59,659
This is basically, CTN Animation Expo is kind of like,

177
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:04,841
think of Comic-Con's Artist Alley meets GDC.

178
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,042
But it's mostly feature and television animation

179
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:10,063
and some game studios

180
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,244
and a bunch of artists from around the world.

181
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:17,479
In doing this, I learned a lot.

182
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,163
And yes, I did struggle for a bit, but I made it.

183
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:25,826
I got it done, and I was there for that first year.

184
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:28,689
And I'd made it a goal each year to put one together

185
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:30,290
and show up at CTN.

186
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:34,274
And lo and behold, three years later,

187
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:39,999
Stuart NG swung by my desk, and he picked up volumes two

188
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:40,539
and three.

189
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,580
And so.

190
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:47,091
I made my goal to try and get that work into his bookstore.

191
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:48,953
And so what I learned from that

192
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,655
was having a definitive goal and a product

193
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,497
really helped me fund my efforts

194
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:56,559
and get the most gains out of my time.

195
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:02,725
Now, my early experiences were not always positive

196
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:04,927
like I shared with you before with my dad.

197
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:10,055
And later on, like I said, I drew less and less,

198
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:14,036
and part of that was the frustration of blank pages.

199
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,218
I'm sure this is something that we all can relate with.

200
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,720
And the other thing that kind of really frustrated me

201
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,721
a lot of times was I would just have a poor start.

202
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,261
It's kind of like what I was just saying.

203
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:26,563
It's like, you're not thinking, you're just kind of jumping

204
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:28,083
and you're like, I'm gonna do a crazy sketch.

205
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:30,644
Like, well, it's crazy and nobody gets it.

206
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:34,523
So in general, I didn't really understand

207
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:36,744
how sketchbooks helped the bigger picture.

208
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:41,625
I remember I got, in school, they asked me to carry one,

209
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:42,786
but I never filled it up,

210
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:45,607
and it was just something that I didn't understand.

211
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,268
My thought on the whole art process

212
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:50,168
was that the real work was in the painting,

213
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:53,710
or the 3D rendering, the details, and all that stuff.

214
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,411
That was until I got this book as a present.

215
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:00,612
And it really changed my view of sketchbooks.

216
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:03,834
Now, it's a collection of sketches from Pablo Picasso.

217
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:07,276
And over the 70 years of his career,

218
00:11:07,696 --> 00:11:09,277
he created 174 sketchbooks.

219
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:12,419
And this is a collection of some of those sketches

220
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:12,919
from his book.

221
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,920
Believe it or not, that one in the back there,

222
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,901
I think he did it at like 12 years old or 14 years old.

223
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,522
And you can see in Barcelona, it's

224
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:21,743
insane what he was doing as a teenager.

225
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:26,217
And so what was really striking to, for me,

226
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:27,738
flipping through this book was,

227
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:30,059
it was the first time I really kind of flipped through

228
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,681
basically an artist's lifetime of his work.

229
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:35,223
And a sketchbook is really an intimate view

230
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:36,283
of that person's work.

231
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:39,905
So for the first time, I really realized

232
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:43,768
the impact sketching has over an artist's lifetime.

233
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:50,396
I'm a strong believer that art is a lifelong endeavor.

234
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:52,096
This is not something that happens, you know,

235
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:55,417
a year, a few years in school, and then you're an artist.

236
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:57,118
Like, it's constantly evolving.

237
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,238
And then I saw this movie.

238
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,499
This is a movie about Robert Crumb,

239
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:04,600
and there's a scene where he's lamenting

240
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,620
about which sketchbook is he gonna pick

241
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,701
to trade for a chateau in France.

242
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,565
I was just floored when I saw that because then I saw the value not only artistically

243
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:18,567
but monetarily a sketchbook could have.

244
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:21,931
Now I started to think about sketchbooks in a different way.

245
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:28,598
Now when I'm talking about sketching, in my mind, and this is how I kind of try to approach

246
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:28,698
it.

247
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,210
It's really including drawing from life,

248
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:33,772
doing visual research.

249
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:39,396
This could be like drawing armor or suspension for a vehicle

250
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:42,018
just so that you can build up this knowledge.

251
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,721
It's also the process of ideation,

252
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:48,884
taking an idea and really expanding it as far as possible.

253
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:54,489
If you guys caught the presentation for Horizon,

254
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,058
all the examples that they were showing

255
00:12:58,098 --> 00:12:59,698
where they were just kind of trying to figure out

256
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,339
the exoskeleton, that's a good example of that.

257
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:04,819
So what's the big deal?

258
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,221
Well, I believe that sketching is like muscle building.

259
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:13,642
It's training and being disciplined

260
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,482
that are essential to getting good results.

261
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:18,943
Now, observational sketching is like

262
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:20,183
taking that to a higher level.

263
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:22,504
And I think this is a good example

264
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:25,825
because bodybuilders or folks who train,

265
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,391
They don't train 24 hours, they don't train for 16 hours,

266
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:31,892
they have very specific schedule,

267
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:34,033
but they practice with intensity.

268
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,154
So it's not about time, it's about your focus.

269
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:41,015
So you get faster gains, less time,

270
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:43,837
and really, you don't need much.

271
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,818
You just need a notebook and a pencil, maybe gouache.

272
00:13:51,014 --> 00:13:53,435
And so when I'm talking about observational sketching,

273
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:55,677
it's kind of a blanket term in my mind

274
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:59,340
to plein air painting, which is when you're going outdoors

275
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,461
and you're painting from life.

276
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:05,625
It also includes live drawing and urban sketching,

277
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,307
which is kind of similar to plein air,

278
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:09,128
but it's a little bit more of like everything

279
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,649
that's happening in front of you,

280
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:12,091
like people and all that stuff.

281
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,293
Now, observational sketching

282
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:17,015
is just a really robust exercise

283
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:18,496
where the hand and the eye and the mind

284
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:19,517
are really working together.

285
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:22,999
You're going to observe the scene,

286
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,660
and you're going to be studying it

287
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,721
for an extended amount of time.

288
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,382
And because of that, you're going to learn and catch

289
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:30,383
what a lot of folks fail to notice.

290
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:33,485
The lessons that you're learning out in the field

291
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,167
give your work authenticity and confidence.

292
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:40,610
This is down on Laguna Beach, summer day, done in oil.

293
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,133
And then what you're going to be doing is analyzing.

294
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:49,228
Really trying to understand all the structures and the surfaces,

295
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:52,969
but most importantly, trying to figure out how they all correlate to each other.

296
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,290
And then you're editing.

297
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,051
You're emphasizing some things and omitting when it's appropriate,

298
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:01,191
being selective.

299
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:03,352
I think one of the things I've learned as a painter

300
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:07,173
is that it's more important what you leave out rather than what you put in.

301
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,453
And that's because there's really not much time

302
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:16,354
to render everything that you're trying to convey.

303
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:18,115
So focus.

304
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:23,738
All that really changed my whole mindset to sketching.

305
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:25,698
And it would greatly impact me.

306
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,220
And it would allow me to get comfortable

307
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,640
with the whole creative process

308
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,961
and get into a creative flow.

309
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:34,142
So here's a good example where I'd been painting

310
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:36,283
down on Laguna Beach for maybe two, three years.

311
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:38,204
So I kind of,

312
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:42,056
I'd understand the rock formations and how things looked.

313
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,196
And so now when I go and sketch it,

314
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:46,377
I don't have to study that photo in front of me.

315
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:47,457
I know this already.

316
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,337
And so I would spend maybe like five minutes

317
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:51,918
for each one of those, five, 10 minutes.

318
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:55,218
But I also learned a few other benefits.

319
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:58,859
Most notably, you connect with others.

320
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,619
You're sketching in a public setting,

321
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,139
so you're probably gonna meet lots of folks,

322
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,120
and a few of them are gonna be fellow artists.

323
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm here because probably more,

324
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:11,309
for more reasons because of all this private work that I've been doing, this personal work.

325
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,713
I'll give you another example. So one of the paintings I was doing, Laguna Beach,

326
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,695
on that day it was a cloudy day and the lighting wasn't going to change too much,

327
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:26,218
so I was feeling kind of confident. I wanted to push myself up and do something a little bit

328
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,721
challenging. So I wanted to do a city scene and

329
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,577
I ended up having to paint because of the view.

330
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:36,138
I had to be right on the sidewalk,

331
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:38,500
basically like the boardwalk down Laguna Beach.

332
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,862
Very intimidating to have hundreds of people

333
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,564
just walking by as you're working on a painting.

334
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:48,309
But, ironically, a manager from a gallery

335
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:49,870
was walking by and saw my work,

336
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:52,573
and that's how I ended up getting into a gallery in Laguna.

337
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:56,256
So it's just an example of how, by sharing your work,

338
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:58,318
lots of things can happen.

339
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:00,300
Now,

340
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:05,572
In the studio, I could also initiate collaborations and kickstart discussions.

341
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:11,261
So what I mean by that is lots of times you would walk into conversations where designers

342
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,443
or tech are.

343
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,036
debating or discussing things with artists.

344
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,797
And a lot of times what I would find out

345
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:19,779
is that they're really saying the same thing,

346
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:21,420
but they believe they're saying different things.

347
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:23,482
And the only way you can kind of make sure

348
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:27,145
that they're all on the same page and kind of kill that

349
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:28,887
is to just start sketching.

350
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,689
Sketching something on the whiteboard or on a sketchbook.

351
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:35,772
And so being able to sketch those ideas quickly

352
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,194
and help move the conversation forward,

353
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:40,336
that would turn out to be a valuable skillset

354
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,118
for art directing and visual development.

355
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:48,581
And soon I would discover how other opportunities

356
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,222
would discover me, or I would say,

357
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:54,084
or sorry, I would discover other opportunities,

358
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:55,745
or they would discover me.

359
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,407
And that's all thanks to social media.

360
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,568
It's how it's connected us all,

361
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,850
and by sharing my work, I've made it possible

362
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,250
for other companies to find my work.

363
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:09,032
So just post it.

364
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:10,353
Don't be shy.

365
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:15,096
Then the other thing I realized was,

366
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:19,599
rather than using solicitation tools like mailing lists

367
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,401
or going through LinkedIn, connecting with folks

368
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:23,622
and bugging them for a job,

369
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:25,923
I really just focused on marketing my work,

370
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:28,065
sharing the work on various platforms

371
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:29,806
and posting on a regular basis.

372
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:33,208
And lo and behold, eventually I started getting calls

373
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:37,071
and emails and work inquiries, negotiating rates and terms.

374
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:40,433
Well, that would be much easier in that scenario.

375
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:50,568
And then I started to really learn a lot about my audience,

376
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,008
about my work, and about myself.

377
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,409
So a few things I wanna share with you

378
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:58,589
that I've learned along the way

379
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,590
is that rough sketches equals viewer participation.

380
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,751
So I'm gonna give you an example.

381
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:10,651
First time I was really doing sketches for production

382
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,132
was for Fallout New Vegas.

383
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,019
Prior to that, I'd only really shared sketches

384
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,520
if they were really heavily cleaned up.

385
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,480
And well, one day,

386
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,242
Chris Avalon, he's one of the big designers

387
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:27,922
down at Obsidian, or was there,

388
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:30,503
he was the project director for one of the DLCs

389
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:31,223
that we were working on.

390
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:33,444
And so he drops in my office,

391
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:36,945
and around that time,

392
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:38,866
I used to be really obsessed with perfection.

393
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:40,386
Everything had to be perfect,

394
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,426
and I think a lot of that was just insecurity.

395
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:46,267
And so I was terrified to have him check out my rough sketches.

396
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:47,928
I was not ready to present them.

397
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:51,109
But to my surprise and delight, he

398
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:53,930
didn't wrinkle his brow with frustration and confusion.

399
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,971
Instead, he was excited and gleaming.

400
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,972
And so what I saw was that there was enough structure

401
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:01,493
to the sketches that he could read them,

402
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,274
but a good deal left undefined that he would then

403
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:06,475
project into those blanks.

404
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,376
Just like a Rorschach test or those inkblot tests

405
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:12,157
that psychiatrists use.

406
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:16,716
He saw what he was hoping to see now.

407
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:20,318
And that meant that he was not just a viewer,

408
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:22,640
but he was a participant in the story and the meaning of it.

409
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:27,022
So what I learned was, leaving some things undefined,

410
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:29,204
that can make for a much more interesting image

411
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:29,784
for the viewer.

412
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:37,109
My second lesson is that the concept is the biggest thing,

413
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:38,249
not the design.

414
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:43,755
Great ideas that are cheap,

415
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:45,256
that's what people are looking for.

416
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:47,017
So I'll give you an example.

417
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:49,219
There's this company called The Mill in New York.

418
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,700
They do a lot of commercials.

419
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:52,902
They're a visual effects studio.

420
00:20:53,723 --> 00:20:56,225
And this was something I did for them

421
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,627
for a Nestle Hot Pockets ad.

422
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,748
They needed a wind tunnel

423
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:04,411
that a bunch of college kids constructed themselves.

424
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:08,074
And so what I learned with working the director was,

425
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,016
we created a great relationship.

426
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:13,349
because I could deliver a bunch of ideas real quickly.

427
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,132
And so what I learned right away was that the sketches

428
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:18,714
were his preferred way or their preferred way

429
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:20,835
of finding the right design for a job.

430
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:23,718
A poor design won't be saved by a great render.

431
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:29,762
So it's really important that the idea is solid.

432
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:34,146
Third lesson, narrative.

433
00:21:35,347 --> 00:21:37,428
No surprise that the concepts that I would post

434
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:40,922
that had a narrative component,

435
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:42,123
well they would do a lot better.

436
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:44,125
And I think like this is an example where

437
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:46,487
I can put in little things that aren't

438
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:51,973
that big or complicated and they can pull your eye in more.

439
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:54,555
So the fact that everybody is looking away from the camera

440
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:55,416
except two people.

441
00:21:56,338 --> 00:22:00,281
that kind of creates moments that people can kind of lock into.

442
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:05,003
And so what I'm trying to do is retain your attention as long as possible,

443
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:09,785
and by doing so, I think you're going to be, you're going to remember it for sure,

444
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:12,447
but you're drawing folks in, and that's essentially what we're doing in games.

445
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,108
We don't want people just to kind of, I get it,

446
00:22:14,348 --> 00:22:16,829
you want them to pick up the controller and run around that world.

447
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,993
Now, that effect would get magnified when you put one image next to another.

448
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:24,753
So.

449
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:28,176
Part of my process at some point was just to create

450
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:31,659
random formats or ratios for my panels

451
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,780
because a lot of times I would see that

452
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,443
that would influence or inspire me to do different sketches.

453
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:39,505
Now, none of these sketches relate to each other.

454
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:41,086
They're just all random ideas

455
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,508
that I'm trying to fill in in a couple hours

456
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:46,591
so that I can see if anything in there

457
00:22:47,131 --> 00:22:49,093
is worth pursuing and doing a full render.

458
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:52,536
So before I'm gonna spend a few days

459
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:55,298
working on a high-end illustration,

460
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,885
I want to make sure that the one that I pick

461
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,047
is one of the strongest ones that I can come up at the moment.

462
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,832
Now, like I said before, I've had this conversation

463
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,735
with lots of folks over the years, usually at CTN,

464
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,737
and when they see the work,

465
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,440
I hear a few common things from folks.

466
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:17,381
I'm not talented.

467
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:21,805
Well, the truth is talent is built, it's not inherited.

468
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,812
And others are gonna judge your work differently than you do.

469
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:29,694
So, just allow yourself the time to learn and have fun.

470
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:31,515
I think you will be surprised.

471
00:23:34,577 --> 00:23:36,298
The other one I hear a lot is, I don't have time.

472
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:39,020
Well, truth is, everyone has time.

473
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,922
But we just struggle managing it.

474
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:45,324
Adapt and scope your work so it works with what you have.

475
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:48,966
So, I think someone was mentioning before

476
00:23:48,986 --> 00:23:50,106
that they just try to do like,

477
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:55,146
They were going to do a massive game,

478
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:57,187
and it was just one student who was still in college.

479
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:01,229
And so the thing is just to keep it simple,

480
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,210
you don't have to do a whole lot.

481
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:06,292
And I don't have money.

482
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:11,615
So that's why I focus on sketches and simple materials,

483
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:14,277
because really, this is how you can develop your skills.

484
00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:17,659
Money is one of those things where it's easy to resolve.

485
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:22,145
And so the time is really your biggest cost

486
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:23,786
because you can't buy more time.

487
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,088
And really, all you need is just good materials

488
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:31,290
and the equipment to be simple and effective.

489
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,990
You don't need it to be fancy or elaborate.

490
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,692
Exquisite work can be done and has been created

491
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:36,752
with limited palettes.

492
00:24:37,152 --> 00:24:38,613
You'd be very surprised.

493
00:24:40,374 --> 00:24:41,334
Zorn is a good example.

494
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,976
He used three colors and he would create amazing paintings.

495
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:49,521
So just remember it's the idea that really matters,

496
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,042
not the rendering or the technique.

497
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,966
At least that's been my experience.

498
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:59,289
Now, you're gonna wanna avoid points of friction.

499
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,213
So I think, or at least I believe,

500
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:04,314
at least in my experience,

501
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:06,435
that balancing that passion with life

502
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:07,496
is just part of the process.

503
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:08,437
You gotta figure it out.

504
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:09,898
I can't give you a formula.

505
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:11,700
Each one of you has a specific...

506
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:16,361
goal and obviously you're going to have roadblocks.

507
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:19,406
So what you need to do is just figure out how to get around those things.

508
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:20,648
In my case,

509
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,874
a lot of times why I wouldn't do work is because it was just too

510
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:31,155
too much in the way, like, oh, I got to put everything together before I can go out

511
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:34,197
and the lighting is going to change so I won't go out today.

512
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,920
So what I started doing was just basically packing things up.

513
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,281
I also changed my gear.

514
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:41,404
I used to have one of those French easels, which is like 20 pounds.

515
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:43,646
And I'm like, no, I don't want to go out painting today

516
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:45,127
because I just I don't want to carry all that stuff.

517
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:47,449
So I just simplified everything, shrunk everything down.

518
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:49,611
So it's hanging on a hook.

519
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:50,752
Backpack's all loaded.

520
00:25:50,993 --> 00:25:52,554
I can just grab it and take off at any moment.

521
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:57,339
So what I started doing was, I would sketch with pencil or pen

522
00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:58,999
when I just needed to work fast and light.

523
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,880
If I was traveling, like I am here,

524
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,320
I'll take a gouache kit with me.

525
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:08,241
It's really small and it's super light, easy to travel with.

526
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,042
But if I have the time and the opportunity,

527
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:14,662
I'm going to go out with oil because it's the one medium

528
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:16,043
that I prefer the most.

529
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:18,083
And also, I'll spend more time.

530
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,275
These are some of my favorite ways of brainstorming that I want to share with you guys because

531
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:28,762
ultimately I want you guys to be able to walk away and hopefully be able to do some of these

532
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:29,062
things.

533
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:33,308
So I call this the 360, it's probably a better term for it.

534
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,632
Basically I'm taking one idea and I'm creating as many designs as possible.

535
00:26:38,272 --> 00:26:40,753
And then I'm going to see what stands out of that group.

536
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:45,636
I think one of the things that kind of helps with something like this is that the negative

537
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:49,078
spaces around the areas as you're filling them, they can influence the design.

538
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:53,520
So some characters are really stretched out, others are more square and bulky.

539
00:26:55,101 --> 00:27:00,424
And then when you're trying a theme, you can experiment different things and borrow from

540
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:02,385
one design and try a different take on it.

541
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:04,729
And so what that's gonna allow you to do

542
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:09,110
is really kind of iterate and iterate on a fast level,

543
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,031
but without starting from scratch each time.

544
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:15,692
I call this the repurposed design.

545
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:18,433
Basically, you're inheriting something from something else.

546
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:22,154
Now, in this example, what I did was,

547
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:25,975
there's a sketch that I'd done on the back of that page,

548
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:27,736
and it was a marker that's bleeding through.

549
00:27:29,675 --> 00:27:32,756
using those marks, I'm kind of just riffing off of it

550
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:35,537
and using it to influence what I'm going to draw on top of that.

551
00:27:38,018 --> 00:27:39,178
And that's just to get me started.

552
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,899
So, the other one's a little bit more complicated.

553
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,720
This one I borrowed from Andrew Loomis.

554
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,780
He has a book called Creative Illustration.

555
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,441
I really highly recommend it for you guys.

556
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:55,710
And so in this example, you have a frame, a red square.

557
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,030
And what I'm doing is I'm running a blue line.

558
00:27:58,071 --> 00:28:00,832
It's kind of faint, but it's going from the top left corner

559
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,313
down to the right bottom corner.

560
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:05,113
And just about.

561
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:07,978
near the halfway mark, but not exactly.

562
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:10,900
I'm trying to stick it to a quarter to a third.

563
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:12,762
There's a vertical line that's being drawn

564
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:13,783
from the top to the bottom.

565
00:28:14,223 --> 00:28:15,504
Now where those two lines meet,

566
00:28:16,164 --> 00:28:17,806
now I draw a horizontal line.

567
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:21,608
Now what that's giving me is four squares,

568
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:24,010
or sorry, rectangles, but they're all different sizes.

569
00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:27,633
As I continue doing that,

570
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:31,376
it's gonna subdivide the frame even more.

571
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:32,717
And so what

572
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:35,983
the result that I get is, and the reason why I use this,

573
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:40,865
it's gonna give me non-uniform sizes for all these shapes.

574
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,147
I'd shown my work to a few folks,

575
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:45,708
and one of the things that was kind of common

576
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:47,828
was that my compositions were poor

577
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:51,090
because I was using the same shapes without realizing.

578
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,811
So this gave me a framework, not a rigid one,

579
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:55,872
but one that I could kind of just have there,

580
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,614
so that way I would avoid that bad habit

581
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:01,675
of creating all these even-sized things.

582
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:06,148
Once I have those primary shapes in place,

583
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:08,749
well then I can spend the time to render things out

584
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:12,311
because I know that the composition is a good design,

585
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:13,751
or at least that's the hope.

586
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:19,954
So I would like to conclude this

587
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,734
with a quote from Vincent van Gogh.

588
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,695
In spite of everything, I shall rise again.

589
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:26,676
I will take up my pencil,

590
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:28,957
which I have forsaken in my great discouragement,

591
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,138
and I will go on with my drawing.

592
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:34,304
Thank you so much.
