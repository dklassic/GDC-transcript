1
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:10,055
So hello, I'm Karen Stevens, the EA Sports Accessibility Lead.

2
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:14,037
My job is basically trying to help those with disabilities

3
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:15,318
be able to play EA games.

4
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:18,421
This talk is about AAA gaming while blind.

5
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:23,744
So basically, how blind gamers are playing EA's major titles.

6
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:26,406
A little back story.

7
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:31,877
Madden 17 had accessibility features covered in a talk I gave last year.

8
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:37,482
And it covered things like enlarged on-field graphics, which made things twice as big,

9
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:42,727
twice as wide, twice as tall, on the field so people with low vision were able to see

10
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:42,847
it.

11
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:49,773
At the same time, I also added in brightness and contrast support, also for people with

12
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:50,234
low vision.

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,370
So I wanted to get information back from our gamers

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,972
as to how they, what they thought of these features.

15
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:01,895
And so I created an email account and a Twitter address

16
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,038
just so I could get feedback back from our gamers.

17
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,681
And the feedback I got surprised me.

18
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:13,745
I'm blind, I was able to play past versions of Madden,

19
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:16,667
but changes were made to things like the kick meter,

20
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:19,390
so now it's hard to play, I can't kick the ball.

21
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:22,813
Yeah, I'm like, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:25,815
And also the fact that I didn't realize

23
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,656
that we had that many blind gamers.

24
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,337
So I went, I reached out and I'm like,

25
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,537
thank you for this information.

26
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:33,098
Is anybody else here?

27
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,899
Because I found it on audiogames.net,

28
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:39,541
which is a site for gamers who are blind.

29
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,202
They make audio games for each other.

30
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:42,823
So I went there and I'm like,

31
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,904
does anybody else playing any EA games

32
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:45,664
that I should know about?

33
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:46,985
Yeah.

34
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,132
I'm blind and I can play UFC,

35
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,053
but I'm having trouble with submission mechanics,

36
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,294
like basically end up on the ground

37
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:54,655
and they don't know exactly what's going on.

38
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:56,596
I'm blind and I can play NHL,

39
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:57,897
but I have trouble knowing

40
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,358
when the puck is about to hit the ice,

41
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:01,319
meaning that they have a really hard time

42
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:03,260
getting control of the puck when you first start playing.

43
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:06,202
Or I'm blind and I'm playing Need for Speed,

44
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:08,103
and sometimes I go off the map and get lost.

45
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:10,644
That blew my mind that they were playing Need for Speed.

46
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,187
So here's the important thing in all of this.

47
00:02:15,607 --> 00:02:16,128
I can play.

48
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,580
They're already playing.

49
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,221
We already had an audience.

50
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:21,501
They were just struggling.

51
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,763
So that was important to realize

52
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:28,525
that we're ignoring part of our audience

53
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:30,926
and really everyone should be included.

54
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,292
So how is this even possible?

55
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,034
I start asking them questions.

56
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,476
Can you explain to me how you're able to play these games?

57
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:38,437
I don't understand.

58
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:40,159
3D sound design.

59
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,261
The more realistic the sound is,

60
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:45,284
the better chance they have of understanding.

61
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,766
Turns out there's a grain of truth behind Daredevil,

62
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:49,488
the comic book character,

63
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:52,471
where people can use echoes

64
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:54,353
to determine how far away walls are.

65
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:57,996
I had no idea that that was possible, but no, they really can.

66
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:03,200
And so when you start putting them in an environment with 3D sounds all around them,

67
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,103
like for the person with Need for Speed, he was listening for cars.

68
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:11,487
You wouldn't think of that, but it turns out that that's super important to have real 3D sounds.

69
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:13,718
Reaction indications.

70
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,640
So let's say you're on a menu and you hear click, click, click,

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,421
that's important so they know where in the menu they are.

72
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:22,443
It's also important when you're in a fighting game,

73
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:24,585
you can actually hear a sound when the hit connects

74
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:26,286
so you get more information.

75
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:27,907
Menu wrapping.

76
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:31,809
So menu wrapping is when you have a carousel.

77
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:34,150
So you have a bunch of options

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,411
and when you get to the end of the list,

79
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:36,992
it automatically goes back to the beginning.

80
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:39,794
If you don't have an indication

81
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,895
as to when this wrap happened.

82
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:44,242
They have no idea where they are on the list.

83
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:46,443
They have no idea when they get back to the beginning.

84
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:48,823
So there's two options.

85
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:49,824
One, don't wrap.

86
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,745
Two, add in some sort of feedback.

87
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:54,525
Rumble audio doesn't matter,

88
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,806
so they know that that happened.

89
00:03:58,386 --> 00:03:59,146
Haptic feedback.

90
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,527
Haptic feedback is rumbles.

91
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,828
It gives you extra clues and context as to what's going on.

92
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,789
It can be used in place of audio in many cases,

93
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:07,889
and it helps give weight

94
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,890
to different interactions in the game.

95
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:12,533
Deterministic menus.

96
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:15,453
Randomness is indeed confusing for everyone.

97
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:18,915
In this case, it means that when you're in a menu,

98
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:22,816
you might have ads that may or may not show up.

99
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:24,877
You may have special promotion modes

100
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:26,077
that may or may not show up,

101
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:29,678
which means that your menu will be different sizes.

102
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:31,439
Things may be in different locations.

103
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:34,620
And if you can't see, that's a problem.

104
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,111
Now you may be wondering, okay, so how are they even coping

105
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:39,112
with what they have already?

106
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,533
Well, there is some technology out there

107
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,555
that lets them take things like stream video

108
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:47,357
off their console into a PC,

109
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:49,659
and then it uses optical character recognition

110
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:50,880
to read the menus.

111
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,221
They still have trouble telling where they are,

112
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:56,684
but they can actually read some of the information.

113
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,285
But it's not a complete thing.

114
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:01,607
They are still lacking as to what

115
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:02,848
they're exactly highlighting.

116
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:04,169
They may not be able to tell.

117
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:08,150
Sometimes they use the OCR technology,

118
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,231
so they hold up a phone to the screen

119
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,992
and it does the same thing as that streaming device,

120
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,753
but then you have to have a separate step.

121
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,974
But they are actually able to read some of the menus

122
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:21,455
even if we didn't do anything in the game itself.

123
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:23,276
So that's important to realize.

124
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:27,637
It also means that the menus, as important as it is,

125
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:28,838
and really it is important,

126
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,878
to make it so somebody can read them,

127
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,360
someone blind can follow them without using software.

128
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,295
If you make all your menus navigatable,

129
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:39,816
but you can't play the game, that's not gonna help.

130
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,198
So I'm at an NFL.

131
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,399
How on earth are they doing this?

132
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,661
This is one of the games I got contacted about first.

133
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,003
And it was about somebody who was really frustrated

134
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:52,863
with the new kick meter.

135
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:57,666
And I asked him, okay, so I know you're frustrated with this

136
00:05:58,086 --> 00:05:59,167
but what does work for you?

137
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:00,528
How are you playing this?

138
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:02,075
Commentary.

139
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,337
So Madden, among with most of our other sports titles,

140
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:06,678
have commentary in it,

141
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:09,200
meaning that there is a constant dialogue

142
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,481
of everything that's going on.

143
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:13,062
It's kind of like listening to a game on the radio,

144
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:15,204
where it gives you a bunch of extra information.

145
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:17,005
It gives them enough information

146
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,127
where they know where their opponents are,

147
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:22,109
they know what yard line they are on the field,

148
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,511
and they know how many more chances they have

149
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,752
to get to the next down,

150
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:27,573
which is like 10 yards from the previous yard line.

151
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:31,997
and they know what their team members are doing,

152
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,939
and they have some general idea of what's going on,

153
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:34,560
just from that.

154
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,662
It also gives them information on the score.

155
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,948
Now, another thing that made it easier for them in Madden

156
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,850
is that the goal was always to move up.

157
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,594
The goal you're going towards is always up,

158
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,395
if you're using a stick.

159
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:53,616
The AI, since there are so many different players on the field,

160
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:58,159
the AI auto steers for everyone other than the player you're

161
00:06:58,179 --> 00:06:59,060
currently controlling.

162
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,861
You can choose not to take control of a player,

163
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:03,463
meaning it will run for you.

164
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,165
There are also assists, so you can do little dodge moves

165
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:11,788
and things, and you don't need to worry about when to do this.

166
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:15,758
So, but the fact is that you always can move up.

167
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,960
That was probably the most valuable thing

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,842
because that means they could take over if they wanted to.

169
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:22,084
And if someone's coming close to them,

170
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:24,446
they can feel that because there's haptics

171
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:26,268
when someone's coming about to tackle you

172
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:27,969
and they can, you know, swirl away.

173
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,272
You can watch somebody playing these games

174
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,313
and you may not even realize they're blind.

175
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:34,876
Unless they try to kick the ball.

176
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:35,837
That was a different story.

177
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:38,339
Need for speed.

178
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:42,148
So this is a racing game, it's kind of open world.

179
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,414
The plus side is that if you go off the track,

180
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:48,797
usually it'll move you right back on the track,

181
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:50,659
like the game itself will move you back on the track,

182
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,741
so that helps them a lot.

183
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:54,044
Realistic sound design.

184
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:56,788
Sound design matters, it matters so much.

185
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:59,089
It tells you whether or not you're on dirt,

186
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,631
you're on pavement, or what type of surface you're on.

187
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:04,373
You can hear the obstacles going by.

188
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:07,495
So they know that if I hear three whooshes,

189
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:09,596
I just went past three posts, that type of thing.

190
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:11,837
So it gives them enough information,

191
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:14,139
in addition to being able to hear the cars.

192
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,880
I ask them, how do you know when to turn?

193
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,661
While the other cars are turning, I turn with them.

194
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,442
Okay, I guess that makes sense.

195
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:22,123
I never thought of that before.

196
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,164
Engine pitch helps determine speed.

197
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:26,205
The engine sounds different,

198
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,466
depending on how fast you're going

199
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:28,586
and how much you're accelerating.

200
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,288
And they use that in conjunction with the other information

201
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:32,829
to essentially memorize tracks

202
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:34,149
the same way sighted people do.

203
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,471
And then after that, they just can go spinning around,

204
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:37,671
you know, by themselves.

205
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:39,753
You're like, how is this person doing this?

206
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:41,554
Well, it's because they used the other cars

207
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:42,534
and figured out the track

208
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:44,655
and figured out all these whooshing sounds and everything.

209
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:46,476
And they've essentially memorized the tracks,

210
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:47,617
even if they're not intending to.

211
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:51,686
Controller rumbles were extremely useful

212
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:52,767
to get more feedback.

213
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:55,710
It lets them know whether or not they've hit something.

214
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:59,494
It also lets them know what type of ground they're on.

215
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,636
It gives you more information than just audio alone.

216
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:04,709
NHL.

217
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,011
NHL is another sports title,

218
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,913
meaning it also has detailed audio, such as commentaries.

219
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:13,876
And similar to Madden, it's a constant dialogue

220
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:15,577
of everything that's happening.

221
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:18,799
In addition to that, you can hear the other players.

222
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:21,081
You can tell when there's a puck being hit.

223
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:24,223
And it also has a feature

224
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:28,226
where you can set the camera to be a fixed angle.

225
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:31,308
So, similar to Madden, your goal is to go up.

226
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,406
And this helps them know where they are.

227
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,267
Now the question becomes, okay, that's great,

228
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:39,288
but how do they know when to shoot?

229
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:41,749
Well, it turns out there's assistive aiming in the game

230
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,510
you can turn on, and it helps you aim your shots.

231
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,632
So as long as they know that they're relatively close

232
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:50,153
to the end of the field, they can try taking a shot.

233
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:53,134
It's not as good as an experience as someone with sight,

234
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:54,495
but it is an experience.

235
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:57,136
And having an experience is the most important thing.

236
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:03,576
For UFC, they have a commentary as well,

237
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,957
just like the other sports titles.

238
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:07,680
And it gives you more information

239
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,321
as to what the other player is doing.

240
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:12,263
What blew my mind is the person

241
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:13,765
who contacted me about this game.

242
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:16,947
He's like, yeah, I beat the UFC two championship.

243
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:18,704
I'm like, you what?

244
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:19,884
Yeah, I beat the whole thing.

245
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,206
Okay, for putting this in context,

246
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:23,627
I think it took me eight hours

247
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,648
to beat the first round in that game,

248
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:27,369
and they finished the championship.

249
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:28,510
I'm like, can you give me tips?

250
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:30,291
I can't play this game.

251
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:32,913
So it just shows you that,

252
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,194
and I asked him, how did he do this?

253
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:36,816
He spent months trying to figure it out,

254
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:39,177
where he's like, well, there's certain audio things

255
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:41,739
that happen after certain rumble things that happen,

256
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,241
and then I know if I do the following that it works.

257
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:47,003
and he got to the point where he was able then to explain

258
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:50,025
to other blind gamers and teach them how to play the game.

259
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:54,368
So we had a reasonably sized blind gaming community

260
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:55,329
for UFC 2.

261
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:01,914
So the trial and error really helped,

262
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,215
but that's still rather painful.

263
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,837
We like to give them more information.

264
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:08,859
So.

265
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:11,572
Support improvements.

266
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:13,999
Soliciting feedback is important.

267
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:15,183
Very important.

268
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,953
One thing I don't have in this slide, but do have later,

269
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:22,035
but I will say now, audiogames.net, all one word,

270
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:24,276
is a blind community.

271
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:25,857
And they play games.

272
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:27,018
And they have a forum.

273
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:30,119
And that's one of the top ways I've gotten information

274
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,720
is by working on their forum.

275
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,681
And if you go there and look for me,

276
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,863
you'll find the entire conversation of all of this,

277
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:40,324
including all the questions of what games are you playing

278
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:41,425
and how are you doing this.

279
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:42,385
It's all there.

280
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:47,766
So soliciting feedback is key because our titles do release,

281
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:51,307
many of them yearly or bi-yearly or relatively often.

282
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:55,889
So it gives us opportunities to add more information

283
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:57,069
every single time.

284
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,431
Now, unfortunately, because these games

285
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,051
all have a long history,

286
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:05,233
we're not able to necessarily do it from scratch.

287
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:10,056
The time really you should be thinking about this is when you're first starting the game.

288
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,918
It's when you're first starting your design.

289
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:14,820
It's cheaper to do it early than it is to do it late.

290
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,562
That does not mean there isn't value in doing it late.

291
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:21,445
So with the our games, sometimes we do it in patches.

292
00:12:21,846 --> 00:12:22,546
That's okay.

293
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:26,669
And keep in mind, it's not about a competitive gaming experience.

294
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,053
This is about people playing with friends, playing with their parents, children.

295
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:35,737
I've gotten emails from like a blind parent in the UK

296
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:38,539
who wanted a game he could play with his five-year-old son,

297
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,462
and he was able to play Madden. That's the type of thing we're going for.

298
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:45,105
Yes, it would be wonderful if they could have the same experience

299
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:49,408
as a competitive gamer, but it'd be wonderful if they just had an experience.

300
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:51,130
And really, that's the most important thing.

301
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:58,940
So Madden NFL 18, we did add new features to Madden NFL

302
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,561
for specifically these problems.

303
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:05,863
What you see here is a picture I used

304
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:08,204
when pitching this to the executives

305
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:09,884
as to how we're going to fix the game

306
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:11,005
or how we could fix the game.

307
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:15,787
The white boxes represent the areas I added rumble.

308
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:18,908
So we have this little line that starts at the bottom,

309
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:20,649
it goes sliding up to the top.

310
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,490
and then it comes back down again.

311
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:26,373
When it goes up to the top, that's when you determine your power,

312
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:28,255
how hard you kick,

313
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:31,938
and when it comes back down, you try to line up the arrows,

314
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:34,740
that determines how accurately you kick.

315
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,602
Now you can see how this could be a problem if you can't see that thing.

316
00:13:38,563 --> 00:13:40,044
So, and it had no audio cues.

317
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,327
So I went through and, uh...

318
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,075
said, okay, if we have these different zones

319
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,936
and we added a rumble to these,

320
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,336
I think we can get past this point.

321
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:55,597
And at the same time, also added in extra rumbles,

322
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:58,238
so you don't have to memorize the advanced menus.

323
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,798
As long as you snap the ball,

324
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:02,599
if you feel like a short single rumble,

325
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:04,519
you know you're in the middle of a pass.

326
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,580
If you have a long rumble, you know it's a run play.

327
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,501
If it's a double rumble, you're looking at a kick meter.

328
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:13,503
and then you can expect the two rumbles after that point.

329
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:16,786
So from that, they don't have to memorize the long menus.

330
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:18,407
They can, some of them still have,

331
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:20,269
because they like being able to pick their exact play,

332
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:23,312
but they don't have to, and that really lowered the barrier

333
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:25,233
to people who are trying to learn the game

334
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,034
for the first time.

335
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,176
Keep in mind that people playing this game

336
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:31,098
have literally never seen football,

337
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,360
because they are completely blind,

338
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,642
but they've also often not even heard football.

339
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,064
So that made it interesting.

340
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:42,461
I also have extra rumbles when the ball is in the air,

341
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,007
and also when the snap occurs.

342
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:47,152
So basically, any time the ball leaves somebody's hands,

343
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:48,695
you feel it, you know it's happening.

344
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,947
Now if you're wondering, why do I keep doing rumbles?

345
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,107
Why am I not doing audio?

346
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,027
I'm deaf.

347
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:58,048
So I'm the one who implemented these features myself.

348
00:14:58,428 --> 00:15:02,089
And they kept talking about it in terms of audio.

349
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:05,350
And I'm like, OK, I know in order to make this happen,

350
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,231
it's probably going to be me doing it.

351
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:09,111
I need to be able to test this.

352
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,732
There is no way I'm going to be able to test audio.

353
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:13,833
So I thought about it.

354
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:14,213
And I'm like.

355
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:19,279
okay how about deaf-blind features? How do we make this so we can make it so the deaf-blind can play?

356
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,044
So I did rumbles to everything and I did turn off my monitor and I was still able to get touchdowns

357
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:29,647
and I got points and scores in the game and I could figure out where I was based on patterns

358
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:35,071
like if it's two kick meters in a row I know I just punched the ball and now I'm doing kickoff

359
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,333
so I know that now the other team has control.

360
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:40,958
I'm going to say it's really hard to play DeafBlind.

361
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:43,920
It is possible, but it's very difficult.

362
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,382
I would have to write an extensive guide

363
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,183
if someone was wanting to play DeafBlind,

364
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:50,325
but I wouldn't mind doing that if somebody's interested.

365
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:53,347
So on top of that.

366
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:56,309
Once I proved the game could be played,

367
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:59,070
I literally blindfolded the gameplay team.

368
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,571
I got those eclipse glasses, you can't see anything through,

369
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,771
and I had them all wear these really cool,

370
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,892
nifty-looking sunglasses that completely blinded them

371
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,253
and made them play the game.

372
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:08,773
And they were able to play.

373
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:10,994
They were like, wow, this actually works!

374
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:12,495
Yeah, it works pretty well.

375
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:15,176
And from there, we got past the,

376
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,757
there is no way a blind person can play Madden.

377
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,478
Yes, a blind person can play Madden,

378
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:22,418
and they can now have done it too.

379
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,379
At that point, I've had more leverage.

380
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,341
So I went to the story mode team,

381
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,883
because last year was the first year

382
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:31,225
Madden had a campaign, and said,

383
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:34,889
hey, so blind players can already play the game.

384
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:37,431
Can we make it so they can play through the campaign?

385
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,153
What would be the blockers for them?

386
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:41,395
They're like, well, we have these quick time events

387
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:44,178
and we don't know, we have no information

388
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:44,979
of giving back to them.

389
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:45,960
I'm like, okay.

390
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:47,201
Can we make a guide?

391
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:48,263
That would help.

392
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:52,327
So I got all the information from them to make this guide.

393
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:55,471
And at the same time, I'm like, OK, so some things

394
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:56,712
we're not going to be able to figure out

395
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:57,593
because of positioning.

396
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:58,374
It's going to be hard.

397
00:16:58,835 --> 00:16:59,776
They might be able to do it.

398
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:02,052
we need to make sure they're not stuck.

399
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:06,194
So if they fail a few times in a row, they fail forward.

400
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:08,215
It does change the dialogue in the game

401
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:09,315
if you do fail forward,

402
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,557
but it doesn't have an overall impact in the experience

403
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,617
and you are able to finish the story.

404
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,538
And that's really the most important thing,

405
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:18,139
is having an experience.

406
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,940
And blind gamers have actually gotten

407
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,981
to the very end of Madden Story Mode.

408
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:27,183
UFC's new feature.

409
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:30,845
UFC also got haptic feedback.

410
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:33,587
This was done completely independently of me at first.

411
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:37,069
There was a blind gamer who reached out on Twitter

412
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,912
to one of the devs, and then it came back to me

413
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:43,113
that someone was doing that,

414
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:44,935
and I was already the EA accessibility lead,

415
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,316
so I was just following up to make sure everything was okay

416
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:48,657
and no one needed anything.

417
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,778
And the other dev had already started adding in rumbles,

418
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:55,739
so you could tell how far or near

419
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,380
you were with your opponent.

420
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,301
So basically, if the right motor rumbles,

421
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:01,761
your opponent's throwing a high strike.

422
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,602
If it's the left motor, it's a low strike.

423
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:06,342
Tensity tells you how far away you are from the other player

424
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:07,963
and gives you a lot more information

425
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:08,943
as to what's going on.

426
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:12,624
Now, he did this, the reason he did rumble,

427
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:15,545
which is really a good reason why I would've done it too,

428
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,785
even if I could actually here,

429
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:18,266
I would...

430
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:22,232
There's no cost of making an audio file

431
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:23,232
or loading the audio file.

432
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:25,273
There's no performance overhead of an audio file.

433
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,534
Rumble's cheap.

434
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:31,156
So the fact it's cheap made it a really good option.

435
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:37,438
Now from there, I made an accessibility portal.

436
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,759
This just came out last week.

437
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:39,919
This is brand new.

438
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:43,561
Before this point.

439
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,318
All the guides I was saying I was writing

440
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:49,700
were all on Reddit because I had no home for them.

441
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,801
So I put everything on Reddit,

442
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,562
even though they didn't have any hyperlinks.

443
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:55,544
And to put it in perspective,

444
00:18:55,604 --> 00:18:57,805
the guide for Madden for the blind

445
00:18:57,865 --> 00:19:00,006
is currently over 25 pages printed long.

446
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:03,769
So that's an awful lot to not have any hyperlinks on,

447
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:05,050
but you do what you can.

448
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,554
And so, for example, for what the guide might look like,

449
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:14,313
This is a screen cap of the guide.

450
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:16,014
That's why the points are a different color,

451
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:18,114
is that this is literally the webpage, or piece of it.

452
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:21,576
It tells you, this is the manual itself,

453
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:23,437
and all the manuals are text-based

454
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,257
per game that's on the site,

455
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:27,838
and it tells you with no pictures

456
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:32,160
exactly what each button is and what it does.

457
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:36,328
So you can use that then to communicate back.

458
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,170
Avoid tables.

459
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,611
If you nest tables incorrectly

460
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,532
or try to do variable lengths,

461
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:44,374
it can mess up screen readers.

462
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:45,835
Avoid tables.

463
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:48,977
This is why we have the colons in the format here.

464
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,758
It is possible to make a table

465
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:52,039
that works well with screen readers.

466
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,040
It's also very easy to make a mistake.

467
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:57,503
So until you get that down, avoid tables.

468
00:19:58,103 --> 00:20:00,684
Also make sure you turn on Windows narrator

469
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,505
or voiceover if you're using Apple,

470
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:03,825
because if you do that,

471
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:06,686
you can hear what your webpage sounds like,

472
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:09,227
and you can find out what you have to do

473
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:11,268
to make it sound the way you want it to.

474
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:13,469
So it's important to test.

475
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,096
This is an example of the text-only guide for Madden.

476
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:23,201
And explains the base concept of football,

477
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,924
because keep in mind, some of these people

478
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,706
have no clue what football is.

479
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:32,302
So I remember I had a meeting with another member of our team.

480
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:35,104
We have these employee resource groups.

481
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:36,765
I run the accessibility one.

482
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:39,407
She runs the one for women.

483
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:42,309
She's like, do you have any idea how hard it is to explain

484
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:43,050
football to women?

485
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:43,850
I said, I don't know.

486
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,892
Do you have any idea how hard it is to explain football

487
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:46,893
to somebody who's blind?

488
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,395
She's like, good point.

489
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:53,752
But I do give a brief overview of what football is,

490
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:57,235
how the teams line up, how to score points,

491
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:58,016
and things like that.

492
00:20:58,076 --> 00:20:59,677
Just a high-level overview,

493
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,399
so they have some concept of the game.

494
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,382
It also gives detailed information

495
00:21:04,522 --> 00:21:06,564
on how to create an Origin account,

496
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:08,446
how to sign in for the first time,

497
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:10,008
what the setting menus are

498
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:11,209
when you first go through the game,

499
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,651
and what options are recommended for them.

500
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:18,010
It also provides information on how to reset all options,

501
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:19,531
so if they make a mistake,

502
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,752
because Madden still does have some of those

503
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,333
revolving menus that are a problem,

504
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:25,415
how to reset it so they know where they are,

505
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:26,815
and then go from there.

506
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:29,357
Tedious, but at least it gets past that.

507
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:35,030
We have, like I said earlier, the long shot story mode.

508
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,473
We have an extremely detailed list

509
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,695
of every single thing that happens in long shot.

510
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,317
Which I find hilarious because this has been out

511
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:46,781
since the day that the patch came live.

512
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,503
And it also gives information for,

513
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:52,065
like there's this mode where you have to know

514
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,847
this football knowledge and pick the right things.

515
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:55,088
The answers are in the guide.

516
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:56,690
But nobody's ever noticed.

517
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:01,612
But it gives you extremely detailed information

518
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,273
so somebody who has no sight at all

519
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,154
still has a decent chance of playing

520
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:06,314
and that's really what matters.

521
00:22:07,415 --> 00:22:09,276
And by this point, you can find those answers

522
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:11,177
anywhere on the web, so that's no real secret

523
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,437
because that happened last summer.

524
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:17,700
So it gives key by key format as I showed earlier

525
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,321
where it covers every single step.

526
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:24,083
Now this is also a screen cap from that website.

527
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,281
Where you see that's why it's blue,

528
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,962
because that's the color of the links

529
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:32,683
and the points in the website.

530
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:35,404
So, as you see here, on the left stick,

531
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:38,125
press right four times, then down two times

532
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:39,485
to reach the practice icon.

533
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,586
Press A to enter practice icon.

534
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,586
The next menu has three options,

535
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:45,447
normal, offense, only, and kickoff.

536
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,327
For now, let's practice kicking.

537
00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:48,988
Press down twice and then A.

538
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,628
The whole guide reads like that.

539
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,783
So if you can't see it all, and you're having trouble

540
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:57,965
with your screen reader, you can still get through,

541
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:00,167
and it gives you an idea of what options are there.

542
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:04,491
For UFC 3, when I went through and did the same exercise,

543
00:23:05,712 --> 00:23:07,133
it's a little more condensed,

544
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,415
because it shows the way the menu's laid out,

545
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:12,137
so there's less of the individual buttons.

546
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:13,318
We do have scenarios.

547
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:14,699
Basically, these are use cases.

548
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,482
We still have use cases for certain things,

549
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,483
but it's a little less.

550
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:23,691
seeing button by button than Madden's is.

551
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:27,334
Now, I would happily expand it if I'm requested to.

552
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:29,416
Every single section in Madden's guide

553
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:31,538
is because it was specifically requested by someone.

554
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,280
And anytime anyone asks me how to do anything,

555
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,501
I made a new section.

556
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:38,483
By the time I was done, I had 25 pages of guides.

557
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,288
So this is an ongoing effort.

558
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,111
And the basic rule I'm pushing,

559
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:52,372
you never can regress, you can always go forward.

560
00:23:52,812 --> 00:23:55,153
So if you have something that's accessible already,

561
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,053
you must maintain the accessibility.

562
00:23:57,513 --> 00:24:00,394
If you touch a new, something that you haven't touched

563
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:02,134
in a while, because a lot of these games,

564
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:05,615
we do touch UI year from year and things like that,

565
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:07,815
but the game itself, Madden's massive,

566
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,936
so some features stay relatively the same

567
00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:12,096
for years at a time.

568
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,857
When you touch something, you must make it better.

569
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:16,158
Not worse.

570
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:17,539
Worse is not allowed.

571
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,842
And if we keep doing that, eventually,

572
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:24,144
the whole game becomes much, much more accessible.

573
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:25,646
And it's already started happening.

574
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,289
Low-hanging fruit can quickly unblock large portions

575
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:29,929
of your audience.

576
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,691
Yeah, being able to kick the ball

577
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,012
is really important in football.

578
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:37,315
So just fixing that helped so many people

579
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:40,738
and really increased the number of blind gamers we have playing.

580
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:43,481
Ask your audience for its pain points.

581
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:45,987
That's probably the most important point here.

582
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:49,053
Ask your audience.

583
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:50,436
They know what they need.

584
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:52,660
They may be playing your games.

585
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:56,928
By asking them, you can find out what they really need.

586
00:24:56,948 --> 00:25:00,250
Now keep in mind that they, sometimes it's easier

587
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,011
to make sure you stay in problem space, not solution space.

588
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:04,172
You probably all heard that before.

589
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:07,314
Where to make sure you're solving the right problem,

590
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,615
because sometimes they'll jump into a solution,

591
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:11,436
and really you have to figure out

592
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:12,577
what the core of the problem is.

593
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:13,878
But that's a standard design issue.

594
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:15,179
I'm sure you're all familiar with that.

595
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:20,882
So once again, audiogames.net is a great place

596
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:22,022
to meet blind gamers.

597
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:23,831
I highly recommend it.

598
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:26,597
And you can see all the conversations I had with them

599
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:29,443
and all the research that went into this presentation

600
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:30,466
is all available there.

601
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,851
So you can get all that information if you like.

602
00:25:34,176 --> 00:25:41,364
Additional content for what these guides look like and different descriptions of how you can design your website for blind gamers,

603
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:47,430
go to ea.com. The whole site is designed for blind navigation and blind gaming.

604
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:53,176
The whole site uses alt tags on everything, so it gives you extra information as to what the pictures are,

605
00:25:53,877 --> 00:25:56,219
and every single widget you can reach every part of.

606
00:25:57,863 --> 00:26:01,784
If you need to contact me, my Twitter is EA underscore accessible.

607
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:06,386
I do tweet out every time something new happens in the accessibility area.

608
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,207
So if you just want to keep up with news, that's a good way of doing it.

609
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:15,850
If you have any questions or feedback, able at EA.com is a great way to reach me.

610
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,891
And does anyone have any questions?

611
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:25,846
First of all-

612
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:28,408
She's going to be repeating the questions to me

613
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:29,308
because I lip read.

614
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,670
Okay.

615
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:36,474
As I told you before, I come from the mobile industry

616
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:40,277
and EA does mobile games and all the games that you said,

617
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:43,419
like part of them have games on mobile.

618
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,964
Do you address, you know, accessibility in any way on mobile?

619
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:50,405
Repeat that.

620
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:52,446
Do you address any of like these kind of things

621
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:53,167
on mobile games?

622
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:56,474
Yes, these type of things do happen on mobile games.

623
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:59,477
I'm actually going to be looking at our mobile games shortly.

624
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:03,260
I started with the console games simply

625
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,261
because I had to start somewhere.

626
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,103
I've only been, I've actually only been the accessibility

627
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:07,904
lead for six months.

628
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:09,506
My positions only existed that long.

629
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:12,008
Before that point, I was a Madden game developer,

630
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:14,390
which is why I was able to say, please, please, please,

631
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,372
let me put this feature in, because I was already

632
00:27:16,412 --> 00:27:16,692
on the game.

633
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:19,255
But yes, that's very important.

634
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:22,200
There are lots, you're welcome to follow me

635
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,582
and ask me for information.

636
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:26,005
I can give you more information that's mobile specific

637
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:27,167
and talks about gestures and things.

638
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,789
All right, fantastic, thank you.

639
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:37,206
Okay, well, you half answered my question about only being in the position for six months.

640
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:41,949
But I was wondering what other resources you have in EA accessibility.

641
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:48,594
So do you have any QA testers that are disabled with blindness, deafness, color blindness,

642
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:49,534
things like this?

643
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:50,915
Or are there plans for this?

644
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:53,149
I think I partially caught that question,

645
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:54,149
so let me try to repeat.

646
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,973
The question being, is it, do we have anybody

647
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:01,474
who's disabled who's helping test or develop these?

648
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:02,795
The answer is yes.

649
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:07,818
I have a list of developers I made internally

650
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:11,941
that I ask people to self-identify if they have any issues.

651
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:14,302
So I have a list of everyone who's colorblind

652
00:28:14,322 --> 00:28:15,883
in the building that was willing to do that,

653
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:18,305
and it happened to cover every single type

654
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:19,586
of colorblindness, even blue,

655
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:20,906
which is like super duper rare.

656
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:21,947
I got really lucky.

657
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:26,109
So that gave me a really good background in any of this.

658
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:27,689
So that helped a lot.

659
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,151
We have multiple people with macular degeneration

660
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,812
in the building, which causes a form of low vision.

661
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:35,473
And they help, too, with these.

662
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:36,674
So if we have something, and I'm like,

663
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,314
I don't think so-and-so can see this.

664
00:28:38,694 --> 00:28:40,895
Well, instead of me saying that, I go, hey, can you see this?

665
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:43,176
And then I send that feedback back to the designer.

666
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:45,998
Oh, another thing that I do, and I

667
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:47,578
don't know if I took them out here.

668
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:51,101
is that I have low vision goggles I use

669
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:54,063
to better get people to better understand

670
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:55,805
what it means to be accessible.

671
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:59,888
So I postulated to a management that,

672
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:02,990
would you say that if you're not legally blind,

673
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,471
you should be able to play our games?

674
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:05,972
And the answer was yes.

675
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:08,634
I'm like, cool, all right, put these on.

676
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,076
This is borderline legal blindness.

677
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:12,217
If you're wearing these,

678
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:13,678
you should still be able to play the game.

679
00:29:13,938 --> 00:29:15,299
I don't care how close to the screen you are.

680
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,580
And that helped a great deal.

681
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,681
Now, this is not a perfect solution.

682
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:22,481
Same thing with blindfolding our game developers.

683
00:29:22,942 --> 00:29:25,142
We don't have a lot of completely blind people

684
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,002
to leverage.

685
00:29:26,062 --> 00:29:26,603
That is true.

686
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:29,403
We do have people who are playing our game

687
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:30,464
who are totally blind.

688
00:29:30,884 --> 00:29:32,604
And I did have blind gamers come in

689
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,285
and demo things with the team.

690
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:36,705
Cool, thank you.

691
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,587
Have you noticed that adding some

692
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:43,527
of these accessibility features to help?

693
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:46,220
blind people has also generally helped,

694
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,642
because a lot of those haptic feedback things you talk about

695
00:29:49,062 --> 00:29:50,964
actually seem like they would be generally useful

696
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:53,746
and generally helpful for just kind of feeling

697
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:54,866
how the game works for anyone.

698
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:56,408
Can you repeat that?

699
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:00,330
Have you found that these new features for disabled people

700
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,312
have helped just in general with the gameplay?

701
00:30:03,673 --> 00:30:04,433
You have to repeat that again.

702
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:08,756
Have you found that these new inputs have

703
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:10,438
helped just in general with the gameplay?

704
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:13,913
Yes, these things have helped in general game play,

705
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:17,776
not just the intended target audience.

706
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,377
For example, it turns out I found out

707
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,239
that deaf gamers were turning on the haptics

708
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:24,721
because it made them feel like they had more information

709
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,362
than that they would get from audio.

710
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:28,804
So I wasn't intending that, although that makes sense

711
00:30:28,824 --> 00:30:30,525
because I'm deaf and I'm the one who made the thing

712
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:31,066
in the first place.

713
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:32,267
You'd think that would cross my mind,

714
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:34,228
but yes, the deaf are using it too.

715
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:36,550
Thank you.

716
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:38,472
Hi.

717
00:30:39,092 --> 00:30:42,716
So you mentioned you have specific rules for new features

718
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:43,397
and stuff like that.

719
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:47,941
Is accessibility part of the official pipeline

720
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:48,982
and gating process?

721
00:30:50,303 --> 00:30:52,445
Is accessibility a part of the official pipeline

722
00:30:52,465 --> 00:30:52,986
in the gaming?

723
00:30:53,813 --> 00:30:55,634
is the accessibility part of the official pipeline

724
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:56,594
in the game process.

725
00:30:57,215 --> 00:30:58,815
Yes, for EA Sports.

726
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:02,376
So the way my role works is I'm handling,

727
00:31:02,716 --> 00:31:05,997
taking in feedback and distributing among teams,

728
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:09,919
giving examples of how things should be fixed to all of EA.

729
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:12,760
Now for sports, I'm more proactive

730
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,700
and I actually go out to the game teams,

731
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,401
even if it means flying across the country.

732
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:22,446
And I have them, you know, think about things at the design phase, so it's planned through.

733
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:25,708
That's different though for the sports versus not sports at this time.

734
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:26,569
Thank you.

735
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:30,452
Hi, thank you very much.

736
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:38,539
Just my first question is, are the games designed to be played alone

737
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,523
or to be played with other people, sometimes well-sighted?

738
00:31:44,124 --> 00:31:46,805
Are the games designed to be played alone or with other people?

739
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:48,126
They're designed to...

740
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:51,587
The games are the games designed to be played alone or with other people.

741
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:52,628
They're designed for both.

742
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:55,429
So the instructions, for example, of Madden

743
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:57,890
covers online play as well, not just offline play.

744
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,831
Yeah, but online player is you're alone on your own.

745
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:03,973
You can play locally with somebody or you can play online with somebody.

746
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:05,973
And when you play locally with someone,

747
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:08,394
is it disturbing for the other player?

748
00:32:08,414 --> 00:32:09,395
Could you repeat that?

749
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,296
If you play online with someone,

750
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:13,376
is it disturbing for the other player or distracting?

751
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:17,269
When you turn on this extra haptic feedback,

752
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:20,371
it only affects the person who signed into that controller.

753
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:23,292
So you can have it turned on and the person next to you

754
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:24,653
may not have it turned on.

755
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:25,633
So it's optional.

756
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:26,934
What about the audio?

757
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,515
If it's an audio type of thing,

758
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,756
it would be on for everybody or off for anybody

759
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:33,016
because it comes out of the TV.

760
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:34,537
Okay, yeah.

761
00:32:34,677 --> 00:32:36,118
But if you're playing online,

762
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:39,099
one console could have it on,

763
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,140
the other console could have it off.

764
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,641
That's how colorblindness works, for example, for Madden.

765
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:47,745
Okay, and I have a second question, still about playing with sighted people.

766
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:55,309
You say the most important thing is to have an experience, not to have the best experience,

767
00:32:55,649 --> 00:33:05,194
but it feels like you designed a less well-designed game, actually.

768
00:33:05,674 --> 00:33:12,958
You shorten the experience, you make it a minor experience for the impaired people.

769
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:20,378
I'm sorry for my English, it's sometimes terrible.

770
00:33:21,941 --> 00:33:28,129
I'm a researcher working on auditory display and working on audio in video games.

771
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:30,371
impaired people.

772
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:35,234
And my question now is, can we design

773
00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:41,398
equivalent experience for both sighted and blind people?

774
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:43,840
Was the question, can you design an experience

775
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,761
that will work for both sighted and unsighted?

776
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:47,802
Yeah, but in an equivalent.

777
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:48,603
That's the whole point.

778
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:50,764
Is that so you could have a AAA game

779
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:53,366
that you could have somebody play with their friend

780
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:54,027
who's not blind.

781
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:55,888
And people with MADDEN, especially at this point,

782
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,488
are doing that.

783
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:59,743
Yeah, but is the experience equivalent?

784
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:01,724
Okay, so equivalent in terms of,

785
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:03,425
can you have an experience?

786
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:03,765
Yes.

787
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:06,006
Is it a competitive gaming experience?

788
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:07,267
At this moment, no.

789
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:09,388
Just because it says this moment no,

790
00:34:09,428 --> 00:34:10,729
does not mean that will never be true,

791
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,530
nor does it mean that will ever happen.

792
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,932
But in terms of, is it theoretically possible

793
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:17,773
to design something that works equally well

794
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:19,894
with someone who's blind and someone who's not blind?

795
00:34:20,314 --> 00:34:20,875
I believe it is.

796
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:23,536
In terms of fun or in terms of performance?

797
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:27,158
Fun or performances?

798
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:29,799
In terms of fun or preference?

799
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,982
Well, options are always a good thing.

800
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:38,345
I would always advocate for any sort of accessibility feature you have to make it optional.

801
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:39,325
Okay.

802
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:41,367
Okay, thank you very much.

803
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:41,887
Mm-hmm.

804
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:43,708
Sorry.

805
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:45,029
Yeah, I think we need to...

806
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:45,149
Hmm?

807
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:45,810
We have to wrap up.

808
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,650
Okay.

809
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,511
Thank you.

810
00:34:48,031 --> 00:34:48,631
That's okay.

811
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:49,852
You can choose.

812
00:34:50,092 --> 00:34:52,734
Everyone who's left, we can go to the wrap-up room and finish up,

813
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,075
and you're welcome to ask questions there.

814
00:34:54,655 --> 00:34:54,915
Thank you.
