1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,360
It's 1.45, I'm gonna kick us off.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,161
Welcome to AAA Academics.

3
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:12,543
I wanna get straight to the conversation,

4
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:14,223
so just a little framing.

5
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:17,585
This is a panel with several fantastic designers

6
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,306
who have worked and been very successful in industry

7
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,867
who have recently been making the transition

8
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:25,408
into academic institutions where they are teaching.

9
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:28,869
We have a panel of wonderful, wonderful panelists.

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,449
I will introduce them all quite briefly.

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,030
But here immediately to my right is John Romero,

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,970
who you may know from such games as Quake or Doom.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,731
He also currently teaches at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

14
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:41,771
And to his right is Brenda Romero,

15
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:45,312
who you may know from such wonderful projects as Train and Wizardry.

16
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,233
And she also teaches at the University of California at Santa Cruz.

17
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,293
To her right is Richard Lamarchand.

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,092
Richard, you may know from such projects as Soul Reaver and Uncharted,

19
00:00:56,392 --> 00:00:58,814
and Richard teaches at the University of Southern California.

20
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:03,717
And finally, we have Warren Spector, who you may know from such projects as Day's X

21
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:08,840
or Disney's Epic Mickey, and he now teaches at the University of Texas at Austin.

22
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,643
So, like I said, I want to dive right into this.

23
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:14,184
I'm going to ask some questions, and hopefully we're going

24
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:15,685
to have an interesting conversation here.

25
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:19,948
When I run out of questions, if there's some magical, theoretical time at the end,

26
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,530
we may even take a few audience questions for the panel to answer.

27
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:30,405
So, I want to start right away by asking how the four of you ended up entering the academic field.

28
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:35,106
Can you talk just a little bit about how you became interested in teaching in academia,

29
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:39,567
whether you were approached by an academic institution or you'd harbored a long passion for it,

30
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:41,128
maybe you'd been part-time lecturing?

31
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:45,569
Okay, I'm going.

32
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:50,007
Well, before I got into games as anything but an amateur,

33
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,188
I mean, I was in the 70s.

34
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:52,628
I'm really old.

35
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,689
But in the 70s, I was playing Dungeons and Dragons

36
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,489
and all those Avalon Hill board games and games

37
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,810
like Champions created partly by the person sitting

38
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,530
in the front row here.

39
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,311
And at the same time, I was working on my doctorate

40
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:07,511
at the University of Texas and figured

41
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:09,012
I was heading for a career in teaching.

42
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,872
It's a long-sorted story why I ended up

43
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:12,572
making games instead, which I will tell you

44
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,753
if things get really slow.

45
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:17,639
But I always thought I was going to teach at some point.

46
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,063
I just didn't think it was going to be quite this soon.

47
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:24,470
I've been making games for 30 years, which sounds like a lot, but it really isn't.

48
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,393
It either kills you or keeps you young making games.

49
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,371
But the University of Texas actually, after many, many years of many of us twisting arms,

50
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:37,332
we just, they finally said, we're going to start a development program.

51
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:40,592
And the day came when I said, hey, wait a minute.

52
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:45,293
If anybody but me is directing that, I'm going to be really upset.

53
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:50,574
So I agreed to do it and, you know, I hope I get back to making games

54
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:51,734
or make some games on the side.

55
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:55,335
But right now, a little too soon, I'm a full-time academic.

56
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:05,678
So for my part, I guess that I'd always kind of wanted to be back in higher education ever since I graduated college.

57
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:13,022
I actually remember telling my friends, soon after I joined the game industry in the early 90s, that one day I would have a doctorate of ludology.

58
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:15,684
And they all laughed at me, but...

59
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:21,107
I'll show them. I mean, yes. And now we have doctorates of ludology.

60
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:27,650
So I started volunteering at USC in around about 2004, visiting classes, giving talks,

61
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,432
eventually mentoring students in the MFA program.

62
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:36,835
I got involved with IndyCade in 2009. I've been speaking at GDC since 2008.

63
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:41,318
So I think all of these things were connecting together for me.

64
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:44,759
at IndieCade, actually, in 2010.

65
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,579
I vividly remember where I was.

66
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,160
I was ironing a shirt in Eric Zimmerman's hotel room,

67
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,500
and I had this sudden realization

68
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,601
that I was heading towards sort of a crossroads

69
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:55,962
in my professional life,

70
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:57,282
one of these times when we can,

71
00:03:58,122 --> 00:03:59,763
where we have an opportunity to make a choice.

72
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,523
It was about halfway through the development

73
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:04,024
of Uncharted 3, and I realized that

74
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:07,265
while I'd had the most amazing time working at Naughty Dog,

75
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:09,185
it was a superlative place to be.

76
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:17,507
I had this opportunity to pursue the love for games and play as art and culture that I'd always nurtured,

77
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,528
really since the beginning of my time in the industry.

78
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:23,629
So as I started talking to my friends about what I might do next,

79
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:26,370
one of the friends I spoke to was Tracy Fullerton,

80
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,391
who's the chair of the Interactive Media and Games Division that I'm now part of,

81
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,871
and Tracy suggested that there might be a role available for me.

82
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:36,632
So I chased it up, and here I am.

83
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:43,151
For me, mine was really a happy coincidence.

84
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:47,957
I've gone into academia and then back into the industry,

85
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:50,460
and now I'm academia slash industry.

86
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,904
My current role actually requires me to remain active in the industry, which is...

87
00:04:55,731 --> 00:05:01,093
exactly what I want. The first time it was really one of jealousy, almost.

88
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:04,434
The guy, you know, is taking college classes. I love learning.

89
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:10,637
And as a frontline lead designer, you know, I envied my friends who were talking, like,

90
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:15,338
books that have been read, you know, that were written, that I just had no time to read,

91
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:18,720
or discussions that I wanted to have about games at a level.

92
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,711
that we just couldn't do when we're trying to hit milestone after milestone after milestone.

93
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:28,013
So, much like you, I was at a transition point and I happened to see an ad

94
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:31,234
looking for a game designer to teach.

95
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:35,556
So I went, you know, I ended up accepting that job.

96
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:38,037
And for me, once I got in there,

97
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:45,390
It was really working with the students that made it irresistible and why I had to go back.

98
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,051
Like my favorite classes to teach are the intro to game development classes.

99
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:53,532
Because for many students, this is, they've gotten, you know, they're maybe 18 or 19.

100
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,693
This is the first class they've ever taken in game development.

101
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:59,714
They've been told all their lives, you know, this is, you want to do what?

102
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:03,555
You want to go to college for this? You're going to pay money for people to teach you games?

103
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,737
And you see the first time that they're in that classroom,

104
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:09,038
and somebody there is validating what they've

105
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,559
wanted to do for 18 years, and they're on fire,

106
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,081
and they've got so much passion, that's a drug to me.

107
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:15,801
I love that.

108
00:06:15,862 --> 00:06:17,522
And so that's why I keep teaching.

109
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:20,564
That's how I got here, and that's why I keep doing it.

110
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,608
I was asked by a professor at UT Dallas, I think in 2002, to teach a class.

111
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:36,833
And so I did that probably for like a semester.

112
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:40,137
It was a cross-platform game development class.

113
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:42,159
And when it was over...

114
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:46,492
they basically told me, hey, why don't we create a curriculum

115
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:48,834
and do a game degree here at UTD?

116
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:51,336
And I was just like, this is not the place

117
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:52,937
to learn game development.

118
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:56,620
I had seen Full Sail, and I was like, that is really intense.

119
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,263
I kind of believe in you immerse yourself

120
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:02,866
every day for as long as you possibly

121
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:05,208
can in learning how to make games.

122
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:08,274
And that's all you do.

123
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,095
So I just said, this isn't the place.

124
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:14,158
We need a college here in Dallas to do that.

125
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:17,501
So I came up with the idea for the Guild Hall at SMU

126
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:21,624
and worked with these people to find the right people

127
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:25,367
to start that school, mostly because I

128
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:26,989
needed to hire people at my company.

129
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,130
I wanted them to come from Dallas.

130
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,033
I want them to be local and just come on over and start working.

131
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:34,635
So I never taught at the Guild Hall.

132
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:35,576
I just started it.

133
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:36,056
And then

134
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:42,411
And then later, basically working with UC Santa Cruz,

135
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:46,174
with my wife Brenda, we worked there for a little while,

136
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:49,297
basically shepherding students through their final quarter

137
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:52,059
of their BS degree, and had been talking to them

138
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:56,542
about starting a new, like, master's degree program

139
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,864
at UCSC, so that's what we developed

140
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:00,105
and what we're doing right now.

141
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:02,467
And it's a blast getting to work with.

142
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:07,940
You know, people that know how to code, but they really want to learn more about design

143
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,581
and how to develop really great games.

144
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:13,822
And so that's kind of what we're doing now. It's really fun.

145
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:19,083
I mean, it's exciting for me to hear that you all sort of have a passion for teaching

146
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,545
or for reaching the students or for being involved in these institutions.

147
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:32,380
It seems like in the end, whether you were recruited or had tinkered around it, there's a joy or a desire that's drawing you in.

148
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,303
But also, like Brenda mentioned, she gets to now be halftime academic, halftime industry.

149
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:43,087
So what are the obstacles, the challenges that you found taking these positions, whether they're challenges of mind?

150
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:46,675
this is a choice that I'm giving something up and I'm going to have to take this other thing.

151
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:47,677
What are you giving up?

152
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:55,086
And what are the other more logistical or odd challenges that I'm not thinking of that you might have?

153
00:08:55,451 --> 00:09:01,558
Well, at the top of my list in my notes, I have fear and self-doubt, which are, I suppose,

154
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:03,761
you know, major obstacles that we all face in life.

155
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:09,188
And you know, I guess it was a very big change for me, one that I hadn't necessarily seen

156
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:09,568
coming.

157
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:14,694
I did have some time to get used to the idea and explore it and talk to friends about it.

158
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,556
But I'm very glad that I did.

159
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:21,977
You know, I've always tried to push myself outside of my comfort zone a little bit,

160
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:28,100
try and be the kind of adventurous person that I love to be in the games that I play.

161
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,462
So if that's holding anyone back here who might be considering a change,

162
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:35,103
I would say push through that fear of the unknown,

163
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:38,644
because it's certainly been an amazingly rewarding experience for me.

164
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:41,930
I think one of the things that I know holds a lot of people back,

165
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:47,215
and it's changed, so if you've actually been pushed out because of this, I encourage you to push your way back in,

166
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:50,238
is the degree wall.

167
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,581
So you want to teach game development, do you have a PhD? No.

168
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:55,883
But I've worked on a hundred games, tough.

169
00:09:56,884 --> 00:10:02,109
And there's lots of game developers who I know are ready to move into academia who really want to do this.

170
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:09,355
and are unable to because they don't have a PhD or a master's, or maybe in some cases even a bachelor's.

171
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:18,503
But that's changing, and I'm noticing people, institutions accepting people or willing to work with people.

172
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,240
who don't have the terminal degree.

173
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:26,424
I think another challenge for a lot of game developers

174
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,586
coming in is, especially if they're coders,

175
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:31,208
so they're coming from game industry code salary

176
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:32,849
and they hear about academic salary.

177
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,951
And it's a shock.

178
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,618
And I will say, one of the things, though,

179
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:45,018
is being able to balance.

180
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:48,019
And it's full-time academic and then

181
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,219
slamming game development in everywhere

182
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,560
in all the available hours.

183
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,341
The supplementing whatever you're doing professionally

184
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,321
with whatever you're doing, whatever

185
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:02,442
you get from academia with consulting and other game dev

186
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:02,742
stuff.

187
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:05,443
But yeah, that's a wall for many.

188
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,532
I've experienced all of this, so I won't go back over it again.

189
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:15,838
For me, the most interesting challenge is I never realized how much of my personal sense

190
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:20,061
of self was tied up with, I am a game developer.

191
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:23,564
And now, what do I put on credit card applications?

192
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:25,685
Manager.

193
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:33,410
But that's been a surprisingly steep hurdle that I'm not actually over yet,

194
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,093
because I didn't have the advantage that some other people who've made this transition had,

195
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,534
in that I'm building something from scratch.

196
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:44,736
The Dean of Sam's Gaming Academy literally doesn't exist yet.

197
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:46,397
We're seating our first class on August 27th.

198
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,249
a date that has burned in my brain out of terror.

199
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,051
But it's been a full-time job and a half for me.

200
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:59,674
And my plan, my big master plan was I was going to do a little startup on the side.

201
00:11:59,694 --> 00:12:01,715
I had some folks who wanted to fund it, you know.

202
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:04,918
No, no, not yet.

203
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:09,241
I'm hoping a year from now, you know, I'll be able to get back to making some smaller

204
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:11,823
games, but right now, I can't do that.

205
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:12,864
So what do I call my...

206
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,445
Tell me what I call myself.

207
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,386
You're a game designer.

208
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:16,287
Game developer.

209
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:17,488
Yeah, you're a game developer, yeah.

210
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:17,988
Okay.

211
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,892
And I think you can own that.

212
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:22,812
You're Warren Spector.

213
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:23,713
Oh, give me a word.

214
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:24,354
Hi Warren.

215
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,255
Do they have a code for that?

216
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:29,198
Hey, there's no death matching with Warren Spector at this show.

217
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:32,560
There could be.

218
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,801
He's playing again at 4.30.

219
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:34,021
Yeah, see?

220
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,022
You can just go down there.

221
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:36,884
Yeah, we'll be happy.

222
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:42,851
Brenda and I both own a game company, and it's right across the street from UCSC.

223
00:12:42,891 --> 00:12:47,616
So it's really lucky for us that UCSC loves that we actually stay active in the industry

224
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,438
so we can keep on teaching the latest and greatest.

225
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:52,316
So we basically just walk across the street, back and forth.

226
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:53,878
You know, I'm actually jealous of that too.

227
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,760
We warned you this was going to be a conversation.

228
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:58,163
You guys have each other.

229
00:12:58,183 --> 00:12:58,904
Yeah.

230
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:04,090
And I describe myself as a guy sitting alone in a room with no windows, you know.

231
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:09,014
Well, it's awesome in a way, because I just get to make a bunch of stuff up.

232
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:10,495
It's like the early phases of making.

233
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:13,698
The game I'm making right now is the Gaming Academy.

234
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:14,458
It's very strange.

235
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:16,259
Basically, what do they need to know?

236
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,780
Yeah.

237
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,901
What do I want to teach them?

238
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:18,561
Yeah, exactly.

239
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,824
This kind of relates to one more challenge that I have faced, which is the challenge

240
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:24,025
of learning a new profession.

241
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:28,808
Because while I do have a little riff about the commonalities between being a game designer

242
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:33,472
and a teacher, of course, being a full-time educator is his own profession.

243
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,512
There's a lot to learn.

244
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:34,773
So...

245
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:38,123
I've never heard the word assessment until about two months ago.

246
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,389
Oh yeah, they're going to judge you.

247
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,031
Who knew?

248
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:43,618
You get an A for play.

249
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,001
The, when I first started teaching, I remember,

250
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:50,402
I think he's, I'm sure Ian Shriver's out there somewhere.

251
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:52,303
Maybe, maybe not.

252
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:55,285
But when I was talking with, hi Ian.

253
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:58,607
When I was just getting into teaching,

254
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,168
I remember like a week before,

255
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,709
I did have this tremendous crisis.

256
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:05,051
Like, what if I don't know anything?

257
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:08,032
I really, what if, and I really did,

258
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,414
like what if my students, what if I come in

259
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,035
and they're like, no kidding?

260
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:15,195
And I do have this overwhelming feeling like I had nothing.

261
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:17,256
And he said, Brenda, you can go in and just talk

262
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,156
about hitting a milestone.

263
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,817
You can talk about just what is your day like in a game

264
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:22,897
development studio.

265
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,618
And that may be, that'll be new stuff.

266
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,718
But I remember Ian having to talk me off the edge.

267
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:30,259
You know, this is after 20, I don't know,

268
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:31,379
25 years in game development.

269
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:33,660
One would have hoped I'd picked up something, right?

270
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:33,960
You know?

271
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,660
But I did.

272
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,600
I had that feeling.

273
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,441
And it was all new to me, like having to prepare lectures

274
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:40,881
or grading homework.

275
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:41,361
You know, it's a.

276
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:45,283
It was, but still, you know, very rewarding.

277
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:48,984
Yeah, well, so now that I've asked about challenges,

278
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:52,086
I mean, what are the rewards or surprises even

279
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:54,047
that you've encountered as you've shifted back to me?

280
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,128
I mean, both Warren and Richard sort of gestured at this idea that

281
00:14:57,598 --> 00:15:02,444
actually when you start heavily designing an academic curriculum, whether on a broad scale or for a class,

282
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:07,230
it is some of the work that you've been doing for your whole lives of game design.

283
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,535
What are other surprises like that, or if one of you guys wants to unpack that thought a little more?

284
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:16,761
For me, and this is actually riffing off something Warren said, to me, building

285
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:22,026
Building an academic program, to me, feels like building a game.

286
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:23,828
And I'm shipping students.

287
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:27,171
Yeah. Exactly right.

288
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:28,533
And it's very similar.

289
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:29,734
Like, what are all those systems?

290
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:30,995
What are the things they need to know?

291
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:33,057
And building that and making sure they get it all.

292
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:35,019
And also, we're in our first year,

293
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,302
and you guys are nowhere close to your first year, but...

294
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,405
it's iterative no matter what.

295
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,727
You have to change because the industry changes.

296
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:48,070
And so making, seeing, well, OK, so now we're the sequel.

297
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:48,771
It's the next year.

298
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:49,812
How do we want to change it?

299
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:52,694
Yeah, I mean, I guess this relates to my riff

300
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:55,737
about the commonalities between being, say, a lead game

301
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:56,697
designer and a teacher.

302
00:15:57,058 --> 00:16:00,320
I was really pleasantly surprised by just how much there

303
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:03,683
is in common between my new life as a professor

304
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:05,104
and my life as a lead game designer.

305
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:13,612
The classes that I teach are studio classes, so just as at Naughty Dog where I would work with a group of game designers

306
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:21,779
and we would all be making work and looking at it and talking about it and giving each other notes and debating the qualities of the gameplay.

307
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,302
So I still do, just with people with a little less experience,

308
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,723
but who are amazing game designers, bursting with ideas,

309
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:36,605
bursting with critical thought and ideas for innovation and originality.

310
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:41,507
And like you say, Brenda, we're developing systems, processes,

311
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:45,028
and we get to iterate on them semester by semester.

312
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:50,793
Yeah, the way I think about it is, you know, no plan survives first contact with the enemy and the students.

313
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:56,357
But seriously, I'm approaching this very much like like I would if I were creating a game.

314
00:16:56,397 --> 00:17:01,801
And in fact, the first day of classes, if any of you have already applied or want to apply or anything, just be warned.

315
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:02,702
Day one.

316
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,259
comment one from me, statement one, is going to be,

317
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,883
welcome to the Denia Sam's Gaming Academy version beta 1.0.

318
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,986
Because we're going to be changing it constantly.

319
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:14,408
Because, I mean, what I knew six months ago

320
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,691
might be out of date already.

321
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,833
You really have to keep making games to stay relevant.

322
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:19,854
I think that's critical.

323
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:20,314
Totally.

324
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,821
Yeah, which is what we do.

325
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,282
We actually have a game that's about to ship,

326
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:27,223
and we just started developing another big game.

327
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:29,164
I am so jealous.

328
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:33,326
We also do consulting, too, so we get lots of input on what's happening.

329
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:38,348
And it's useful for the students to hear, because we talk about other stuff, too.

330
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:41,070
We don't just, here's what we're teaching in this class,

331
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,351
but we also talk about, like, here's the latest thing that's happening in the industry

332
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:46,372
and what that means, and it's kind of here.

333
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:50,095
Everybody up on, like, it's about learning constantly.

334
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:52,217
Everything that's happening is all relevant.

335
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,919
Mm-hmm.

336
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,583
I'm actually, I'm kind of, I don't know if you have a little more to unpack there,

337
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:01,705
but I'm interested in unpacking just a little bit more.

338
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:07,666
sort of what you, the collective you,

339
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,507
can bring that's unique to academic programs

340
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,488
because you have this ongoing and past industry experience,

341
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:15,068
because you've shipped games,

342
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:19,369
from your perspective sort of as AAA superstars,

343
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,050
as our panel has titled you all?

344
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,950
Totally, sorry.

345
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,411
I didn't put the mic back on, bad me.

346
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:28,831
So I was just asking specifically,

347
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:36,329
To go off of what John was saying, the idea that coming from industry, there are special

348
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:38,430
unique things that they can bring to academic programs.

349
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,553
I'd be interested in what more you guys think you do bring from that stance.

350
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:47,356
Well, having made tons of games and shipped tons of stuff and been doing it for decades,

351
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:50,899
that experience is not anything that most students get.

352
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:56,382
And I think that's really, really valuable because we can talk about decades and how it was in that decade.

353
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,404
We can talk about lots of things we've tried.

354
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:02,686
We've tried, we've failed, we've done lots of stuff over the years.

355
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:08,249
And having that experience, we can tell them what's common and what doesn't change and what's really important.

356
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:11,446
And I think in the case of all of us,

357
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:13,107
our experience is very recent, too.

358
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:16,768
And in a business and in a medium that changes so rapidly,

359
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,669
I think recent experience is critical.

360
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:22,250
Right now, I'm in the process of hiring two full-time faculty

361
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:22,610
members.

362
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,411
And one of my requirements is that your experience

363
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:27,172
has come in the last three years.

364
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:29,392
And I'm even ashamed to say three years.

365
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:31,613
I want your experience to have been six months ago.

366
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:35,915
So recent experience, I think, as well as long-term

367
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:36,355
experience.

368
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:37,315
Last shift game.

369
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:37,815
Yeah.

370
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:39,256
Yeah, exactly.

371
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:45,780
The thing that I, where I see that there's a lot of values is going back to how similar

372
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,301
it is to being a lead game designer.

373
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:53,525
And even though, if I'm working with somebody in industry, I want my lead to have lots of

374
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,106
experience, not because...

375
00:19:56,323 --> 00:20:00,026
I feel that she has done great things during that time,

376
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,587
but with the lots of experience,

377
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:03,969
I know that she has seen things go wrong.

378
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,332
And the value in a lead to me is that they've seen

379
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:11,255
stuff go off the rails, she can spot it a mile away,

380
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:13,657
and she's not gonna panic about it.

381
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:16,719
And so that's the value in a lead.

382
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:19,861
And you see, over the course of 30 years,

383
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,703
you see a lot of stuff happen.

384
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:22,163
And so,

385
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:28,473
You know, for instance, our students just hit alpha, you know, and I let them know,

386
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:32,599
and I'm sure you guys deal with this too, I said, and I saw some of you out in the audience,

387
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:35,463
so I won't mention you by name, but I know roughly where you're sitting, Ian.

388
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:37,566
I'm sorry. Did I say I wouldn't say your name, Ian?

389
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:39,988
It's all Ian.

390
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:42,750
Anybody named Ian, I'll be referencing you all talk.

391
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,752
Anyway, but our students, you can see just this,

392
00:20:45,832 --> 00:20:48,894
like, everything, there's no way we could possibly hit alpha.

393
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:50,255
Everything's going to go to hell.

394
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:51,916
The whole world's going to catch on fire.

395
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:53,837
And just letting them know, like, you know what?

396
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:55,558
Somehow alpha will happen, and the world

397
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:56,519
will not catch on fire.

398
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:58,040
And you're going to be thrilled when it gets there.

399
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,682
And that's just, that's not to say that when we're shipping,

400
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:02,123
we don't feel the same way.

401
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,470
Well, I mean, that's what I've tried to do.

402
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,713
TJ's in the front row and chuckling about this very issue.

403
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:09,954
Because, yeah, you know, we work to,

404
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:12,356
we try and bring the sort of structured methodology

405
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:15,078
for our students that we've learned in the industry

406
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:16,399
that we've had to kind of struggle

407
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:17,820
to get to grips with in the industry.

408
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:20,503
How to hit alpha well, how to not slip beta.

409
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:23,625
And yeah, I think it's always really valuable

410
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:26,707
to make yourself vulnerable to the students,

411
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:27,548
to tell them, look.

412
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:32,332
I know you're working really hard and maybe it hasn't gone as well as you might have liked

413
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:37,035
to make your game feature complete and let me tell you about that one time on this one

414
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:41,018
project where we managed to pull it out of the fire at the last minute.

415
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:43,720
That freedom to fail is critical, you know.

416
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,085
In the game business, if I fail too often or too frequently or too recently, I get fired.

417
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:54,306
In an academic setting, every failure is a learning opportunity.

418
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:59,228
One of the things that absolutely freaks the administrators out when I talk to them about this,

419
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:02,789
but I actually want to engineer failure into the program.

420
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:05,871
Because every failure is a learning opportunity.

421
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,131
Absolutely.

422
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:06,851
And it's safe.

423
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:11,676
Yeah, I mean, I think it was Tracy who really drew my attention to the fact that, in a way,

424
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:14,959
a big failure is a better learning experience than a big success,

425
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,382
when you're just learning how to be a game developer.

426
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:22,266
So, yeah, I always try and embody that rapid prototyping credo,

427
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:25,870
fail early, fail fast, fail often, in everything that we do, you know, in the program.

428
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,293
And I always say, to follow up on something Brenda said,

429
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:32,476
The game is not the product in my course.

430
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:34,457
The people and the knowledge they gain are the product.

431
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:35,038
And the experience.

432
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:36,439
And the experience, yeah.

433
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,462
At least I hope we can take what would take years to learn

434
00:22:40,602 --> 00:22:42,403
and compress it into a year.

435
00:22:43,304 --> 00:22:45,246
I mean, you're not going to get it overnight,

436
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:48,408
but I think we can do a lot of compression and career acceleration

437
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:50,850
in an academic setting that we don't have the time to do

438
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,952
if we have the skill to do it in our real life.

439
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:58,430
And with freedom to fail comes tremendous freedom to experiment and to innovate.

440
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,471
Because you've got to do something to fix it.

441
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:05,716
And we've had the same experience with, like, right now, even, like, with our alphas,

442
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:10,660
where we've had some teams hit a wall where they know that they haven't done something great

443
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,664
and they have to do something to fix it because we push innovation constantly while we're teaching.

444
00:23:15,684 --> 00:23:19,247
It's like if you're not doing something innovative and new and exciting, you shouldn't be making that game.

445
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:22,548
So that's kind of like one of our high bars

446
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,609
that they have to hit, and they know when they haven't hit it,

447
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,329
and then it's time for a redesign,

448
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:27,949
or it's a reboot or something.

449
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,750
So they've kind of hit that failure point

450
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,791
that they've recognized, and then they get to fix it.

451
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,451
And fix it in crunch mode.

452
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:40,953
We can keep going.

453
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,073
Yeah, no, I know you can.

454
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:43,134
I sort of don't want to cut you off.

455
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:44,374
I actually want to, I sort of want

456
00:23:44,394 --> 00:23:46,315
to hear the four of you talk a little bit about crunch

457
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,435
vis-a-vis the Academy.

458
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:48,995
I don't know if anybody has thoughts on that.

459
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:53,409
I absolutely do. I think it relates to what we were just talking about because

460
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:56,710
you know part of the reason that we want to teach a

461
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,451
structured production methodology is so we can have the conversation about

462
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:02,251
quality of life

463
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:05,992
and certainly I've given it to myself as a mandate

464
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:10,813
to address this issue very directly with my students. You know the game

465
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:13,813
industry historically has had a problem with crunch.

466
00:24:14,674 --> 00:24:17,314
with people working too hard for too long

467
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:20,435
and hurting themselves physically and psychologically

468
00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:23,456
and often leaving the industry, leading to

469
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:26,177
this terrible wastage of experience.

470
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:29,958
Some of our most experienced people leaving the industry and going

471
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:33,519
to a profession where they can have a better work-life balance.

472
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:36,480
I mean, I think that the game industry has managed to really

473
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:40,182
start to work to get this under control in a lot of very

474
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:42,943
responsible ways in the last decade or so, really.

475
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:46,425
But I think that we have great opportunities as educators to

476
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:48,266
have really frank conversations with our

477
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,106
students about this.

478
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:55,209
And while I'm a big fan of working hard in a sustained

479
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:58,271
way for the right amount of time to achieve excellence at

480
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:01,052
a certain critical stage of the project, I really try and

481
00:25:01,072 --> 00:25:02,033
encourage my students.

482
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:06,815
not to crunch in the way that some people do to their detriment.

483
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,736
I don't know how you guys feel about this.

484
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:13,618
It's interesting, the quality of life, I mean, I feel

485
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:18,040
you know, I have conflicted thoughts on it, right? Because

486
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:21,722
I get up in the morning and I'm awake and I'm reading about games

487
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:25,044
or I'm playing a game and then I go to work and

488
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,466
I'm talking about or working on games for

489
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:30,346
eight to ten hours and then I come home.

490
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,687
and I'm working on games for a couple hours, then I might play a game

491
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:38,111
before I go to bed. And this is pretty much my life and that is quality

492
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:41,635
for me. It would drive other people to institutions, I'm sure,

493
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:44,538
not of higher learning, but the other kind.

494
00:25:45,238 --> 00:25:47,581
But that to me is a quality life and

495
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:52,606
I also recognize that's not for everybody.

496
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,929
It's also a choice for you. I mean, for many of us...

497
00:25:57,429 --> 00:25:59,551
I don't feel like it was, though. I've been making...

498
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,213
Like, I don't feel like I ever had another living I could have had.

499
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,615
You have a milestone coming up. You know, you've got a...

500
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:10,000
Your publisher throws in a demo that, you know, is required in a week,

501
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,362
and, no, you can't have more time. I mean, that's not a choice.

502
00:26:13,382 --> 00:26:14,263
No, okay, that's right.

503
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:15,044
You just have to do it.

504
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:18,927
Yeah, so I... And I still have that publisher, so I still eat that.

505
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:27,330
But that said, you know, I don't want the students to overwork themselves. I feel like our milestones are reasonable.

506
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:35,733
And we do talk about that. Like I tell them about the CEO I work for who says he's going to make everybody crunch in January and February.

507
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:39,735
And I was on the team and I said, why? And he said, because we did it last year and it worked great.

508
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,976
But there's no goal that you're trying to hit.

509
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:43,717
Don't care.

510
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,378
That's an actual conversation.

511
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:46,699
So I tell the students about that.

512
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,760
That is, that's, well, thanks.

513
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,421
I'm leaving, Crunch.

514
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:53,063
And we talk about all the various ways it shows up.

515
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:55,064
The death marches that I've been on,

516
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:57,406
had to crunch for nine months, seven days a week.

517
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:03,985
we talk about the range of it because you don't want to go into a place where that's happened.

518
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:10,446
You know, and hopefully what I try to encourage is you're working on your game every single day,

519
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:16,347
you know, leaving not planning well ends to disaster in the end and leads to these type

520
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:20,328
of crunches. I think that's the same stuff we would do in industry. Having said that,

521
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:25,089
okay, true confessions, there are times when crunch is really cool.

522
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:29,993
It's bonding and it's energizing.

523
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:33,719
It's pretty damn cool

524
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,723
a lot of the time. There are times when it's not

525
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,928
and I think what we have to do is communicate to our students.

526
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:43,810
you know, when it's too much and why you want to do it,

527
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,752
and what are the values that can be gained from it,

528
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,652
and what are the damages that can be done by it.

529
00:27:49,013 --> 00:27:51,133
But I'll tell you, the freakiest thing to me,

530
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:52,454
and maybe I shouldn't say this,

531
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:55,675
because it's going to sound like I'm an advocate of crunch in a big way,

532
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:59,637
but the University of Texas shuts its buildings down at 11 o'clock at night.

533
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:01,978
You're not allowed in the building after 11,

534
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:04,919
and I'm going, wow, that's so not like me.

535
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:06,600
There's no crunch happening there, yeah.

536
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,021
That's the middle of the afternoon for a program.

537
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:11,902
Yeah, my best working attitude after that.

538
00:28:11,962 --> 00:28:13,702
Well, everyone takes their laptops outside then.

539
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,463
That'll probably be what...

540
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:16,783
No, that won't be what happens.

541
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:18,504
We won't do that.

542
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:23,145
At our small company, when we started this last company, Loot Drop, in 2010,

543
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:26,807
and we started working on our first game, we had a really small office space,

544
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:30,568
and we had maybe, jeez, eight people or ten people.

545
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:35,452
working on it and then our company grew to 40 and we'd move to different, to two different times,

546
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:37,954
but everybody remembers that first space and

547
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:41,597
the crunch that we were on is just like the best time they've ever had in game development.

548
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:47,682
And it's just because it was a small team. We loved what we were doing, which is the big differentiator between crunch and not crunch.

549
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:51,064
and everybody got to know each other really well

550
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:51,965
and everyone liked each other.

551
00:28:52,546 --> 00:28:55,368
But for me it's just part and parcel of best practices

552
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:56,368
and good methodology.

553
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:58,270
It's just a question of saying to the guys

554
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,831
something as simple as, hey, you know,

555
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,053
maybe the time when you should be working hard

556
00:29:02,113 --> 00:29:04,655
on your project is not at the end, but in the middle.

557
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,617
When you're heading towards alpha and beta.

558
00:29:07,657 --> 00:29:09,838
Because if you're all frazzled at the end,

559
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:11,780
you'll make silly mistakes at the last minute

560
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,641
and ruin, you know, an otherwise.

561
00:29:14,322 --> 00:29:15,343
perfectly brilliant game.

562
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:16,143
Well, really.

563
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:16,844
Go ahead.

564
00:29:16,904 --> 00:29:17,825
And these are the kinds of things

565
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:20,207
that you have to win through experience, I think,

566
00:29:20,347 --> 00:29:21,808
unless you can kind of.

567
00:29:22,408 --> 00:29:24,330
Also, just like planning correctly,

568
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,272
which is obviously what everybody harps on about.

569
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:27,933
Bad planning leads to crunch.

570
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:32,297
Leaving lots of time in your milestones is really helpful.

571
00:29:32,377 --> 00:29:34,438
Like right now, one of the games that we're developing,

572
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,360
we turned in our third milestone.

573
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,561
We're already working on the fifth one.

574
00:29:38,264 --> 00:29:40,526
And so we're like months ahead, which is really great

575
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,067
because if it ever gets to a point where,

576
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:44,448
oh, beta is looking like it's gonna be taking

577
00:29:44,488 --> 00:29:46,190
some extra time, we have tons of padding.

578
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:50,388
and so if you can plan that and get the right number of people to do that

579
00:29:50,648 --> 00:29:54,289
then you don't have a crunch. Mattie Burns said this really interesting thing

580
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:57,689
last year that has stayed with me and that I've tried to use. He said that he

581
00:29:57,789 --> 00:29:58,889
feared that because

582
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:02,630
maybe as teachers of game design we might not have

583
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,491
our eye on the ball of the scope of our students' designs

584
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:09,651
as we might have at the beginning of their processes

585
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:13,572
and then when we get to what I believe is technically known as the

586
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:14,492
oh shit moment.

587
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:18,615
in the middle of a project, when we suddenly realize how much we have left to do,

588
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:22,859
the students kind of in school might tend to learn that they have to work

589
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,421
harder and harder and harder towards the end. So now,

590
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:29,164
as a teacher of game design, I'm trying to make sure that I work really hard at

591
00:30:29,184 --> 00:30:30,325
the beginning of the project

592
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:34,609
with my students to make sure that their projects are well scoped. And then all of this

593
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:38,452
other good stuff kind of leads from that in a very natural way that leads toward

594
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:39,273
best practices.

595
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:41,955
Yeah, the scoping is like massively important.

596
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:44,157
That's like so unbelievably important.

597
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:46,379
Errors at the beginning magnify over time.

598
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,402
That's just like basic common sense.

599
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:52,865
And so we have a really great advisory board

600
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,466
that's there to choose.

601
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:57,068
We have our teams design three pitches.

602
00:30:57,729 --> 00:30:59,951
And the advisory board, which is all industry people

603
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:01,973
and academics, basically as many of them

604
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:04,015
come as possible to vet these pitches.

605
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:07,437
And then they get to choose, and they get to just critique it,

606
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:10,339
and just scope is like the number one thing that they look at,

607
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:11,820
whether it's even doable or not.

608
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,443
And then from that point, then they can kind of go on with the thing

609
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,604
that the industry panels decided,

610
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:20,906
this is good, but you need to do this, you know,

611
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,428
and try and help us scope at the very beginning before they...

612
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:28,811
That's another interesting advantage of having people who've just come out of the industry.

613
00:31:28,831 --> 00:31:33,954
I have plenty of friends that I can shame into participating in this program.

614
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:40,018
So we have a development council as well that's going to be part of the absolutely terrifying review process, I hope.

615
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:46,281
I mean, it's kind of intimidating going. I mean, I've had to pitch to the CEO of the Walt Disney Company, you know.

616
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:54,667
And I remember back in the day pitching to the CEO of Electronic Arts and the Executive Vice President of Sales and everything.

617
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:58,108
I mean, it's pretty intimidating. I want students to have that experience too.

618
00:31:58,128 --> 00:32:03,530
Because you're inevitably going to get up in front of people who are going to make you stutter and stammer.

619
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,691
And getting that experience before you actually have to do it to get paid, I think, is a really good thing.

620
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:15,633
You know, this relates, I don't know why what you said made me think of this, but what an early question, the challenges.

621
00:32:16,474 --> 00:32:19,677
One of the things that, and you also mentioned something about this,

622
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:23,280
going from industry into academia, you mentioned that it's

623
00:32:24,061 --> 00:32:27,665
it's a whole different profession, which is obvious, but just because you're

624
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:31,649
you are a game developer, maybe you're even an award-winning game developer,

625
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:33,731
doesn't mean that you have the foggiest idea

626
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,973
how to captivate a room full of people.

627
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:41,217
and how to, and I wished that there had been some little boot camp for,

628
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:44,399
so you're a game designer and you'd like to come teach people.

629
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:49,022
I'm a teacher, let me tell you what I know about working with students.

630
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,603
Nobody on a milestone comes up to me and

631
00:32:51,623 --> 00:32:56,887
you know like, I've never had to massively alter someone's life to say you

632
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:59,889
failed this course and I'm sorry but you're not going to be able to graduate.

633
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:03,811
Oh my god, it's like the worst thing I can imagine and I had to do it.

634
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:05,753
UT has someone like that, actually.

635
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,095
I mean, I'm sure they have many, but there's

636
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:11,398
a woman in the College of Communication, where I am,

637
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:13,560
whose job is to work with teachers

638
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,901
to make them better teachers.

639
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:15,821
Oh, that's great.

640
00:33:15,901 --> 00:33:17,803
Yeah, I meet with her every, well, not right now,

641
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:18,704
because I'm too busy.

642
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:20,205
But I was meeting with her every Thursday

643
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:22,547
and intend to get back into that at some point.

644
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:25,389
I think this is, in fact, the session where the game

645
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:27,391
designers who may or may not be sitting in the audience

646
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:29,753
and are thinking about moving to academia would love.

647
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:34,531
those five pieces of advice that each of you wish someone had given you before you made the jump.

648
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:37,634
I'm accepting applications now, by the way, both for students and for faculty.

649
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:42,139
But do you have, I mean, in that, do you have thoughts, things that you would tell

650
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,963
to a colleague who came to you and said, I'm thinking about going and teaching.

651
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:49,927
What should I know? What should I do? How can I prepare?

652
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:53,805
Learn the meaning of the word assessment and learn the meaning of the word rubric.

653
00:33:57,228 --> 00:33:59,831
Although the rubric's just the rules of the game, isn't it?

654
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:03,614
It's the stuff at the end that tells you the ground conditions for the clubs.

655
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:12,363
I would say, if you're thinking about it, start now on getting your resume and your background together.

656
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:20,539
every game, every article, every award, everything on your resume because that, to get a resume

657
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,822
that you, if you're going to work at Naughty Dog, you're going to put one thing together,

658
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:29,687
but if you're preparing a, I'm heading into academia CV, that's a massive deal.

659
00:34:30,826 --> 00:34:34,547
when John was going was looking at going to

660
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:38,689
UCSC and I asked so let me see your resume and I don't have one.

661
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:43,430
You didn't have to make a resume did you? Oh yeah. I didn't have to make a resume.

662
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:48,192
They just let me skate through. Yeah basically UCSC is this huge machine.

663
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:51,433
Well what do you think he's at a machine? Yeah the state schools.

664
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:55,454
I'm at a big machine with lots of grit and gears. They knew who you are.

665
00:34:57,015 --> 00:35:00,036
But it was all the way back to, I mean, every award,

666
00:35:00,136 --> 00:35:00,936
all the articles.

667
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:03,997
And that's important, because especially if you don't have

668
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:09,059
a PhD, and he doesn't, you have to, and I have a bachelor's,

669
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,260
and I'm partway through a master's.

670
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,401
If you don't have that, you have to justify it with experience.

671
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:16,962
And all that experience needs to be verified on paper.

672
00:35:17,522 --> 00:35:20,543
And it was a pretty massive undertaking to do that.

673
00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:25,927
I don't know how generalizable this is, but my program is currently a certificate program.

674
00:35:25,947 --> 00:35:30,370
The university didn't want to dive into a full degree program until it was proved out.

675
00:35:30,931 --> 00:35:36,435
And as part of a certificate program, applicants for faculty positions don't have to, I mean,

676
00:35:36,455 --> 00:35:37,275
I get to just pick.

677
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,136
It's you.

678
00:35:38,196 --> 00:35:39,317
It's like an interview.

679
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:44,580
Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's essentially, I determined the requirements, the job requirements,

680
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,962
and I get to interview people, and then I get to pick.

681
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:48,463
And it's kind of the same with the students.

682
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:52,749
The students don't have to go through the standard, you know, the main building,

683
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:54,271
which is where the admissions department is.

684
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:55,612
They don't have to go through any of that.

685
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:57,074
Go for a certificate program.

686
00:35:58,045 --> 00:36:01,767
If anybody's, if you're a game developer and you're thinking of doing it, I would do it.

687
00:36:01,907 --> 00:36:04,968
Man, I've just, I love working with students so much.

688
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:09,129
And I love that, you know, like I'm working on the Trail of Tears game right now.

689
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,510
What's the ship they don't know?

690
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:17,513
You know, and then I have that kind of freedom to pursue projects that nobody in their right mind would ever publish.

691
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:21,494
And that I'm working with students who are just so incredibly excited.

692
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:22,735
Like, after they hit alpha...

693
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:26,795
and they showed their games in front of the review board,

694
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:29,217
the happiness that I saw among them

695
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,840
was enough to power me through GDC.

696
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:34,623
Isn't it, it's so exciting.

697
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:35,644
It really is amazing.

698
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:38,547
I mean, I guess that would be maybe my biggest piece

699
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:40,909
of advice that you may have heard teachers say.

700
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,114
You know what makes this experience so meaningful is the students, but it's absolutely true.

701
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:47,335
It's absolutely true.

702
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:55,042
The energy, the ideas, the enthusiasm of the people that we teach is the most incredibly

703
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:57,364
sustaining thing, I think, about the experience.

704
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:02,549
Another piece of advice is, I mean, I guess this kind of connects to what you guys have been saying.

705
00:37:02,629 --> 00:37:07,153
I feel like I began to learn how to be a teacher here at GDC, really,

706
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:12,158
by being lucky enough to be able to give talks, by going to roundtables, actually,

707
00:37:12,238 --> 00:37:13,720
and beginning to learn how to...

708
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,022
have a debate in front of a room of 30 people,

709
00:37:18,143 --> 00:37:21,405
you know, meeting people in the halls, meeting some of my heroes, you know.

710
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:24,487
And so I think that

711
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:26,968
if you once long ago on

712
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,153
PBS I heard, I wish I could remember the name of the motivational speaker, but it

713
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:35,634
was a talk about transforming your life, you know, if you were

714
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:39,797
perhaps not completely happy with what you were doing and you wanted to

715
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:45,023
create a new career for yourself, then the advice that this person gave was to

716
00:37:45,624 --> 00:37:50,169
not change it all at once, not don't quit your day job and throw all your savings

717
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,272
into this new thing, but do it bit by bit.

718
00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:56,537
So consider, you know, giving a talk at a local community college or a

719
00:37:56,997 --> 00:38:01,382
you know, a local university, get involved with the IGDA or, you know,

720
00:38:01,422 --> 00:38:04,225
with some other game development organization

721
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,769
and see where it leads. Because I think that I'm very lucky that that sort of

722
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:08,569
happened to me quite

723
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,594
serendipitously. Suddenly, without my realizing it, without my planning it,

724
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:14,396
suddenly all the stars were aligned

725
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:18,560
for me to be able to move into this role. So... Can I ask a question related to that?

726
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:23,489
So I've given a lot of talks at GDC, I've given a lot of talks at universities,

727
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:28,291
and I may not be any good at it, but I'm really comfortable doing it.

728
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:32,332
And I don't know how that, I haven't started teaching yet.

729
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:33,993
The teaching starts in the fall.

730
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:37,434
I don't know how that's going to translate to,

731
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:40,015
I have to get up three times a week and talk for an hour and a half.

732
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:41,436
It totally translates.

733
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:54,479
Well, okay. We're done. Thanks for coming. Smaller audience. It really does. It does totally translate. I have one small caveat. I found I'm always chronically over prepared for most everything I do.

734
00:38:54,979 --> 00:39:03,921
And one of the tough things for me to learn has been that I don't need to be quite as prepared with lecture materials and stuff as I think that I need to.

735
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:07,402
If I have a few good talking points for class.

736
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:10,864
The students will bring all the most brilliant information

737
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:11,564
into the room.

738
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:12,925
That's if it's interactive.

739
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:14,747
But that's one of the things you need to plan,

740
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,248
is that it's going to be an interactive class,

741
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:16,988
and not just a free tea.

742
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:18,930
That's true, and not a lecture class.

743
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,192
But I don't know if any of you guys caught the great seven

744
00:39:22,232 --> 00:39:25,675
exercises for teachers of game design session that

745
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:27,876
was in this room this morning that John Sharp and Colleen

746
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:28,477
Macklin ran.

747
00:39:28,777 --> 00:39:32,600
But exercises, Warren, I think they're also your secret

748
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:32,920
weapon.

749
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,662
My classes love programming tests.

750
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:42,309
Just like throw a pro, well, like, I guess, when they're done with this class, they're

751
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:45,892
going to be in the industry and the more prep that they get, the better.

752
00:39:45,912 --> 00:39:51,058
So it's like, here's Blizzard's test, if you're a coder, you know, here's one that we give,

753
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:55,362
you know, just like randomly, just, they're not graded on it, but it's like, here's what's

754
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:57,544
going to happen, you know, it's very useful.

755
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:01,239
And one of the things, just with classes,

756
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,841
is I too would have this.

757
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,643
This is exactly what we're going to talk about today,

758
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:07,205
be boop kind of whatever.

759
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:10,009
And the current course that I'm teaching,

760
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:11,911
although I guess it's over now, but the current course

761
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,073
that I'm teaching over now, it's finals week.

762
00:40:14,113 --> 00:40:14,734
It's over for me.

763
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:17,275
Not for you guys.

764
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,696
So the current course is about non-digital game design.

765
00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:22,637
Really just right down to the metal.

766
00:40:22,697 --> 00:40:24,618
How do you, I guess not down to the wood,

767
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:26,259
down to the prototype parts, whatever.

768
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:27,519
The cardboard.

769
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,600
Down to the cardboard.

770
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,981
And just looking at game mechanics and game design

771
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:33,262
at its most fundamental level.

772
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:41,126
And being comfortable in completely derailing a whole class, I had about, this is stupid,

773
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:45,448
but this is what I did, I had 15 minutes budgeted for discussing what is a game.

774
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:51,491
And we actually had to put, we had like guest speakers come in and you'd see like,

775
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:54,333
so let's talk about, you know, it's interesting to me, what is a game?

776
00:40:54,353 --> 00:40:56,334
And you'd watch my students like, oh man, this is a week.

777
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:00,477
still talking about it now, you know?

778
00:41:00,517 --> 00:41:02,118
Probably, right?

779
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:07,143
But being flexible in some of the best conversations have come up, have happened,

780
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:09,906
because these are the things that we're going to talk about today,

781
00:41:10,086 --> 00:41:11,728
and then somehow something else happens.

782
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:13,950
And that's so rewarding.

783
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:14,931
Some of those...

784
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:15,772
You should take a note.

785
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,894
Some of those conversations can be the best.

786
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:17,954
Oh.

787
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:22,738
Great thing about, that's very different in academia that I love,

788
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,640
whereas if I said, yeah, we're doing something really cool in our current game,

789
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,202
what are you doing? Can't tell you, can't share.

790
00:41:28,543 --> 00:41:32,126
But in academia, it's like, well, no, I'll just send you my, I'll send you all my notes.

791
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:34,367
I'll send you my stuff. Send me all your notes.

792
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:38,291
There's no NDAs, right? So it's, so it's very, it's very open,

793
00:41:39,572 --> 00:41:43,094
which was something to get used to. You're going to post my slides online.

794
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:49,169
It's very free and I like that.

795
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:51,470
So what about the other side of this?

796
00:41:51,930 --> 00:42:04,038
For the institutions, should there be any institutions in the room who are interested in hiring high-level game designers to come from industry and become a part of their program or build a program?

797
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:06,019
Would you have advice for institutions like that?

798
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:08,200
How they can make the position more appealing?

799
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,081
Pay better.

800
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:10,121
Prepare.

801
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:11,462
Pay better.

802
00:42:12,682 --> 00:42:17,606
How they can also prepare their institution or prepare the situation for success.

803
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,088
Remove bureaucratic barriers.

804
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:25,833
I thought Disney had a lot of bureaucracy.

805
00:42:25,953 --> 00:42:29,516
Allowing professors to work on the side is great.

806
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:33,479
UCSC lets students own their own IP, which is really valuable

807
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:36,902
because it means that they don't have to hold back their best ideas while they're in school.

808
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:39,645
They can just make them and own them and take them out and publish them.

809
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:42,348
That's super valuable.

810
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:43,730
I'm sure everyone's been there.

811
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,634
We're like, that's a great idea, but I'm not going to do anything about it yet.

812
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:50,697
I've already talked about the degree wall,

813
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:53,880
but I know that affects so many game developers.

814
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,042
Some of the best game developers in the game industry

815
00:42:57,082 --> 00:42:59,183
don't, game developers in the automotive industry,

816
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,804
obviously the game industry,

817
00:43:01,265 --> 00:43:04,827
some of the best game developers don't have a degree,

818
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:06,749
but they've got this knowledge that we want.

819
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:09,371
So if you're unwilling to allow them to teach

820
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:11,112
unless they have that formal degree,

821
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:14,074
maybe give them a pathway where they could do that.

822
00:43:14,854 --> 00:43:17,616
You know, that's just such a needless bureaucratic barrier.

823
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:18,886
I don't have a degree.

824
00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:20,307
You have a high school degree.

825
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:21,047
Oh, sorry.

826
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:21,908
High school diploma.

827
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:27,171
That's why in my program, I tell people there are three ways into the program.

828
00:43:27,252 --> 00:43:31,334
Graduate from an existing game development program so you kind of know how to make games

829
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:31,735
already.

830
00:43:32,715 --> 00:43:37,038
Have three-ish, one to three years experience in the game business and want to accelerate

831
00:43:37,058 --> 00:43:37,859
your career path.

832
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:41,361
And convince me you're God's gift to gaming because I don't want to be the guy who turns

833
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,402
away the next John Romero or Richard Gere.

834
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,764
I'm not going to be that guy.

835
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:55,910
I guess if I had a piece of advice for an institution looking to attract people from one of the many different game industries to their school,

836
00:43:56,351 --> 00:44:00,654
it might be to think about what the value proposition is, you know, for that person.

837
00:44:01,254 --> 00:44:07,939
And I think that universities and other kinds of educational institutions have an amazing opportunity right now,

838
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:15,024
when so many folks who have worked in one part of the game industry or another have this burning desire to make

839
00:44:15,745 --> 00:44:19,168
unique, innovative, idiosyncratic work.

840
00:44:19,628 --> 00:44:22,831
And as you were just talking about, Brenda,

841
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:25,834
we have great opportunities to do that in the academy.

842
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:29,477
So that's certainly something that drew me to USC.

843
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:33,701
I'm working on an independent design research project

844
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:37,024
right now, and doing things that I always

845
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:39,166
tried to get started when I was working

846
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:42,008
as a full-time professional AAA developer.

847
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:47,393
that I just couldn't do because my whole mind was full of whatever project I was working on.

848
00:44:48,614 --> 00:44:54,058
And in any case, I've often said that being at USC is like being at GDC every day.

849
00:44:54,078 --> 00:45:02,465
I love GDC so much. It would be my one week of the year where I'd really get to come and talk about games and play

850
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:07,069
and the process of designing these cultural artifacts.

851
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:13,475
different unconstrained way and that's a freedom that we also have in the academy.

852
00:45:14,135 --> 00:45:20,541
So you have a lot to draw people to you, so consider how you can articulate that to folks

853
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:23,284
when you're doing a job search or whatever.

854
00:45:26,527 --> 00:45:32,072
All right, I'm going to circle back once more to something that came up early because it's

855
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:33,273
actually my favorite topic.

856
00:45:34,475 --> 00:45:34,835
which is...

857
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:35,736
Dungeons and Dragons?

858
00:45:35,976 --> 00:45:36,196
Yes.

859
00:45:36,556 --> 00:45:40,339
That's Richard Hasrelli veiled my true favorite topic.

860
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:41,999
We're going to just throw this panel out now

861
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:43,840
and talk about D&D for 15 minutes.

862
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:44,441
No, um...

863
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:45,561
Vornheim, actually.

864
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:47,042
Sam's my DM in Vornheim.

865
00:45:47,322 --> 00:45:49,784
But, no, so we talked a couple of times

866
00:45:50,324 --> 00:45:52,625
about the similarities

867
00:45:52,946 --> 00:45:54,687
between designing curriculum,

868
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:55,787
between being a teacher,

869
00:45:55,827 --> 00:45:56,988
between the shared skills you have,

870
00:45:57,008 --> 00:45:58,269
whether you're talking to GDC

871
00:45:58,309 --> 00:45:59,189
and how much that's like...

872
00:46:00,128 --> 00:46:02,911
talking in a classroom, or how the systems design work

873
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:05,273
you do as a game designer is like the systems design work

874
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:08,896
you do in potentially building a class.

875
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:12,399
So are there other things there that are really applicable?

876
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:15,902
What are the similarities for you as someone leading

877
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:19,485
your daily life between having been a game designer

878
00:46:19,525 --> 00:46:22,147
and now being a games academic?

879
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:26,210
Is it a huge change, or is it a surprisingly subtle shift?

880
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:33,588
Well, in designing a program, again, I'm at a little bit of a disadvantage here in that I haven't actually started this yet.

881
00:46:33,688 --> 00:46:38,192
But my process is, you know, you start with what is the outcome?

882
00:46:39,053 --> 00:46:41,255
And that's very much the way I always approach design.

883
00:46:41,275 --> 00:46:43,237
I mean, what do you what do you want players to experience?

884
00:46:43,277 --> 00:46:45,359
What do you want them to feel? What do you want them to do?

885
00:46:45,399 --> 00:46:49,804
What are the verbs? And that's exactly the way I've approached the curriculum.

886
00:46:50,064 --> 00:46:50,765
Again, it's not just.

887
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:54,186
designing a course, I'm designing an entire course of study,

888
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:58,627
and it's very much that, you know, what is the outcome,

889
00:46:58,667 --> 00:47:03,449
what is the output, what do the players have to have experienced along the way.

890
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:06,230
So it's very similar in that respect.

891
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,191
I bet it's going to be a lot like running a paper game campaign for you, Warren.

892
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:15,412
Oh, if you want to talk about D&D, I'm your guy.

893
00:47:15,512 --> 00:47:18,393
I've got an agenda here. Let's go.

894
00:47:18,413 --> 00:47:20,014
Mitch is taking over the panel.

895
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:35,907
Well, because I think it is, you know, those hours you spend in the evening at home drawing your maps and creating the characters and then all of a sudden the players are there in the room, you've got your DM, your moderator's shield and you're rolling the dice.

896
00:47:36,547 --> 00:47:39,170
Don't forget they all have stat sheets which contain grades.

897
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,172
Oh, I'm not grading anybody.

898
00:47:42,232 --> 00:47:42,413
Oh.

899
00:47:42,453 --> 00:47:43,894
I've got a cunning plan for that.

900
00:47:43,934 --> 00:47:45,535
Get some CA's, yeah.

901
00:47:45,575 --> 00:47:47,477
No, no, no, no, no, there will be no grades in my program.

902
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:50,394
Saving clothes.

903
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:50,855
Saving clothes.

904
00:47:52,216 --> 00:47:53,458
But improvable saving clothes.

905
00:47:53,518 --> 00:47:54,900
I can't reveal all my secrets.

906
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,481
Oh, wait.

907
00:47:56,894 --> 00:47:59,136
I guess for us, the similarities are that we're just,

908
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:00,937
we're teaching what we know.

909
00:48:01,397 --> 00:48:02,578
And so we're still talking about,

910
00:48:02,698 --> 00:48:04,279
we're constantly talking about the things

911
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:05,580
that we do all the time.

912
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,522
Like some of our classes are how to start an LLC,

913
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:12,344
how to handle HR, how to get a lawyer,

914
00:48:12,845 --> 00:48:13,445
just all the stuff,

915
00:48:13,485 --> 00:48:15,546
because these people need to start companies.

916
00:48:15,747 --> 00:48:16,767
They need to start making stuff.

917
00:48:16,787 --> 00:48:17,788
They need to own IP.

918
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,209
They need to know the value of IP

919
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,610
versus making someone else's IP more valuable.

920
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,772
And so we have professional courses that are just,

921
00:48:25,393 --> 00:48:29,175
giving them all the information about like, here's my 10 startups and how they went.

922
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:34,459
And, you know, just tons of information about not just the game stuff, but what's around

923
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:35,380
the game development.

924
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,020
That's great.

925
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:40,170
And does that feel like the life of a game developer

926
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:40,530
a little bit?

927
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,971
I mean, in the same way we juggle and all.

928
00:48:41,991 --> 00:48:43,572
We run companies, so it happens all the time.

929
00:48:43,592 --> 00:48:43,852
Right, right.

930
00:48:43,872 --> 00:48:45,033
Your life is juggling these 20 things.

931
00:48:45,073 --> 00:48:47,354
You know, but the thing that's changed for me tremendously,

932
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:48,515
being a game developer, is that one

933
00:48:48,535 --> 00:48:49,655
of the things that drew me into academia

934
00:48:49,715 --> 00:48:52,197
is I felt like, having started in game development in 81,

935
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:53,677
I was a little bit more comfortable with the fact

936
00:48:53,737 --> 00:48:54,518
that I was a game developer.

937
00:48:54,538 --> 00:48:55,158
I was a game developer.

938
00:48:55,178 --> 00:48:55,678
I was a game developer.

939
00:48:55,698 --> 00:48:56,659
I was a game developer.

940
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:57,660
I was a game developer.

941
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:00,903
there were no programs about making games.

942
00:49:01,603 --> 00:49:03,565
And so while I was making games,

943
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:05,046
people were studying games,

944
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:06,607
and they were writing about games,

945
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:08,328
and they were having conversations about games,

946
00:49:08,368 --> 00:49:10,950
and so I would find myself going to GDC

947
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,492
and hanging out with the academic game developers.

948
00:49:15,373 --> 00:49:19,796
And very energized by the conversations that I would be having with those people.

949
00:49:19,836 --> 00:49:23,279
And then I would go back, and then I would be on to the next milestone.

950
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:29,584
And so going into academia, I got to read for the first time a lot of the stuff that was written years ago.

951
00:49:29,604 --> 00:49:34,107
Some of Greg Kastikian's early stuff, you know, which is used heavily in academia.

952
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:37,229
And I finally got to read Raft's book, Theory of Fun.

953
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,391
And I finally got to read Homo Ludens.

954
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:42,913
I finally got to read all of this stuff that I had never had an opportunity to.

955
00:49:43,955 --> 00:49:46,159
while you're working in these non-POL,

956
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:49,084
get your damn milestone stuff done positions.

957
00:49:49,825 --> 00:49:52,089
So for me, I now have that time.

958
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,211
And I have time to re-read books that I love.

959
00:49:56,691 --> 00:49:58,431
And I have time to explore questions.

960
00:49:59,511 --> 00:50:01,792
And just, you know, frankly, ask ridiculous questions.

961
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:05,773
Like I had to consider the way that we,

962
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,793
the tactile nature of games.

963
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:10,074
Which I just, you have to make decisions and move on.

964
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:11,634
But to actually pause and think that

965
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:13,275
what used to be a tremendous,

966
00:50:13,655 --> 00:50:15,215
and sometimes impossible luxury,

967
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:19,016
I can now explore the most minute game design topics

968
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,957
into the ground with a group of people

969
00:50:20,997 --> 00:50:22,097
who are also interested.

970
00:50:22,657 --> 00:50:24,379
And I like that shift in my life.

971
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,301
You know, building on something John said,

972
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:29,885
I'm really glad to hear that you're talking about all the stuff around games,

973
00:50:30,306 --> 00:50:34,410
because as a hiring, I'm not hiring except faculty right now,

974
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:37,013
but when I hired people out of game development programs,

975
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:42,087
I don't want to say always, but eight times out of ten, I would encounter two problems.

976
00:50:42,328 --> 00:50:49,131
One is, they had experience making their personal passion art project, which doesn't really

977
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:54,274
reflect what happens in the real world of mainstream game development, of AAA game development.

978
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:59,296
And they had no clue about anything but how do you make an art game.

979
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:03,541
And so one of the big things I'm trying to do with my program is exactly what you were talking about.

980
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:15,173
You know, focus not to the exclusion of everything else, but focus way more on culture, quality of life, business, you know, production methodologies.

981
00:51:15,393 --> 00:51:23,001
The other problem that I encountered with people coming out of development programs is they so often think they know the right way to do something.

982
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:25,582
And they know one of the right ways.

983
00:51:26,462 --> 00:51:30,124
And I really want to expose people not just to the right way according to me,

984
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:33,966
but in an academic setting I think there's an opportunity to show them

985
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:36,887
the various ways you can actually tackle the same problem.

986
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,029
If I might suggest you start with what is the definition of game?

987
00:51:40,049 --> 00:51:44,111
Because there's about 90 right definitions.

988
00:51:45,091 --> 00:51:45,931
Yeah, no doubt.

989
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:52,852
I had one thing on my mind to do with the similarities between being a game designer and a teacher.

990
00:51:52,872 --> 00:51:56,154
I don't... we've sort of touched on it a little bit so far.

991
00:51:57,095 --> 00:52:03,441
But I guess it's connected to the fact that I've always tried to be kind of a player-favoring game designer.

992
00:52:03,941 --> 00:52:10,186
So I really like the idea of a game designer as an advocate for the player and for the player's experience.

993
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:14,830
And obviously, as designers, we're free to create any kind of experience for the player that we want,

994
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:20,515
from one that's cozy and warm and safe to one that's, like, punishingly difficult and, uh, um...

995
00:52:21,796 --> 00:52:29,579
But, you know, the kind of games that I've worked on, my personal design philosophy is to do with kind of bringing the player into the experience,

996
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:36,121
and then bringing them along through the experience in a way that is best for them, if I can possibly work out how to do that with my game design.

997
00:52:36,762 --> 00:52:42,865
So I guess, just before I started working at USC, I read a little bit of Bell Hooks.

998
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:50,589
Bell Hooks is an American educator and she talks about the way that in the classroom,

999
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,851
because of the sort of implicitly hierarchical nature of the classroom,

1000
00:52:53,891 --> 00:52:58,894
there's a possibility for oppression in there.

1001
00:52:59,354 --> 00:53:02,536
if the professor doesn't engage with the students in the right way,

1002
00:53:02,636 --> 00:53:06,598
if they don't draw the students out, if they don't kind of establish parity

1003
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:12,160
in the community of the class. And so I don't know, I don't have a strongly

1004
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,061
developed ideas

1005
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:16,463
around this yet, but I think it's important for us as

1006
00:53:16,883 --> 00:53:19,564
new professors to think about this, because this is very much

1007
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:23,506
part of the skill, the profession of people who have been

1008
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:27,088
teachers for many decades, for all their professional lives.

1009
00:53:27,895 --> 00:53:30,841
Okay, I do have time for one, possibly two questions.

1010
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:32,825
I saw Tracy's hand first,

1011
00:53:33,226 --> 00:53:34,488
and then I saw somebody over here.

1012
00:53:34,508 --> 00:53:37,855
I saw a hand over here.

1013
00:53:38,055 --> 00:53:38,877
Oh, it was that hand.

1014
00:53:40,037 --> 00:53:42,819
And when I say oppression, I just mean when we're working on critical...

1015
00:53:43,759 --> 00:53:47,682
working critically on creative projects, you know, that...

1016
00:53:48,082 --> 00:53:49,783
we've all heard about the horrible art crit,

1017
00:53:49,823 --> 00:53:52,845
where someone makes themselves vulnerable and then ends up crying.

1018
00:53:53,246 --> 00:53:55,427
I do think it's important that we're direct with each other

1019
00:53:55,447 --> 00:53:56,548
when we criticize each other.

1020
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:58,369
I really like Eric Zimmerman's thing about the...

1021
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,411
As game designers, the way we show each other respect

1022
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,113
is by being direct with one another.

1023
00:54:04,694 --> 00:54:06,315
But it's a big, complicated subject

1024
00:54:06,355 --> 00:54:07,656
where there's lots for all of us to learn.

1025
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:08,536
Okay, Tracy.

1026
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:13,852
I'll repeat it if you, yeah.

1027
00:54:14,472 --> 00:54:17,176
OK, now, but I'll try and shout.

1028
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:20,381
OK, I want to talk about industry expectations,

1029
00:54:20,441 --> 00:54:23,885
since you guys are coming from industry into academia.

1030
00:54:27,649 --> 00:54:30,251
Here's something I'm always fighting.

1031
00:54:30,431 --> 00:54:32,413
OK, so I also came from industry,

1032
00:54:32,433 --> 00:54:37,117
but maybe have been more on the side of academia for a while.

1033
00:54:37,137 --> 00:54:40,980
And what I'm always getting is the industry folks coming

1034
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,201
and saying, you ought to do it like this.

1035
00:54:42,521 --> 00:54:44,042
You ought to be doing it like this, right?

1036
00:54:44,943 --> 00:54:47,725
And it's usually something like, hey, you know, in industry,

1037
00:54:47,845 --> 00:54:48,606
we have people.

1038
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:49,827
We have 200 people teams.

1039
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,748
So you guys got to have 200 people teams.

1040
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:53,670
We got to get you some 200 people teams.

1041
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,031
OK, let's work on that, right?

1042
00:54:56,452 --> 00:54:59,313
And I'm like, that's great, that's great, but guess what?

1043
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:02,574
I don't know if they're ready to be on 200 people teams yet.

1044
00:55:02,654 --> 00:55:04,115
Maybe we should have teams of two,

1045
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:07,476
and you could maybe learn to be on a team.

1046
00:55:07,496 --> 00:55:09,797
Because as above, so below.

1047
00:55:09,817 --> 00:55:12,958
They're little microcosms of the macroscopic bigotry.

1048
00:55:12,978 --> 00:55:16,179
How do we, though, negotiate what industry

1049
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,020
wants us to be teaching and what we know

1050
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,781
they're ready to be learning?

1051
00:55:21,937 --> 00:55:25,480
I think this is a really important sort of negotiation, because you don't want to say,

1052
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,942
I don't want to teach that, because you do, but you want to teach the steps.

1053
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:33,545
So I throw that to you because it's something I wonder all the time.

1054
00:55:34,045 --> 00:55:36,607
Do you mind? I'm sorry.

1055
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:37,687
Warren and then Brenda.

1056
00:55:37,807 --> 00:55:41,470
Okay. I think you may be selling yourself a little short.

1057
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:46,193
As someone who hired hundreds and hundreds of people over the last several years,

1058
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:50,859
There was a point where having a degree, especially one in game design or development,

1059
00:55:51,279 --> 00:55:56,687
was like it was a knock. It was against you, you know, and that is no longer true.

1060
00:55:56,707 --> 00:56:01,613
At this point, I don't think I hired anybody in the last five years who didn't come out of,

1061
00:56:01,773 --> 00:56:03,276
you know, your program or one like it.

1062
00:56:05,357 --> 00:56:08,240
So, I think you may be selling yourself a little short and you're doing plenty right.

1063
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:15,429
The one thing, I sort of alluded to it earlier, but I think there, and I think some places

1064
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:19,553
like you guys are getting at it and you guys are getting at it, I think somewhat larger

1065
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:22,176
teams are necessary and that's why in my program I'm...

1066
00:56:22,617 --> 00:56:23,977
A lot of people think I'm crazy, by the way,

1067
00:56:24,017 --> 00:56:25,378
but everybody in my program is going

1068
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:27,939
to work on one big, in air quotes, game.

1069
00:56:27,979 --> 00:56:31,500
I mean, 20 people on a team is, I picked that number

1070
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,001
because it's just big enough to start

1071
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:35,942
seeing the communication and coordination problems

1072
00:56:35,982 --> 00:56:38,283
and planning problems and I don't like you problems

1073
00:56:38,623 --> 00:56:41,524
that you don't see on a team of four, six, or even eight

1074
00:56:41,644 --> 00:56:43,045
where, hey, we're all friends.

1075
00:56:43,105 --> 00:56:44,005
Let's work together.

1076
00:56:44,845 --> 00:56:46,786
So I don't think you need 200, but I

1077
00:56:46,826 --> 00:56:48,967
think you need somewhat bigger teams, which I know

1078
00:56:49,007 --> 00:56:49,987
you guys are doing already.

1079
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:51,228
So you're right on track.

1080
00:56:52,055 --> 00:56:57,359
But I'm guessing that what Trace is suggesting is that just as game designers, when we're

1081
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:03,904
designing a game for a player, it's not great to introduce too many verbs all at once. You

1082
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:08,348
know, we want them to get the hang of the climbing before they do the dino jumping.

1083
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:14,032
I think that's what Trace is alluding to. And so we sort of structure our teams to start

1084
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:19,336
small and then grow to sort of 20-person teams. It just takes a bit of deliberateness about

1085
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:19,456
it.

1086
00:57:20,844 --> 00:57:25,905
What we do in our program at UCSC is we focus on real small teams.

1087
00:57:26,705 --> 00:57:31,707
And we focus on developing like indie developers that can make an entire game themselves.

1088
00:57:32,467 --> 00:57:39,249
And teams right now, our teams are like three people, like three designer programmers with 20 artists.

1089
00:57:40,509 --> 00:57:42,029
So they have plenty of art.

1090
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,110
So that is crazy.

1091
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:44,730
That's cool.

1092
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:46,872
They'll never see it again.

1093
00:57:46,892 --> 00:57:51,356
We work with San Jose State University, so they have access to an art team.

1094
00:57:51,696 --> 00:57:53,218
Like we tell them it's downhill from here.

1095
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:59,143
Yeah, you're never going to see this quality and amount of art for a small team like that.

1096
00:57:59,223 --> 00:58:04,368
But as the program gets bigger, we probably won't have teams that are bigger than five

1097
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:08,491
people, just so they all have really great experience.

1098
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,673
They can't hide in a big team.

1099
00:58:10,713 --> 00:58:12,115
They have to make something that...

1100
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:16,373
that uh... is innovative and they all have to have a really big part of that

1101
00:58:16,874 --> 00:58:21,556
of that uh... of that game so they so they can say yeah i made that huge thing

1102
00:58:21,576 --> 00:58:23,417
uh... and also the they can

1103
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:25,518
they feel like they really made a whole game

1104
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:32,675
To Tracy's point, it's almost like my previous week was a setup for that single question.

1105
00:58:33,216 --> 00:58:36,819
I began my week meeting with one massive publisher,

1106
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:40,642
and I ended my week meeting with one massive publisher,

1107
00:58:40,742 --> 00:58:43,025
and I had first-party interaction in the middle.

1108
00:58:44,006 --> 00:58:47,007
And everybody knows exactly how things should be done.

1109
00:58:47,647 --> 00:58:49,568
And none of them are in agreement with one another.

1110
00:58:50,849 --> 00:58:53,249
And so it's really just a question of, well, I'll

1111
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,370
align a Scott Faux.

1112
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:56,951
I've credited him with this line.

1113
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:57,931
But it's good to know.

1114
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,812
It's very noncommittal.

1115
00:59:00,192 --> 00:59:00,672
Good to know.

1116
00:59:00,692 --> 00:59:05,834
I mean, ultimately, you can't make a game for everybody,

1117
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:07,335
really, unless it's Minecraft.

1118
00:59:07,355 --> 00:59:07,895
So now it's done.

1119
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:14,341
And, you know, likewise I don't think you can necessarily make students or have a program that's for everybody, you know.

1120
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:19,387
So you have to, you know, what are you most skilled doing and then go from there.

1121
00:59:19,427 --> 00:59:22,851
But I, but I certainly, and I felt that pull just last week where there was.

1122
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:26,597
I know, and you see what fits.

1123
00:59:26,837 --> 00:59:31,301
I'm afraid I won't have time for the second question because we are ending in 30 seconds.

1124
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:33,023
Unless you can do it in 15 seconds, Stephen?

1125
00:59:33,183 --> 00:59:34,404
Yeah, so who are you shipping?

1126
00:59:34,425 --> 00:59:35,546
Who are you shipping?

1127
00:59:35,846 --> 00:59:40,050
John answered that a little bit and Brenda touched on it, but who are you shipping and

1128
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:43,093
how do you build the program and what advice do you have for sales?

1129
00:59:43,193 --> 00:59:44,094
In 15 seconds?

1130
00:59:44,235 --> 00:59:44,635
Heck yeah!

1131
00:59:44,695 --> 00:59:45,175
In 15 seconds.

1132
00:59:45,396 --> 00:59:45,796
What's your product?

1133
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:46,817
It's fine, I've been doing this forever.

1134
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:51,960
My product is people who aspire to positions of leadership, production and direction,

1135
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,882
and want to shorten the dues-paying period.

1136
00:59:54,902 --> 00:59:56,883
So instead of 10 years, it takes you 5.

1137
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:03,006
Yeah, innovators, industry leaders, and craftspeople, I think.

1138
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:06,148
Indie devs.

1139
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:09,830
Or Indie devs. They own their own company, and they build small teams and great games.

1140
01:00:10,966 --> 01:00:15,010
Awesome. I also want to take a chance, my little plug chance here real quick at the end,

1141
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:19,935
to make sure you all know that the third edition of Tracy Fullerton's Game Design Workshop came out this week.

1142
01:00:20,335 --> 01:00:25,300
It features sidebars from Richard and Brenda, a designer's perspective from Warren,

1143
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:29,124
and there's a whole chapter analyzing Quake vis-a-vis Go Fish.

1144
01:00:29,685 --> 01:00:33,368
There are discounted copies available for GDC attendees, and I have...

1145
01:00:34,109 --> 01:00:37,113
tickets for them so right here at the end if you want one come up and grab one

1146
01:00:37,153 --> 01:00:37,494
from me

1147
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:40,618
I'm in please can we have a huge round of applause for our panel they did a

1148
01:00:40,658 --> 01:00:41,479
fantastic job

1149
01:00:46,325 --> 01:00:48,528
and thank you all for coming out have a good GDC
