1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,842
So, I was asked to introduce myself first.

2
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:12,283
So, I'm Jamie Chang.

3
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:13,444
I founded Clay in 2005,

4
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:19,287
and we've been building independent games since then.

5
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,849
Our last two games was Mark and the Ninja and Don't Starve.

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,173
And I wanted to talk about the development process today a little bit.

7
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:33,735
And I'm Jeff McGillic.

8
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:35,576
I'm the creative director at Clay Entertainment.

9
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:37,227
You're pretty much the art dude.

10
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:47,460
Okay, so I want to talk about what we want, what Clay is about.

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,851
and what we've been trying to build over time.

12
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:54,413
And for me, I wanted Clay to be a place

13
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:59,316
where we're continually building amazing games over and over.

14
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:02,718
And so Jeff and I have been doing this for quite some time,

15
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,000
and the only way that we can actually see this

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,202
actually happening is if the process is sane,

17
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:11,163
is if the process is sustainable.

18
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:16,730
So not only do we need to build great games, we actually need to do it while still going

19
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,094
home and still not ruining our lives in the process.

20
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,368
It's basically inevitable.

21
00:01:30,488 --> 00:01:32,910
I mean, for me, I actually just flew in today,

22
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,031
which is why I'm a little out of it.

23
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:35,753
I had a 2 a.m. feed.

24
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:37,554
I have a two-week-old at home right now,

25
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:39,216
and I flew in today.

26
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:40,317
I'm flying out tomorrow.

27
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,080
Jeff has a one-year-old Friday.

28
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:45,882
Yeah, her birthday's on Friday,

29
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:47,163
so I have to fly out early.

30
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:49,349
and all of us are getting older.

31
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:51,891
And it just, you know, for the last three years,

32
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:53,873
we've been thinking about this, you know,

33
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:55,694
that we know that everyone's gonna get older,

34
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:57,155
everyone's priorities are gonna change,

35
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,957
and we need some changes in order for that to happen.

36
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:03,980
And, you know, for me, I find it disingenuous

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,941
when somebody says,

38
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:09,215
The reason why we worked a whole lot of overtime,

39
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:11,396
and the reason why we killed everybody working this game,

40
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:12,557
is because we're doing something new.

41
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:13,857
It's because we're doing art.

42
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:16,099
And to hide behind art as a shield,

43
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,220
to kill yourself and your employees

44
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,661
and the people you work with,

45
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:23,083
I think is not the right thing to do.

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,725
And I think you're going to screw with development

47
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:28,566
in the future for that.

48
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:33,031
So, while there's no formula to building a new game,

49
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,574
how we see it is that there are theories that we can use

50
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:39,436
to help us better understand how game development works.

51
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:44,761
So this is a little bit of how much, I guess,

52
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:47,564
you can call it over time, what I would say is

53
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:50,887
insanity happened during the development

54
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:51,667
of our different games,

55
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,429
and you can kind of see this downward slide.

56
00:02:55,307 --> 00:03:00,430
And shank one was the one where basically it was a tipping point for me.

57
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,173
It was so stressful and such hard work in such a short amount of time.

58
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:11,617
Basically I made a promise to myself that I would never put myself or other people in

59
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:12,397
that position again.

60
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:15,319
So you can see a downward slide from there.

61
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,161
And you can see a little up on Mark the Ninja.

62
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:21,303
And the important thing for me is not that.

63
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:29,795
We shouldn't work really hard, but that I see that as a failure and I see that you know we can do better

64
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:37,920
So what we end up asking is you know what are the biggest wastes of time as we're working on development?

65
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:40,262
and

66
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:43,244
To us. It's actually just building the wrong thing

67
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:46,685
So it's not even about the trees or the leaves,

68
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:49,867
it's like this analogy where people are in a forest

69
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:51,027
and they're chopping down the trees

70
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,348
and they're trying to work really hard

71
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:54,769
and then somebody climbs up to the top of the forest

72
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,130
and says, hey, we're in the wrong forest.

73
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:58,791
And the other guys are like,

74
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,192
but we're making so much progress down here,

75
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:03,193
it'd be a waste if we moved to another forest.

76
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:10,655
And we laugh because, you know, we see that a lot, because we're building these features

77
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:13,959
and we're like, well, we don't want to cut that because, you know, we've already spent

78
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:14,799
so much time on it.

79
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:22,467
And so, you know, for us the idea is how do we figure out that we're in the wrong force

80
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:22,787
quicker?

81
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,151
Because when you're working on something new, the nature of it is that you're going to do

82
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,592
the wrong thing, often.

83
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:31,676
But the goal is to recognize that quicker and get the hell out of there.

84
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,344
So I want to start with talking about some of the massive failures that we had.

85
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:43,385
And between March and July was when we started Ninja.

86
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:47,866
And even then, people say that you need to have this vision of your game, and you follow

87
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:49,366
your vision and you'll be fine.

88
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,287
But even then, we already had that vision.

89
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,568
We had the vision that Ninja is a stealth game where you feel like a real ninja.

90
00:04:56,868 --> 00:05:00,789
So you're a glass cannon, and you're flitting in the shadows, and the enemy never even knows

91
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:01,729
you're there.

92
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,490
The first pitch...

93
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,111
we already had that written down.

94
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,051
But the problem was we had no idea

95
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,492
how to actually get there.

96
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:14,152
And so we had all these assumptions

97
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,213
that we were building on that we thought would work,

98
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,693
and none of it was working.

99
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,674
It just felt, so we actually had light and dark,

100
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,435
and we had stealth kills, and we had shurikens,

101
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:25,115
we had the sound, all this stuff,

102
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:27,876
but it actually felt all mushy, and it just sucked.

103
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,036
And in fact, it got so bad.

104
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:33,817
that, you know, around May, we actually thought,

105
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,238
this isn't actually going to work at all,

106
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:37,499
we can't build a stealth game.

107
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,903
So for a couple months, we decided that Mark of the Ninja

108
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:45,384
wasn't going to be a stealth game primarily anymore,

109
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:47,346
and that it was going to be an action game

110
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,627
with stealth elements, because we thought

111
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:50,828
this wasn't actually going to work.

112
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:53,370
And of course, that made the game even worse.

113
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,810
So then we took it back.

114
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,773
And we thought again, what is wrong with what we're doing?

115
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:04,855
And what was wrong was, is that we were building a whole bunch of stuff based on bad assumptions.

116
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:08,697
And so, what was going on was, we were saying that we think that...

117
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:14,597
you know, these fire propagations is going to work, or that if we build more features

118
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:15,499
the game will get better.

119
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,344
But it was all based on assumptions that we weren't clear about.

120
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:24,110
So instead what we did was we went back and we said, I'm going to build testable hypotheses.

121
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,011
I'm going to see...

122
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:29,715
I'm going to say, this is what I actually believe, and let's test it out.

123
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:33,417
And so we went through tons and tons of different little scenarios, and we said,

124
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:39,741
I think that, for example, if I hide behind this vase, and then a guard comes along,

125
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:40,821
I'm going to feel stealthy.

126
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:44,824
And so we built all these scenarios, and we're testing them out,

127
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:46,805
and trying to fail quickly.

128
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:51,908
And once we started doing that, that's when we could actually start to see

129
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,890
which of our assumptions were right, and which of our assumptions were wrong.

130
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,924
So I'm going to show you a little video of something that we did when we, as we started

131
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,364
doing that.

132
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:10,769
This is, you know, somewhere in the summer where we started testing out our hypothesis

133
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,430
and these are the ones that actually worked.

134
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:21,156
So I'm going to, how do I, yeah.

135
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:24,218
Who's there?

136
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:43,391
You can see that there was a little line up there that's talking about exactly what we're trying to accomplish as we're going along.

137
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:48,954
So here we're trying multi-targeting and trying to slowing the game down.

138
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:54,516
I see him!

139
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,906
Here we're getting people to work for the information.

140
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,588
What we decided was, our hypothesis was, hey,

141
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,690
if people don't know the information but can learn it, that's fun.

142
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,191
That feels sneaky.

143
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:17,571
And so we're trying that out.

144
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:20,053
Can I hear something?

145
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:24,576
Not kill them and just distract them.

146
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:25,877
I need to check this out.

147
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,059
And that's the Canadian elk that everyone talks about.

148
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,380
I thought I heard something.

149
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:38,775
on for some time.

150
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:44,091
I think we probably built about two dozen of them.

151
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:54,203
before we started really realizing that the point of the game is rather mechanically,

152
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,604
the point is to plan.

153
00:08:56,284 --> 00:09:01,807
It was to observe the environment, work for your information, plan your attack, actually

154
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:06,669
execute that, and the planning part was the most important part, and it was having this

155
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,891
predictable cause and effect.

156
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:12,646
And once that was clear, and we could test that,

157
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,328
and it was working, then kind of the game

158
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:16,389
started designing itself.

159
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,872
And all of these decisions just kind of worked itself out.

160
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:22,514
So for example, should we have binary light sources?

161
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,015
Yes, because that makes it more clear.

162
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:27,819
Should we have, should we show the sound rings?

163
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,881
Well, at first, I remember saying,

164
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:32,363
hey, we really should show the sound rings.

165
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:36,386
And there was some murmur, because it was like,

166
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:38,147
well, does that make the game too easy?

167
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:43,130
You know, shouldn't you be able, shouldn't you have to work to figure out how big your

168
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,730
distance is?

169
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,332
And the answer is no, because that makes it mushy.

170
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:51,114
It makes it unclear how many steps forward I can plan.

171
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,617
And so when you make it super clear, then you're able to plan further ahead and do higher

172
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:57,177
level planning.

173
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:00,038
And then another really good example is the AI,

174
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:02,679
because at first we had these really complex systems

175
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,880
of what the AI was gonna do,

176
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,181
and we're having a really hard time implementing it.

177
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,242
Or rather, we're having a really hard time

178
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:09,542
getting the player to understand

179
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:10,423
what the heck it was doing.

180
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:14,564
And when this idea, this theory,

181
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:16,645
that people need to know the cause and effect

182
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:18,146
very, very clearly became clear,

183
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,288
it was very clear that we needed stupider AI.

184
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,854
and we needed AI which was really manipulatable.

185
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:29,657
So, you know, this is one of those things

186
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:32,500
which actually helps cut out work.

187
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:36,045
And I'd say that cutting out, you know, smart AI

188
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:39,509
cut out probably, you know, four or five months worth

189
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:41,051
of programmer work just there.

190
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:49,424
And then this translates totally into the the art process and making things clear to the player

191
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:54,888
Like so basically it went from the theory of like, okay, let's let's take things and make it look cool, too

192
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:58,812
Okay, how do we translate all this information? How do you translate all this data to the player?

193
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:04,817
So certain things like okay binary light systems, like if you're an artist, you know, like, okay

194
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:07,259
if I walk into a light I could get like shadow up to here and then

195
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,200
I'm like partially seen so we actually change that to like if you have one foot in the light you're seen if you're not if

196
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,142
You don't you're unseen so it's basically player knows at all times if they're in shadow or if the non shadow

197
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:25,703
Another point was if we had like the UI aiming all the guides that we have in the game

198
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:33,145
We made it like super precise super accurate just so people could plan and execute their their actions to a T

199
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:35,166
and

200
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:39,387
And the one key point that Jamie was talking about too,

201
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:42,049
is the AI, being able to have predictable AI.

202
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,130
And from an art standpoint, how do you do that?

203
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,173
How do you translate those emotions and stuff like that?

204
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:49,695
So we did, like we have really talented artists at Clay,

205
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,816
so we did a whole bunch of like facial animation.

206
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:54,657
We scaled up their expressions to make it readable.

207
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:57,018
But we found the most critical thing,

208
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:59,639
or the easiest thing to do, was to actually put

209
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,720
emotional icons over them so that everybody knows,

210
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,381
oh, that person's in a terror state,

211
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,302
that person's in a investigate state.

212
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:14,580
But one of the big elements here we're playing with our theory of making it clear was also

213
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:16,182
like where the ninja can go.

214
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:19,485
Like we were playing with this idea of like the artists were like, oh, should we do it

215
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:23,148
like Shank where it was like, like there's steps to the platforms and stuff like that.

216
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:26,831
But the key thing was like, we had to get the player to know like,

217
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:29,153
oh I could go on that ceiling part, I could go on these walls.

218
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:34,379
So we decided to keep it completely flat, and that was just the result of just testing these theories.

219
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,082
Like, the more the easier it is, the clearer it is for the player, the better it is for the game.

220
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:48,029
So not only did these theories of like create a theory, test a theory, and learn from all our failures

221
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,350
apply to game design and like what I call visual language for a game,

222
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,811
it applied to our entire process.

223
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:57,971
So that was a weird and awesome kind of learning for us

224
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:00,832
where we could basically test our theories with production

225
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:04,953
and move on and see if like that actually worked,

226
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:08,954
if like everybody in the production process enjoyed it and we created a good...

227
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,135
effective product at the end.

228
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:17,019
So this is an example of us when we had the,

229
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,540
when we were creating a level.

230
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:20,942
So we wanted to test this process, our theory,

231
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:22,783
and we wanted to fail quickly.

232
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,525
So, like, we got Nels and the team to do,

233
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:28,587
like, one level, to create all the scenarios,

234
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:30,048
create all the cool, like, stealth moments

235
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,069
where you're sneaking up on guards,

236
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:32,289
going through vents and all that stuff.

237
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:36,525
But the one thing was, it wasn't a world.

238
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:39,466
Like, when the artist got it, I even tried painting over it,

239
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:43,027
and it's like, we couldn't make these into an actual world.

240
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:47,648
Like, is this supposed to be, like, a sewer-vented, like,

241
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,391
facility? Like, how do we actually make this in the world?

242
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:54,352
So we're like, the artists were struggling with it, so we're like,

243
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:59,175
okay, let's fail at that, and let's get the artists to actually create the structures.

244
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:01,457
Let's get the artists to create the buildings, like,

245
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:04,158
knowing that we have to put vents everywhere, knowing we have to put

246
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:05,859
like, different rooms and doors.

247
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:06,780
And so...

248
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,181
And then we passed it off to the game designers.

249
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:12,122
So the game designers knew exactly how their scenarios worked.

250
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:16,944
They had their process planned out, but they were able to use it within our structure of

251
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,125
artists created buildings.

252
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:22,667
A whole bunch of work was moved around, deleted, pushed and pulled to make the final game,

253
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:24,107
but at least they had a basis.

254
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:28,649
It removed the whole blank canvas structure that the game designers were struggling with.

255
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:34,201
And then the artist went in and painted it up or polished it up afterwards.

256
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:37,747
But the key thing, the key learning for us here was that...

257
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,581
like, we kind of changed our perspectives.

258
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:42,523
Like, people presume that, like,

259
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:44,204
oh, creating a more efficient system

260
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:46,906
for an individual is the better way,

261
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:49,368
but with this, we actually created more work.

262
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:50,709
Like, the artist did the levels,

263
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,070
the designers adjust the levels,

264
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,451
and then the artist did the levels again,

265
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:58,375
but it also created a more effective process,

266
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:00,717
or effective product at the end.

267
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:02,619
So it wasn't, like, about efficiency,

268
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:06,261
individual efficiency, but more process effectiveness.

269
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:17,216
So, the theory of failing quickly was a big thing,

270
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:19,898
and we wanted to incorporate into all our different,

271
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:24,361
like, in-studio processes, so batching became

272
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,803
one of these things that, like, we used to do it on Shank,

273
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:28,885
where we would just, like, do all the run animation

274
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,506
at one time, do all the, like, kill animation,

275
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:31,587
and then we'd implement it later.

276
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:34,389
We took that idea and we're like,

277
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:36,810
okay, well let's test everything constantly.

278
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,591
Let's make sure everything works.

279
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:41,112
So we kind of eliminated batching

280
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:42,453
from our whole kind of process.

281
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:45,035
And we basically, if someone animates like a kill,

282
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,535
we put it in game, test if it works.

283
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,097
And so they're not just doing like all these stealth kills

284
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:50,838
and not having it in game.

285
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,399
So nothing kind of like lingers.

286
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,680
And then we're constantly testing our stuff

287
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,081
and like constantly testing our assumptions.

288
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:01,866
So we're not wasting a lot of work as well, and we kind of get clearer.

289
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:08,388
So the thing about batching is that it's this thing where, in a production process, where

290
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:12,209
if you know what you're going to do, you can do a lot of it very quickly.

291
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,491
But if you're doing that based on bad assumptions, then you're going to be very quickly doing

292
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,031
the wrong thing.

293
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:25,334
So that's why we needed to get rid of batching until we really figured out what we were actually

294
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:25,474
making.

Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supplies needs!

296
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,508
And now, going back to some of the theories

297
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:35,269
that we're thinking about and solidifying

298
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:36,369
what the vision of the game is,

299
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,611
I see Mark of the Ninja as this finely sharpened blade

300
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:42,911
because we just kept shaving things off.

301
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:46,493
And in terms of an efficient development process,

302
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:50,594
many talks talk about how you need to be able

303
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:53,235
to cut features, you need to be able to cut, cut, and cut.

304
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,176
So how do you know what to cut?

305
00:16:57,076 --> 00:17:00,260
is through a solid theory that you've actually tested your assumptions on.

306
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:05,727
And because of that, we were able to just keep fine-tuning Ninja,

307
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,492
and it's almost to the point where if we cut anything else, the blade would break.

308
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:13,916
And what's interesting is, you know, as an aside, you know, our other game, Don't Starve,

309
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:19,978
is about, you know, whereas Mark and the Ninjas are finely tuned blade, Don't Starve is more

310
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:20,899
like a bonsai tree.

311
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,019
It kind of grows and grows.

312
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,940
It's a, you know, there's all these interlocking systems.

313
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:29,983
And as the systems grow, we kind of fine-tune those systems, but it's growing nonetheless,

314
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:31,283
and it gets bigger and bigger.

315
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:35,625
And so it's kind of a different process, but at the same time, using these theories, so

316
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:36,586
theories are flexible.

317
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:42,670
Whereas, you know, if you have a formula, that's inflexible.

318
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,373
A formula is you put this stuff in and it comes out the other way.

319
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,455
A theory is when you understand what's going on better.

320
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:53,459
And so we were able to use these theories on Don't Starve as well, and I think that

321
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,562
even though it's a very different game and a different way of building it, it still really

322
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:57,062
helped us out.

323
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:09,963
Now, one other thing that I use to think about process is how the people work together, and

324
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:11,165
how all of us work together.

325
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:15,870
And at Clay, we have what we call T-people, which are people who are really good at one

326
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,914
thing but are pretty good at a whole bunch of other things.

327
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,634
Now, I'd say that in a traditional process,

328
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:24,416
there's a lot of I people.

329
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,798
So people who only know their thing

330
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:29,260
and don't know much about other people, right?

331
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,122
And that's when middle managers come in.

332
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:32,663
That's when you need the middle managers

333
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:34,825
because they need to talk to everybody else

334
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:37,027
so that everybody knows what everybody's doing.

335
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:41,516
But when you have T people and they work together,

336
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:44,238
they naturally already touch each other

337
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:46,439
and they actually can talk about what they're doing

338
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,961
and they actually think about the effect

339
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:50,762
of what they're working on against other people.

340
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:54,224
And so, the problems actually get worked out way sooner

341
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:56,786
and you actually get more innovative results

342
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:57,406
that way as well.

343
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:02,007
So, you know, at Clay, we've tried having middle managers before.

344
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:02,988
We thought we needed them.

345
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,009
And honestly, we don't.

346
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,211
And it's worth it out way better this way.

347
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:12,013
So this is something that I think about a lot.

348
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,856
And it kind of comes back to,

349
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,096
when I'm thinking about all these processes,

350
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:21,417
it comes back to a state of mind, I think.

351
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:23,178
So what I'm saying here is,

352
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:24,598
while shipping a mediocre games

353
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:26,318
is gonna screw up your company really quickly,

354
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:28,539
having an unsustainable process

355
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,799
is gonna suffocate your company,

356
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,900
or yourself, rather, I would say.

357
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,411
And so, you know, the message that I want to bring across is that that's not okay.

358
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:43,932
And that I hope that, you know, today I'm presenting a little bit about how we do things

359
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:49,754
and I want to learn from everybody else so that we can create processes that allow us

360
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:50,374
to create art.

361
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:56,395
And I think that it's not a juxtaposition or an oxymoron.

362
00:19:56,836 --> 00:20:01,577
When you have good theories and you have good processes, you're actually more free to think

363
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:02,437
about new things.

364
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:06,939
because you're not just flailing around not knowing where you're going and hopefully hitting

365
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:13,903
somewhere good. That's kind of my message. And I think that's, that's it.

366
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:27,631
So time to just write, there's a time for questions, five minutes questions.

367
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,839
Oh, I forgot to say all those things I was supposed to say,

368
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,980
which is turn off your cell phones and all that stuff.

369
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:35,761
Anyway.

370
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:38,082
Terry is, if you want to go ahead and set up

371
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,482
while they're taking questions, that would help.

372
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:42,303
So questions?

373
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:45,225
So you just have to come up to the mics over here

374
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:47,185
on both sides if you have any questions.

375
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:50,707
No questions?

376
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:52,868
Oh, there we go.

377
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:54,128
There's some questions.

378
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,289
OK, I have a question.

379
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,971
So you talk about using theories.

380
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:01,434
Can you give us some examples of the theories

381
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,756
that guided Mark of the Ninja?

382
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,159
Yeah, so I mean, the theories were,

383
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,802
I mean, for example, the process theories,

384
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:10,104
some of them were, you know,

385
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:13,027
T people make it so that you don't need middle management.

386
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:16,091
But from a game, from a mechanical perspective,

387
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,333
it was that planning.

388
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:22,243
made people feel like a ninja, for example.

389
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:26,205
We basically keep drilling down into little theories

390
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:27,466
and testing those things out.

391
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:32,929
So, with the testing of these theories,

392
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:34,790
did you do it internally within the team

393
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,331
or did you look outside of the team?

394
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:38,472
Were you going back to the same people again and again

395
00:21:38,512 --> 00:21:39,793
or was it fresh people every time?

396
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:43,816
So Nels did a great job in getting people off Craigslist

397
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,577
to come over and thankfully we weren't murdered

398
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,317
or anything like that.

399
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:53,351
But they came in, you know, twice a week throughout development, and sometimes would bring in

400
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:54,471
the same people over and over.

401
00:21:55,772 --> 00:22:01,154
And we made really clear, I mean, the distinction is that we use that data to test our assumptions,

402
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,975
to say, did our assumptions work or not, rather than ask them what they wanted.

403
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:06,716
Because what they actually wanted was...

404
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:13,742
to hit harder and to, you know, to slice people up. That's what they said they wanted, right?

405
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:19,427
And so the feedback for us was, oh, they don't want to stealth. Why don't they want to stealth?

406
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:22,590
Hey, Jamie. Great talk, actually.

407
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:31,415
Did you use your hypothesis method to improve other processes besides game design?

408
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:35,619
I.e. production, management, everything.

409
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,940
Absolutely, yeah, absolutely.

410
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,665
So the idea behind, for example, the level building was that we thought that the best way to build levels

411
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:47,888
was for the designers to build it and then the artists to art it up, in that order, right?

412
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:51,630
Right. I guess maybe more on the management side or more, maybe, business side?

413
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:58,315
Yeah, there is, I can't think of any off the top of my head, but for sure that's what I think about all the time.

414
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:02,678
Maybe after, I don't know. Sorry, I can't think of it right now.

415
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,141
Hey, I'll take it.

416
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:13,486
It seemed like it was really cool to see those early prototypes, all the testing, hypothesis videos of gameplay.

417
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:15,047
It seemed like it was really polished.

418
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:16,448
I wondered, did you like...

419
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:22,759
Did you do an extra effort into doing like a polished prototype of your assumptions?

420
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,660
Or did you just like...

421
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,821
Why wasn't it just blocks jumping around?

422
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:28,362
They were just blocks jumping around, actually.

423
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:37,365
Because we built a tiling system for the platforms that look good as soon as you put it down.

424
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,467
So that was actually my art.

425
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:42,610
And I'm not an artist.

426
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,933
So I just threw down the blocks,

427
00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:49,237
and it looks good because the artists are awesome.

428
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,100
But they were just blocks, really.

429
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:55,603
Okay.

430
00:23:56,808 --> 00:24:01,912
So you did talk about the, uh, basically the method of applying theories and making sure

431
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:04,915
that you're applying them appropriately with your wrong forest argument.

432
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:09,598
So I was curious as to, with all these different theories being experimented and

433
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:14,322
you're rejecting the ones that don't work, did you still feel an attachment to that

434
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:17,885
kind of mechanic being a fun mechanic that you could apply to a later project?

435
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:21,768
I mean, do you guys have a notebook or an archive of theories that didn't work for

436
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:25,471
Mark of the Ninja, but could possibly make a return in another game?

437
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:32,329
We don't actively archive them, but I mean, there's still cool mechanics.

438
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:37,113
Like, for example, we actually had a mechanic where the ninja could counter attacks.

439
00:24:37,634 --> 00:24:42,698
He would actually go into an attack pose and do like Assassin's Creed style, you know,

440
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:44,199
movements and jumping over and stuff like that.

441
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:44,700
It was cool.

442
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,963
It just made people want to slash people more.

443
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:57,650
Well right, and basically in correlation with my question, say for example, if that was a cool mechanic that you found cool, would you ever see yourself applying it in a game that would be more appropriate?

444
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:05,039
I agree, yeah. But we don't actively archive it, it's not like a process that we actually write it down. But yes, we would do that.

445
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:05,860
Awesome panel, thank you.

446
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:14,487
Hi. Regarding the T-People arrangements, if you have, say, an artist-designer, a designer-programmer,

447
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:20,050
and a programmer-producer, then for the artist and producer to communicate, do they use the

448
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:26,194
designer-programmer as a middle manager, or do they try to interact directly, or how does

449
00:25:26,214 --> 00:25:26,554
that work?

450
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,256
We don't have any producers.

451
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:33,399
Oh, I mean, as far as that kind of... if it wasn't producer, then say, a sound guy, then.

452
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:40,842
I think everybody's like, once you create an area and a team that can, that has all

453
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:44,884
these multiple skills, or like is aware of other people's skills, then everybody communicates

454
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:45,325
with each other.

455
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:48,666
Like everybody sits in the same area, so if you have a question, there's other people

456
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:51,048
overhearing and then people can pitch in and stuff like that.

457
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:55,550
So we basically just create an environment where people can communicate as well as like

458
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,971
everybody knows what's going on constantly.

459
00:25:57,131 --> 00:26:02,419
And I also have, you know, in terms of like more theories and guess is, you know, we see

460
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,621
people in certain ways as well.

461
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:08,348
So we try to see people where, you know, four people have backs to each other because that's

462
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:09,650
the minimum amount of distraction.

463
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,954
But then they can still turn around and talk to each other.

464
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:18,211
You know, from a space perspective, the best space usage is when you have a tea and you're

465
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:21,735
all working inside that tea, but then you stare at each other all the time and when

466
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:23,977
one person stands up, everybody notices.

467
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:27,320
So I used to work like that and it was terrible.

468
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:33,406
So we actively try to think about all the little things that help the communication.

469
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:49,533
Okay, we have, yeah, we have.
