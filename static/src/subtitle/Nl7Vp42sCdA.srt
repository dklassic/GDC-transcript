1
00:00:06,032 --> 00:00:08,652
Hi, everyone. Welcome to our GDC panel.

2
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:12,413
I am so excited for what you're going to see today.

3
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:13,693
My name is Nika Noor.

4
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:15,054
I'm the executive director

5
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:18,775
of the International Game Developers Association Foundation.

6
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:22,495
We exclusively work on increasing representation

7
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:25,216
and diversifying the video game workforce.

8
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:28,897
We really believe in making sure that every person

9
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:32,438
who wants to make or play games deserves a chance to do so.

10
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:35,838
And today, we're going to focus on a really special topic.

11
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:42,121
We're going to be talking about building pipelines to find, grow, and retain diverse talent.

12
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:46,544
But enough of that, let's get to our stellar, stellar panelists.

13
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:50,165
Let's do a round of introductions, starting with Movel.

14
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:55,948
Hi, I'm Movel, and that's my dog, Poppy, that you can hear in the background.

15
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:57,509
She's barking outside.

16
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:02,900
So I joined Unity in October of last year.

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,201
So I haven't actually stepped foot in the Unity office yet

18
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:06,262
because of the pandemic.

19
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:09,904
I work on the inclusion team.

20
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:12,305
I head up inclusion for Unity.

21
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,486
We have a small team there.

22
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:16,407
We focus on lots of different things

23
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:17,408
which we'll talk about later,

24
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:19,909
but I'm really enjoying working.

25
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:20,670
There's a difference for me

26
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,950
because I haven't come from tech,

27
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:24,932
but inclusion is inclusion wherever you are.

28
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,593
There are nuances depending on the different industries,

29
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:27,853
but...

30
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:29,817
Inclusion is primarily about inclusion.

31
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,560
So it's about people at Unity as well.

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,180
I'm loving it.

33
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,361
That's me.

34
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:36,882
Awesome.

35
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:38,102
Davina, how about you?

36
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:40,103
Hey, everyone.

37
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:41,284
I'm Davina Mackey.

38
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:44,966
I am the Director of Support Services and Operations

39
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:47,888
for PlayStation Studios QA.

40
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:51,990
I've been at SIE, Sony Interactive Entertainment,

41
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,971
for over 16 years.

42
00:01:54,605 --> 00:02:00,129
started from the grassroots and I've basically worked my way up. I'm also the president of

43
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:07,655
Black at PlayStation, which is one of seven affinity groups at SIE and I've been president

44
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:16,621
for five years. So I'm enjoying, you know, my space, doing DE&I work and supporting

45
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:21,925
underrepresented communities and we're really doing some interesting

46
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,012
work now at SIE.

47
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,594
And my whole thing is,

48
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,035
if we can make an impact

49
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,398
and make representation of underrepresented people,

50
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:37,540
black people specifically in my realm,

51
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:42,844
we can improve the representation in tech

52
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,345
or in the video game industry.

53
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:47,066
That's where I'm focused.

54
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:49,468
Awesome.

55
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:52,009
Trinidad, how are you doing?

56
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:54,415
Hi everybody, Trinidad here.

57
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:57,917
I'm the head of diversity and inclusion at Niantic.

58
00:02:57,937 --> 00:03:00,219
I am passionate about people.

59
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,620
I'm passionate about policy

60
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:04,802
and I'm passionate about impact.

61
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:08,965
And so my mantra in life is stay ready,

62
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:09,966
don't have to get ready.

63
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:15,389
So I'm always ready and I'm always ready to educate,

64
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,792
empower and utilize my genius

65
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:21,974
to help people understand why.

66
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,659
All of this that we're about to talk about is imperative,

67
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,180
not only to the business, but just to us being better humans.

68
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,261
That's awesome.

69
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:35,122
Well, let's dig into it.

70
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:37,103
Let's see how we're actually developing

71
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:40,864
the actions and pipelines behind these great thoughts.

72
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:43,665
Davina, do you mind sharing some of the initiatives

73
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:45,085
you're working on at your company?

74
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:54,439
Yeah, so we've had a very impactful year, I should say, and I would say prior to the pandemic,

75
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,685
we were stuck in culture awareness, you know, we really didn't have strategy.

76
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:11,191
We have a new leader in DE&I, her name is Tiffany Hester. She's an amazing individual that

77
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:14,153
introduced strategy in the

78
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,345
E-net space is what we call it at SIE.

79
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:20,007
And so that happened.

80
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:22,308
So we had new D&I leadership

81
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:26,651
and we also had the John Platt,

82
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:33,374
who is the CEO and president of Sony ATV,

83
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:35,916
which is our music licensing division.

84
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,077
He had the...

85
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:44,999
the guts to go to our Sony leadership and ask them to support social justice

86
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:50,560
for underrepresented communities, specifically the Black community.

87
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,921
And they allowed for him to put together a $100 million donation

88
00:04:58,142 --> 00:05:03,583
that Sony specifically is supporting social justice initiatives.

89
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:10,092
And each division within Sony was able to partake in that $100 million.

90
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:11,673
So each of us got a piece.

91
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:20,838
So PlayStation received, you know, a pot and we split it with our UK counterpart.

92
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:25,340
So there's a portion going to the US and a portion going to the UK.

93
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:33,463
And from that, we've built relationships with several organizations that promote social justice initiatives.

94
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:37,186
I can only tell you the few that have been announced so far.

95
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:43,190
So, for example, Gameheads, which is in the Bay Area, we're supporting them.

96
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:47,714
Black in Gaming, which is a part of the IDGA Foundation.

97
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:52,998
Black Girls Code and Hidden Genius Project, which is.

98
00:05:53,622 --> 00:06:01,885
is for men. So a million dollars was donated to them from SIE, specifically those four organizations.

99
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:07,648
There are three other organizations that we're working with. One I can announce, which is the

100
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:16,412
Black Collegiate Game Association, and that organization has a network of 16 HBCU universities,

101
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:20,293
are historically black colleges and universities.

102
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:26,994
we're doing all sorts of great programming with them. They have a scholarship that falls under

103
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:32,979
our PlayStation Career Pathways, which is what we've developed based on the social justice

104
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:41,906
initiatives that we're doing. And so BCGA has a scholarship program where they support students

105
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:48,070
that are upperclassmen with hardships and finances. And so we're

106
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:55,606
working to make sure that our Black students are able to actually graduate. We were told that

107
00:06:55,806 --> 00:07:04,591
some of them will drop out of school for as little as $2,500, $5,000. And so if PlayStation

108
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:11,916
can support those students in making sure that they complete their education, to me that's a,

109
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:17,979
we're in the, going towards the right direction. The next part for us is internships because we

110
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,280
want to.

111
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:22,927
improve the channels that we're reaching in talent acquisition.

112
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:29,871
And so we're working with several organizations to build programs that will allow us to bring

113
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:33,973
in students from HBCUs specifically.

114
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:43,378
We've never, like SIE has never tapped into HBCUs as a TA channel for resources, our recruits.

115
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:44,998
And so

116
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:49,623
Now we have the opportunity to bridge that gap,

117
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,770
bring in new talent from HBCUs,

118
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,075
and hopefully land them a position and career

119
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:58,800
in the video game industry, specifically at PlayStation.

120
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:08,110
That's awesome. I love that level of investment. Wow. If you told me three years ago today that

121
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,893
this was the future, I wouldn't have believed you. So I love it. I love where I can say this. Maybe

122
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:19,455
you can't say it, but I love it when companies put their money where their mouth is. Fantastic.

123
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:21,776
Thank you so much. Trinidad.

124
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:30,362
I know you have been working relentlessly, tirelessly, sleeplessly on driving impact at Niantic.

125
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:36,946
You do so many things. Mind shedding some light with our audience on maybe your current role and your current initiatives?

126
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:46,312
I'll piggyback off Davina on the GameHeads tip because we also are supportive of GameHeads

127
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:54,298
and we just launched a certificate class with Cal State USMB, Cal State East Bay, not USMB,

128
00:08:54,498 --> 00:09:03,945
Cal State East Bay, and in partnership with Unity and Oculus, and it's a certificate program

129
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,988
around, well,

130
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:16,738
Unity, VR, and AR. And so it's just the beginning and we're excited because the goal,

131
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:26,601
the long-term goal, is to find ways to infiltrate colleges, HBCUs, local communities that don't

132
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:36,345
have access to possible this AR, VR gaming space, even just the tech that's going out.

133
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:43,328
finding ways to get people just a taste for it, a desire for it, getting it in front of them.

134
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:52,033
And so the beauty of Gameheads is that they have a program where they can teach youth and young

135
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:59,276
adults from a thought inception all the way to getting it on a platform on how to navigate

136
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:01,978
this game industry. They have, they have.

137
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,585
something that actually works, right? A lot of their students are at USC. A lot of their students

138
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:13,271
are interning at some of our companies and working with us. And so how do we get that in front of

139
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:20,297
HBCUs? How do we get that in the South, in the Carolinas? How do we get that in Detroit? And

140
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:23,580
so these are ideas and the vision that we have. So this is the first step.

141
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:30,706
step number one. We also are, last year we hosted a program called the Treehouse Apprenticeship

142
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:37,932
Program where we are creating an unconventional pipeline of boot camp talent and Treehouse has

143
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:44,036
pivoted so now we are pivoting to find a new partner to continue this program because last

144
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:50,582
year was successful. We hired seven people from this unconventional background, never worked in

145
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:52,523
tech before in QA and in UX.

146
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:58,565
I mentioned earlier, I like changing policy.

147
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:02,947
It's not sexy, it's not something that on a GDC panel,

148
00:11:02,987 --> 00:11:04,788
people are gonna be like, ooh, that's so cool.

149
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:08,830
But we are actually changing how we track

150
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:11,912
our marginalized ethnicities and genders.

151
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,551
that there is a broken system of the EEOC

152
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:17,811
that the US requires.

153
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,852
And it's broken because two or more races

154
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:23,673
could be white and Asian.

155
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:26,274
And in tech, white and Asian is a majority.

156
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:31,735
So like that's even misrepresenting data.

157
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:36,217
And so for me, I want the data to be as pure as possible

158
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,457
because then we can make the right decisions

159
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:41,438
based on the communities that we have within our company.

160
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:49,866
I also believe that we're looking at salaries, reassessing where people are to make sure

161
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:51,487
that there's no pay disparities.

162
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:56,111
These are things that like, again, not sexy, but matter.

163
00:11:56,683 --> 00:12:02,307
Right? And so I like to do a combination of both low-hanging fruit and high-hanging fruit.

164
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:07,931
I like them to both because low-hanging fruit is fast, easy, we get short winds, people are excited, they go,

165
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:13,335
woohoo! And then the high-hanging fruit, which takes like three to five years, you know, it's like,

166
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:19,520
ugh, are we done yet? But no, but we have these small winds. And so I do think that

167
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:28,061
There's a lot around our Black Developer Initiative that's hot, it's new, but it's also not easy.

168
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:35,608
Let's talk about it. You know, at Niantic, we are an AR platform company. We focus on augmented reality,

169
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:42,054
we focus on mobile games, but we really want to be the platform of the future for augmented reality.

170
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,077
How many black augmented reality developers do y'all know?

171
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:48,257
I'm pretty sure it's like the 2% of the 2%,

172
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,098
but they're out there.

173
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,278
And so we're really trying to get awareness

174
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:57,159
around the fact that we wanna empower,

175
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,040
but building a program to be equitable

176
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,781
in a space that has for years been unequitable

177
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:05,421
is one where.

178
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:11,360
it's taken us time. We made the commitment in June of last year and it took us six months just to

179
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,104
really make sure and inform this development program to make sure that we're proud of it.

180
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:20,988
And so we launched it in February this year. We're on to our second cohort right now. We just

181
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:25,912
announced who our second cohort is and we're recruiting for our next cohort. So I mean,

182
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:28,814
these are little things that we're doing, but at the end of the day,

183
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:32,115
We're just scratching the surface.

184
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,117
We're not going to reverse 300 years of systemic racism

185
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,278
overnight, actually 400 years.

186
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,800
So how do we go about making sure

187
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,782
that not only our leaders are accountable and committed,

188
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:47,384
making sure that we're still engaging our communities

189
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:50,305
and our partnerships externally and in our backyard,

190
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:53,627
but then also building a culture that's of inclusion,

191
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:55,768
where people can bring their genius to work.

192
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:56,229
So.

193
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:03,033
These are all things that are toiling into my mind every day as I'm, I'm, I wake up, you know,

194
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:07,657
I'm not a coder and no offense to y'all coders, but like, I can't just like close the laptop

195
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:15,542
and stop thinking about this. This is, this is a long-term of thing that I hope I get to see

196
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:18,504
some in my lifetime, but I'm not banking on it.

197
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,812
Thank you. Thank you so much Trinidad.

198
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:26,398
And thank you for thinking about this even after five.

199
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,842
I think that's the tenacity that's important

200
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,625
to keep the spirit going.

201
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,087
Now, Mavel.

202
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,552
people talk about diversity initiatives

203
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:39,194
and kind of refer to them, especially in bigger companies,

204
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:42,136
almost as if they're US-centric structures.

205
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:43,817
But that's not true,

206
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:48,079
because you're dealing with a whole other region of the world

207
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:52,262
and a company that's doing it across multiple continents.

208
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:55,544
Talk to us a little bit about your experiences

209
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,665
and what you're working on over at Unity.

210
00:14:58,586 --> 00:15:00,126
Yeah, I mean, the thing is,

211
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:06,718
We have pretty much the same kind of issues in the UK and in the EMEA region,

212
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:12,019
which is obviously Europe, Middle East and Africa. But I focus predominantly on the kind

213
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,661
of European side of things, so UK, France, Germany, Finland, places like that, where we have offices.

214
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:24,283
But it's really a tricky situation trying to deal with inclusion and diversity in Europe,

215
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,024
because a lot of the legislation prevents people from even measuring diversity.

216
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,575
and inclusion in some countries in Europe is actually illegal to gather data about people's

217
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:40,482
ethnicity, for instance, or whether their sexual orientation. So it becomes really difficult to

218
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:47,529
gauge where you should focus, right? Because we know that what gets measured gets done. And if

219
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:51,653
you can't measure something, it's really hard to kind of figure out where you should be focused.

220
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:52,614
However...

221
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:56,975
what we've decided to do at Unity is to kind of focus on where we can focus.

222
00:15:57,395 --> 00:16:03,102
So we're able to gather data in the Emei region on gender. We're not able to gather any information

223
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:08,408
on ethnicity, but we're able to gather that data on gender. So we focus our efforts primarily

224
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:13,393
on gender, but that doesn't mean we don't focus on other areas. We just can't do it in a very

225
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:20,086
shall I say in your face or explicit kind of way because we can get ourselves into trouble for

226
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:26,552
doing that. But we do realise that there is still issues within countries in Europe as it pertains

227
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:31,757
to ethnicity and other what we call in the UK protected characteristics which are you know

228
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:38,263
things like LGBT status, religion, socio-economic status. So there's all those things that we do

229
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:40,285
focus on we just can't necessarily measure them.

230
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:45,066
So some of the things that we're doing in Unity on a global level is looking at,

231
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:48,308
and Trinidad mentioned it before, is looking at our data.

232
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:53,451
So we're taking a very data-based approach to pay equity, recruiting, retention,

233
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:57,013
and promotion at all levels, because we recognize that these are things

234
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:59,335
that we can control, because we have our own data.

235
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,296
Right, so that's one of the things we're focusing on.

236
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:04,118
We're also looking at introducing targets.

237
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,320
They include hiring retention targets.

238
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:13,656
to increase representation of women across all unity offices, so that's across APAC, EMEA and the US,

239
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:18,337
and also looking at increasing that representation at Black and Latinx level in the US.

240
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:24,779
And then some of the other things we're looking at is making sure that all of our leadership are

241
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:29,220
able to kind of deal with some of these issues, right, because a lot of the times

242
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,921
leadership want to be helpful but they don't necessarily understand the issues.

243
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:39,406
So we've just spent the last six months embarked on a leadership training course.

244
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:48,411
We brought in an external provider to look at how leaders at director level and above can understand race and inclusion in the workplace.

245
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:52,273
And we're kind of making sure that we're embedding those practices.

246
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:53,414
We've just finished the training.

247
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:59,057
So we're now completing plans for each leader to have targets on how they're going to embed their learning.

248
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:01,279
And then of course, we're doing things,

249
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:03,481
some of the similar things that Davina

250
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:04,482
and Trinidad have been doing.

251
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,103
So we're partnering with, I think,

252
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:09,446
nearly two dozen community organizations and nonprofits.

253
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:11,888
Some of those, most of those are in the US,

254
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,429
but we've just recently started partnering

255
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:14,250
with some in the UK.

256
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,413
So we've got the Black Tech Sales Network here.

257
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,175
And then we're also partnering with people like

258
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:23,578
Nolevate Black, Blacks in Gaming, Queer Tech,

259
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,619
all the other standard ones that you would see

260
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,600
across the US.

261
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:30,027
And then we're also doing a number of recruiting initiatives.

262
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,649
We attend five major recruiting conferences per year.

263
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:37,850
And then we do specific targeted recruiting exercises

264
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,890
with each of the directors.

265
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,731
So where they want to increase their representation,

266
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,792
we actually sit and focus our attentions

267
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:44,932
on how they can do that.

268
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:49,933
So we're recruiting specifically for under-representation

269
00:18:49,973 --> 00:18:52,034
and making sure we're increasing that within our leadership.

270
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:59,112
So we're doing a number of things and we're trying to make sure that approach is consistent from US to APAC to EMEA.

271
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:03,074
But as I said, it's slightly challenging sometimes when we can't kind of gather that data.

272
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:06,995
But we're still making sure we're focusing on those things because the issues are the same wherever they are.

273
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:11,777
I said at the beginning that my background isn't in tech, my background's in inclusion.

274
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,759
I've been doing this work for 20 years and the issues are the same from industry to industry.

275
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,620
So we're just making sure that we're focusing on people.

276
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:22,681
and trying to do what we can to improve the experience of everybody that works within Unity.

277
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:26,723
Fantastic. Thank you so much.

278
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:30,565
Look, because we have such an incredible panel here,

279
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:34,187
I would like to pivot to an important topic.

280
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:35,407
We talk about...

281
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:42,171
targeting recruitment data, making sure that we've got, you know, this representation there

282
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:48,915
and that they are well served from, you know, an earlier point of someone's career. We've all been

283
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:54,278
there. We were all bright eyed, bushy tail, let's go get it done. Rah, rah, rule the world.

284
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,981
And sometimes the world kicks us in the back of our knees.

285
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:05,723
And this industry is quite relentless, not even just to marginalize folks, but it can be quite

286
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:11,765
unforgiving and relentless. The average turnover rate of a gaming professional,

287
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:17,027
according to the IGDA Developer Satisfaction Survey, is two to five years.

288
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:24,845
And at least from the IGDA Foundation side, every year we award and support 100 different types of

289
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:30,488
scholarships and recipients that we walk through. And time and time again, especially people who've

290
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:37,191
been in the industry for a while, we are seeing underrepresented talent face severe imposter

291
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:37,631
syndrome.

292
00:20:38,332 --> 00:20:40,052
feelings that they don't belong,

293
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:42,233
that they weren't meant to be leaders,

294
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:43,873
that they can't be promoted

295
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,014
or that they shouldn't shoot for the moon

296
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,454
and become a vice president, et cetera.

297
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:52,255
Ladies, how do we tackle retention?

298
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:58,057
Not just at the company level, but on an industry level.

299
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,158
How do we keep these awesome people

300
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,859
that we are investing time, money, research into

301
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:10,887
into this industry because it is such a shame. It is such a shame to see diverse talent leave.

302
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:15,109
Trinidad, why don't you kick us off?

303
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:29,676
It starts with a people-first mentality within management. And I like to call managers the

304
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:32,558
frozen chosen. They're hit from both sides. They're hit from

305
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,096
executive leaders, giving them direction, objectives,

306
00:21:36,157 --> 00:21:38,958
and then you have individual contributors who you manage,

307
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,360
who have their concerns, and depending on the company

308
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:45,022
and how they communicate and how transparent they are,

309
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:47,384
you're stuck, you're stuck in the middle.

310
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:52,307
I do think that a lot of companies need to invest more time,

311
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:55,629
more education, more empowerment to their managers.

312
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:59,940
educating them on how to be an inclusive leader,

313
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,945
how to inclusive hire, also...

314
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:08,010
empowering them with opportunities for stretch goals,

315
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,152
to show their leadership skills and be developed.

316
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:15,574
Another thing I would say is,

317
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:18,595
it starts at the executive leadership level.

318
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:22,437
If you really do believe in this DEI journey

319
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:25,539
or DEIB journey, DEI-EB,

320
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:28,080
like, I mean, we can add acronyms to that as well.

321
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:36,901
you have to show it at your leadership level. I mean your board, I mean your executive leaders,

322
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:43,625
do they look like the communities that you're trying to attract? And if they don't, that's a

323
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:50,490
hard miss in my opinion. Leadership is not something that, leadership in gaming.

324
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:55,646
The work so particular, oh, we need 20 plus years of experience.

325
00:22:56,427 --> 00:23:00,731
Uh, we have a mobile on, on our call who didn't come from the game industry.

326
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:02,973
I didn't come from the game industry.

327
00:23:03,578 --> 00:23:04,998
I'm a leader, Movel's a leader.

328
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,979
And like, I truly believe that at the executive level,

329
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,719
all you need to do is give them a little bootcamp,

330
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,040
have them meet some industry professionals

331
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,920
and pillars within the industry.

332
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,181
And they too can be an industry professional and leader.

333
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:22,661
And I think that's just a nuance.

334
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:24,962
It's something that we wanna do just because we can.

335
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:26,622
And I think it's a blocker.

336
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:31,763
I also believe that we have to start looking at the way

337
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:32,263
that we...

338
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:42,024
recruit. I also think that we're sort of happy with only a certain schools, you know, we recruit

339
00:23:42,065 --> 00:23:47,510
like we have, there's just there's a lot of opportunity here and if these companies really

340
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,314
want to put their money where their mouth is, which all of them seem like they're doing,

341
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:54,678
we need to start pouring into some of these colleges.

342
00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:03,751
that are less represented in this space and offer them opportunities to create a program,

343
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:09,700
create a school pipeline, also empowering more programs like GameHeads.

344
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:14,771
doing you know partnering we say that we all partner with black and gaming and

345
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:17,152
Latinx and gaming and gay gaming professionals

346
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:22,916
how are we uh keeping the companies that partner with these organizations

347
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:27,138
accountable to actually hiring the talent from these organizations

348
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:30,400
because we can run all these uh

349
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:37,174
career fairs, and they're not really, they're a waste of most people's time if you don't have

350
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:44,661
recs in hand and you're not willing to interview people on the spot, or at least get some type of

351
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:48,485
schedule where you're like, boom, we're committed to interviewing,

352
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:52,008
to getting to the second round, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

353
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:58,973
You know, and so I just truly believe that there's a lot of performative stuff happening in our industry.

354
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:01,535
I do believe we have some great DEI leaders.

355
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:04,697
We have some great DEI practitioners, Davina, great DEI.

356
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:14,905
affinity group leaders, like, have been in this space for so long, and it's unfortunate

357
00:25:15,385 --> 00:25:21,788
that only the resilient last. And the thing is, and that's not, that should not be the case,

358
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:25,370
you know, and that's the problem, right? People ask me,

359
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,731
How has your last couple of years been? I was like, yo, I felt like I've been in a boot camp.

360
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:33,812
I've been in the game industry only three years and it feels like 15, you know, and

361
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:39,134
Davina, God bless you. You know, I'm not sure how long you've been, you know, able to endure.

362
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:44,955
And obviously Sony's taking care of you, right? Like, so if you find a good place,

363
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:49,336
then you could flower and foster and grow more power to you.

364
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:55,600
But what do we do about those bad managers? Because people leave these managers, not necessarily these companies.

365
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,602
I think all of the companies that are on these panels are dope.

366
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:06,506
But I don't think all of our managers are prepared to manage people who don't look like them or may not represent what they represent.

367
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:15,050
So why are we not focusing on our management styles and how we empower our culture, and we're focused more on a pipeline?

368
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:21,878
you know, your pipeline is trash if the manager who the person who is coming in through the pipeline

369
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:28,080
doesn't understand how to work with them, empower them, see them, give feedback.

370
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,680
Announcement feedback is not a dirty word.

371
00:26:34,021 --> 00:26:41,383
And guess what? Anybody who's listening to this, if you are a manager and you manage a Black,

372
00:26:41,703 --> 00:26:44,884
Brown, marginalized gender or ethnicity person,

373
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:48,683
You better give them feedback because if you don't,

374
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,744
you're telling me that you really don't care

375
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:53,985
about their growth and empowerment at your company, period.

376
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:55,425
That's a systemic crack.

377
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:57,986
White and Asian people don't like

378
00:26:58,026 --> 00:26:59,287
giving black people feedback.

379
00:27:00,908 --> 00:27:01,688
Are you scared?

380
00:27:02,168 --> 00:27:03,308
You think we're gonna yell at you?

381
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:04,349
Come on.

382
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:08,451
You give your buddy a feedback at the bar with a beer.

383
00:27:08,811 --> 00:27:12,592
Like give me the same due diligence and give me feedback.

384
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:21,557
That tells me, and yes, I might not like your feedback, so oh well, my best professors in college.

385
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:25,334
ran me into the ground with feedback.

386
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:27,815
And I was just like, at a young age, I didn't understand.

387
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:30,676
I was like, I just hate this professor.

388
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:33,977
But that's the class that I learned the most from.

389
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:38,358
My old bosses who, one was a Jamaican woman,

390
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:40,638
God bless her soul, you know who you are.

391
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:42,799
Like, she would just run me.

392
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:46,400
Like, you need to, and she was a chief diversity officer.

393
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,540
That was my bootcamp.

394
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,001
She cared about me enough to tell me,

395
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:53,523
Trin, if you don't change your ways here, here, here, here,

396
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:54,564
you're not going to make it.

397
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:56,885
And look where I'm at today.

398
00:27:58,246 --> 00:27:59,607
Because she gave me feedback.

399
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:03,610
And I'm telling you right now, I've had more bosses than none

400
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:06,833
give me no feedback whatsoever.

401
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,034
They're, oh, you're doing great.

402
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:10,135
And then you realize.

403
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:16,291
I mean I'm still here, you haven't fired me, but I need to grow, I need to develop,

404
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:22,253
tell me what I'm doing wrong. I know I'm not doing everything perfectly. So I'll pause there

405
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:26,535
because I think that those are things that companies overlook because they just want

406
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:29,816
to focus on a pipeline, but not focus on

407
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:39,504
the rotten apple that is rotting and creating a stench. And you're like, hmm, why does nobody

408
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:43,967
want to work for this manager? Or why does nobody want to work in this organization?

409
00:28:43,987 --> 00:28:48,311
I mean, if I take a magnifying glass, I could probably figure it out.

410
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:51,033
Incredible.

411
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,352
Davina, from Trash Pipelines to Feedback,

412
00:28:55,892 --> 00:28:59,314
I know you've been at PlayStation for quite a long time.

413
00:28:59,774 --> 00:29:02,756
You are one of those early, early, I don't know,

414
00:29:02,796 --> 00:29:05,417
maybe not that early, maybe Trinidad's right.

415
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:07,078
You know, we're living in dog years.

416
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,700
You know, what are you, what do you think here?

417
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,881
Are you just resilient?

418
00:29:14,182 --> 00:29:16,003
I would say I'm an outlier.

419
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:18,444
I used to call myself a pink unicorn.

420
00:29:18,664 --> 00:29:21,485
I'm now a white unicorn because PlayStation has like,

421
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:28,507
five Black directors, two of which that are senior directors, right? So specifically at Black at

422
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:36,573
PlayStation and SIE in general, they are making changes and our leader, I love our leader,

423
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:45,460
Jim Ryan, he has come in and he has made some instrumental impacts that has allowed us to do

424
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,504
a lot in DE&I. First, he understood the need for DE&I and he brought

425
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:57,796
a very strategic and seasoned individual with Tiffany Hester.

426
00:29:58,557 --> 00:30:05,924
And what we've been able to do, and he's also changed HR, so now we have Orit, who is very

427
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:11,309
instrumental and knowledgeable about, you know, just the talent that we bring in.

428
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:11,369
So,

429
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:19,107
Trina, you mentioned so many key things. One of the first things that

430
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:24,116
PlayStation has done is they've changed their performance management tool.

431
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:28,363
and framework, and it includes cultural leadership values.

432
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:30,384
And within cultural leadership values,

433
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:33,065
which now is not just about what you do

434
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,486
and your goals that you accomplish,

435
00:30:34,506 --> 00:30:35,927
it's about how you do it,

436
00:30:36,407 --> 00:30:39,109
but within that is embedded DE&I.

437
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:42,770
And so we specifically can carve goals out

438
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:45,392
within DE&I space.

439
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:48,373
So I can talk about being a Black at,

440
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:51,335
the Black at PlayStation president within my goals.

441
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:53,136
And my manager is now,

442
00:30:53,969 --> 00:31:00,212
understanding that because it's a part of the goals for SIE, and he is going to rate me on

443
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:08,697
doing that job. So hands down, that has been a big change in making sure that, you know,

444
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:16,562
how we execute, how we treat our employees who are underserved, you know, all of the things that

445
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:23,246
is needed is there. DE&I has been an impact as well because what we understood is...

446
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:31,710
is there is a gatekeeper, there is filtering in talent acquisition. We all know this. And Merveille,

447
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:37,171
you mentioned data and Trinidad, you also mentioned this as well. You know, we have

448
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:44,013
all sorts of data in the gaming industry about women, so gender is there. We know, you know,

449
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:51,714
you know, we know demographics on other areas, but you really don't see much in race or they don't.

450
00:31:52,353 --> 00:32:01,195
allow us to make it public, right? And so, like, I did a presentation that showed that, you know,

451
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:09,777
nationwide, the Black representation in the U.S. is about between 5 and 7 percent,

452
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:16,779
Black representation in tech. When you come to Silicon Valley, though, that decreases down to 2.5

453
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:17,099
percent.

454
00:32:20,393 --> 00:32:24,895
right? So that's like half of the, you know, representation and nationwide.

455
00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:30,297
But when you go to the universities, you'll see like Stanford, if you look at the engineering

456
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:36,500
program there, they're about 5% Black representation. So there's this mis-under,

457
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:42,243
there's this misnomer that, you know, there's not enough Black talent, for example, in the pipeline,

458
00:32:42,283 --> 00:32:47,665
but that's not true. There are gatekeepers, these managers that Trinidad has talked about.

459
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:50,284
that have unconscious bias.

460
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:52,885
And, you know, I think that's a new fancy word.

461
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:55,606
Let's just say what it is, is prejudice, right?

462
00:32:56,906 --> 00:33:00,128
And the companies are not doing a great job

463
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:04,550
at providing training and holding them accountable

464
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,311
for being prejudice, point blank.

465
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:14,013
And they're keeping talent out of the pipeline, period.

466
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:22,734
Or if we do get into the pipeline, again, I say that I am an outlier because I came from the grassroots.

467
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:28,476
I was a project coordinator when I started at Sony, at SIE.

468
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:35,898
And because I had great managers like Dave Moran, shout out to him, and he allowed for me to grow.

469
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:41,320
I also took accountability for my career and was able to level up.

470
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,645
And you know, they also pay for my education. So I didn't have my undergrad when I started and

471
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:52,389
Sony paid for it. And then I went back for a master's degree, Sony paid for that.

472
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:59,455
And I promoted each time. So I'm an outlier. So I won't say that there are many like me.

473
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:06,062
However, I think that there are programs that we're putting together within DE&I space that

474
00:34:06,122 --> 00:34:09,545
is allowing us to do a couple of extra things because

475
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:12,702
I believe we, as an underrepresented community,

476
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:14,902
have to take responsibility as well.

477
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:19,364
So we are looking at providing awareness

478
00:34:19,484 --> 00:34:22,485
that there are opportunities in the video game industry,

479
00:34:22,565 --> 00:34:23,705
starting in middle school.

480
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:27,106
Because if you tap into middle school kids

481
00:34:27,186 --> 00:34:29,607
and let them know the talents that they have

482
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:32,307
in computer science skills, or even the arts,

483
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:35,128
so music and, you know,

484
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,743
visual arts, like, you know, creative drawing and all those type of skills that they can get can

485
00:34:42,803 --> 00:34:50,108
translate into a career in the video game industry. So we're under the PlayStation Career Pathways,

486
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:55,392
we are working with those non-profit organizations through the Social Justice Initiative

487
00:34:55,952 --> 00:35:02,837
to build programming that starts at the middle school level and ensure that we can create pipelines.

488
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:09,175
that start there. So we're working with schools, we're working with the universities, and then

489
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:17,039
creating programs within Sony that allow for that talent to come in. Specifically, HBCUs

490
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:22,502
is our target as well. So creating the pathways, creating the internships.

491
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:25,957
Sony's internship is a challenge.

492
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:27,658
Like if you're not at a certain school,

493
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:29,899
it's pretty much challenging to get in.

494
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,600
So we're creating a separate internship program

495
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,101
that allows for talent within the HBCUs to pipe in.

496
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:44,223
And those internships are not one set of season.

497
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:46,483
They basically start as a freshman.

498
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,271
and then come back as a sophomore,

499
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:51,032
and then they come back as a junior

500
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:52,472
and come back as a senior,

501
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:57,313
and they end up with some sort of apprenticeship opportunity

502
00:35:57,373 --> 00:36:00,174
and an actual career at PlayStation.

503
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:04,515
That to me is impacting the pipeline.

504
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:08,497
I think the place where we've not targeted yet,

505
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:12,358
but I think DE&I, Tiffany is in, or Reed are handling this.

506
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:18,496
is the unconscious bias that we face, making sure that those gatekeepers, we break that down as well.

507
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:25,340
And we've asked for data. We want to know things like how many Black managers are there,

508
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,584
how many have been promoted, how many are being paid equitably, you know, with their peers. We

509
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:33,605
want to understand.

510
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:39,531
when there is the riff, how many are impacted, how many black employees are impacted, and what is the

511
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:45,355
off-boarding, right? We want to know these things because we know if we understand the metrics, then

512
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:51,318
we can bridge the gaps, and if you don't have the metrics like Movel says, then you really don't

513
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:59,883
have really a justification to base what you're doing off of. So, you know, I said a lot, but

514
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:09,490
I just think that if, you know, 2.7% in tech,

515
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,151
Black representation is bad and it needs to increase.

516
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:14,851
And if you go into the game industry,

517
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:20,252
I think it's less than 1% from a survey that IGDA created,

518
00:37:20,492 --> 00:37:23,053
you know, based off of GDC attendance, right?

519
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:25,073
We have to do better than that.

520
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:27,893
There's, so when you look at, you know,

521
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:31,794
underrepresented communities play games.

522
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:36,530
They hold large markets that need to be tapped into.

523
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,733
And if they are playing your games,

524
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:44,617
why not make sure that the people have opportunities

525
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:47,459
to see themselves represented in games correctly,

526
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,623
that people are making the games represent them, right?

527
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:56,527
I think that it would bring more revenue

528
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,068
to our game companies,

529
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,990
and they just don't realize that yet.

530
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:06,145
Mouvel, how does Unity tackle retention?

531
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:09,807
I know that you all focus on what you can focus on.

532
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:12,928
So how do you focus on retaining talent?

533
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:15,670
So, I mean, all of the things

534
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,611
that both Trinidad and Givino have said

535
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:20,072
apply to everyone at Unity also.

536
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:24,955
And I think the biggest issue is with the gatekeepers

537
00:38:25,355 --> 00:38:27,036
and identifying talent, right?

538
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:28,897
Because even when we get people in from under,

539
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:36,283
it's classic and it's not just in tech or in gaming, you get people through the door and then

540
00:38:36,323 --> 00:38:40,387
you don't recognize them as talent so they don't progress right and then that's what happens in

541
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:44,029
terms of your retention rates they slip because if I'm not progressing and I'm not seen as talent

542
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:49,554
why would I stick around right so people leave. So what we're focusing on at Unity at the moment

543
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:55,418
and I'm personally working on this is building a sponsorship program for our underrepresented

544
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:00,402
and what we're going to have is our senior leaders our senior most leaders

545
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:06,761
be responsible for sponsoring an individual from an underrepresented group who decides

546
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:09,823
to nominate themselves, because we're not going to have the gatekeepers nominate who

547
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:13,925
talent is and who can then have a senior leader sponsor because then we're just going to perpetuate

548
00:39:14,306 --> 00:39:18,949
the same old, same old, right? So you're going to decide that you're talent and you're going

549
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:22,691
to represent yourself and say, I'm going to nominate myself for this program. And then

550
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:26,634
you will spend, the program is going to run for about a year, so you'll spend a year being

551
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:30,356
sponsored by some of our most senior people within the organization.

552
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:33,501
And we've chosen to focus on sponsorship rather than mentoring,

553
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:35,804
because mentoring only takes you so far.

554
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:40,208
Sponsorship allows the senior person to advocate for their talent

555
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:41,329
when they're not in the room.

556
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,592
And that's not to say they're going to say to you,

557
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:46,174
say to somebody, give that person a job because they're my sponsee.

558
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:49,157
It's about saying, hey, you should talk to Trinidad.

559
00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:50,238
She's really talented.

560
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:55,664
Because we know that when these discussions about who's talented take place,

561
00:39:56,005 --> 00:40:00,007
it's very rare that somebody who's from an underrepresented group is even mentioned.

562
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:04,130
And that's because the gatekeepers have not put them forward as talent.

563
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,751
They've not been given some of those career-defining opportunities

564
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,232
that would allow them to stand out.

565
00:40:08,952 --> 00:40:11,934
So we have to be explicit about how we manage that.

566
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:14,416
And that's why we've decided to create a sponsorship programme.

567
00:40:14,436 --> 00:40:18,838
So these people then have that one-to-one key into leadership.

568
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,129
They'll get to see how the business itself operates.

569
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,692
They'll get to mix and mingle with people

570
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:26,514
who are outside of their management chain

571
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:29,517
so that they can then see for themselves

572
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:31,118
what it's like outside of their management chain,

573
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,800
but also those people are exposed to them.

574
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,242
And what we hope will happen there is that

575
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:37,864
once we've got one cohort through this process

576
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,406
and people can see that talent

577
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:41,408
does not just look like one thing,

578
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:45,748
we're hoping then that people start saying, oh okay actually there were some really good people

579
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:50,111
came through that talent that sponsorship program last time, let's have a look at talent in a

580
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:55,696
different way. We really want people to start re-examining what talent looks like because if

581
00:40:55,756 --> 00:41:00,800
we don't we're not going to retain people because ultimately no one's going to stay somewhere

582
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,364
they're not growing and I love what Trinidad was saying about feedback because you know again

583
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:10,508
outside of tech, in tech, people are afraid to give people of color feedback and I don't understand

584
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:10,968
why that is.

585
00:41:11,662 --> 00:41:14,243
You know, I have a teenage daughter and I used to tell her,

586
00:41:14,324 --> 00:41:16,865
if your teachers are not complaining about your bad behavior,

587
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,126
if you behave badly, it means they don't care.

588
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:20,306
They actually do not care.

589
00:41:21,107 --> 00:41:23,488
If they're talking to me about your behavior,

590
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:25,589
that says to me they recognize you as talent

591
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:26,650
and they want you to do better.

592
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,310
And it's the same in the workplace.

593
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:30,011
And all of that generic feedback,

594
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:31,392
you're doing great, means nothing.

595
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:33,553
It's just, it's the smoke screen

596
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:34,974
for not telling you what you really think.

597
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:36,775
Because at the end of the day,

598
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,842
they're going to be high performers who are from underrepresented groups and they're going to be low

599
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:45,285
performers. But in order for people to progress, they need to know that they're a low performer so

600
00:41:45,305 --> 00:41:49,887
they can improve, right? And that's part of how you retain people. You give them that constructive

601
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:55,070
feedback that is not always favorable, but they're able to understand this is where I need to grow.

602
00:41:56,091 --> 00:42:00,914
So we're really focusing in on that aspect of things. So we're taking the top down and the

603
00:42:00,954 --> 00:42:04,916
bottom up approach, but then also the training I mentioned before for our senior leaders and

604
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:07,337
directors and above. We're expecting them to take what they learned.

605
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,791
and start helping that trickle down

606
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:10,912
into the management chains.

607
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:12,373
And that's why we're gonna be working with them

608
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:15,295
on an implementation plan as to how they then take

609
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:16,695
some of that knowledge that they acquired

610
00:42:17,296 --> 00:42:18,817
and pass it on to the gatekeepers

611
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:20,838
so that they can actually start fixing

612
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:23,340
some of those issues that occur

613
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,101
where we've got some of those bad managers

614
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:28,663
who have unconscious bias or just racist tendencies

615
00:42:28,723 --> 00:42:29,804
or sexist tendencies.

616
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:32,806
Because what we start doing is focusing on those people

617
00:42:33,286 --> 00:42:35,448
and giving them the tools to do better when they don't.

618
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:38,246
you then have the reason and the rationale for saying,

619
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:39,967
it's time for you to leave this company.

620
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:42,188
So that's where we're focused at the moment.

621
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:46,429
Fantastic, and thanks so much for that.

622
00:42:46,589 --> 00:42:48,630
Do you mind, Movel, actually kicking us off

623
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,791
with our last question as we wrap here?

624
00:42:52,351 --> 00:42:55,232
I'd love for every panelist, starting with Movel,

625
00:42:55,293 --> 00:43:01,035
to kick us off with, what piece of advice do you have

626
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,480
for the next generation of talent,

627
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,141
for the many yous who are watching this and going,

628
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:09,842
I wanna be them, I wanna do that.

629
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:14,603
You know, what are we telling folks these days?

630
00:43:15,023 --> 00:43:16,404
At least what would you tell them?

631
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:19,464
Do you know, I will tell people what I tell my daughter,

632
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:22,465
which is you can do anything you want to do,

633
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:24,426
but there's gonna be people who try to obstruct you.

634
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:25,606
And so.

635
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:31,043
For me, it's not about trying to get a seat at the table if no one wants you to be there.

636
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:36,125
You make your own damn table. Or you burst the doors down and tell people,

637
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:38,966
actually, I'm talented. But it starts with you believing in yourself.

638
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:45,888
And so it goes back to that same feedback conversation. I want to tell teachers to

639
00:43:45,948 --> 00:43:50,549
give feedback to students. If they're not doing things they should be doing, tell them.

640
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,230
If they're talented, recognize that.

641
00:43:53,975 --> 00:43:57,316
and actually showcase that and put it where it belongs.

642
00:43:58,076 --> 00:43:59,696
All too often, children who are talented

643
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:01,437
from underrepresented groups at schools

644
00:44:02,157 --> 00:44:04,117
don't get told they're talented or we hide their talent

645
00:44:04,177 --> 00:44:07,358
or we have them help other kids out in the classroom

646
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,118
as opposed to saying,

647
00:44:08,518 --> 00:44:09,998
let's create a gifted and talented programme

648
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:12,099
where we can focus on these kids and get them to shine

649
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:14,939
and move them through processes sooner

650
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,200
if they're ready for it.

651
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,740
So it starts at that stage.

652
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,180
So I would tell teachers to identify talent.

653
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:25,578
and actually focus on it and give feedback where someone isn't performing to their best abilities.

654
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:31,261
And then talk to those individuals and tell them, you know, hear what people are saying to you.

655
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:37,143
Don't shy away from feedback and criticism. Ask for it. If it's not being given to you, ask for it.

656
00:44:37,643 --> 00:44:40,444
Because you know, deep down, you know if you're not doing a good job.

657
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:44,247
right? And so sometimes we sit back and we want to be told,

658
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:47,449
yeah, you're doing an okay job and we accept that. And then we complain that

659
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:50,211
actually we're not progressing. But if you know you're not doing a good

660
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:54,493
job, ask for that feedback and ask for very specific feedback also. So people

661
00:44:54,513 --> 00:44:56,294
will say, you're doing fine. Okay, well what does

662
00:44:56,334 --> 00:45:00,516
that mean? How am I doing fine? And if I'm doing fine, how can I improve?

663
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:03,778
When I used to go with my daughter to her

664
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:07,340
parents evenings, is what we call them here, where you had a chance to speak to

665
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,342
teachers. They would always say, she's doing great.

666
00:45:09,963 --> 00:45:13,265
and I would have a little pen and paper and say, okay, great, how can she improve on that? Great.

667
00:45:14,405 --> 00:45:18,466
What else can she be doing? And I expect people to be asking those questions for themselves.

668
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:22,768
We have to take responsibility for our own development, especially if people don't want

669
00:45:22,808 --> 00:45:27,169
to help us with that. So that's what I would tell people is take your development seriously,

670
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:34,132
advocate for yourself. It's not always easy, but if it's not easy for you, get yourself a mentor,

671
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:38,573
get yourself a sponsor, get someone to speak for you, because that's important also. And it's fine

672
00:45:39,275 --> 00:45:40,796
at Unity, we're creating that program,

673
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:43,116
but there's absolutely nothing wrong with individuals

674
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:44,956
going and speaking to a senior person and saying,

675
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:46,277
I like the way you work.

676
00:45:46,337 --> 00:45:47,637
Trinidad, I love how you speak.

677
00:45:48,517 --> 00:45:49,537
I love what you stand for.

678
00:45:49,777 --> 00:45:50,977
Would you mind mentoring me?

679
00:45:51,658 --> 00:45:54,798
So, you know, don't sit back and wait to be told what to do.

680
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:56,518
Take your career into your own hands.

681
00:45:56,538 --> 00:45:57,379
That's what I would tell people.

682
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:00,179
Fantastic. Thank you.

683
00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:01,999
Davina, piece of advice.

684
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,400
I would say take accountability for your career first.

685
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,081
And if you want to get into the game industry,

686
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:13,204
make sure you're doing things like participating with GDC,

687
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:18,288
going to E3, and understanding the various organizations that

688
00:46:18,348 --> 00:46:21,810
are in the industry, the various publishers and game

689
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:22,731
developers, right?

690
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:26,854
Make sure that your college experience

691
00:46:27,134 --> 00:46:29,916
is specific to the discipline that you

692
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,077
want to get it within because it's

693
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:36,240
going to give you a higher success rate in getting a job.

694
00:46:36,664 --> 00:46:41,506
Make sure you get an intern and get a mentor as sooner than later, right?

695
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:46,708
If you have a mentor in your college years and you have people that can sponsor you,

696
00:46:47,368 --> 00:46:51,369
I think that that also levels the playing field for you.

697
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,991
Make sure you take negotiation skills because there's nothing wrong.

698
00:46:56,071 --> 00:47:01,233
I know one of the underrepresented, one of the things we do that we can improve most

699
00:47:01,373 --> 00:47:04,294
is we don't negotiate well enough our salaries.

700
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:06,865
when we're coming on board to these companies.

701
00:47:07,265 --> 00:47:10,106
So take negotiation skills and don't be afraid

702
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:13,887
to understand what your value is and ask for it

703
00:47:14,287 --> 00:47:17,027
because you really only have that one chance, right?

704
00:47:18,008 --> 00:47:21,109
And then the other thing is once you get into the company,

705
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:23,989
understand from an HR perspective

706
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,210
what training opportunities you have.

707
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:30,319
And make sure you always level up your skills

708
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:34,722
by making sure you keep abreast of the training that's there

709
00:47:34,962 --> 00:47:36,504
and keep your skills sharpened.

710
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:41,627
And then, and you need to ask your managers

711
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:43,969
for one-to-ones on a consistent basis

712
00:47:44,289 --> 00:47:46,671
and understand what the expectations are,

713
00:47:47,251 --> 00:47:49,953
you know, for your specific job.

714
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,855
And if you're touching base on a cadence,

715
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:54,997
that means that you shouldn't be surprised

716
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:56,398
at the end of the day.

717
00:47:56,905 --> 00:48:00,746
when you end up with your performance appraisal.

718
00:48:00,766 --> 00:48:03,308
And then you also should be doing

719
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:04,968
your individual development plan

720
00:48:05,108 --> 00:48:06,969
so that in three to five years,

721
00:48:07,029 --> 00:48:09,970
you know the trajectory of your career.

722
00:48:10,311 --> 00:48:11,511
You know where you wanna go.

723
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:13,652
And then get those networks

724
00:48:13,732 --> 00:48:16,073
because don't only rely on the people

725
00:48:16,113 --> 00:48:18,174
that you know at your current job.

726
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:27,092
Black in Gaming is a great network of people from various publishers and development houses

727
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:32,793
where if you get to know these individuals, you have opportunities elsewhere.

728
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:33,734
The networks are great.

729
00:48:34,074 --> 00:48:36,974
So that is my advice.

730
00:48:37,274 --> 00:48:40,795
I know that's a lot to chew, but and it's a lot of work.

731
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,275
This is not easy, guys.

732
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:47,797
You know, if you really want to get into this industry, it's fun.

733
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:49,537
It's rewarding.

734
00:48:50,673 --> 00:48:54,336
I think, you know, I can't complain.

735
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:58,079
For 16 plus years, I've been able to do various things

736
00:48:58,399 --> 00:48:59,640
and have a ball.

737
00:49:00,421 --> 00:49:03,784
And, you know, people in my family regard what I do highly.

738
00:49:03,864 --> 00:49:05,185
Like I'm some big shot.

739
00:49:05,465 --> 00:49:08,027
I even got asked for my autograph at the airport

740
00:49:08,047 --> 00:49:10,569
because I had my badge on and I thought that was insane.

741
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:15,533
But, so there are perks to being at.

742
00:49:16,129 --> 00:49:22,153
some of these companies and it's enjoyable work. So now you know that's my advice and then just

743
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:29,458
have fun and make sure that you're just you're not working just for a paycheck but you have

744
00:49:29,538 --> 00:49:36,183
substance and it's building you know you personally but also have work-life balance

745
00:49:36,603 --> 00:49:38,285
and that's that's all I'm going to say.

746
00:49:39,887 --> 00:49:47,810
Fantastic, thanks for that. Trinidad, mind closing us out with your last thoughts and piece of advice?

747
00:49:49,971 --> 00:49:55,894
Sure, so my advice is very simple. I think number one is network and I think this is something that

748
00:49:55,934 --> 00:50:02,097
everybody has said on the panel is network, network, network, network. We could put our

749
00:50:02,157 --> 00:50:05,318
names out there, we can say that we're in this industry and that we're here to help.

750
00:50:05,928 --> 00:50:13,573
But I can count on my hand how many people actually take that opportunity and reach out and actually try to network.

751
00:50:14,273 --> 00:50:15,594
Black in gaming is there.

752
00:50:18,253 --> 00:50:20,634
Latinx and gaming, gay gaming professionals,

753
00:50:20,674 --> 00:50:26,356
game devs of color, IGDA, IGDA, IGDAF.

754
00:50:26,477 --> 00:50:27,397
Like, you know, like there's just like,

755
00:50:28,377 --> 00:50:33,480
there's so much that you could essentially just tap into

756
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,160
and say like, hey, I'm interested.

757
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,781
I don't know where to start.

758
00:50:37,141 --> 00:50:39,422
You could start at any of those places.

759
00:50:41,003 --> 00:50:44,425
And it takes being vulnerable and stepping out and saying,

760
00:50:44,465 --> 00:50:47,346
hey, I don't know everything, but I'm interested.

761
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:52,876
I've never been hit with resistance in this industry.

762
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,717
You may not get a response right away.

763
00:50:54,737 --> 00:50:57,138
You may not even get a response, but you will get one.

764
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:03,162
And so for me, I think that's something that's overlooked.

765
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:04,943
And yes, if you're an introvert,

766
00:51:05,043 --> 00:51:09,145
I understand there are ways that you can write a great email

767
00:51:09,225 --> 00:51:10,806
that catches someone's attention.

768
00:51:10,826 --> 00:51:15,128
There are ways that you could send a LinkedIn message,

769
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:17,450
you know, that is captivating.

770
00:51:18,134 --> 00:51:25,263
Use your genius. Use your gifts. And then also, once you network, offer them something.

771
00:51:25,803 --> 00:51:29,888
Is there anything I can do to help? Is there a volunteer opportunity? Is there...

772
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:34,990
I find that sometimes it's even hard for me to be like,

773
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:36,612
that's a good question.

774
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:38,613
And that makes me wanna come back with like,

775
00:51:39,174 --> 00:51:41,496
all right, here you go, here's an opportunity,

776
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,397
here's an idea, I want you to do this.

777
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:46,500
And so another thing is when anybody meets with me

778
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,402
for like an introductory or one-on-one,

779
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:52,345
I give them assignments and I'll see how serious you are

780
00:51:52,385 --> 00:51:54,287
if you actually come back with the assignments.

781
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:56,627
And those assignments are not for me.

782
00:51:57,387 --> 00:51:58,648
Those assignments are for you.

783
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:02,411
So understanding exactly, like taking the time

784
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:05,593
to maybe not have it correct in the sense of like,

785
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,454
you know what the future holds,

786
00:52:07,774 --> 00:52:10,496
but actually like be like, hey, I have some ideas.

787
00:52:10,556 --> 00:52:12,137
I don't know what my future could hold,

788
00:52:12,177 --> 00:52:13,198
but I'm really interested

789
00:52:13,218 --> 00:52:14,439
and I just wanna get in the industry.

790
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:15,479
Like, where do I start?

791
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:17,100
You know, having those conversations

792
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,802
and then being open, open to feedback.

793
00:52:20,022 --> 00:52:21,543
Because one thing I know is,

794
00:52:22,304 --> 00:52:24,665
at least on this panel, we all give feedback.

795
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:27,127
And we all give feedback because we care.

796
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:31,229
And I can't say that I've, you know,

797
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:32,609
this generation behind me,

798
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,110
I wanna work for some of y'all, y'all are so smart.

799
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,312
But it's also like, if I'm coming to you with feedback,

800
00:52:39,473 --> 00:52:42,114
listen, I'm not hating, I'm not hating on you.

801
00:52:42,214 --> 00:52:43,275
I want you to succeed.

802
00:52:43,335 --> 00:52:45,736
I want you to make it in this space.

803
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:49,718
And it takes the Davinas, the Movels, the Nikas

804
00:52:49,778 --> 00:52:50,958
who've been here longer.

805
00:52:52,572 --> 00:52:59,175
who can come in and give you that feedback in a way that because they understand the scope and they understand the journey.

806
00:52:59,255 --> 00:53:07,160
So I think those two things are being able to network, being able to tap into the resources that are already out there.

807
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,841
I'm pretty sure.

808
00:53:09,281 --> 00:53:29,989
You can rerun this and you can listen and you can hear these things and you can Google search all of those things that we mentioned game heads, black and gaming, all these organizations in the UK there's Code Coven, there's a bunch of, you know, organizations out there. So how do we tap in? You have to do your work.

809
00:53:30,537 --> 00:53:33,099
And then at the end of the day, you're like, dang it,

810
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:35,340
I forgot everything that was just said.

811
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,843
Hit up Nika, hit up Davina, hit up Jovel, hit up myself

812
00:53:40,403 --> 00:53:43,425
and be like, hey, I'm really interested

813
00:53:43,465 --> 00:53:44,586
but I just don't know where to start.

814
00:53:44,606 --> 00:53:46,327
Go for it.

815
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,521
Awesome. Well, thank you to everyone.

816
00:53:51,681 --> 00:53:53,382
