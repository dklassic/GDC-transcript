1
00:00:05,404 --> 00:00:06,625
My name is Matt Heinegger.

2
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:08,627
I am a technical artist at Undead Labs,

3
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:10,228
and today I'm going to be talking to you

4
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:12,150
about the photogrammetry workflow

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,831
that I developed for State of Decay 2.

6
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:16,213
Over the last couple years,

7
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,215
there have been a number of really great GDC talks

8
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:19,516
about photogrammetry.

9
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,158
Companies are pushing the bounds farther every year,

10
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:24,800
and the quality ceiling is always getting higher.

11
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:27,642
This talk is not about that.

12
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:31,265
Instead, this is a talk about lowering the floor,

13
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:32,847
reducing barrier to entry,

14
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:35,048
and making photogrammetry available to everyone.

15
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:38,528
whether you have a AAA budget or an Indy budget.

16
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:41,850
So I'm gonna be walking you through the pipeline

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,330
that I developed over the last two years,

18
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,772
and I'll give you an in-depth look at the rig that I created

19
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:49,613
and used to scan over 200 people for State of Decay 2.

20
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,034
I will also be offering some tips and tricks

21
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,715
to help you get the best out of your own scans.

22
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,897
So before I dive too deep in this,

23
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:02,318
I'd like to start by giving you some of our project history

24
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:03,578
so you have a little bit of context

25
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:04,398
for what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,954
Back in early 2016, State of Decay 2 went through an engine change mid-production, which,

27
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:14,856
as you can imagine, had a huge negative impact on our development schedule.

28
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:19,760
So while I waited for some infrastructure things to get set up with our artists, I decided

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,563
to take some time and see what I could do to speed up our production pipeline and maybe

30
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,664
get some of that time back.

31
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:29,106
And photogrammetry was one of the things on my list to research.

32
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:34,004
Now at the time there were a couple games released

33
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:36,207
that had used photogrammetry to great effect.

34
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:38,349
But it was still fairly new to games

35
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,071
and there weren't a whole lot of practical guides

36
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:41,332
on getting usable scans.

37
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:45,477
So I just started doing it to see what I could get out of it.

38
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,921
I began by scanning some props.

39
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,804
Quality ranged from so-so to completely unusable.

40
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:56,145
Now there was a lot of lighting baked into the textures,

41
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,046
there was a lot of noise in the meshes,

42
00:01:58,126 --> 00:01:59,847
and they just generally weren't that great.

43
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:02,129
I ended up spending more time cleaning up the mesh

44
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,111
than I did just modeling that same prop by hand.

45
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:07,433
So after about a dozen scans,

46
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:08,994
I was about to write off the technology

47
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:10,495
as being unfit for our needs.

48
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:14,658
And then on a whim, I scanned a coworker's face.

49
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:18,401
I brought this face to our only character artist at the time.

50
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:21,356
and he was absolutely thrilled.

51
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,118
He turned that scan into a playable character that day,

52
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,620
and our character pipeline has been using

53
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,741
photogrammetry ever since.

54
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,825
So for those of you who are unfamiliar with photogrammetry,

55
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:34,666
let's take a look at how it actually works.

56
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,188
Now this isn't going to be a step-by-step guide

57
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:39,349
on which buttons to push in which software.

58
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,691
Those guides do actually exist on the internet these days.

59
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:44,553
This is going to be more of a high-level overview,

60
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:45,874
just so that we're all on the same page.

61
00:02:48,332 --> 00:02:49,412
What is photogrammetry?

62
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,013
A photogrammetry uses a series of photos

63
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:55,234
to reconstruct a 3D object, or of a physical object.

64
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,555
Basically, it's 3D scanning with a camera.

65
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:03,016
I begin by having my subject sit in a chair

66
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:05,276
with even lighting, and I take a series of photos

67
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:06,036
from different angles.

68
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:10,217
For a face, I do four rows of photos at different heights,

69
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:11,658
generating roughly 40 photos.

70
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:17,110
I then feed these photos into our photogrammetry software.

71
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,050
There are a couple of good options out there.

72
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,711
Metashape and RealityCapture are the two most common ones.

73
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:24,972
I personally prefer Metashape.

74
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:28,933
It's a lot slower, but it gives more fine-tuning control.

75
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:33,334
Once the photos are in the software,

76
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:36,035
it analyzes these photos for key features.

77
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:41,077
It then tries to match these points in multiple photos.

78
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:45,797
Using these matches, the software uses perspective

79
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:48,939
distortion to determine the camera's location in 3D space.

80
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:53,302
When the camera locations are determined,

81
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:55,603
the software projects those point matches

82
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:58,685
and where the points meet, it creates a point cloud.

83
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,928
Next, the software does this projection again

84
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,429
at a higher resolution to create

85
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:05,830
a much more dense point cloud.

86
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,731
This cloud was about 17 million points.

87
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:13,804
The software then converts the point cloud into a surface,

88
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:15,385
about two million polys.

89
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:21,588
The photos are then projected back onto the mesh

90
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,709
and blended together to create the texture.

91
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,573
The resulting model is not quite suitable

92
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:31,674
for a game just yet.

93
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:33,835
The mesh is too high poly,

94
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,436
there's some noise in the model

95
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,978
and some lighting information that still does remain.

96
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,419
So at this point, the model gets passed off

97
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,320
to our character artists.

98
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,400
They do smoothing, sculpting,

99
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,980
painting out some of the artifacts.

100
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,561
They also split open the mouth, add teeth,

101
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,281
align the eyeballs, and the back of the head.

102
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:54,442
After that cleanup is done,

103
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:55,922
it essentially converges

104
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:57,402
with the traditional character pipeline.

105
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,623
Decimation, retopology, unwrapping,

106
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,383
and projecting onto the low-poly mesh

107
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,323
to generate the textures.

108
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:06,344
And this is that final scan in Unreal 4.

109
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,831
So what makes this process so great for our faces?

110
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,416
Well, these same results can be achieved with a 3D scanner,

111
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:21,100
but classic 3D scanning uses specialized equipment.

112
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,063
Photogrammetry, on the other hand, requires a camera.

113
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:27,626
Not many people have a 3D scanner just lying around,

114
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,668
but chances are you or someone in your studio

115
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,250
has a camera capable of doing this.

116
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:35,288
Photogrammetry is also more versatile than 3D scanner.

117
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,789
It is very difficult to find a 3D scanner

118
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:40,329
in this price point that can scan both a face

119
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,390
and a cliff wall, but photogrammetry can do both with ease.

120
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:47,811
Scanning a face and cleaning up the model

121
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,571
is considerably faster than modeling

122
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:50,511
a new head from scratch.

123
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,552
Our head pipeline went from about one week per head

124
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:54,892
to one day per head.

125
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:59,953
Not only is it faster, but the quality results are better.

126
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:06,077
This is a comparison of our last hand modeled face on the left and our very first scan face on the right.

127
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,981
The models that are sped up by this process are the models that need it most.

128
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:19,724
Organic complex shapes that take a long time to model by hand usually scan really well.

129
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,370
Hard surface models, not as much.

130
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,751
You can get a 3D model of a pile of laundry

131
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,931
in about 20 minutes, but you wouldn't want to scan,

132
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:28,972
say, a bar stool.

133
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:30,872
You'll spend more time cleaning up the model

134
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,513
than you would just modeling it by scratch.

135
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:37,934
This process allows us to exaggerate facial features

136
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,955
much more than we could with hand-modeled faces,

137
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:42,116
which sounds kind of counterintuitive.

138
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:43,196
If you're modeling by hand,

139
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:44,737
you can exaggerate as much as you want.

140
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:47,993
But when you're targeting realistic proportions,

141
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,513
it's often hard to find the line

142
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:51,514
of what is unrealistically exaggerated.

143
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:53,754
And those that may look fine on one face

144
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,735
will be completely ridiculous on another.

145
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,536
You can very quickly cross over the line

146
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:00,596
and go full DreamWorks with exaggerated features.

147
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:02,717
So our artists tend to be conservative,

148
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:05,258
and as a result, our models all start looking the same.

149
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:08,507
But when you use scan models,

150
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:10,909
suddenly you can get these great Adrian Brody noses

151
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:12,650
or Angelina Lips, Leno chins.

152
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,591
It's impossible to cross over the line

153
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:15,952
into unrealistic proportions

154
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:17,654
because your scans are based on reality.

155
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,016
You just have to find subjects with these features.

156
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:23,799
This is one of my favorite scans.

157
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,460
This is Officer Diaz of the Seattle PD.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,902
He came in for one of our most recent scanning sessions

159
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:30,204
and it's a great example of the kind of face

160
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:32,445
we just wouldn't have tried to do with traditional modeling.

161
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:38,119
So next I'd like to talk about the equipment and setup

162
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,621
that I used for Stata Decay 2.

163
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:43,705
There's a wide range of hardware that you can use for this

164
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:46,507
and quality definitely scales with cost.

165
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,712
This is the quality that is achievable

166
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:52,533
with the phone that is in your pocket right now.

167
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,695
No lighting rig, no fancy camera,

168
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,397
I literally pulled Dave into a conference room

169
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,419
and spent 30 seconds scanning him with my iPhone.

170
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:02,787
And then there's the other end of the spectrum.

171
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:05,248
Big budget studios and specialized companies

172
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:07,930
like Pixel Light Effects build an elaborate camera rig

173
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:11,313
with between 30 and 64 cameras that all fire in unison.

174
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,435
These rigs can catch facial expressions

175
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,715
flawlessly in real time.

176
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,659
Companies like Infinite Realities

177
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,160
are pushing the boundaries even further.

178
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,041
They can use metered light bursts

179
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,022
to extract specular and subsurface data

180
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:28,404
to give a full PBR texture set right out of the scan.

181
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:32,122
It's possible to spend several hundreds of thousands

182
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:33,363
of dollars on a rig like this.

183
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:36,085
64 cameras, shutter synchronization,

184
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,686
measured lighting, permanent facilities, it adds up.

185
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,009
Now, Undead Labs is a fairly small studio

186
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:44,810
and we don't have the space or the funding

187
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,051
to dedicate to something like that.

188
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:49,533
So I set out to find the sweet spot between cost and quality.

189
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:54,576
I endeavored to build the cheapest functional rig

190
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:57,017
that I could, and after several iterations,

191
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:57,958
this is what I came up with.

192
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:01,428
six LED light strips attached to some light stands

193
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:04,309
using some clamps, a tripod to give our subject

194
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:07,791
a fixed focal point, and a single handheld camera.

195
00:09:08,812 --> 00:09:11,033
It provides even lighting without sacrificing comfort

196
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:11,594
of the subject.

197
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,735
The setup time takes about 15 minutes,

198
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:16,096
and the entire rig collapses to fit in a duffel bag.

199
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:19,939
And this model of Dave that we've been seeing

200
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,440
a couple times showcases the quality we are able

201
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,901
to achieve using this setup.

202
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,342
There's very little shadowing and mesh noise.

203
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:27,923
It's not a perfect scan,

204
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:30,725
but it gives our character artists a huge jumpstart

205
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:31,886
without breaking the bank.

206
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,309
So what are the advantages of my rig

207
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,671
over a multi-camera professional photogrammetry rig?

208
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:42,893
Why not just go all in and build an expensive rig?

209
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,335
Well, my rig is cheap.

210
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:48,176
The total cost of my setup,

211
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:50,698
including my own personal camera, was just over $2,500.

212
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:53,800
If you filter out the cost of the camera

213
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,161
that I already own, it was about 500 bucks to do this.

214
00:09:58,777 --> 00:09:59,317
It's portable.

215
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:01,919
I can set up and tear down my rig at will.

216
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,361
It takes about 15 minutes to set up and measure.

217
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:07,824
It doesn't require any permanent space in our tiny office.

218
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,687
I can take my rig over to the Microsoft campus.

219
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:13,109
I can bring it home and scan my neighbors.

220
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,430
I can take it anywhere in the world.

221
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:19,494
And the whole thing fits in a duffel bag next to my desk.

222
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:25,699
The equality bar is good enough for what we needed.

223
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:30,084
State of Decay 2 is a third-person action multiplayer game.

224
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,965
We weren't creating any up-close, cinematic

225
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,566
Nathan Drake cutscenes.

226
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:37,907
That kind of micro-detail was overkill for us.

227
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:43,130
This process doesn't always recreate exact lookalikes.

228
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,791
When an area of a scan is particularly noisy,

229
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:48,272
our artists have to do some guesswork in shaping features.

230
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,840
But our characters needed to be believable,

231
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,341
not identifiable.

232
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:54,143
We weren't scanning famous people

233
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:56,564
our audience would be expected to recognize.

234
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:58,846
So even if there's some distortion in the model

235
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:01,868
and scanned Jeff doesn't quite look like real Jeff,

236
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,109
it's still a completely usable scan.

237
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:09,593
Now this particular method is not without its downsides.

238
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:12,956
There's more cleanup time involved.

239
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,858
The cost savings on the rig is not completely free.

240
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:18,808
More artifacts in the model means more cleanup time

241
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:19,689
for character artists.

242
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:23,091
We average about two and a half hours of cleanup time

243
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:24,891
that we wouldn't have to do if we were using

244
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,612
a multi-camera high-end setup.

245
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:31,275
Some scans just don't work.

246
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:33,716
We've got about a 3% failure rate

247
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,657
where the scan is completely unusable

248
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:37,418
and no amount of manipulating the settings

249
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:38,358
can recover the data.

250
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:41,711
This can be caused by a variety of reasons.

251
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:43,732
Maybe the camera focus wasn't on point,

252
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:45,992
perhaps the subject moved too much during the scan,

253
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:47,913
maybe their skin was too oily,

254
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:49,193
or a combination of these things.

255
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,054
We compensated by volume of scans.

256
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:56,075
We intentionally scanned significantly more people

257
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,575
than we needed to account for scans that didn't work

258
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:01,056
and to give us more options on which faces

259
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,436
we wanted to use in the future.

260
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,497
Now there were some cases where the scan had to work.

261
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:10,613
We held a contest for five of our fans to be in the game.

262
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:12,774
And Microsoft held a charity auction

263
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:14,135
where appearing in state of decay

264
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,296
was one of the things up for bid.

265
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,197
Now those scans had to work.

266
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:18,458
Failure was not an option.

267
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:21,300
So when I was doing those important scans,

268
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,861
what I did was I brought in just that one person

269
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:24,762
to scan on that day.

270
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:27,884
I scanned them and then I brought them back to my desk

271
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,506
and sat them down and had them watch me process the scan.

272
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:33,688
It was neat for them to see how the sausage gets made

273
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:36,010
and it kept them on site in case the scan failed.

274
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,214
When you take all of the photos in unison

275
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:43,355
with a multi-camera rig, it takes an instant.

276
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:47,416
But taking 40 plus photos from different angles,

277
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:49,177
one at a time, takes time.

278
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:51,577
Our volunteers have been pretty good

279
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:52,998
at sitting still during these scans,

280
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,139
but no matter how good you are at sitting still,

281
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,199
eyes tend to move and blink.

282
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,580
And so eyes are often problematic in our scans

283
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,081
and usually require a lot of cleanup.

284
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,282
I did have one subject who didn't know

285
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:06,202
he was allowed to blink.

286
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:07,503
He spent.

287
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:10,359
several minutes trying his hardest not to blink,

288
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:13,000
and by the end of the second row of photos,

289
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,880
he had tears streaming down the side of his face.

290
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,661
We had to clean him up and start the whole scan

291
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:17,621
back over from scratch.

292
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:22,802
The comfort of the subject is definitely a concern.

293
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,623
The lights are bright, and sitting in front of them

294
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:29,204
for several minutes can get uncomfortable,

295
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:31,824
and people who are more light sensitive tend to squint,

296
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,725
which gets baked into the look of the character.

297
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:35,885
So my particular setup.

298
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:39,163
is designed to be a compromise between comfort and even lighting.

299
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:43,784
There's a space directly in front of the subject that has no lighting and it's

300
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,965
got a tripod that they stare at, so they're not looking directly into a

301
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:52,787
bulb. When in doubt, I prioritized comfort over even lighting. It's a lot easier to

302
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,608
paint out lighting artifacts than it is to account for a squint.

303
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:01,110
Getting a subject to relax can also be difficult.

304
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:03,338
We needed neutral expressions.

305
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:05,578
And now people instinctively smile

306
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:06,639
when they get their picture taken,

307
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:07,819
especially by a stranger.

308
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,480
And scans with smiles are unusable.

309
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:14,482
These subjects are often strangers in an awkward situation.

310
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:16,002
Sometimes I kind of feel like a dentist

311
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:17,523
having a one-sided conversation

312
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,004
with a captive stranger who isn't allowed to respond.

313
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:23,165
So I find it helps to throw on some music

314
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:24,885
or talk to your subject about what you're doing.

315
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:27,586
Keep them engaged, just make sure you don't make them laugh.

316
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:30,707
I had one group of college kids come in

317
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,648
all at the same time.

318
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,412
and after the first scan, they decided it would be fun to try and make the kid in the chair laugh.

319
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:42,395
And even holding back a laugh, your muscles tense up and it changes the shape of your face. So I

320
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:45,697
ended up having to kick the whole group out of the room and bring them back in one at a time.

321
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:51,600
So if you do catch your subject moving during a scan, wait until they're done and they're ready

322
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,122
to start again. Hold up your camera like you're going to start shooting again, but wait about

323
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:59,944
five to ten seconds for muscles to settle. Because when someone thinks they're relaxed,

324
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:02,401
they are still tensed a little bit

325
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:04,182
and it takes some time for muscles to settle.

326
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,603
We've had tremendous difficulty with scanning facial hair.

327
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:12,004
It's simply a limitation of the process.

328
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:15,165
The camera estimation step evaluates

329
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,105
all the contrast points and averages them

330
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:18,385
to find the camera's location.

331
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:21,386
Short facial hair throws in a large collection

332
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:22,186
of faulty matches.

333
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,387
It may find one hair in one photo,

334
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,887
a different hair in the next photo,

335
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:28,048
and think they are the same hair as a match,

336
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:30,288
which gives us incorrect location data.

337
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,681
On the left we have Dave with four days worth of stubble,

338
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:36,523
and on the right he's clean shaven.

339
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:39,265
You can see there's much more noise in the model

340
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:40,926
without, or with facial hair.

341
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,308
And not just in the beard area, but everywhere,

342
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:44,829
because the camera locations

343
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:46,411
are being incorrectly calculated.

344
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:51,655
Thicker beards often turn into a giant pillow of noise

345
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:52,856
if they even scan at all.

346
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:55,538
Oftentimes they just turn into a hole in the face.

347
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,228
And this limitation on facial hair made it harder for us to find volunteers because

348
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:02,669
beards are in fashion right now.

349
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,372
I did have one subject come in on a Saturday.

350
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:11,655
I was doing a Saturday session and he was my last one for the day and I started getting

351
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:14,237
texts about five minutes before he was supposed to arrive.

352
00:16:14,777 --> 00:16:16,298
I missed my bus but I'm on the next one.

353
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:17,239
I promise I'll be there.

354
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:17,739
Don't leave.

355
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,022
And so I ended up sitting there waiting around for an hour on a Saturday for this guy to

356
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:22,343
show up.

357
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,086
He arrives at our building.

358
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:25,807
I go down to let him through the elevator.

359
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:29,010
The elevator doors open, gigantic lumberjack beard.

360
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,932
And I told him, it says right in the listing,

361
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:33,273
we can't scan that.

362
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,155
He says, okay, hang on, don't leave.

363
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,358
And he goes across the street to a corner shop

364
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:40,219
and buys a can of Barbasol and a razor

365
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:42,941
and comes back and shaves in our bathroom to be in the game.

366
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:48,953
But ultimately this constraint is not a huge issue for us

367
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:50,533
because of the game we were building.

368
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:53,674
We wanted to reuse faces for randomized characters

369
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:55,734
and we could add a beard to a character later

370
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:58,775
a lot easier than we could paint out the beard on a scan

371
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:01,195
because you can't see the underlying facial structure

372
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,036
underneath the beard.

373
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:07,717
So let's take a look at the final results of all of this.

374
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:12,058
We shipped State of Decay 2 with 75 unique faces.

375
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,298
Every single one of them is generated using this method.

376
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,531
And this is some of our heads in context.

377
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:21,793
We swap out different hairstyles and clothing

378
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:25,055
to reuse faces for different random encounters.

379
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:30,720
So now we get to the practical portion of this talk.

380
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:33,542
I'd like to share with you some general advice

381
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,664
to help you get the best possible scans you can.

382
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:40,148
First of all, you always want to shoot in manual.

383
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:43,195
Exposure adjustments from one shot to another

384
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,676
will make it much harder for the software to find matches,

385
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:48,137
and it will cause a lot of problems with texture blending.

386
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:50,078
When you have two different exposures,

387
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:51,659
when they try and blend together,

388
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,200
you're gonna get very patchy, uneven textures.

389
00:17:57,181 --> 00:18:00,182
Shooting in RAW allows for global exposure correction,

390
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,323
and helps avoid compression artifacts.

391
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:08,770
I often get questions about, you know,

392
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,090
is my camera good enough for this?

393
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,831
Is it high enough megapixels, all that kind of stuff.

394
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,552
Don't worry too much about the resolution of the camera.

395
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,113
More pixels is good, but up to a point.

396
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:21,154
The final textures are generated

397
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,234
from a series of photos stitched together.

398
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:24,315
So after a certain point,

399
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:26,435
more pixels is just wasted disk space.

400
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,776
More important than resolution is sharpness.

401
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:32,677
A 12 megapixel photo that is tack sharp

402
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,258
will provide better results

403
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:36,138
than a 40 megapixel photo out of focus.

404
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:39,432
That being said, you never want to sharpen your photos

405
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:40,513
artificially in post.

406
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:44,474
Unless you know exactly what you're doing,

407
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:47,075
you don't want to adjust your images at all in post,

408
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,336
because this has the potential for nullifying point matches

409
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:52,336
and can seriously mess up your scans.

410
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:57,938
Shiny surfaces do not scan well.

411
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:00,539
Specular highlights confuse the software,

412
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,800
because a specular highlight moves across the surface

413
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,900
depending on viewing angle.

414
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:08,826
The software doesn't know the difference between a moving specular highlight and a fixed point,

415
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,989
and so it throws in a large collection of faulty matches.

416
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,834
But skin is shiny, and particularly oily skin does not scan very well.

417
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:21,617
A polarizing filter can help a lot with this.

418
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:26,481
On the left I just took a normal photo of Dave, and on the right I took the same shot

419
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,722
again with a polarizing filter over the lens.

420
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:31,865
You can see the large highlight on the forehead goes away.

421
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:34,670
but it doesn't get all the highlights, but it helps.

422
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,791
Polarizing does, polarizing filter does reduce

423
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:42,452
the amount of light reaching your camera sensor,

424
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:44,853
so you're gonna wanna increase your camera settings

425
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,813
up by a couple stops.

426
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:50,154
You can also use anti-shine powder.

427
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:51,955
We've had tremendous success with this,

428
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:54,415
but it requires your subject to be comfortable

429
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,496
with a stranger putting makeup on their face.

430
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:02,915
State of Decay 2 takes place during the zombie apocalypse,

431
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,356
and having female characters all dolled up in full makeup

432
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:06,837
doesn't really fit the narrative

433
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:07,858
of the world we were building.

434
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:09,999
So we wanted to scan faces without makeup.

435
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,541
But we quickly discovered that not all females

436
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:15,842
are super happy with someone taking 40 photos

437
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:17,083
of their face without any makeup on.

438
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:19,184
So we quickly changed the listing

439
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:21,085
to request natural colored makeup,

440
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:25,068
which helped a lot with reducing skin shine as well.

441
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,269
So on average, our female scans ended up

442
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:29,330
more reliable than our male scans.

443
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,774
Before you start a scan, take a photo of your subject

444
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:36,635
holding up their name.

445
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:40,938
At one point, I could name every single one of the 206 faces

446
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:43,139
that I scanned, but I wasn't the only one

447
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,080
working with these photos.

448
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,722
And we needed a way to identify these faces.

449
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:49,844
Folders can get renamed, tables can get sorted.

450
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:52,185
This identifier photo is a great way

451
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:54,607
to keep things organized that can't get decoupled.

452
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,390
It's also super helpful when you're processing

453
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,971
a full day's worth of photogrammetry.

454
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:02,893
I can dump 30 scans into one folder

455
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:06,594
and use the thumbnail view and look for this name photo

456
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:08,774
as a delimiter for where one session ends

457
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:09,694
and the next one begins.

458
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:13,935
Lastly, there's a lot of debate

459
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:15,276
within the photogrammetry community

460
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:18,616
about whether to rotate the subject or to move the camera.

461
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:19,957
And we've tried both.

462
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:24,738
The first approach is to have the subject sit still

463
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,498
while you move the camera around

464
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:27,978
and take photos from different angles.

465
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:31,464
The subject is able to sit very still

466
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:33,305
and focus on a fixed point.

467
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:37,467
There is, however, potential for blur in the camera.

468
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:40,069
You want to take these photos as quickly as you can

469
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:42,890
and having the camera on a tripod or even a monopod

470
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,392
gets in the way with all of the legs

471
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:46,412
from the lighting equipment.

472
00:21:49,614 --> 00:21:52,375
The other approach is to put the camera on a fixed tripod

473
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:53,496
and rotate the subject.

474
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,238
Put them in a swivel chair and rotate them,

475
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:58,519
sorry, around the camera.

476
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,701
This approach gave much more even lighting.

477
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:05,322
A feature that may be shadowed in one shot

478
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:07,123
can be directly lit in another,

479
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:08,803
and those values average out.

480
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:12,165
But without a single fixed focal point,

481
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:13,825
there's a much higher probability

482
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:15,966
of your subject not quite lining up right.

483
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:19,947
They may look a little higher or lower on each turn.

484
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:23,068
And just the physical act of rotating your subject

485
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,409
causes muscles to tend and shift,

486
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,750
and they put their weight differently.

487
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:30,828
So the best scan we ever got was actually using this method.

488
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,729
But ultimately we decided on moving the camera

489
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:36,249
rather than the subject.

490
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:37,969
I have no idea what that was.

491
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,010
All right.

492
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,530
So the quality ceiling was lower,

493
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,230
but the average was a lot higher.

494
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,011
So there it is.

495
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:49,551
Photogrammetry can be a great tool

496
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:51,992
for boosting your production regardless of your budget.

497
00:22:52,852 --> 00:22:54,372
I hope you've learned something here

498
00:22:54,452 --> 00:22:57,013
that is helpful for you to get your own scans.

499
00:22:58,214 --> 00:22:59,574
I'd like to thank you all for coming.

500
00:22:59,674 --> 00:23:01,755
Looks like we've got some time for questions.

501
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:03,156
I could take some of those now.

502
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:05,137
Otherwise we can meet across the hall

503
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:07,739
in the atrium for further questions.

504
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:16,603
Yes.

505
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:18,184
Thanks for that talk.

506
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:19,105
It's really cool stuff.

507
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:19,985
Thank you.

508
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:23,667
My question is when you were rotating the model,

509
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:29,207
Did you ever use like a headrest or even some sort of brace

510
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:32,029
that you could see only from the back to help eliminate

511
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:32,710
some of the movement?

512
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:35,872
We didn't go too far into that.

513
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,815
We were experimenting with a whole bunch

514
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,336
of different setups all at the same time.

515
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:44,119
Basically, I took one of our swivel office chairs,

516
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,601
I pulled the wheels off, and I fixed it to the floor.

517
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:48,302
So there was some backing on the chair

518
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:49,844
up to about the upper neck.

519
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,085
We haven't tried to like,

520
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,551
get them completely braced into the chair.

521
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:59,553
Comfort is definitely an issue, and having strangers

522
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:02,174
come in and get strapped to a chair is a little awkward.

523
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:06,176
Yeah, because I've seen setups where

524
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:11,058
they have some type of not restrictive movement,

525
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:12,839
but just something that the subject can

526
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:14,800
press their head into and feel.

527
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,921
Yeah, that would definitely help.

528
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:16,581
Right.

529
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:23,812
I have a question about photo scanning, but not particularly faces.

530
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:28,515
So I'm not sure you have experience with that, but I scanned many models last year

531
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:31,998
and I ended up failing with different kind of stuff.

532
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:32,939
For example, a lemon.

533
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,943
It's very tough because even colors and, you know, shiny surface, I know.

534
00:24:38,703 --> 00:24:41,406
I started to use different kind of markers.

535
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:44,768
For example, barcodes visible on the photos.

536
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:51,473
And then even using different kind of markers, red and black markers, on the model itself.

537
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:57,237
And it didn't work at all. So I'm just wondering if you have any experience with that.

538
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:09,806
With really shiny and flat colors using markers, because none of the actual ticks I drew on a lemon were using those barcodes.

539
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:13,996
Yeah, we haven't tried too much with markers.

540
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:18,782
I've used a couple markers when scanning larger outdoor objects, like boulders and stuff.

541
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:22,546
For something the scale of a face, I don't tend to use markers for it.

542
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:27,732
If you're trying to scan something like a lemon that's got a bit of a shine to it,

543
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:28,593
if it's...

544
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,824
Something you don't care about, there's anti-shine spray you can put on things.

545
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:39,549
We've tried scanning shoes that have like reflective, you know, for seeing people in

546
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:40,490
the dark when they go out running.

547
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:46,576
Putting some of the anti-shine spray on those, as long as you don't care about the shoe is

548
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:49,498
fine but if it's something you want to keep, that becomes a bit of a problem.

549
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,721
A polarizing filter would definitely help in a lot of those cases.

550
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:53,822
Spray.

551
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:54,463
That sounds cool.

552
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:54,963
Thank you very much.

553
00:25:57,048 --> 00:25:58,449
I think they're all on that side today.

554
00:25:58,629 --> 00:25:58,849
Hi.

555
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:01,891
So my question is also not regarding facial scans.

556
00:26:01,931 --> 00:26:05,413
So I mean, we've been trying doing photogrammetry

557
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:06,494
for a few objects.

558
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:10,056
So how do you deal with objects which are made with glasses?

559
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:12,977
So is there any way we can scan them and use

560
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:13,618
photogrammetry for that?

561
00:26:14,438 --> 00:26:15,199
Scanning with glasses?

562
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:16,440
I mean, the object, yeah.

563
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,421
So some artifacts which are pretty complex,

564
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:19,682
but made of glasses, yeah.

565
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:26,412
Generally we have them remove glasses and I find it helps to have them remove their glasses for about 10 minutes beforehand.

566
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:29,052
Because like the red marks you get on the bridge of the nose.

567
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:34,733
No, no. So I didn't mean the faces. Objects. So for example a glass artifact.

568
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:39,574
Glass object. Yeah, I wouldn't know of a way to scan that well.

569
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:43,695
Anything transparent is even worse than a shiny surface.

570
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:48,116
The software is not going to be able to pick that up very well.

571
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:55,400
Okay, cool. So I mean, does depth sensing and depth cameras help in that or that also?

572
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,923
Potentially, there might be some hardware out there that can do that kind of stuff.

573
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:01,325
I don't think photogrammetry will ever work very well with that.

574
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:02,706
Cool, thank you.

575
00:27:05,468 --> 00:27:10,712
Hey, so I remember you mentioned earlier not to do any post-processing to the images,

576
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,193
unless you knew what you were doing.

577
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:17,277
Do you do any post-processing or do you just throw the raw photo into Agisoft?

578
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,904
I do minimal post-processing on occasion.

579
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:27,531
There's, sorry, the triangle of how much light you have,

580
00:27:27,551 --> 00:27:30,313
your camera exposure, and like the film ISO

581
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:30,914
and stuff like that.

582
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,938
Trying to get enough exposure on the image

583
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,439
so that you can see what you're looking at.

584
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:41,397
Generally, when you're trying to get enough exposure,

585
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:42,759
you can always just throw more light at it.

586
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,081
But that gets very uncomfortable for people

587
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:47,023
standing under very bright lights for a long time.

588
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:50,506
And so we had to limit how much light

589
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,907
we pour onto our subjects.

590
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:55,691
And so occasionally I had to artificially increase

591
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:58,693
the exposure, but I do it on the exact same settings

592
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:01,236
for all of the photos so that they don't get mismatched.

593
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:03,906
Usually where the disconnect comes from,

594
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:06,269
if you're doing post-processing stuff,

595
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,874
is when one photo ends up diverging from the others,

596
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:13,617
so you never wanna do exposure correction

597
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:15,159
on one photo and not the others.

598
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,981
Okay, cool, thank you.

599
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:19,631
Hi, Matt.

600
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,294
So my question is, what kind of lenses

601
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,655
will be needed for a scan?

602
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:29,379
Because I think if you use a different lens

603
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:33,182
or a special lens, there will be some distortion

604
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:34,823
of the facial features.

605
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:43,510
different lenses don't make a huge amount of difference other than, you know, how sharp your lenses can definitely help.

606
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,631
Whether you're using wide-angle or if you're using a tighter

607
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:50,872
lens, it doesn't matter so much

608
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:54,472
because the software takes into consideration the

609
00:28:55,493 --> 00:29:02,574
focal length of the lens. So if you're getting a lot of distortion from a single image from a wide-angle lens,

610
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:06,235
the software can read in that data. And so no matter

611
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:13,000
which angle you look at it, it reconstructs the actual object that you're scanning.

612
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,322
Okay, sorry, I have another question.

613
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:15,802
Yeah, go ahead.

614
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:19,826
So will some small details like eyelid be scanned well,

615
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:23,789
or you have to manually model that after the scanning?

616
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,930
Eyelashes, you said?

617
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:26,131
Eyelid.

618
00:29:26,151 --> 00:29:26,832
Oh, eyelid.

619
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:29,935
Because of the nature of...

620
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:33,667
scanning someone with a single camera over multiple minutes,

621
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:35,607
people are gonna blink.

622
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:38,408
And so the eyes almost always require cleanup.

623
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:42,549
There's not really much we can do about that

624
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:44,090
with this single camera setup.

625
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,170
If you're doing a multi-camera rig

626
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,150
that all fire in unison,

627
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,831
then you're gonna get that kind of detail

628
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:49,531
out of the eyelids.

629
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:51,392
Okay, okay, thank you.

630
00:29:52,852 --> 00:29:53,612
We have one on this side.

631
00:29:53,632 --> 00:29:56,693
Yeah, did you have any experience with flashes or strobes?

632
00:29:57,573 --> 00:29:57,893
We did.

633
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,213
We found that constant lighting tended to be a little bit better, especially with people

634
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:08,374
not kind of wincing when the flash goes off.

635
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:14,557
And so having slightly dimmer but consistent lighting made people relax more.

636
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:28,391
You mentioned that some of the higher-end rigs can generate textures like glossiness and subsurface and stuff

637
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:33,433
What sort of pipeline steps did you guys do to get those maps?

638
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:37,694
It was just up to the artist discretion or did you have automated tools? Yeah, it was mostly up to the artist

639
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:41,176
They did a lot of painting just to recreate that sort of thing. Gotcha. Okay

640
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:46,538
All right. Thank you everyone. If we've got more questions, we can meet me across the atrium
