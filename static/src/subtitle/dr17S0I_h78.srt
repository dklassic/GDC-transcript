1
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:12,075
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:14,218
Really nice to see so many of you here.

3
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:18,022
This is my first GDC and it's been really great so far.

4
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:23,387
I'm Maxime Fleury, Asset Art Lead for the Machine and Weapons team at Guerrilla.

5
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:29,609
And this is not just my first GDC, Horizon Forbidden West is also the first game I ever worked on.

6
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:35,338
Before starting at Guerrilla, I worked in visual effects as an asset supervisor making assets for movies.

7
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:38,192
This here is my colleague, Leonard Franken,

8
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:39,693
who's a senior artist on the team.

9
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,355
He's been with Guerrilla for over 15 years,

10
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:43,976
where he worked on most of the games

11
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:48,300
in the Killzone franchise, Horizon Zero Dawn,

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,201
and of course, Horizon Forbidden West.

13
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:52,483
To give you the most complete look

14
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:54,124
at the process of making these machines,

15
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:55,785
we'll divide this talk between us.

16
00:00:58,947 --> 00:01:00,909
Let's go to the 18th of February, 2042,

17
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,571
release date of Horizon Forbidden West.

18
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:06,596
Well, it could have been.

19
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:09,798
So today, we'll talk about how we avoided spending

20
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:11,239
over 24 years on this game.

21
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:14,640
And hopefully, this will give you some insight

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,781
into how to schedule and set up your pipeline

23
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:19,082
to create some of your own complicated assets.

24
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:23,264
I'll begin with a quick introduction

25
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:25,765
to Horizon and the machines that populate the world,

26
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,346
followed by a look at what it means

27
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:30,087
to schedule a large amount of assets

28
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:31,788
while finishing somewhere before 2042.

29
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:37,118
Then, Leonard, who worked on both games in the Horizon franchise,

30
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:39,260
will take you on a quick journey back in time

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,342
to explain how the unique look of the machines evolved.

32
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:47,086
He will then go deeper into each step of our workflow

33
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:49,227
and how it evolved for Horizon Forbidden West

34
00:01:49,588 --> 00:01:50,709
so we could meet our deadlines.

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,572
And when we understand the pipeline and the process,

36
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:57,434
I'll go over team management and what

37
00:01:57,454 --> 00:01:59,496
it takes to keep a team happy and productive

38
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:00,556
during a long production.

39
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,837
And last but not least, we'll have a look at how we worked

40
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,079
with Outsource, without whom we couldn't have done this

41
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:06,680
project at all.

42
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:11,245
So how many of you played the game?

43
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:14,649
Ha, that's great.

44
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,653
I hope you enjoyed your encounters with our machines.

45
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,455
We certainly enjoyed building them.

46
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:22,920
For the people that didn't play any of the Horizon games,

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,701
let me tell you briefly what they are about.

48
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:26,703
The game takes place in the future

49
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:28,424
where you take the role of Aloy,

50
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:31,066
who tries to save the world with bow and arrow,

51
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:33,988
while giant robot dinosaurs try to kill her.

52
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:36,890
But these machines are not just there

53
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,231
to make Aloy's life difficult.

54
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,894
In fact, most of them don't really care about her

55
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:44,216
unless she gets too close or disturbs them otherwise.

56
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:51,298
You see, their primary function is to regenerate the planet after cataclysmic events destroyed almost all life on Earth.

57
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:55,260
And to do that, there are different types of machines.

58
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:04,005
You have the acquisition class machines like the fangermers here that gather resources in canisters and travel in herds.

59
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:07,647
They are usually accompanied by recon class machines like the Burarr.

60
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:09,348
Pretty cute, right?

61
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,911
who are constantly on the lookout for danger.

62
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:15,033
If they spot it, they call in larger combat class machines

63
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,235
like the Ravager or even the Fender Jaw

64
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:18,276
to protect the herd.

65
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:20,658
If machines do get destroyed,

66
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:22,219
there are scavenger class machines

67
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:25,021
that strip their parts and resources to be used elsewhere.

68
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:27,043
And armored transport machines

69
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,004
carry these resources across the lands.

70
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:32,707
Towering over all are the majestic toll necks

71
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,548
walking the earth while gathering data

72
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,770
to help the other machines complete their tasks.

73
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,981
Horizon Zero Dawn was well-received,

74
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:43,203
and especially the machines got a lot of praise.

75
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,464
So Matthijs de Jonge, our game director,

76
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:47,885
wanted to make sure that the machines of Forbidden West

77
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,106
would be a worthy addition.

78
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,068
One of his regrets from the first game

79
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,249
was that only two of the 25 machines, the Thunderjaw

80
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,791
and the Stormbird, were the really big robot dinosaurs

81
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:00,192
he had originally envisioned.

82
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,814
So for Forbidden West, he wanted to extend the roster

83
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,215
with more giant machines.

84
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,296
This is something that we as a team, of course,

85
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:08,997
could get behind 100%.

86
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:15,341
And we added the slitherfang, tremortusk, and slaughterspine,

87
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:16,682
among others.

88
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:20,605
To make fighting and hunting them even more interesting,

89
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:22,126
Matthijs also wanted the machines

90
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,108
to have more complexity, for which we gave them

91
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:28,610
more interactive parts, attacks, and different ways

92
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,511
for the machines to move.

93
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:35,891
Aloy was able to override and mount some of the horse-like machines in the first game,

94
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:40,112
but Matthijs wanted her to be able to ride different machine varieties in the Forbidden

95
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:40,393
West.

96
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:46,415
So we added machines like the Claustrider and the Bristleback to add variation to the

97
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:48,155
way Aloy travels throughout the world.

98
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:53,518
And where before only one person, the only person who could do these overrides was Aloy,

99
00:04:54,743 --> 00:05:00,826
This time Matthijs wanted to give certain Yumi enemies the ability to override some machines as well and use these against her.

100
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:08,389
For this, we painted machines with the Graalai clan colors and the Tremortusk even got spikes and a turret with arches on top.

101
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,732
And last but not least, most machines got an Apex or elemental variation in the game.

102
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:20,054
The Apex machines are faster, have more health and are a real pain in the butt.

103
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:23,396
To second-guess the player, they got a different color scheme.

104
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:27,283
And the elemental variations carry different canisters

105
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:30,145
or fluids to allow the player to hunt for resources.

106
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,090
To see how we made all of these, let's first

107
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,952
have a look at Gorilla's machine pipeline.

108
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,194
It is divided into the following phases.

109
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:45,656
First, the low-level phase, where

110
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:48,278
game design writes a design document describing

111
00:05:48,318 --> 00:05:51,761
a machine's role, functions, and its attacks

112
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:52,701
in quite a bit of detail.

113
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,018
When that document gets approved by the game director,

114
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:59,459
our team creates a 3D concept model in the static phase.

115
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,560
There are regular stand-up meetings

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,140
with the leads of all teams involved,

117
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,581
and the concept model is discussed

118
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,542
to make sure it works for everybody.

119
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,702
And changes are made until it does,

120
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:14,344
which is when the model gets rigged and animation can

121
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:15,904
start during the dynamic phase.

122
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:18,705
Now, while the other teams pick up the concept model,

123
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:21,406
the asset team works on a fully detailed machine model.

124
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:25,575
Next, animation starts going back and forth

125
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:28,096
with core technical and artificial intelligence

126
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:31,117
in the interactive phase to make the now animated machine work

127
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:31,477
in game.

128
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:34,939
And as soon as the detailed machine model

129
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,080
gets approved by art direction and game design,

130
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,121
we'll update the model in game with a better representation

131
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:43,242
while outsource works on the final game mesh.

132
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:46,664
When the final model is textured and integrated,

133
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,565
visual effects and sound effects can add their magic

134
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,666
while game design balances the gameplay

135
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,046
with artificial intelligence.

136
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,501
Now that we've seen where the asset team fits in

137
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:00,482
in the overall pipeline, let's take a closer look

138
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:02,024
at the steps in our workflow.

139
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,847
As I just explained, we start with a 3D concept model

140
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:08,429
where we figure out the general shape and size of a machine.

141
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,232
For this, we have dedicated 3D concept artists on the team.

142
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,375
The concept model then gets detailed

143
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,857
into something that could work around

144
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:17,837
in the world of Verizon,

145
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:20,920
which then gets picked up by our outsourcing partners

146
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,222
who clean up our work and create the final game mesh.

147
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,583
which we then texture before finally integrating

148
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:28,704
the finished asset in-game.

149
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,226
In between each of these phases, there

150
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:35,349
is a short review stage where we deliver an updated model

151
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,412
with work-in-progress textures to the other teams.

152
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:43,074
This allows them to see if the asset still works for them

153
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:46,557
or if changes are needed before we proceed to the next stage.

154
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:52,288
That whole process takes about a year for one machine asset,

155
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,750
from concept to fully finished textured asset in game.

156
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,792
We started in 2018, 24 machines, one year per machine.

157
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:04,194
That means we wouldn't be done till, well, you know, 2042.

158
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,816
Management obviously had another release date in mind.

159
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:11,137
So how would we fit these 24 years

160
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:13,258
into a more realistic four-year plan?

161
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,436
We have multiple artists on the team,

162
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,557
allowing us to work on more machines at the same time,

163
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,518
reducing the overall production time

164
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,258
to a more manageable timeframe.

165
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,719
Outsource has the most work,

166
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,560
but this could be assigned to multiple outsource vendors,

167
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,081
reducing the problem by having more companies work on it.

168
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:32,922
By dividing the work between in-house and outsource,

169
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:36,383
you can greatly increase the team size

170
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:37,883
and add scalability to the process.

171
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:45,753
But to fully utilize the potential of our outsourcing vendors, it is important we send them the work they can help us with the most.

172
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:58,389
You see, some of the tasks in our workflow, like making a concept and detail model and doing the final texture pass, are highly subjective and require a lot of input from our direction and the other teams.

173
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:04,470
Having outsourced do these tasks would lead to a lot of feedback rounds caused by the subjective nature of the material,

174
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,053
and doing these tasks in-house means it can be done with short turnaround times, speeding up the process.

175
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:17,798
Other tasks, like the creation of the game mesh, the UVs, the LOD meshes and the baking of the mesh maps,

176
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:24,341
are objective tasks, which are very suitable to be divided upon multiple artists with less feedback needed.

177
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:29,861
This makes these objective tasks perfect for our outsource vendors to help us with.

178
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:34,588
Leonard will now take you deeper into the process of how we created these machines.

179
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:50,394
Thanks. As Maxim just explained, I've been with the company for more than 15 years now.

180
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:56,596
And after Killzone Shadowfall, I joined a team that now will be called the Machine and Weapon

181
00:09:56,616 --> 00:10:02,539
Team. Now, when you look at the machines of Horizon, they look organic and fit the world

182
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:08,661
they live in. But it took a long time of exploration to get there. And that exploration

183
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:11,222
is what I will show in the Look the Filament part.

184
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,231
You see, when we started on the new ERP Horizon,

185
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:18,893
we got presented this concept image

186
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,595
that had all of the key pillars there from the start.

187
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:25,317
It had the nature, tribes, alloy,

188
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:26,878
and of course the machines.

189
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,320
But what these machines would look like

190
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,621
wasn't really defined at this moment.

191
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:34,123
So how did we get there?

192
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:38,399
Well, when the company moved to the new project, before that,

193
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,461
we worked for a very long time on Kailh's own, which

194
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,182
had a totally different style.

195
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:46,804
It was more like a dark and gritty first person shooter.

196
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:51,226
So when designing the first concepts of the machines,

197
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:53,268
they were very tank-like and man-made,

198
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:55,709
a lot like what we're used to on Kailh's own.

199
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,694
We wanted to steer away from this look and started to look into biomechanic design,

200
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:05,838
where examples from nature get used in designs.

201
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:13,124
For example, here on the Japanese bullet train, it got its shape of the beak of a kingfisher.

202
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:17,188
This solved their problem of when the train was going with high-speed through tunnels,

203
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:21,572
of not exploding, which is kind of nice when you ride a train.

204
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:29,661
With the studio visit from Martijn Wisse, a professor in biorobotics from the Technical University Delft,

205
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:34,689
he showed us some advanced robotic designs that used artificial muscles

206
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,975
and 3D printed frames that had taken inspiration from nature.

207
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:44,807
So when we started to flesh out the machines, they needed to be more organic.

208
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:49,152
And we started this by setting some rules.

209
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:57,682
First, we started with a list that what we didn't want, for instance, no pistons, screws,

210
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:01,886
hard edges, or actually anything man-made.

211
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:07,127
With this list and the given information,

212
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:08,488
we got back to the drawing board

213
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:11,389
and did a lot of exploration in 2D and 3D.

214
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,650
We really tried to get away from the style

215
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,950
that we were used to on Kailh's own.

216
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:18,871
And in some cases, this turned out better than others,

217
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,612
but I think we got there.

218
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:27,420
With that exploration that we have been doing, we also looked at the machine's colors.

219
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:32,946
They mainly were a lighting color as they support the story of them being 3D printed

220
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:37,151
and not hand-painted afterwards that would make it more human-made again.

221
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:43,624
But to support the designs of the machines, the interactive components had to stand out.

222
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:50,808
And game design wanted us to have the interactive components, for instance, the plating, antennas,

223
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:57,291
weapons a lighter color, and the base body more consisted more out of dark materials

224
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,032
to draw it a bit more to the background.

225
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:03,874
So it would clearly read as separate components and shootable.

226
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,496
We started to apply these rules to the machines.

227
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:10,071
And now that we were happy with the concept,

228
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:13,854
we took everything we learned and made a list of elements

229
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,096
of the, yeah, that we did want on these machines.

230
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:21,240
And they should have run on biofuel,

231
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,765
have 3D printed frames, muscles, and plates on top.

232
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:30,747
With all of these features,

233
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:33,389
we got a more organic looking Horizon machine.

234
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:37,992
But working on the first machine from the 3D concept,

235
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:42,678
we started to notice that it did not really have that organic feel we were looking for.

236
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:47,123
As the model got made with the hard surface polymodeling technique

237
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:51,208
that we previously used on Killzone.

238
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:57,285
As this obviously worked for us before, we continued working this way, but this time

239
00:13:57,325 --> 00:14:05,012
around we wanted a more organic looking machine instead of the more chunky machines that we had

240
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:09,717
on Killzone. So it was clear for us that we needed to head in a different direction with

241
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:14,901
a workflow that would be less destructive and give us more freedom, as iterations with this

242
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:18,265
workflow caused a lot of rework and it wasn't flexible at all.

243
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:28,240
Well, exactly at that point, our art director Walton said,

244
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,581
this, this is what I want.

245
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:33,503
And he showed us this image by Mike Nash,

246
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:38,066
an artist who had this amazing organic mechanical sculpting

247
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:38,347
style.

248
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:41,188
And it would perfectly fit our machines.

249
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,331
He was available for freelance work

250
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,253
and helped us defining the machine style of Horizon.

251
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:51,295
And on the left, you can see the models

252
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:53,337
that we've created in Guerrilla before the detailing.

253
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:59,014
And we sent this to him and on the right, you can see the same modeling with all of the detail added.

254
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:05,419
This really was that push that our 3D translation needed and this in the end set the machine look.

255
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:13,406
Now that you know a bit more about the history of the machine look, I can show the process of making one of them.

256
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:18,351
And I will do this by example of the tremor task that's now on screen.

257
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:24,418
and by showing the differences between the Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West pipeline.

258
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:35,722
At the start of the process is game design as Maxim showed before on his production overview.

259
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,857
A document gets made there where the Yenno was specified,

260
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:43,277
and it has some reference images of it,

261
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:47,479
and also what components, weapons, canisters,

262
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,099
and other interactive parts it needs.

263
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,600
The attacks get explained, and all of its specifications,

264
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,481
and it's all together with some stunning game designer art.

265
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:02,843
Now that there's a design document,

266
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:05,163
we have a starting point for the machine and weapon team.

267
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:11,278
a concept artist of our team, starts to work on the machine

268
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:14,621
as it's now moving into the concepting phase.

269
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:19,065
Creating a concept in other companies, but also ours,

270
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,607
usually starts with a 2D design,

271
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,009
but because of the complexity of these machines,

272
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,590
we directly start in 3D.

273
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:29,213
Version gets kitbashed from previous made parts,

274
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:30,634
setting the outline of the machine,

275
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:33,777
keeping in mind the movements and skeleton

276
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:35,118
of the animal it's representing.

277
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:42,451
This way of working turned out to be really quick and even faster than when just creating simple volume shapes.

278
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,973
As the concept was getting made, we had regular stand-up meetings.

279
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:53,815
This stood together with the game designers, animators and tech animators.

280
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:57,916
And in these stand-ups, we would check if everything was on track,

281
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:03,418
in terms of sizes and components for game design and movement for animation.

282
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:06,907
And when everybody was happy with the final machine's

283
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:09,029
concept, there would be a sign off,

284
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,351
and a first model gets generated from the concept

285
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:13,191
to put in game.

286
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:19,275
TAC animation can now build a rig for the animators.

287
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,317
And we could continue with our next phase, the high resolution

288
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:24,077
detail model.

289
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,300
On the first game, the machine's look

290
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,661
was set by a freelance artist.

291
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:31,822
And so a few were made by him.

292
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:35,487
But the rest of the machines got detailed in-house by our team.

293
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:39,529
And this is where we made the switch to work with ZBrush.

294
00:17:40,249 --> 00:17:41,929
That was a lot more organic to work with,

295
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,790
and it gave us a lot more freedom.

296
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,111
And to create a consistent look across the machines,

297
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:50,972
we created a library of parts to detail them.

298
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:58,879
Now that we had the look down, we continued this way of working for Horizon Forbidden West.

299
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:02,800
From the rough concept mesh we started with the subjective detailing work,

300
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:06,662
and I will show this process on the upper leg of the Tremor Tusk.

301
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:13,104
Step by step we add parts like the muscle and joint to block some volume,

302
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,466
creating a basic frame connecting the joint.

303
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,452
making the frame more organic by avoiding 90 degree hard angles

304
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:26,893
and make lots of connections throughout

305
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:34,415
adding layers on top of that extruding volume to get that 3D printed frame feel inspired by nature

306
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,777
that we also have seen before with the visit from Professor Wissen

307
00:18:40,397 --> 00:18:44,338
and to balance all of that detail we mask some parts of the muscle with a cover

308
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,901
This then of course needs some details,

309
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:49,942
some pinch folds displaying the cloth tension

310
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:53,183
and some buttons that seem, make it seem attached to it.

311
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:57,425
And all of this is creating a real and detailed model

312
00:18:57,465 --> 00:18:58,925
that supports the Horizon language.

313
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:03,527
Together with the plates, weapons and canisters,

314
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:07,148
this is helping us to set that iconic machine look

315
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:07,728
for Horizon.

316
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,210
As artists of course,

317
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,871
we love this process of fleshing out a machine.

318
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,446
But unfortunately, in the end, we still have a schedule to keep.

319
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:23,748
So to speed up this process, we use a selection of older machine parts,

320
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:26,469
which then get re-sculpted, preserving some detail,

321
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:28,749
and adding new ones in the process.

322
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,811
And as you can see here, we use the eyes of a Ravager,

323
00:19:35,912 --> 00:19:38,653
and the gun belt of the Thunderjaw,

324
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:43,575
and the leg of the Tallneck.

325
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:56,306
As we completed the detailing, we have another round of checks on the newly generated game model.

326
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:02,988
And so animation can now have another check if movement still works with all of the detail added.

327
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:10,490
When the detailed model is signed off, the art director makes a color block out.

328
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:15,932
This gets projected on the game model, so we now have the latest version in game with the color material.

329
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:24,646
Now animation can continue their work and AI and Cortex can start their process.

330
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:28,448
As the model we've made, it's making its move to outsource.

331
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,431
On the first game, we did try and outsource the subjective part of detailing

332
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:38,973
one of these machines, as this is custom in other asset pipelines.

333
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:43,796
Outsource vendors have lots of artists and can divide the work among them.

334
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:46,897
As they say, many hands make light work.

335
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:51,263
But what we started to notice with these complex machines

336
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:53,284
is that it's very subjective work.

337
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:57,267
It was taking a long time going back and forth with feedback

338
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:00,049
and lots of artists working on one machine

339
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:01,951
created inconsistencies across.

340
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:06,474
So many hands don't always make light work.

341
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,258
Doing the detail pass in-house turned out to be a lot faster

342
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:15,000
and working with a maximum of two artists on a machine

343
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,241
also removed the inconsistency.

344
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,621
In the process, we now take our model up to about 80%

345
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:30,444
of completion, doing most of that subjective work in-house,

346
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,326
leaving our outsource partners to do the last 20%

347
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:37,988
of objective work of straightening the surfaces,

348
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:39,489
edges, and details.

349
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,851
The work they do is very labor intensive.

350
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:46,193
So if we needed to do that extra work, the extra 20%,

351
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:50,416
it would cost us to, I think, twice the amount of time

352
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,336
in the detailing phase.

353
00:21:55,062 --> 00:22:01,005
Other geptic tasks that get covered by outsource are the game meshes that get made from the

354
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:01,846
high poly detail.

355
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,487
And this includes the first three lots.

356
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:13,091
UVs get laid out and big maps get generated like the normal occlusion position and curvature.

357
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:18,634
But I think this is pretty common in most asset pipelines, so I won't really go further

358
00:22:18,674 --> 00:22:19,334
into detail here.

359
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:24,040
But what is different on the Forbidden West pipeline,

360
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,160
we wanted to see what Outsource could do

361
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,501
on the texturing side for us.

362
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,041
As example, we took the detailing process

363
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,522
where the last 20% of objective work

364
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:33,482
gets done by Outsource.

365
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:36,423
And we now wanted Outsource to do the first 20%

366
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:38,003
of the texturing for us.

367
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:41,464
And like the art director created a color blockout,

368
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:46,865
he now also created a blockout for the ID clown mask.

369
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,002
This mask gets used for setting the materials in the texturing process.

370
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:57,966
Like for instance with the green, the muscle is set in that process.

371
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:03,889
By creation of this ID-Print, the artist can now objectively follow this and we can then

372
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:08,131
later take that map to add more details as that's a more subjective process.

373
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,208
Then they also provide us with a muscle mask,

374
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:16,129
which is an outline drawn of the muscle strands

375
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,370
that we can use as an input to create a muscle glow

376
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,771
mask in our texturing process.

377
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:24,892
When all of the outsource work's done,

378
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,733
we get a nice package delivery.

379
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:30,774
We can check this on all requirements,

380
00:23:30,814 --> 00:23:34,035
but we still hold off to integration to the game,

381
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:36,376
as the model is still a gray mesh,

382
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:38,756
and the last steps of texturing are done in-house.

383
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:45,656
On the first game, we started with texturing the machines.

384
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:49,799
We originally started doing this by hand-painted textures

385
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,479
in Photoshop.

386
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,061
Again, this was coming from our Killzone legacy.

387
00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:57,383
Working this way, the albedo, reflectance, and roughness

388
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:58,684
need to be made separately.

389
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:01,706
And there was no way of directly previewing the textures,

390
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:04,468
meaning an export to game was required every time

391
00:24:04,488 --> 00:24:05,468
you wanted to do so.

392
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:08,610
All of the machines seen in the 2015 E3 demo

393
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,391
were still made this way.

394
00:24:12,027 --> 00:24:13,828
There were only three machines in this trailer,

395
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:17,329
and it cost us months of work, or like a month.

396
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:18,990
No, months, months.

397
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:20,951
Sorry.

398
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:23,852
So how did we improve this?

399
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:26,713
After that 8.3 demo, we went into production

400
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:29,394
for the first game, and made the switch

401
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:30,774
to a 3D painter software.

402
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:33,415
In our case, we used Substance Painter here,

403
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,236
as they still had a familiar layer approach,

404
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:39,258
like Photoshop, but meaning we still had

405
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:41,418
to develop this workflow during production.

406
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:46,268
We ended up with just one simple template in the end,

407
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:48,530
texturing all of the machines.

408
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:55,276
And the base materials got set in this template.

409
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:58,159
But when starting to use this template,

410
00:24:58,259 --> 00:24:59,821
a separate Word file gets created.

411
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:02,043
This Word file then gets separated

412
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,206
from that material template, as it had no referencing.

413
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:11,961
So when creating loads of work files for all of the different machines, this meant a lot

414
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:13,442
of base materials got created.

415
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:18,747
And at the end of the project, when we made a change in values of a material, this meant

416
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:23,971
we had to go over all of the machine texture files, making these changes by hand, creating

417
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:26,173
room for human error and inconsistency.

418
00:25:26,913 --> 00:25:33,158
On top of that, it took us like a month of changing and re-exporting all of the files.

419
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:37,876
This was not the only flaw this workflow had.

420
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:41,076
It had basic inputs set in one place,

421
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:44,217
and the color input at the bottom of the layer stack.

422
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:48,337
And multiple third-party generated wear masks

423
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:49,638
inside of the layer stack,

424
00:25:49,718 --> 00:25:52,598
meaning this workflow had inputs coming from everywhere,

425
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:56,099
making it very unclear and confusing to work with.

426
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,819
When you needed to update one of these maps,

427
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:00,299
you had to reconnect it by hand,

428
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,700
meaning searching through all of the layer stacks

429
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,980
for your input.

430
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:11,085
And this, with not even all mechs being created by the output,

431
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:16,270
you still had to create a mask for the styling detail textures

432
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:18,153
and the glow of the muscle by hand.

433
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:22,878
However, we could now directly paint on the model

434
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,840
and preview the textures in our viewport.

435
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:27,583
This all with the correct shading model of the game

436
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:29,665
was a really big step forward.

437
00:26:30,787 --> 00:26:34,571
But it wasn't perfect as there were still some features missing

438
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,814
in the viewport like the displaying of the muscle glow

439
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:40,456
and the tiling detail textures.

440
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:50,166
All in all, this workflow helped us ship Horizon Zero Dawn,

441
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:51,707
but it was far from ideal.

442
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:54,590
At the end, we needed some extra freelancers

443
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,791
to help finish this project.

444
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:59,500
So for Horizon Forbidden West, it was clear to us

445
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,822
a change needed to be made in the process.

446
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,484
But what was this change going to be?

447
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:08,908
Well, we started to look into procedural texturing

448
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:10,269
with a node-based approach.

449
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,212
In our instance, we moved to Substance Designer

450
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:15,875
and one of our more technical artists

451
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,016
on the machine and weapon team

452
00:27:17,096 --> 00:27:18,537
started to develop this process

453
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:21,360
on the principles of the previous workflow.

454
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:28,014
This process starts with plugging in the delivered maps from outsource.

455
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,495
This is all in one place now.

456
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:35,859
And the materials are set in a node that is referenced, so all adjustments automatically

457
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:39,201
get rolled out, only an export is needed.

458
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,943
So changes can be easily made throughout the whole process.

459
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:50,447
The texture artist can then start with the subjective detailing of the ID mask and create

460
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:53,609
a color map from the ID that's needed for the material colors.

461
00:27:54,521 --> 00:27:58,465
With this, the materials are now set and we can preview them.

462
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:01,568
But at this moment, it still looks very still,

463
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:04,190
like a car that just rolled from the factory line.

464
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:07,073
And these machines have been roaming the nature

465
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:08,554
and encountered enemies.

466
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:11,957
So they would need some dirt and scratches to show that.

467
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,702
This wear and muscle now get generated

468
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,283
by nodes within the software.

469
00:28:21,955 --> 00:28:26,759
You can set the generators and their presets can be saved to be later used on other machines

470
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,921
while keeping the freedom of adjusting it all.

471
00:28:30,682 --> 00:28:32,904
And remember that muscle mask created by ArtSource?

472
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:38,709
Here in a muscle node a muscle glow mask gets generated from that, where you can set the

473
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:44,493
soft shape of the muscle islands and the variation of brightness of the muscle strands, all creating

474
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:47,115
the final muscle map for a glow in game.

475
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:55,858
Just another layer of decals come on top, and all of the maps get generated by the output.

476
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:57,959
So no more hand painting afterwards.

477
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:11,467
The viewport now displays all of its features, including the tile and detail textures, and

478
00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:14,689
muscle glow, so the final result is really close to in-game.

479
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:22,761
But during production, we also needed to make some texture variants.

480
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:25,663
The Regala and Apex.

481
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:31,027
With this new flexible workflow, this was all just possible.

482
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:34,429
We could now add this to our existing network

483
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:36,911
with just the addition of two simple masks.

484
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:40,313
With our old workflow, this would have meant starting all over again

485
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:42,855
with a new template and all of its work files.

486
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:47,843
Adding customization, however, did require a bit more

487
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:51,104
technical knowledge now, as this required a

488
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,005
node-based solution.

489
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:55,866
Like, for example, the heat sinks on the rollerback got

490
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:59,687
some heat discoloring, and a custom copper material on the

491
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:01,268
big snake-like slender thing.

492
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:07,750
And this all can be added with any custom nodes that the

493
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,751
artist wants to use.

494
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:11,092
So you've got a lot of freedom there.

495
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,864
In the end, texturing on Horizon Forbidden West felt like a breeze compared to Horizon Zero Dawn,

496
00:30:19,844 --> 00:30:24,328
as everything was finished on time without the help of some additional freelance artist.

497
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:27,410
And so, what did we learn from this?

498
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:31,934
Well, at the start of creating this process, we had to worry it might feel generic,

499
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:36,417
as the textures would be generated, but with the artist input and customizations,

500
00:30:36,677 --> 00:30:39,019
it actually didn't feel generic at all.

501
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:45,180
We had created a balanced and standardized look across these machines with the procedural process.

502
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,982
And now that the final textures are done with all of its variants,

503
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:54,483
Maximo will take over again and show some more on the production side.

504
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:14,725
Thanks, Leonard.

505
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:17,866
And don't those Tremor tusks look awesome?

506
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:21,607
Making these machines was fun, and taking a model

507
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:24,068
from design documents to final textured model

508
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:26,269
and to see it animated in-game is amazing.

509
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:29,910
Less sexy, but also important, was team structure

510
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,470
and management.

511
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,691
As these are long projects, it's important to keep everybody

512
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:35,652
productive and morale high.

513
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,693
Team composition had been different on the first game,

514
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,174
so let's first have a look at what we had before

515
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:41,894
and what worked.

516
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,661
Back then, the team consisted of an art director who also took on the role of lead artist.

517
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:57,024
We had 3D concept artists do a first pass, and for quick turnaround, asset artists pick

518
00:31:57,064 --> 00:32:01,466
up the concept, do the detailing and texturing, wanted to get back from Outsource, and to

519
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:05,787
manage this, there was an Outsource manager to review the work from Outsource, give feedback,

520
00:32:06,568 --> 00:32:10,609
and integrate the work back into the pipeline when it was done.

521
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:17,640
As Leonard explained, texturing old machines using the old pipeline was more work than expected.

522
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:22,326
So freelance asset artists were hired to help with texture work at the end.

523
00:32:23,547 --> 00:32:27,131
And with everybody busy on the machines, there was nobody to model the weapons.

524
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:29,775
So we hired freelancers to help with that as well.

525
00:32:32,877 --> 00:32:35,199
Having one outsource manager seemed like a good idea.

526
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,000
He could talk to all the vendors,

527
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,881
make sure the work was consistent,

528
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:41,562
but he was also tasked with reviewing the work

529
00:32:41,702 --> 00:32:44,724
that came back from outsource and send feedback where needed.

530
00:32:45,024 --> 00:32:47,366
But as the amount of machines in outsource grew,

531
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:49,867
this caused an enormous bottleneck in the workflow

532
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,868
with everything having to go through one person.

533
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:54,150
We obviously made the deadline,

534
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,891
but we could have saved time with outsource,

535
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:58,512
sometimes having to wait on feedback

536
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:00,093
and not everything getting ingested

537
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,294
back in the system straight away.

538
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:05,663
We needed a different solution for this.

539
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:07,483
And at the end of this project,

540
00:33:07,503 --> 00:33:09,303
the freelancers fulfilled their contract,

541
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:11,304
leaving a very small team in place.

542
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:16,045
So now that the project was finished

543
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:18,946
and Forbidden West in early stages of development,

544
00:33:19,426 --> 00:33:20,706
management wanted to expand

545
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:22,787
in our very small machine and weapons team.

546
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:25,668
With the first game's success,

547
00:33:26,108 --> 00:33:28,068
plenty of people wanted to work at Guerrilla,

548
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:29,749
but it still wasn't an easy job

549
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:31,329
to find the right people for the team though.

550
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:36,467
And it took almost three years and looking at hundreds of portfolios for them to find the right artists.

551
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:41,648
With halfway through the second year of production, we had a full team.

552
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:48,351
It had some Horizon veterans for seniority and experience mixed with fresh talents to bring new ideas.

553
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:57,534
Now, the team consisted of three concept artists, five modelers, with two of them Horizon Zero Dawn veterans and two web and artists.

554
00:33:57,594 --> 00:33:59,014
So no freelancers would be needed.

555
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:04,984
With me joining them as lead artist, the art director was happy he didn't have to do double duty anymore

556
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:09,866
as a lead artist, clearing the way for him to go to get back to full-time art direction.

557
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:15,729
He got me up to speed, handing over the lead role, and this helped me a lot in my first year at Guerrilla.

558
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:24,853
We didn't have an outsource manager anymore, but now the artists themselves did review and feedback on their own work,

559
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:26,293
so there wasn't any bottleneck.

560
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:34,646
Where before, there could be a separate artist doing the concept model, detail model, outsource review and texturing.

561
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:41,288
Now, one artist does the detail model, sees it for outsource, and then picks it back up for texturing when it comes back.

562
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:46,189
They know their model, and as a result, do faster reviews and give more efficient feedback.

563
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:51,971
Having the opportunity to text your own model, at the end, creates ownership and achievement for that artist.

564
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:55,924
Dividing up the work also made it varied for everybody.

565
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:58,185
And nobody got stuck for just doing one thing

566
00:34:58,245 --> 00:34:59,166
for the entire project.

567
00:35:01,627 --> 00:35:02,828
Having the art director on the team

568
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:05,089
to take care of the more visual tasks

569
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:07,430
gave me more time to manage the team as a lead artist.

570
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,092
But lead artist is a bit of a misleading term.

571
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:15,054
You see, a lead artist is more of a supporting managing

572
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:15,394
artist.

573
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:17,795
They have to be all around so they

574
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,536
can help at each stage of the workflow

575
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:20,736
and offer support where needed.

576
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:24,378
An effective lead knows the artist and the team,

577
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:26,879
what they are good at, what they enjoy working on,

578
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,900
which might be different than what they're good at,

579
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,901
and what they want in their career.

580
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:34,862
A good lead artist means finding a balance

581
00:35:34,922 --> 00:35:37,063
between being a manager, a producer,

582
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:41,284
an HR assistant, a recruiter, and finally, a generalist.

583
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:44,385
And yes, I won't lie, part of the job

584
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:46,606
is looking at lots and lots of spreadsheets.

585
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:53,980
To know what goes on in a team, it's good to have regular one-on-ones with the artist and the art director.

586
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,225
There, they can talk about any problems they might have, where their passions lie, and everything else, really.

587
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:08,192
This allows the work to be scheduled so people mostly get to do what they love and excel at, making them more productive.

588
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:12,143
It's still work, so sometimes artists end up with a less fun task.

589
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,684
There is just no avoiding that.

590
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:18,288
But knowing what people aspire to allows the work to be divided in a more meaningful way

591
00:36:18,648 --> 00:36:20,749
and gives artists opportunity to grow.

592
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:26,313
One of the artists, for instance, enjoyed the sculpting of the machines, but also wanted

593
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,614
to develop the texture pipeline.

594
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:32,238
And there were people who got pushed in a more technical role where they really just

595
00:36:32,298 --> 00:36:33,118
wanted to be creative.

596
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,942
For others, it was their first job and they just needed some more guidance in that department.

597
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:41,068
Investing time and energy in the artist on the team

598
00:36:41,328 --> 00:36:43,509
made them more productive and happier as a result.

599
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,190
But that was only part of the team,

600
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,152
as the artists at our outsource vendors do a lot of work

601
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:52,372
and add scalability to the amount of work we can do.

602
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:55,234
We couldn't have made the same number of machines

603
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:57,294
without them, and they need managing as well.

604
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:00,816
We started the project with one outsource vendor,

605
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:02,336
but as the project progressed,

606
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:04,277
we added two more vendors to help us out.

607
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:13,614
As I said, this added scalability to the amount of work that could be done by assigning them the objective part of the process the vendors could split the work among many artists.

608
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:22,601
We had teams working with us of up to 12 people per vendor, with a total of 35 people involved with machines at the height of production.

609
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:29,526
None of this would have been possible without producers managing the teams at the vendor side.

610
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,972
They act as gatekeepers, gathering information

611
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:35,173
and making sure everything gets translated

612
00:37:35,193 --> 00:37:36,614
and conveyed to their team properly,

613
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:39,817
while also checking there are no problems

614
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:41,158
and their teams are happy.

615
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,761
The lead artist acts as the main point of access on our site,

616
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:47,762
taking the role of outsource manager

617
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:50,845
by making sure feedback is given on time by the artist,

618
00:37:51,465 --> 00:37:53,166
keeping an eye on the amount of feedback rounds

619
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:55,868
and answering any questions the outsource vendor might have.

620
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:01,926
Now, this is a lot of people to manage and keep busy,

621
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:03,947
and they are on other continents,

622
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:05,048
in different time zones,

623
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:07,669
and sometimes communication goes through a translator.

624
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:09,690
To help with this,

625
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,552
the team created an extensive 150 page long

626
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:13,392
outsource document,

627
00:38:13,452 --> 00:38:14,512
going through the workflow,

628
00:38:14,653 --> 00:38:15,853
pointing out potential problems,

629
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:18,294
and giving examples of solutions.

630
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:21,936
And every new vendor went through a training period

631
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:23,197
before they started production.

632
00:38:24,063 --> 00:38:26,005
The document explains, for example,

633
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:28,267
how to finish the last 20% of the detail model,

634
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:31,610
as Leonard talked about, create game meshes

635
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:34,553
to our specifications, set up LODs,

636
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,456
how to make specific maps, set up

637
00:38:37,476 --> 00:38:41,200
the first 20% of the texture paths by doing the ID maps,

638
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:45,224
and even how to do the first skinning pass based on inputs

639
00:38:45,244 --> 00:38:46,265
from our tech animation team.

640
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:54,163
Normally, we would also visit their studios, give on-site training, answer any questions

641
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:58,364
they might have in person, and really get to know the team to help build a relationship.

642
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:03,285
Unfortunately that wasn't possible on this project as the world shut down.

643
00:39:04,546 --> 00:39:09,627
Gorilla went from everybody in office to work from home within a week, and the same went

644
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:10,548
for our outsource vendors.

645
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:14,123
But apart from not being able to visit the studios,

646
00:39:14,183 --> 00:39:16,366
the outsource workflow didn't fundamentally change.

647
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:18,669
It just became the world's way of working for a while,

648
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:20,152
as we all know.

649
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:22,776
It sounds obvious,

650
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:24,919
but what turned out to be really important

651
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:25,820
was communication.

652
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:29,023
Problems, either in scheduling or workflow,

653
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:30,844
are a part of any game's production,

654
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:32,224
and Outsource is no exception.

655
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:34,305
We just deal with them as they come up.

656
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,206
But if we don't know there's a problem on the vendor side,

657
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:40,687
or vice versa, a team of 12 people might run out of work

658
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:43,267
or spend time fixing issues we could help them with.

659
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:45,968
And this could mess up the schedule

660
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:47,669
and cause other work to get delayed as well.

661
00:39:49,129 --> 00:39:51,030
This is where the producers at eVendor come in.

662
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,450
They need to be aware of what's happening on their side,

663
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,071
spot any problems, and let us know.

664
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,299
The same goes for us, obviously.

665
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:00,540
If we go over and might deliver stuff later than was agreed,

666
00:40:01,281 --> 00:40:03,462
we need to let the vendor know as soon as possible.

667
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:07,104
As it is paramount to know what these problems are

668
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:09,665
so they can be solved, either by giving tips

669
00:40:09,725 --> 00:40:12,426
on how to solve the issue, adjusting the workflow,

670
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:16,328
or by redistributing the work to lighten the load.

671
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:22,259
Now, outsource work on Horizon for the West was mostly smooth,

672
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:25,102
but if you remember my earlier distribution of WorkGraph,

673
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:27,424
the actual time spent on projects

674
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:29,206
was slightly less neat, as you can see.

675
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:31,588
This had multiple causes.

676
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:34,932
For one thing, Texture started when the pipeline was done.

677
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:37,494
So there is a gap between outsource and Texture.

678
00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:39,937
But it doesn't mean there was a gap in production.

679
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:41,538
In fact, we did start Texturing

680
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:43,440
before the last machine finished in outsource.

681
00:40:44,702 --> 00:40:48,545
And you can see that most of the outsource work took longer at the beginning of production.

682
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:52,687
Vendors had to get up to speed on our workflow and what we expected of them.

683
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:57,410
And some machines took longer on our side as they were more complex than originally thought.

684
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:03,274
And then there are some machines that took more than a year in outsource because of the communication not being great.

685
00:41:03,915 --> 00:41:05,956
From our side, there were too many feedback rounds.

686
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:09,358
Focusing on...

687
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,392
lots of small details. And on the vendor side, producers changed and as a result,

688
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:17,013
production problems weren't always communicated properly.

689
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:22,916
Towards the middle of the project, you can see most staff sped up and completed much

690
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:28,138
closer to what was originally scheduled, with work often getting done faster than anticipated.

691
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,580
This was a direct result of communication getting better,

692
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,341
and both sides knowing what the others needed, allowing for better synergy.

693
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,507
This allowed flexibility with vendors helping us out

694
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:41,809
during spikes of work, like the trimmer task

695
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,931
that had to be finished for the first trailer

696
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:47,675
over a very short period of time with a hard deadline.

697
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:50,097
And the vendor really stepped up,

698
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:51,758
rescheduled work on their side

699
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,540
and made sure they delivered on time.

700
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,463
While at the same time, we did extra review sessions

701
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:59,205
to help them achieve this, all part of the same team.

702
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,689
So what did we achieve?

703
00:42:03,877 --> 00:42:06,359
Having the same artist take a model from detail model

704
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,822
to final in-game asset created ownership

705
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,125
and gave the artists a sense of achievement.

706
00:42:12,186 --> 00:42:15,009
It also meant they didn't do just one sort of task

707
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:15,810
for the whole production.

708
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,494
Variation keeps tasks from going still and morale high.

709
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:24,279
We tweaked the team composition, adding more asset artists

710
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,841
and spread the load of review work.

711
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:30,251
Having 3D concept artists on the team had already worked on Zero Dawn,

712
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:33,032
but having a separate art director and lead artist to split the load

713
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:36,594
meant there was more time for internal feedback and team management.

714
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:41,337
As a direct result of ownership, variation in work, and team composition,

715
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:43,818
the artists on the team were happy and productive.

716
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:48,561
And the new texture workflow that Lennart described made it easier to make changes,

717
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:51,103
even late in the project, and help us meet our deadlines.

718
00:42:52,932 --> 00:42:55,313
Because we shared the feedback work among the team,

719
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,753
there was more time for actual outsource management.

720
00:42:58,293 --> 00:43:00,133
Our vendors also did amazing work.

721
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:01,454
We couldn't have done it without them.

722
00:43:03,394 --> 00:43:07,935
In fact, together, we built 24 new machines, seven of which

723
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:10,395
were XLRs, three extra mounts.

724
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,556
We updated 21 of the existing Horizon Zero Dawn machines

725
00:43:15,736 --> 00:43:19,777
and created 33 Apex texture variations and an additional

726
00:43:20,037 --> 00:43:21,117
five Regala variants.

727
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,626
And together with the elemental variations,

728
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:27,147
there are over 100 different machines

729
00:43:27,227 --> 00:43:28,548
in Horizon Forbidden West.

730
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,152
And it didn't take till 2042 to finish.

731
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:37,913
In fact, the machines were all finished

732
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:39,094
towards the second half of 2021,

733
00:43:40,374 --> 00:43:41,795
five months before the release date.

734
00:43:43,105 --> 00:43:45,806
I'm really proud of the team, of the work that the team did.

735
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,867
And it's great to see players experience these machines

736
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,769
in ways even we couldn't imagine when we built them.

737
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:54,290
I would like to finish with a fan-made video

738
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,011
I found on Twitter that shows some of our machines in action.

739
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:11,476
Thanks for listening.

740
00:45:21,672 --> 00:45:25,895
I'd also like to thank the rest of the team who couldn't be here for their amazing work,

741
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:30,538
and Suny Legends who made most of the gameplay videos except for the last one for our talk.

742
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:34,281
And I think we have some time for questions if there are any.

743
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:42,808
Hey, great talk, great work on the game too.

744
00:45:42,968 --> 00:45:43,868
I'm really enjoying it.

745
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:47,371
So I'm curious, and this is maybe more of a design question.

746
00:45:48,216 --> 00:46:03,238
But I'm curious what motivated this decision to change the base scout class in the first game from a velociraptor type creature to one that was the burrow or that was more based on like a ferret or a badger.

747
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:14,709
I think we had in the first games, we had a lot of quadrupeds and velociraptor, T-Rex kind of machines.

748
00:46:14,749 --> 00:46:18,152
So we wanted to change to different ways of movements and stuff.

749
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:22,575
In fact, there is a talk tomorrow by our animation supervisor, Richard Oudts.

750
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,777
So he'll talk more about that.

751
00:46:25,978 --> 00:46:26,278
Thank you.

752
00:46:29,695 --> 00:46:31,397
Great presentation, great game, good job.

753
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:35,723
Quick question, when you were talking about the ownership

754
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:39,609
and the artists talking directly to the outsource artists,

755
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:42,633
was that communication directly with the artists

756
00:46:42,713 --> 00:46:44,516
in outsourcing or were the producers managing

757
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:45,477
the artists in outsourcing?

758
00:46:45,998 --> 00:46:52,820
Well, usually we work with artists on different continents and they don't always speak English,

759
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,600
the artists themselves.

760
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,642
So we usually talk to the producer with the team of the artist, but then the producer

761
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:02,042
translates because they can't always understand everything.

762
00:47:02,062 --> 00:47:03,503
Gosh, but they still got that sense of ownership.

763
00:47:04,243 --> 00:47:07,844
And I can't understand them, so it's not just that I don't speak English, I don't speak

764
00:47:07,864 --> 00:47:08,324
their language.

765
00:47:08,364 --> 00:47:08,444
So.

766
00:47:09,445 --> 00:47:10,586
Sorry, one more question.

767
00:47:11,346 --> 00:47:13,068
The more junior artists you hired,

768
00:47:13,108 --> 00:47:14,870
were they also given that sense of ownership,

769
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,492
or was there a little bit more oversight on them?

770
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:19,835
No, they made machines as well,

771
00:47:20,355 --> 00:47:21,216
from beginning to end.

772
00:47:21,576 --> 00:47:22,397
Cool. Thank you very much.

773
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:22,898
No worries.

774
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:29,509
Hello. Oh, I don't know if you want to go first. Okay, sorry.

775
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:34,152
With the art leads interfacing directly with the outsource teams for those reviews,

776
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,274
I was wondering how often were the art leads reviewing work from outsource,

777
00:47:38,694 --> 00:47:40,975
and how did they balance that with working with the folks in-house?

778
00:47:42,016 --> 00:47:43,296
Sorry, I couldn't hear it completely.

779
00:47:43,638 --> 00:47:46,501
How often were the art leads interfacing

780
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:48,003
with your outsource houses?

781
00:47:48,123 --> 00:47:49,825
Like how many reviews per week?

782
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:51,667
Was it sort of a constant stream?

783
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:54,129
Or how did they balance that versus the reviews

784
00:47:54,149 --> 00:47:55,511
that they would need to do internally?

785
00:47:56,424 --> 00:48:00,686
So it was sort of constant stream because at some point we had multiple machines in

786
00:48:00,746 --> 00:48:06,108
outsource and in production and whenever I had regular meetings with them, so I was sort

787
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:12,891
of the gatekeeper there and then the artist did all the feedback and if there was a specific

788
00:48:12,951 --> 00:48:18,854
question I would relegate it and make sure that they knew so I handled sort of the production

789
00:48:18,894 --> 00:48:25,197
side on my end, on our end but yeah, it was like a constant stream of outsource.

790
00:48:25,788 --> 00:48:29,591
And was that through Slack, just a constant stream of messages, or did you

791
00:48:29,631 --> 00:48:32,933
have some other external tools that you used to interface with the teams?

792
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:39,178
Yeah, when I joined, and we still do for this, we used Hansoft, which was,

793
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,900
yeah, maybe, you know, I would like to.

794
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:45,403
progress through Slack and have instant messages.

795
00:48:45,764 --> 00:48:50,389
I set up Skype with them so they could always send me messages.

796
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:53,673
So at least there was, you know, I could react straight away.

797
00:48:53,773 --> 00:48:57,698
So not having to constantly update some program.

798
00:48:58,478 --> 00:48:58,779
Thank you.

799
00:48:59,119 --> 00:48:59,419
No worries.

800
00:49:01,643 --> 00:49:02,084
Oh, sorry.

801
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,544
Thank you for the presentation.

802
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:07,986
The game is great.

803
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:10,947
I don't know the question's topic,

804
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:13,187
but I noticed a lot of improvements

805
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:17,069
to the animation with Aloy and everything

806
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:19,010
from walking and climbing.

807
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,531
I just want to know, what were the challenges in terms

808
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:26,192
of implementing the animation during the fight

809
00:49:26,252 --> 00:49:27,733
scenes or the machines?

810
00:49:29,617 --> 00:49:34,520
Well, you should really come to Richard's talk tomorrow, because he talks about exactly that.

811
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:41,303
He can answer that better than that. We just built a model. So he brings them to life, or his team brings them to life.

812
00:49:41,864 --> 00:49:42,304
Okay, thank you.

813
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:43,165
No worries.

814
00:49:44,405 --> 00:49:49,488
Hi, my question is similar to an earlier question. How often did you have cross-disciplinary reviews about the machines being built?

815
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:52,109
You know, how AI was implementing those behaviors and how those behaviors were being used by the gameplay designers?

816
00:49:52,129 --> 00:49:52,970
I think that's a good question.

817
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,670
We've got a lot of good questions.

818
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:53,790
We do.

819
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,211
We're going to answer those questions in the Q&A.

820
00:49:55,251 --> 00:49:55,691
We'll see you there.

821
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:55,832
Thanks.

822
00:49:55,852 --> 00:49:55,912
Bye.

823
00:49:55,932 --> 00:49:55,992
Bye.

824
00:49:56,012 --> 00:49:56,332
See you there.

825
00:49:56,352 --> 00:49:56,412
Bye.

826
00:49:56,432 --> 00:49:56,512
Bye.

827
00:49:56,532 --> 00:49:56,632
Bye.

828
00:49:56,652 --> 00:49:56,712
Bye.

829
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:56,832
Bye.

830
00:49:56,852 --> 00:49:56,912
Bye.

831
00:49:56,932 --> 00:49:56,992
Bye.

832
00:49:57,012 --> 00:49:57,072
Bye.

833
00:49:57,092 --> 00:49:57,152
Bye.

834
00:49:57,172 --> 00:49:57,252
Bye.

835
00:49:57,272 --> 00:49:57,352
Bye.

836
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:57,452
Bye.

837
00:49:57,472 --> 00:49:57,532
Bye.

838
00:49:57,552 --> 00:49:57,613
Bye.

839
00:49:57,633 --> 00:49:57,693
Bye.

840
00:49:57,713 --> 00:49:57,773
Bye.

841
00:49:57,793 --> 00:49:57,853
Bye.

842
00:49:57,893 --> 00:49:57,953
Bye.

843
00:49:57,973 --> 00:49:58,053
Bye.

844
00:49:58,073 --> 00:49:58,133
Bye.

845
00:49:58,697 --> 00:50:01,838
So we have the stand-ups like we talked about.

846
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:05,881
So we regularly have the teams directly involved with us,

847
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:08,142
like animation and tech animation,

848
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:12,524
who does the rigging and builds the rigs and game design.

849
00:50:13,085 --> 00:50:15,286
And then as we progress, there's also

850
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:22,433
to the four-week weekly meetings with all the leads from all the teams on the machine pipeline

851
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:27,975
to discuss whatever is needed. So sound effects is there really early and visual effects and

852
00:50:28,035 --> 00:50:32,957
everything just so everybody knows what's going on because these machines have a lot of moving parts.

853
00:50:34,058 --> 00:50:34,398
Thank you.

854
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:34,898
No worries.

855
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:38,553
Hi, I guess I do have a bit of a sound effects question.

856
00:50:38,653 --> 00:50:41,275
And I was wondering, do the sound effects,

857
00:50:41,435 --> 00:50:42,736
does the sound effects team get started

858
00:50:42,776 --> 00:50:45,737
like as soon as the concept is agreed upon

859
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:47,198
or do they start a little bit later

860
00:50:47,999 --> 00:50:49,099
depending on the machine design?

861
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,700
Do you wanna answer that?

862
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,863
Yeah, well, they indeed do start with the initial concept,

863
00:50:55,503 --> 00:50:59,025
but towards the end, the final comes in.

864
00:50:59,065 --> 00:51:01,287
So they do start to place their markers

865
00:51:01,347 --> 00:51:03,468
and everything for that at the start.

866
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:04,288
Cool, thank you.

867
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:11,151
So, big fan, and this is the best session for me at GDC.

868
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:15,855
So, the question is about how to design this master.

869
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:19,979
It's like you said, you design the design document first,

870
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:23,802
and then do the model, and then change the design, right?

871
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:28,864
So I want to know is there some standard or criteria to measure

872
00:51:28,884 --> 00:51:31,085
if this is a good design or not.

873
00:51:31,445 --> 00:51:37,848
Because it's like I design a machine and I don't know if it's good or not.

874
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:40,689
You mean the visual design or the game design?

875
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:43,210
The game design. It's like how to design a boss.

876
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:47,473
So they spent a long time making those design documents and they're extensive.

877
00:51:47,513 --> 00:51:49,954
They're like, I don't know, 80 pages, some of them.

878
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:52,156
And there is a lot of information in there.

879
00:51:52,296 --> 00:51:59,661
So my question is about how, is there some way to say, okay, this is good.

880
00:51:59,902 --> 00:52:01,383
We can pass to the next phase.

881
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:05,745
They keep iterating on them because they also, you know, they really

882
00:52:05,825 --> 00:52:07,486
integrate with other parts of the game.

883
00:52:07,546 --> 00:52:11,028
So, you know, and there is a lot of fine tuning there.

884
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:17,632
So they try to think what matches with the gameplay and what matches with

885
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:19,854
the story and then sort of go from there.

886
00:52:20,894 --> 00:52:24,276
But yeah, we don't have any game design talks here today.

887
00:52:24,357 --> 00:52:24,497
So.

888
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:25,817
Thank you.

889
00:52:25,837 --> 00:52:26,058
Thank you.

890
00:52:26,078 --> 00:52:26,338
No worries.

891
00:52:28,823 --> 00:52:44,935
Hey, I was curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the sign off process that you would have at each one of the distinct internal phases, like, was that a meeting who was involved in that who gave the sign off? And then, you know, was yeah, like, what was the frequency of that?

892
00:52:45,682 --> 00:52:52,645
Yes, so after each of the stages, we finish the concept, then we, like Leonard was showing,

893
00:52:53,505 --> 00:53:01,168
we look in-game and in-engine to see all the zones and if you can hit everything, what the sizes are.

894
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:09,371
And once game design and animation, they look at the model then as well to see if the anatomy works.

895
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:13,514
And if they in that stage do a sign off, then we can progress.

896
00:53:13,634 --> 00:53:17,897
And it's really important that they do because then we know that later on, we don't have to go back.

897
00:53:19,218 --> 00:53:25,763
And, you know, as we progress, more and more teams get involved with this sign off because it gets more and more things get tacked on.

898
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:25,823
So.

899
00:53:27,118 --> 00:53:32,602
How was the sign-off managed? Did you have like, did you denote that it was signed off at some given point?

900
00:53:33,182 --> 00:53:42,368
Yeah, we make sure that it goes round and then we do an email so we have it all and then we progress to make sure that later on,

901
00:53:43,949 --> 00:53:48,072
you know, we say like, well, we did look at it and it is signed off. So, cool.

902
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:48,893
All right, thanks.

903
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:49,973
No worries.

904
00:53:53,514 --> 00:54:00,799
Hey, you guys have a fantastic game, of course, but when you went from substance painter to designer,

905
00:54:01,659 --> 00:54:07,644
how did it affect the workflow efficiency for the artists and the force multiplying

906
00:54:07,804 --> 00:54:13,508
of productivity? It's kind of a both question. Yeah, as you could see in the process,

907
00:54:13,548 --> 00:54:19,953
the texturing process was like really short, so it immensely affected that. It helped a lot.

908
00:54:22,364 --> 00:54:25,387
And as we just now could set the generators and everything

909
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:27,889
in there, and it had presets.

910
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:32,734
And we had the basic input from outsource for the ID mask

911
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:33,395
already made.

912
00:54:33,515 --> 00:54:35,897
So it was just editing of the mask,

913
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,380
creating the color out of that.

914
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,123
And it was a very, very quick process.

915
00:54:42,564 --> 00:54:42,805
Thank you.

916
00:54:43,565 --> 00:54:46,706
I just want to add, in fact, towards the end of the project,

917
00:54:46,726 --> 00:54:48,407
I think in the last month or something,

918
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:51,868
well, pretty close to the end, the art director

919
00:54:52,228 --> 00:54:54,689
didn't like the look of the metal.

920
00:54:55,549 --> 00:54:58,190
And we updated, like the material got updated,

921
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,871
and then we just batched process all textures.

922
00:55:00,951 --> 00:55:02,772
And it was basically in a day, it

923
00:55:02,812 --> 00:55:04,492
was all done, where before it took a month

924
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:05,353
to do all the machines.

925
00:55:05,373 --> 00:55:07,573
So it was hugely beneficial to us.

926
00:55:08,194 --> 00:55:09,294
Wow, awesome.

927
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:15,567
So you mentioned you use clown maps

928
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:17,748
with the concept art and stuff early, early.

929
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:20,029
And you have 3D concept artists

930
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:22,049
who are also giving you a workout mesh.

931
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,050
So are you also testing your texture pipeline

932
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,331
with the clown mask early on the prototype mesh?

933
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:29,872
Getting a headstart, like generating,

934
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:30,792
because you already have the clown.

935
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:33,775
So are you using that to generate your ideas?

936
00:55:34,195 --> 00:55:38,699
The cloud mask gets created afterwards at the end in the outsource process.

937
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,522
So not with the concept.

938
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:47,528
If we get the detailed model, then the art director, he does a paint on top of that.

939
00:55:47,728 --> 00:55:52,993
And that we do with the side projection on top of the model to represent what it's going to look like.

940
00:55:54,154 --> 00:56:01,241
and we do generate like a really dirty version in Houdini to project the normals on there already.

941
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:05,545
So that's quite detailed for what we have at that point actually.

942
00:56:06,005 --> 00:56:09,369
Yeah, no problem. I was just assuming because you had the prototype model

943
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:12,652
that if you could already have a concept artist do a clown pass,

944
00:56:13,153 --> 00:56:14,494
you could probably generate a little.

945
00:56:14,894 --> 00:56:16,536
Now that happens later in the process.

946
00:56:16,596 --> 00:56:17,397
Okay, no big deal.

947
00:56:17,617 --> 00:56:17,797
Okay.

948
00:56:18,615 --> 00:56:20,657
Also, we don't have UVs yet at that point.

949
00:56:20,737 --> 00:56:25,501
It's just generated UVs, but the side projection looks so good.

950
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:30,124
We get like, um, tickets from QA gone like, yeah, but the colors are not correct.

951
00:56:30,184 --> 00:56:31,705
It's like, well, it's not the finished model.

952
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:40,513
All right. So, um, not only is it fun to like observe these awesome like machines,

953
00:56:40,573 --> 00:56:44,995
but also the whole, one of the points is to like take them down and blowing off

954
00:56:45,075 --> 00:56:49,396
like bits and pieces off them. So how did you guys handle that process of.

955
00:56:50,117 --> 00:57:00,342
Or where is that process, I guess, of, I guess, modeling the pieces that come flying off or after a machine's been destroyed?

956
00:57:01,142 --> 00:57:06,345
So there's different parts, like the canisters, they're instanced, so they get reused on all the machines.

957
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:10,607
And then some parts are like antennas and stuff.

958
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:13,429
We reuse them or re-sculpt them a little bit.

959
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:21,895
Then the plates are got like Leonard showed, get sculpted with the machine and really think about what it looks like with them on and without.

960
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:32,343
And things like weapons that you can shoot off and pick up, they get handled by our weapons team, which I didn't talk about at all, which is a bit of a shame because they do amazing work.

961
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:33,804
They made over 100 weapons as well.

962
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:39,066
And most of the parts also get specified in the design document at the start.

963
00:57:39,186 --> 00:57:43,410
So how many plates, where, and components, everything.

964
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:44,631
All right, awesome.

965
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:45,031
Thank you guys.

966
00:57:45,932 --> 00:57:46,913
So, great talk.

967
00:57:47,193 --> 00:57:49,895
I have some technical questions about the machines.

968
00:57:50,376 --> 00:57:57,041
So, first of all, could you recall what's the average poly count of the machine?

969
00:57:57,121 --> 00:58:01,405
Like, I know it differs from machine to machine, but what's the average one?

970
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:03,907
What's the average poly count for LOD 0?

971
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:11,221
I think the, if I remember correctly, I think that the tremor task was about the highest

972
00:58:11,261 --> 00:58:15,627
lot was about 400,000 polys, triangles, sorry.

973
00:58:16,308 --> 00:58:18,651
And how many LODs did you alter?

974
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:22,152
It depended on the machine.

975
00:58:22,272 --> 00:58:27,016
Some got fewer because they were smaller, but like the biggest one cut about seven.

976
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:31,059
I, we had way more and then it just, it was just too much.

977
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:31,800
Okay.

978
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:35,483
And the last one, the machines are quite huge.

979
00:58:35,683 --> 00:58:42,929
So I'm curious about the resolution needed to have a like good quality, a textile density.

980
00:58:43,209 --> 00:58:47,093
So what were the, what was the resolution that you like used?

981
00:58:47,613 --> 00:58:48,896
detail maps or

982
00:58:49,897 --> 00:58:51,741
How many texture set this you use?

983
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:54,305
What was the memory budget for it?

984
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:59,755
It sort of varies obviously by machine, but a large machine might have in total

985
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,097
say six or seven 4K maps, but then we split them up

986
00:59:04,337 --> 00:59:05,678
into lots of 2K maps.

987
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:08,520
And then those were baked into texture sets.

988
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:12,302
But we tried to emphasize the parts that you saw the most,

989
00:59:12,362 --> 00:59:16,745
like the eyes and the plates and the details

990
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:18,607
that would be seen the most.

991
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:20,608
And they had separate texture sets.

992
00:59:20,628 --> 00:59:23,150
So we could always scale them up if needed to.

993
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:26,632
And then we have a large array of detail textures

994
00:59:26,652 --> 00:59:27,933
that can use them on top.

995
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:29,014
And they create details.

996
00:59:30,355 --> 00:59:31,916
to really give you that scale.

997
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:37,881
And then we split up for the different variations.

998
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:42,845
So every texture set actually had two, was split in two.

999
00:59:43,385 --> 00:59:45,707
And so for a different variation,

1000
00:59:45,767 --> 00:59:47,308
we would only have to swap out one of them.

1001
00:59:47,368 --> 00:59:49,410
So we loaded in the least amount of textures.

1002
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:50,550
Okay, thank you.

1003
00:59:50,891 --> 00:59:51,151
No worries.

1004
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,083
Hey guys, great talk, great game, thank you for your job.

1005
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,166
So the question is about updating the existing machines

1006
00:59:59,206 --> 00:59:59,987
from zero dawn.

1007
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:03,170
So did you follow the same flow for that?

1008
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:05,852
And how much compared, of course it's like,

1009
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:08,915
it takes less time than creating a machine from scratch,

1010
01:00:08,935 --> 01:00:11,717
but how complicated was that,

1011
01:00:11,797 --> 01:00:13,559
like, I mean, updating the existing ones?

1012
01:00:14,814 --> 01:00:17,414
Well, the models stayed the same.

1013
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:20,015
So we didn't do any updates to the model,

1014
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:21,635
but we did redo the texturing.

1015
01:00:22,135 --> 01:00:22,855
Just the texturing?

1016
01:00:22,895 --> 01:00:23,056
Yeah.

1017
01:00:23,376 --> 01:00:25,376
Okay, thank you.
