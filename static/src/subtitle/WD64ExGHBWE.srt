1
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:08,648
Okay. I think we're probably about ready to start. First of

2
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:11,489
all, I'd like to thank everyone for coming. My name is Ron

3
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:14,410
Gilbert, and today I'm going to be talking a little bit about

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,891
Maniac Mansion. The GDC people wanted me to remind everybody to

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:23,452
please fill out your evaluation forms. They also wanted to let

6
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:26,993
me tell you that due to a bug in their database, excellent is the

7
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:31,574
only possible choice that you can fill out. So I just want to

8
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:32,275
tell everybody that.

9
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:34,879
So I'm going to talk a little bit about Maniac Mansion.

10
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,599
And Maniac Mansion was really one

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,900
of the defining graphic adventure games

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,080
of the 80s and 90s.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,301
And I started working on Maniac Mansion about 25 years ago.

14
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:46,942
And I'm just curious, a quick show of hands,

15
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:50,543
how many people in this room weren't even alive 25 years ago?

16
00:00:50,563 --> 00:00:53,763
And I said, don't worry about making me feel bad,

17
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,604
because I'm going to stand out here for the next hour

18
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:58,504
and rant like a bitter old man about how much better things

19
00:00:58,524 --> 00:00:59,405
were back in the day.

20
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:03,275
how we had pixels the size of your head and we liked it that

21
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:12,938
way. So when I started thinking about this talk, it started out

22
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:17,660
really being a post-mortem on a game that was 25 years old. And

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,521
looking back at its creation and looking back at its development

24
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,522
and what we did right and what we did wrong. But as I was

25
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,703
putting together the talk, it started to become more of this

26
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:28,364
trip down memory lane for me.

27
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:31,593
And I got together with Gary Winick, who had co-created and

28
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:32,653
designed the game with me.

29
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,674
And we spent hours laughing at all the odd things that we did

30
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:38,755
back then and reminiscing what it was like to work at Lucas

31
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:39,995
Film in those early days.

32
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,976
And I met with David Fox, who I'd not seen in years.

33
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:45,996
We chatted about programming in the SCUM system for the

34
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:46,676
first time.

35
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:49,137
We talked about the ups and downs of the project.

36
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:52,158
We talked about the good times and the bad times.

37
00:01:52,642 --> 00:01:56,483
So this talk ended up less being a postmortem and just an odd

38
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:59,584
collection of memories that are hopefully entertaining and

39
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:05,746
amusing to more people than just myself. Now, Maniac Mansion is

40
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:10,348
a graphic adventure. It came out in 1987. It was for the Commodore

41
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,889
64 and it was one of the first point and click adventure games.

42
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,650
Maniac Mansion allowed players to choose three of these seven

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,371
possible kids to go into this creepy old mansion in search of

44
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:20,812
a friend.

45
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:24,926
The game featured several endings and different puzzles

46
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:28,749
depending on which of the kids you chose. Now, over the years,

47
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:32,411
Maniac Mansion has become somewhat of a cult hit for fans

48
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:36,415
around the world. Maniac Mansion has inspired countless pieces

49
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:40,458
of fan art. There's the green and purple tentacle knitting.

50
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,801
This is one of my favorites. This is the Maniac Mansion LEGO

51
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,381
minifigs.

52
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:50,897
This is this very odd plastic doll of Razor that I find oddly

53
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:57,783
compelling. This is a 256-color fan remake of Maniac Mansion.

54
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:04,388
This is some of the kids done in plastic bead art. This is also

55
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:07,350
one of my favorites. This is Dr. Fred and Nurse Edna done as a

56
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,374
cross stitch. This is a fan-made Maniac Mansion poster.

57
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:17,580
There was even a fan remake of Maniac Mansion, all done in 3D.

58
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:20,022
This was really interesting.

59
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:23,144
So people put together a live action movie trailer for

60
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:27,008
Maniac Mansion, which was great fun.

61
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:30,590
People, of course, love to cosplay the green and purple

62
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,013
tentacles, or the green and purple tentacles.

63
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,856
This is why I make video games.

64
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,693
Well, while I was not the first to do it, Maniac Mansion has

65
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:47,494
really been credited with a game that really popularized the

66
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:50,235
point and click interface that LucasArts really became famous

67
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:53,757
for in the 80s and 90s. And Maniac Mansion was the game that

68
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:57,239
coined the word cut scene that we use inside and outside the

69
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,140
industry today. Now, of all the games that I've worked on over

70
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,862
the years, Maniac Mansion is without a doubt my favorite. It's

71
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:08,124
a very personal game for me. And not because it's a great game,

72
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,225
but because it's a very flawed game.

73
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:14,094
And it's those flaws that make it so interesting and special

74
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:14,475
for me.

75
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:17,237
Now, when I started working at Lucasfilm,

76
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:18,277
I started there in 1984.

77
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:20,919
I was a programmer working on the Commodore 64

78
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,900
version of Corona's Rift.

79
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,142
Now, the Lucasfilm games division

80
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:27,764
was a small seven-person team that

81
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:29,985
was a part of the Lucasfilm computer division.

82
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,107
And the Lucasfilm computer division

83
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,388
would go on to become Pixar at some point.

84
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:38,811
And it was there, working in the games group,

85
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:39,932
that I met Gary Winnick.

86
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:43,863
And we became really good friends. Gary and I both really

87
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:48,825
enjoyed old horror movies. We liked things like Reanimator. We

88
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:53,067
loved things like The Fly. There was this movie called Creepshow

89
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:57,088
which starred Stephen King. And he played this farmer and a

90
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,830
meteor crashed into his farm and slowly started to take him over.

91
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,031
And this is really where we got the idea for the purple meteor

92
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:09,233
that crashes and takes over Dr. Fred really kind of came from

93
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:09,773
this movie.

94
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,702
So as Kronos was finishing up, Gary and I started talking about

95
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:17,724
making some kind of a comedy horror game. And the Little

96
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:20,385
Shop of Horrors had just came out. And we were really big fans

97
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:22,866
of that game. And you can see where we kind of stole the idea

98
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,768
for the man-eating plant in Maniac Mansion. Now, around the

99
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:30,749
time we were thinking about Maniac Mansion, the Lucasfilm

100
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,591
Games group moved from our offices in its industrial park

101
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:36,231
up to Skywalker Ranch.

102
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:40,250
Now, Skywalker Ranch is this large, sprawling ranch that

103
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,593
George Lucas built in the hills of Marin.

104
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:46,015
And the ranch was designed to look like a big family ranch.

105
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:48,838
But it would actually house his company, Lucasfilm.

106
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,640
Now, it consisted of several buildings.

107
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:56,144
There was the main house, which housed George's office.

108
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,626
And behind it, there was a collection of much smaller

109
00:05:58,687 --> 00:05:59,087
buildings.

110
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,029
In the very back, there was the stable house.

111
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,331
And the stable house is what housed the

112
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,472
Lucasfilm Games Group.

113
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:06,843
I always thought it was amusing that we were in the stable

114
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:09,385
house, you know, back where the horses and stuff would have

115
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:19,573
been. Now, a lot of the inspiration for the mansion, the

116
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,595
Maniac Mansion, came from the main house. This is the main

117
00:06:22,635 --> 00:06:25,357
house at Skywalker Ranch, and George's office is up there on

118
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:28,679
the third floor. And you can see a lot of similarities in the

119
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:29,940
main house and the mansion.

120
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,724
Gary and I were always poking fun of things that were going

121
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:34,485
on at the ranch.

122
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:37,526
And this was just kind of our way of poking fun of that stuff

123
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:38,066
a little bit.

124
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:40,866
The main house also had a library in it.

125
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,268
And you can see the picture of the spiral staircase that was

126
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:47,849
in the library at the main house and the spiral staircase

127
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,109
that is in Maniac Mansion.

128
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,071
The main house also had a media room with a large screen TV.

129
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:57,752
And back then, that was actually a very large TV.

130
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,961
The main house had a grand piano in it.

131
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:06,024
We also had a nuclear reactor at Skywalker Ranch.

132
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:08,986
It's actually true.

133
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:11,148
You can only get so much power from Ewoks.

134
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:14,310
They've got those little legs.

135
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:20,294
So Gary and I did some early concept art.

136
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:23,657
We did these posters for the game, just kind of showing

137
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:26,318
what a movie poster of the game might look like, just to

138
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,980
get the feel of everything coming out.

139
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:31,673
We also did some early concepts of the kids.

140
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:34,714
And I often call those seven characters,

141
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,174
I call them the kids.

142
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:38,054
But they're not really kids in the game.

143
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:40,515
But they actually did start out as kids.

144
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:41,995
And they were these young kids.

145
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:44,636
And there's a brother and a sister and their friend

146
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:45,776
and the little brother.

147
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,177
And they were the ones that were going

148
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:48,377
to be going into the mansion.

149
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:51,578
But someone mentioned that maybe this might push

150
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:53,238
the game a little bit young.

151
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:55,459
And maybe we should do something about making

152
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:56,819
the kids actually older.

153
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,602
So we started working with making them a little older.

154
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,683
And this is, again, some early concept art.

155
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:05,506
You can see an early version of Razor and Bernard down there

156
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,107
and dead cousin Ted.

157
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:09,228
And that was Weird Ed and the tentacle.

158
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:12,870
And in the early versions of the game, Weird Ed was much

159
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,671
more of a friendly character that was really

160
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:15,672
helping the kids out.

161
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:20,334
And he became a little bit more in line with the family

162
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:21,955
as the game kind of went on.

163
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:25,057
Here's some of the artwork of the entryway to the

164
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:26,338
house that Gary did.

165
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:33,307
This is the infamous dungeon that you get thrown into. Some

166
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:40,691
more stuff going around the edge of the house. The entryway.

167
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:47,574
Here's another one of Weird Ed. He changed a lot. This was some

168
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:50,195
very early stuff that we were doing. Just trying to get a feel

169
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:51,055
for what things were like.

170
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,869
This was the concept for what the box might look like.

171
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,609
This was a little bit later in the process,

172
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,490
after the game was getting closer to being finished.

173
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,291
And Gary was just doing some mock-ups

174
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:04,752
of what the box might look like.

175
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:12,675
So besides this concept art, we really didn't have a story.

176
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,776
Besides these kids that just go into this creepy old house,

177
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,817
I think we kind of figured that the game would just

178
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:18,957
write itself after that.

179
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:22,708
We didn't even really know what the genre of the game

180
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:23,448
was going to be.

181
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,849
At this point, it was not an adventure game.

182
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,209
The idea of it being an adventure game

183
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,070
really hadn't even occurred to us yet.

184
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,751
It was just this amorphous game where you just went around

185
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:34,791
and you did stuff.

186
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:37,011
But we really didn't know what at that point.

187
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:39,612
I clearly remember sitting around trying

188
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:41,832
to imagine what the gameplay was going to be like.

189
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:44,773
And it just wasn't making a lot of sense to me.

190
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:47,454
I really didn't know what the players were going to do.

191
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:49,754
We had fun ideas, but that was about it.

192
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,530
So during my Christmas vacation that year, I went to see my aunt

193
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,291
and uncle. And my eight-year-old cousin had a RadioShack-colored

194
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:01,832
computer, and he was playing this game called King's Quest.

195
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:06,194
Now, I'd spent a lot of time playing Colossal Cave on my

196
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:09,335
university's mainframe, and I played all the Scott Adams

197
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:13,376
adventure games and the Infocom text adventure games. And I

198
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:16,177
really loved the genre of adventure games. But it was

199
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,718
watching my eight-year-old cousin play King's Quest.

200
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,224
that really made Maniac Mansion just completely fall into place.

201
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:25,227
It was like, of course, we're making an adventure game.

202
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:29,471
And it was this eureka moment where everything just made

203
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,434
sense. It's like all those weird, disconnected ideas that

204
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:35,458
Gary and I hate just all completely, instantly fell into

205
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:39,922
place. Now, I spent a lot of time playing King's Quest over

206
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:42,285
that Christmas vacation just to see what they were doing.

207
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,523
And it was my first exposure to a text adventure that had

208
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,105
graphics, but they weren't just simple static pictures.

209
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,666
They actually had animation on them.

210
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:53,930
But there was one aspect of the game that I did not like at

211
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,731
all, and that was the text parser.

212
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,553
There were these graphics, and it was more than just a

213
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:02,236
slideshow, but I still felt at some level that I was playing

214
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,097
a text adventure.

215
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:06,140
And I was getting very frustrated playing this game

216
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,001
that I called Second Guess the Parser.

217
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:10,763
You'd see a bush on the screen.

218
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,375
You wouldn't know what to call it, so you'd type pick up plant

219
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,937
and it would say I don't know what a plant is. So you'd type

220
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:19,139
pick up bush and it would say I don't know what a bush is. You'd

221
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,261
type pick up shrubbery and it would say I don't know what a

222
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:24,624
shrubbery is. So eventually I typed fuck you on there and it

223
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:27,346
would say, you know, do you really need to swear? And I'm

224
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:32,089
like, yes, yes, I really do need to swear right here. So I'm

225
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,112
looking at this bush or this plant or this shrub and I can't

226
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:38,034
really figure out what the game designer is calling it. This was

227
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,995
not gameplay to me. This was not fun.

228
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,732
It's like, why can't I just point at this thing?

229
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,733
I can just see it right there on the screen.

230
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,293
I should be able to just point at it.

231
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:49,515
And if I'm able to click on objects on the screen,

232
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,176
the next logical step is, why can't I just

233
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:54,417
click on the verbs that are also on the screen?

234
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,458
And really, what despite the backs of the boxes

235
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,239
and the marketing departments were telling us,

236
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:02,020
there really was only a very limited set of verbs

237
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,661
that these games actually understood.

238
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:07,723
Now, the Commodore 64 had a joystick.

239
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:10,936
So I made it so you move the joystick around and you would,

240
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:13,278
you know, hover over an object and you click on it and it

241
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:15,660
would select it and you could go down and you could select the

242
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,922
verbs. So now that Gary and I really knew that Maniac Mansion

243
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:22,884
was this adventure game, it was going to be completely visual

244
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:26,307
and there was not going to be a parser, we were really off and

245
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:31,290
running now. Now, the other idea that we had was that you played

246
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,993
the game not just with three characters, or not just with one

247
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:37,955
character, but with three, and you could switch off between

248
00:12:37,995 --> 00:12:38,095
them.

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,102
Even better than that, there were seven different

250
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:42,603
characters that you could choose from.

251
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:44,724
And you got to pick any three of these.

252
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:47,846
The characters, there was Dave, who was the first one.

253
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,828
He was loosely modeled after me, just because I dressed a

254
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,009
lot like that back then.

255
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:53,390
There was Sid.

256
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,231
He was the New Wave musician.

257
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,633
And New Wave was all the rage, so we had to have New Wave.

258
00:12:57,673 --> 00:12:59,114
There was Michael, the photographer.

259
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:00,955
There was Wendy, the writer.

260
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:03,436
And Wendy was actually modeled after a real person, my

261
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:05,958
neighbor Wendy, who worked in the Lucasfilm games group.

262
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,339
And she did all of our accounting.

263
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:10,629
And there was Bernard, who I think just represents the geek

264
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:11,309
in all of us.

265
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,810
There was Razor.

266
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,373
Now Razor is named after Gary's girlfriend, whose name was Ray.

267
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,154
So we took that from there.

268
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:20,416
And then there was Jeff, who was the surfer dude.

269
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:22,578
And I guess we were from California, so I guess we had

270
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:23,979
to have surfer people in the game.

271
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,502
So playing the game with these three characters, as a group

272
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:32,345
of seven, it was this genius idea that we would come to

273
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,827
completely regret later on in the game.

274
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,632
So to get the design off and running, Gary and I made this

275
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:43,415
large map of the mansion. We had each room laid out as a little

276
00:13:43,475 --> 00:13:47,217
box on this big giant piece of cardboard with all these lines

277
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:50,759
extending from each box showing how one room connected to

278
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,022
another. We had these layered sheets of acetate that you would

279
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:57,024
lay over the top of this thing. And we had every object written

280
00:13:57,084 --> 00:14:00,326
on the acetate. We had all these colored arrows representing the

281
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:03,368
different characters and what puzzle they could solve and what

282
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:05,109
object went to solution.

283
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,999
and all of these different things.

284
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:10,680
And we were really, really proud of this map.

285
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,581
We were so proud of this map that Gary actually added it

286
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,081
to Weird Ed's bedroom.

287
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:18,962
And it was complicated.

288
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,122
And it was a virtually unintelligible mess.

289
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:24,403
But it was the only way that we knew

290
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:25,843
how to keep this game straight.

291
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:28,884
Plus, Gary and I had never designed an adventure game

292
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:29,244
before.

293
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:30,784
I mean, really, how hard can this be?

294
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:40,120
So after a few weeks of frantic programming, it became clear to

295
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,003
me that I was never going to complete Maniac Mansion, writing

296
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:46,605
the whole thing in 6502 assembly language. Now another

297
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:49,928
programmer at Lucasfilm by the name of Chip Morningstar

298
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:53,451
suggested that I create a scripting language. This would

299
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:56,573
allow the logic of the game to be done in scripting language

300
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:59,456
and the engine itself could be done in blazingly fast 6502.

301
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:04,085
Now, I played around with using a Lisp-like language, because I

302
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,186
was kind of all the rage for AI, but I eventually settled on a

303
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:10,827
language that was more C-like in structure. Now, Chip wrote that

304
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:13,628
first version of the SCUM compiler, and I wrote the

305
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:16,429
interpreter and the rest of the engine, and the SCUM system was

306
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:20,630
really born. Now, SCUM stands for Script Creation Utility for

307
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:28,472
Maniac Mansion. Now, several aspects of Maniac Mansion

308
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,154
really hard-coded into the scum language at that point. Like

309
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:35,256
the actual names of the kids were hard-coded into the engine,

310
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:38,459
the color that they used when their text was displayed, the

311
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,182
actual verbs, this was all hard-coded, really hard-coded

312
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:47,107
into the engine at that point. Now all of this would become

313
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:50,750
abstracted out when Zach McCracken came out and then

314
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:56,275
Indiana Jones and then also with Loom. The system became a lot

315
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:57,015
more independent.

316
00:15:57,487 --> 00:16:00,568
And the whole notions of verbs were completely removed from

317
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:03,149
the SCUMM engine, and they were coded in the language.

318
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:06,010
And that all really started with Loom, because Brian didn't

319
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,291
really have verbs in the conventional sense.

320
00:16:08,351 --> 00:16:10,672
We had to remove them from the engine, and they became a lot

321
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:11,632
more abstracted.

322
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:16,074
So during this time, Gary was producing a lot of art, and it

323
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,494
had no place to go yet.

324
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:19,355
And we continued to work on the design.

325
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:21,896
Now, I want to talk a little bit about the art

326
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,036
in Maniac Mansion.

327
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,017
Now, it may look very crude.

328
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,172
and unsophisticated by today's standards.

329
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:31,533
But at the time, this was really state of the art stuff.

330
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:35,894
The Commodore 64 screen had a resolution of 320 by 200

331
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:39,735
pixels, and it had 16 predefined colors.

332
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:43,897
Now, one of the innovations that Maniac Mansion had over

333
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,797
the Sierra games were scrolling screens.

334
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,178
As the character moved from left to right, the camera

335
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,939
tracked them by scrolling the screen.

336
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:55,274
And we use this to great effect to reveal characters and

337
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,736
objects in the game as the Edison family moved around and

338
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:00,416
the screen would scroll to reveal them.

339
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:03,637
But this presented a big technical challenge for me.

340
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:08,519
The Commodore 64 had a true bitmap screen where each pixel

341
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,440
could be addressed individually.

342
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,622
But at 16K for one screen, that was just way, way too

343
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:18,103
much memory to actually scroll.

344
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:21,984
And the really sad thing is, I spent months, months,

345
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:26,080
hand tuning 6502 assembly language to get that screen to

346
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:33,187
scroll. And now I can just do it in PowerPoint. But the Commodore

347
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:36,109
64 also had what was called a programmable character set that

348
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:38,992
allowed for the creation of custom characters. Meaning that

349
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:41,414
we could redefine what each of the characters looked like to be

350
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:44,777
anything we wanted. And then by using this, we could create all

351
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:47,780
the screens using these 8 pixel by 8 pixel tiles.

352
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,571
And it reduced the amount of memory that we needed to scroll

353
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:53,711
from 16K down to just 1K.

354
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:56,692
But this presented a big problem for Gary and his art.

355
00:17:57,232 --> 00:17:59,673
Creating the images for all these rooms out of little

356
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,894
tiles was going to remove a lot of the charm that we saw in

357
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:03,554
Gary's art.

358
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:06,815
So I wrote this graphics editor where Gary could paint

359
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,996
on the Commodore 64 screen and treat it like a real bitmap.

360
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:12,717
And he would press a key, and it would go through, and it

361
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:16,958
would try to reduce that screen into a character set.

362
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:19,869
Now, the downside of using character sets is there was a

363
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:23,932
limit of only 256 characters. And a lot of Gary's art would

364
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:27,714
get compressed down to three, four, or 500 characters. So

365
00:18:27,754 --> 00:18:29,695
then the program would go through and it would try to find

366
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:33,277
two characters that looked similar, not exact but similar,

367
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:35,939
and it would just force one to look exactly like the other.

368
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,141
And after multiple minutes of crunching, it would have reduced

369
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,503
this image to 256 characters. There would be a lot of

370
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:45,745
glitches. So then Gary would go in and he would touch up those

371
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:47,286
glitches back in bitmap mode.

372
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:50,626
And after several iterations of this, we had images that had

373
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:53,888
been crunched down to 256 characters, but they still

374
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:56,610
retained a lot of the charm of Gary's original art.

375
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:02,954
Now, another one of the things that this found in Maniac

376
00:19:02,994 --> 00:19:05,516
Mansion also came about from a technical limitation.

377
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:08,758
And that was the large-headed characters that you see here.

378
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:13,821
And the Commodore 64 had these 24 pixel by 24 pixel sprites.

379
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:15,282
And they were all done in hardware.

380
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:18,174
And by using scanline interrupts, we were able to

381
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:20,496
reuse the sprites vertically down the screen.

382
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:23,778
So we had these vertical sprites that were 24 pixels

383
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:26,140
wide, but they were as tall as we wanted.

384
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,821
And Gary wanted the characters to really read well, and

385
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,082
especially the faces.

386
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,444
So he made the heads as large and as wide as he could.

387
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,926
And if you really look at a lot of the animation in

388
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,468
Maniac Mansion, you'll see that as the characters walk and

389
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:42,350
move, nothing ever extends outside of that 24 pixel box,

390
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,931
which was the constraint of the sprites.

391
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,892
So after close to a year working on the core of the SCUMM

392
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:51,414
engine, this was much to the consternation of LucanSwim's

393
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:54,317
management, I might add, it was actually time to start

394
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:55,317
programming the game.

395
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:59,841
Now, the ultimate purpose of the SCUMM system was now time

396
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:01,402
to really put that to the test.

397
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:03,964
Now, I was originally going to be the only

398
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:05,225
programmer on the project.

399
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,347
But that was just no longer realistic.

400
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:11,170
So David Fox came on to do a lot of the SCUMM programming

401
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:11,330
work.

402
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:14,698
Now, I'd done some of the basic SCUMM programming, mostly to

403
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:17,358
test the engine and the constructs of the language and

404
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,419
just set things up and make sure it was working. But most of

405
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:23,900
the actual work, the actual SCUMM scripting, really fell to

406
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,421
David Fox. Now, one of the first things, or one of the things

407
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,641
I'm really proud of about the SCUMM system is that it was

408
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:35,162
completely multitasking back in the day of the Commodore 64.

409
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:38,062
This allowed the SCUMM programmers to focus on a

410
00:20:38,123 --> 00:20:39,583
single object or character.

411
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:42,228
and code it to run in its own process.

412
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,091
And it's really eliminated the need for complex state engines.

413
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,993
And one of the first things it ever animated in the game,

414
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:50,414
one of the first things it got working,

415
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:52,415
was that clock, that little pendulum

416
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:53,456
that moved left and right.

417
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,378
And that little clock was a 10-line SCUMM script.

418
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,460
And it ran in its own process.

419
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,782
And we used this technique throughout the game

420
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:04,743
to control different characters and logic.

421
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:07,905
Now, being able to fully multitask and think about the

422
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:11,527
game as small, independent chunks and objects really

423
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:15,048
became a mainstay of how you programmed in the SCUMM system.

424
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,391
So other than this big map of the mansion that we had hanging

425
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:24,332
in Weird Ed's bedroom, there was no design document for

426
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:27,994
Maniac Mansion. We had nothing that was not in our heads or on

427
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,074
that particular map.

428
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:32,769
And this presented a really big problem for David Fox, since he

429
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,072
was going to be tasked with a lot of the SCUMM programming. So

430
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:38,875
before David would start working on a room, he would sit down

431
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:41,318
with Gary and I and we talked about what was supposed to

432
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:44,682
happen, and then he'd program it up in the SCUMM language. We

433
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:48,025
called this wiring up rooms. Now, we called the screens

434
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:50,188
rooms because they were rooms of the mansion.

435
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,998
This was a terminology that would follow the scum system all

436
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:57,139
the way through. And even in Monkey Island, we still called

437
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:06,882
them rooms, even though most of them took place outside. Now,

438
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:10,063
one of the opening lines in Maniac Mansion is where Dave

439
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,223
says to Bernard, don't be a tuna head. And it's a really odd

440
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:18,065
line. People often ask me about it. And originally, this line

441
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:19,625
was supposed to be don't be a shithead.

442
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:24,998
Now the head of Lucasfilm Games told us to take it out, that we

443
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:28,900
could not swear in a Lucasfilm game. And Gary and I felt very

444
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,542
strongly that Dave needed to say shit. I guess we were young and

445
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:36,163
swearing was probably still cool. Now we protested. We

446
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:38,845
argued about the antistrict integrity of the game and

447
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,146
probably how our vision was being destroyed by censorship.

448
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,308
If we couldn't say shit, then this whole game just wasn't even

449
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:46,428
worth making anymore.

450
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,290
So our boss said, look.

451
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:54,234
You too go off. And if you can come back with a really good

452
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:58,675
reason why you need to say shit, we'll leave it. So think long

453
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:05,477
and hard about why you need to swear. So we did. Gary and I

454
00:23:05,737 --> 00:23:08,598
thought about, we thought about it a lot. And we really couldn't

455
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,939
come up with a good reason. And in retrospect, it really was

456
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:16,221
kind of silly and pointless and a little bit juvenile. So I

457
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:19,202
changed don't be a shithead to don't be a tuna head. And I

458
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:20,642
think I did it out of protest.

459
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:24,455
And at the time I figured, well, if I couldn't swear, then I was

460
00:23:24,495 --> 00:23:27,195
going to say something confusing and maybe a little bit stupid

461
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:30,377
just to make a point. But it was a line that actually caught on

462
00:23:30,437 --> 00:23:33,718
in an odd way. And you talk to, you know, Maniac Mansion fans

463
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:36,079
and you say, don't be a tuna head, and they know exactly what

464
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:40,800
you're talking about. So as the game was finally coming

465
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,281
together, we were getting a chance to play it. We started to

466
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:48,183
realize that we had made a huge mistake. Having seven

467
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:51,959
that all had their own set of interconnecting puzzles and

468
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,841
endings was a hell of a lot of work. And it was far more

469
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,423
complex than we had anticipated. And we were constantly dealing

470
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:03,084
with dead-end situations and odd unsolvable puzzles. And in

471
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:06,706
short, this was a complete clusterfuck. And we were

472
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:10,108
constantly fighting against the desire just to rip out all the

473
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,229
endings and just go with three characters or even sometimes

474
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:17,952
just one character for this game. We were way behind schedule.

475
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:21,292
And there's this point where you're in so deep that you just

476
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:24,674
want to scream, and there just seems to be absolutely no way

477
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:27,855
out. And this is where we found ourselves in Maniac Mansion.

478
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:32,096
But we stuck with it. We worked out all the odd puzzle issues

479
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:35,057
and we slogged through the programming. We kept the seven

480
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:38,238
characters and all the solutions. In retrospect, I

481
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:41,259
think it really was the right decision. Maniac Mansion is

482
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,640
really defined by these seven characters.

483
00:24:44,204 --> 00:24:47,406
Being able to pick the three you wanted to play with allowed

484
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:50,809
players to really customize the game in a way. Players often

485
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:53,971
had dream teams that they would go into the mansion with. And

486
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:56,754
having different endings based on the kids that you chose was

487
00:24:56,794 --> 00:25:00,036
a great way to get replayability. Players would

488
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:02,418
talk to each other about the different puzzles they had to

489
00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:04,960
solve and the different endings and the different kids and they

490
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,643
really want to play it again. Now, of course, none of this

491
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:11,325
was planned. We just thought it would be fun to have seven

492
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:12,266
characters in the game.

493
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,283
Now, one of the other defining elements of Maniac Mansion are

494
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:19,204
really the cut scenes. And it's probably one of the first games

495
00:25:19,224 --> 00:25:23,366
to really truly use cut scenes. The other games had scenes that

496
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:26,267
played out when you started or finished a level, but not that

497
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:29,068
happened throughout the game, really as a way to tell a

498
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,390
story. Now, the reason I called them cut scenes was that they

499
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:36,371
were scenes that cut away from the game. And there was even a

500
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,772
command in the scum language called cut scenes.

501
00:25:39,352 --> 00:25:42,293
And this command automatically saved the state of the game and

502
00:25:42,313 --> 00:25:45,294
then restored it when the cutscene was over. This meant

503
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:47,594
that they were easy to be triggered off of timers and

504
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:49,795
other events and we didn't really have to worry about the

505
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:53,235
state that the game was in before that happened. I'm also,

506
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,616
you know, it's hard sometimes being the programmer half of an

507
00:25:56,696 --> 00:26:00,177
artist programmer duo, so I couldn't resist to show my source

508
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:03,698
code up here since you're seeing all of Gary's great art. Now

509
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:06,458
Maniac Mansion triggered a lot of these cutscenes simply based

510
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:07,138
on timers.

511
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:09,650
So you could be right in the middle of doing something and

512
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,732
the game would cut away and show you a cut scene. And we later

513
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,614
refined this in the last crusade in Monkey Island and we

514
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:18,175
had the cut scenes triggered off of events or progressions of

515
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:22,518
the player so they really weren't so jarring. So we're

516
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,020
frantically working on the game. We are way, way behind schedule

517
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,002
at this point. We're very worried that George is going to

518
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,844
show up one day and throw us in this garbage compactor we're

519
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:33,705
pretty sure that he has outside his office.

520
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:37,600
Gary is cranking out art and I'm working on the scum engine and

521
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,382
David is scum programming like mad. This is a seven day a week

522
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:44,864
job, it's late into the night for many months and many, many

523
00:26:44,924 --> 00:26:48,486
weekends. And we're thinking, is this going to work? Is this a

524
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:53,128
good game? Or are we just wasting our time? So one day

525
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:56,250
David asked me to come into his office. He wants to show me

526
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,571
something. And Gary is standing there with this odd smirk on his

527
00:26:59,631 --> 00:26:59,872
face.

528
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:04,397
David has the kitchen room up and running on his Commodore 64

529
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:08,478
and Razor standing there next to the microwave. There's a

530
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:15,501
hamster in her inventory. Go ahead, David says. Put the

531
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:23,003
hamster in the microwave. So he put the hamster in the microwave

532
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:25,744
thinking David's going to show me some bug in the scum system

533
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:29,346
that he needs to fix. And then David says, go ahead, turn on

534
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:29,966
the microwave.

535
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:34,896
So after a few seconds of humming sound and a perfectly

536
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:40,697
timed ding, and we just completely laughed our asses

537
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:45,079
off about this. So if you're upset about that hamster in the

538
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:52,381
microwave thing, that was David and Gary. I love hamsters. But

539
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,102
what this really does point out is really the power of the scum

540
00:27:55,162 --> 00:27:58,563
system for us. It only took a few minutes to draw and script

541
00:27:58,603 --> 00:27:59,163
that gag.

542
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:02,815
And it was fast and funny to put things into SCUMM games.

543
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,276
And you really see that payoff in Monkey Island, where we

544
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,697
were able to make that game in this almost improv fashion.

545
00:28:08,717 --> 00:28:11,619
It was just trying things and taking them out and trying

546
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:12,799
lots of different ideas.

547
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:16,580
Now, one of the drawbacks of being able to script events so

548
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,161
quickly is we wanted to make everything work.

549
00:28:19,602 --> 00:28:22,042
We made it so you could use any object with any other

550
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:24,643
object, and if we thought it made logical sense to let the

551
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,264
player do it, we would let them do it.

552
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:30,523
Now what this did mean is that we wired up a lot of dead ends.

553
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:34,026
Things that the players might think to do, we'd wire up and

554
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:37,168
let them screw themselves over. Now some of the examples of

555
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:42,451
this, you can pour the developer fluid on the plant, killing it,

556
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:44,713
preventing you from ever being able to climb up into the

557
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:48,855
attic. You can shoot the Edsel off into space without putting

558
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:53,559
the meteor into it. Letting Weird Ed get his package makes

559
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,060
the game unwinnable with certain combinations of kids.

560
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:01,114
If you open the undeveloped film and the lights are on, the film

561
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:05,657
is exposed, making the game unwinnable with Michael. If you

562
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:08,219
waste the paint remover on anything else other than the

563
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,923
paint blotch in the room with the man eating house, or if you

564
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:17,746
waste all your dimes in the telescope room, or if you send

565
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:21,228
irrelevant information to Mark Eater, the marketing guy, you

566
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:23,510
won't be able to send anything else to him, making the game

567
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:23,990
unwinnable.

568
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:28,336
And if you only have one of the kids inside the house who

569
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:30,597
doesn't have the old rusty key and they get caught in the

570
00:29:30,657 --> 00:29:34,139
dungeon, you're pretty much screwed. Now there are

571
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:36,780
countless other examples of this. And it's not that we were

572
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,382
trying to be cruel or vindictive. We were just naive.

573
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:44,404
And it was so easy to wire this stuff up that we really didn't

574
00:29:44,464 --> 00:29:46,746
think about a lot of the implications of what we were

575
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:47,066
doing.

576
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:50,577
Now, the worst part of the dead ends is you don't know you've

577
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:53,518
really screwed up until much farther in the game. You just

578
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:56,500
happily play along before you realize what you did a long time

579
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,542
ago just completely boxed you in. Now, some of that was just

580
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:03,923
accepted gameplay back then, you treating the save game as a

581
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:07,505
gameplay mechanic. But a lot of it was just us not thinking

582
00:30:07,545 --> 00:30:11,367
things through. Now, today a lot of this would be caught by test.

583
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,343
But other than myself, David, and Gary, there was only one

584
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:18,546
other full-time member of the Maniac Mansion team, and he was

585
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:20,868
the sole tester at Lucasfilm Games.

586
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:24,431
And he sat in this back room, and he played Maniac Mansion

587
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:25,071
all day long.

588
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:27,293
And we had no bug database.

589
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:30,136
He would just jot down notes, and he'd give them to either

590
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:31,677
David or Gary and I to fix.

591
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:33,578
We had no regression testing.

592
00:30:33,638 --> 00:30:34,980
We had no focus testing.

593
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,561
We had no test plan at all.

594
00:30:37,422 --> 00:30:39,824
So other than David and I playing this game, that was

595
00:30:39,844 --> 00:30:41,005
the extent of the testing.

596
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:44,012
which I think is pretty amazing, considering the complexity of

597
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,433
the game and all the different endings and the characters.

598
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,254
Other than the dead ends, I guess it all worked out.

599
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:51,555
There were no major bugs found in the game.

600
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:55,496
This was long before the days of being able to treat paying

601
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:59,437
customers as beta testers and just patch the game as you go.

602
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:04,159
So we're getting to the end of the Get project, and Lucasfilm

603
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:08,000
was responsible not only for the game, but also for the box and

604
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,560
the marketing for Maniac Mansion.

605
00:31:09,957 --> 00:31:13,319
This was the first game that Lucasfilm self-published. The

606
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,142
games they did before this were published by other companies,

607
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:20,365
like Atari or Activision or other companies that aren't even

608
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:23,488
in business anymore. So this whole thing was very, very new

609
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:33,035
to us. Now one of the things we need is cover art. And Gary

610
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:36,658
knows this artist named Ken Macklin, so he's contracted to

611
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:38,179
paint the cover of the box.

612
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:41,859
And Lucasfilm had just hired somebody to do marketing for

613
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:45,842
their games, who looks a lot like Mark Eater, I might add.

614
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:51,185
Absolutely no coincidence there. But part of Mark Eater's

615
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:54,807
job includes doing the copy for the box. So Gary and I threw

616
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,789
out a bunch of ideas that we had, and one of them involved

617
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,051
putting this a story of, followed by just a whole long

618
00:32:01,071 --> 00:32:04,293
list of funny things. This was another idea that would come

619
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,054
back to bite us.

620
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:09,071
Now, another great thing about the games from the 80s and 90s

621
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,833
were all the cool things that you got in the box besides just

622
00:32:11,873 --> 00:32:12,594
the floppy disk.

623
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:16,197
And Gary and I made this mock-up of a bulletin board

624
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:18,779
that appears in the college dorm where the kids that

625
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,899
go into the mansion live.

626
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,482
And it's filled with lots of in-jokes.

627
00:32:22,862 --> 00:32:24,483
There's the town that I grew up in.

628
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:27,546
Plus, there's a lot of back stories being told on this.

629
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:31,129
And there's hints to puzzles, like how the radioactive water

630
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,289
will make a plant grow.

631
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,611
So this thing is just filled with lots of really, really

632
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:35,572
cool information.

633
00:32:36,795 --> 00:32:38,877
And also, Gary and I made all this stuff.

634
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:42,940
So if you're ever looking to get my handwriting sampled for

635
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:44,722
something, you just copy it off of here.

636
00:32:44,782 --> 00:32:45,943
It's no problem whatsoever.

637
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,086
Now, the original Maniac Mansion, OK, so the box is

638
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:50,747
finished, right?

639
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,548
And we have this professionally written back of

640
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:53,349
the box copy.

641
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:54,870
And the game is finally done.

642
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:58,634
Now, the original Maniac Mansion fit on two sides of a

643
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:01,736
Commodore 64 disk, with each side holding 160K.

644
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:07,190
So the entire game fit in 320K.

645
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:12,353
Now, a few years later, while doing Monkey Island, we had

646
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:15,454
this little celebration when Steve Purcell did a single

647
00:33:15,614 --> 00:33:18,015
animation that was 380K.

648
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:21,697
So this one animation in Monkey Island is larger than

649
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:24,058
the entire game of Maniac Mansion.

650
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:27,460
In the sequel to Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle,

651
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,501
you can actually play the original Maniac Mansion on a

652
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,982
computer in Weird Ed's bedroom.

653
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,661
So the game goes off to be manufactured.

654
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:37,102
We're very tired.

655
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:39,342
We're very happy to finally be done with this.

656
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:44,384
Now, one of the places the game is being sold is Toys R Us,

657
00:33:44,585 --> 00:33:46,025
in addition to computer stores.

658
00:33:46,545 --> 00:33:48,586
They're becoming a big seller of games.

659
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:50,047
And it's one of the ways that games

660
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:52,328
are starting to work their way into the mass market.

661
00:33:53,288 --> 00:33:55,229
They are very, very important to us.

662
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:58,530
Now, after a few weeks, Toys R Us

663
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,691
pulls Maniac Mansion from their shelves.

664
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:06,987
because of offensive content. This is our largest reseller and

665
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:10,588
they are no longer selling Maniac Mansion. So what is this

666
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:14,969
offensive content? Is Razor's dress too short? Did they

667
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:18,790
discover the exploding hamster in the microwave gag? No.

668
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:23,651
Apparently a customer wrote Toys R Us a rather nasty letter

669
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:27,532
complaining that she didn't think it was appropriate for a

670
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:31,693
game to have, are you ready for this, the word lust.

671
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:37,203
on the back of the box. So that long list of words that Gary

672
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:43,886
and I came up with, she included lust, became offensive. Now,

673
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:47,027
mind you, I don't think she even played the game. She probably

674
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:49,908
didn't even own a computer. She probably just saw the box on the

675
00:34:49,948 --> 00:34:55,090
shelf and she wrote this letter. So Lucasfilm redesigned the back

676
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,452
of the Maniac Mansion box, removing the offensive word in

677
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,032
the process.

678
00:34:59,906 --> 00:35:02,467
Now, Maniac Mansion was then ported to the Apple II.

679
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,768
And a few months later, Gary would redo all the graphics

680
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:08,888
in high res, which at the time meant a mind-blowing 640 by 480.

681
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:12,389
Then we gained some extra vertical pixels,

682
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:15,250
so we had room for two lines of text at the top of the screen.

683
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,831
Maniac Mansion was then ported to the Atari ST,

684
00:35:19,091 --> 00:35:20,272
and the Amiga, and the Mac.

685
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:23,313
It was also ported to the Nintendo NES.

686
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:26,193
Now, the NES version of Maniac Mansion

687
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:28,634
had to go through Nintendo's approval process.

688
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:32,575
And it became heavily censored on things like renaming some of

689
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:37,719
the in-game arcade machines like Kill Thrill. There was this

690
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:41,362
statue depicting the horrors of nudity that had to be removed.

691
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:46,045
There was this poster showing other nudity that had to be

692
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:50,709
removed. But I think my favorite thing that Nintendo censored in

693
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:55,213
the game was in the credits for the game. It says NES scum

694
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:58,575
system buy. And then it listed the people who worked on it.

695
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:03,118
And Nintendo was confused why we were referring to their NES

696
00:36:03,178 --> 00:36:11,020
system as scum. Why would we insult their console machine

697
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,700
like that? We tried to explain to them that it was just the

698
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,541
name of our development system, but in the end we just shook

699
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:20,981
our heads and we just removed it. Oddly enough, Nintendo had

700
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:25,722
no problem with putting a hamster in a microwave. Now,

701
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:28,163
one of the great things about the scum system was it was so

702
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:28,823
easy to port.

703
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:31,875
The game code, or the code that drives the logic of the game,

704
00:36:31,935 --> 00:36:33,416
didn't change from port to port.

705
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:35,117
And if it did, it was very, very slight.

706
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:38,639
And this allowed Maniac Mansion and all future SCUM games

707
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,461
to be ported to a wide variety of platforms.

708
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:45,464
And now, thanks to the SCUM VM project, which

709
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:49,466
is a fan-driven project, most of the SCUM-based adventure games

710
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:51,548
have been ported to platforms that hadn't even

711
00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:55,310
been invented yet, all while running the exact same code

712
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,291
that the originals did.

713
00:36:57,086 --> 00:36:59,727
Now, Maniac Mansion was one of the first games to use the SCUM

714
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,908
engine, but it was far from the last. The next game that was

715
00:37:02,948 --> 00:37:07,630
built in SCUM was Zack McCracken. It was followed by

716
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,132
Loom, an Indiana Jones adventure game, and then Monkey Island 1

717
00:37:11,352 --> 00:37:15,873
and 2, and The Dig, Salmon Max, the sequel to Maniac Mansion,

718
00:37:16,054 --> 00:37:19,175
Day of the Tentacle, and Full Throttle. Now, after I left

719
00:37:19,255 --> 00:37:22,136
LucasArts, as they were now called, I started a company

720
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:23,477
called Humongous Entertainment.

721
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:27,514
And we continued to use the SCUM system to make adventure

722
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:30,796
games for kids, like Putt-Putt and Freddy Fish and Pajama Sam.

723
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,878
The SCUM system even powered our entire line of backyard sports

724
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:43,363
games, like backyard baseball, football, and soccer. Now, a lot

725
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:46,905
of lessons were learned in making Maniac Mansion. The dead

726
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,987
ends and the deaths would all but disappear by the time Monkey

727
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:50,848
Island came around.

728
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:53,187
Puzzle structure would get refined,

729
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,147
and we now had rules and guidelines

730
00:37:55,187 --> 00:37:58,148
for what made a good puzzle and how players should discover

731
00:37:58,228 --> 00:37:59,528
problems and solutions.

732
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:02,889
Replacing the convoluted mess of the map

733
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:04,769
that Gary and I had for Maniac Mansion

734
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:07,650
with these well-structured puzzle dependency graphs,

735
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,290
where you could look at the entire flow of the design

736
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,390
in a single glance.

737
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:14,551
Now, it's really easy to look back

738
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,652
at games like Maniac Mansion or any of the classic games

739
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:20,652
presented this year through this lens of nostalgia.

740
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,986
It's easy to look at what they became and really make

741
00:38:24,026 --> 00:38:26,766
assumptions about what they were before they were anything.

742
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:29,707
But for us, Maniac Mansion was just a game.

743
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:32,688
It was a game that we spent many long months and late

744
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,608
nights and seemingly endless weekends working on.

745
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,008
And we loved it.

746
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:38,289
We hated it.

747
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:41,689
And our only dream for it was we really wouldn't run the

748
00:38:41,749 --> 00:38:42,750
company out of business.

749
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,530
When Gary and I started making Maniac Mansion, we had a

750
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,711
bunch of fun ideas.

751
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:49,571
But we didn't have a vision for the future.

752
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:52,911
We were not out to change the face of graphic adventures.

753
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:55,653
We just wanted to make a game and not get fired.

754
00:38:57,394 --> 00:39:00,096
And I think if there's anything to learn from this talk,

755
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,738
I think it's that we had no idea what we were doing.

756
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:05,379
None whatsoever.

757
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:08,922
And I think that's an important lesson.

758
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:12,264
Because sometimes you just need to do things.

759
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:15,986
And sometimes thinking too much and knowing too much

760
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:18,288
can sometimes hurt more than it can help.

761
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,262
because sometimes I think it really is important to just be

762
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:26,164
too stupid to know that it can't be done. Anyway, thank you very

763
00:39:26,204 --> 00:39:41,514
much. I think we have some time for some questions, so if

764
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:44,316
anybody has any questions, I am happy to answer them.

765
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:53,471
So game development has changed a lot since the 80s and I was

766
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:56,692
wondering how long did Manic Mansion take to make and on a

767
00:39:56,732 --> 00:39:59,113
typical day how many hours did you guys spend working on the

768
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:02,754
game before you went home? It took about two years to make the

769
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:06,195
game from beginning to end. A lot of that first year was just

770
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:11,677
getting the scum system working. And we worked a lot of hours. I

771
00:40:11,697 --> 00:40:15,898
probably worked 12 hours a day and kind of at the core of the

772
00:40:15,938 --> 00:40:17,639
thing we were working seven days a week.

773
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,310
It really was a grueling, grueling project to get done.

774
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:25,352
OK, thanks.

775
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,494
Thank you for that amazing talk.

776
00:40:28,614 --> 00:40:32,676
I completely agree that sometimes not

777
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:35,337
knowing what you're doing can result in great innovation.

778
00:40:35,378 --> 00:40:38,299
And the fact that you guys hadn't made adventure games

779
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:41,781
and then came to adventure games clearly turned out great.

780
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:43,982
But obviously, a lot of the time,

781
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:45,303
people who don't know what they're doing,

782
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:50,095
don't create great things at all, they just create crap.

783
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,757
So I wondered if you had any insight

784
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:57,058
into what you think it was about you guys that

785
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:58,739
meant you could come to adventure games

786
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:00,960
and do something really great, rather than just come and make

787
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,020
a really bad adventure game.

788
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,142
Well, a lot of that I really credit to the early Lucasfilm

789
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:06,902
games group.

790
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:08,623
It was a very small group of people.

791
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:10,784
When I started, there were seven people in the group.

792
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:13,445
And by the time Maniac Mansion was really going,

793
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:14,205
there were maybe 10 or 11 people.

794
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:22,215
And it was a really very tight-knit group of some of the smartest people that I have ever worked with.

795
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:26,459
And we had this very open, free flow of ideas.

796
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:31,764
And we did a lot of things where we did these little one-page design concepts.

797
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:36,709
And we'd write these things and we'd pass them around the office and everybody would comment on them.

798
00:41:37,136 --> 00:41:40,417
And it was just an interesting environment to be a part of.

799
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:43,978
And a lot of that, I think a lot of what you see in those

800
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:48,199
early Lucasfilm games really came from that environment.

801
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:52,020
And I credit that a lot for what Maniac Mansion became.

802
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,841
Because it really wasn't just Gary and I sitting by

803
00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:56,381
ourselves figuring everything out.

804
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:59,222
It was this highly intelligent group of people that were

805
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:02,583
constantly challenging us on every single thing that we

806
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:02,803
did.

807
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:11,870
the start about the problems you had with King's Quest. I guess

808
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,131
you may have noticed that's coming back. I just wanted to

809
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:17,972
know what your thoughts were on that. And also, perhaps you

810
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:20,594
could talk a little bit about your thoughts on the future of

811
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:24,535
Maniac Mansion with all of these old properties coming back

812
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:24,755
again.

813
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:28,617
Yeah, when I, you know, when I played King's Quest, I really

814
00:42:28,637 --> 00:42:31,398
did not like the parser. It really turned me off to the

815
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:32,219
game a lot.

816
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:36,677
was one of the reasons that I did the whole point and click

817
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:42,058
thing for Maniac Mansion. Back at Lucasfilm we had a big rivalry

818
00:42:42,118 --> 00:42:45,479
with Sierra Online because they always sold more copies than us.

819
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:48,540
Every game we did they always sold more copies than we did. We

820
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,601
were always in second place with them. So there was this kind of

821
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:56,501
almost friendly rivalry in a way that we had with them. What was

822
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,582
the second part of your question?

823
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,261
Oh, the future. Yeah, you know, I don't know. I mean, I don't

824
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:06,662
work at LucasArts right now. I would love for them to

825
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:09,963
re-release Maniac Mansion the same way that they did with the

826
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:13,404
Monkey Island games. I think that would be really neat. I've

827
00:43:13,564 --> 00:43:17,105
often thought that it might be fun to go through the game and

828
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:19,266
fix a lot of these problems that I mentioned.

829
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:24,165
to get the puzzle structure and everything more like we had done

830
00:43:24,225 --> 00:43:27,066
in Monkey Island. But other times I think, well, do I

831
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:30,108
really want to do that? Maybe the game really needs to have

832
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:33,190
those flaws in it. Isn't that a little bit like George Lucas

833
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,672
going back and fixing all the problems with Star Wars? So

834
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:41,254
maybe the game really does just need to be what it actually was

835
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:44,315
back then. But I would love to see them re-release Maniac

836
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:44,655
Mansion.

837
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:48,749
I just wanted to thank you for the game.

838
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:51,212
And it sounds like it was an amazing development process

839
00:43:51,872 --> 00:43:52,713
with lots of challenges.

840
00:43:52,974 --> 00:43:54,275
And I was just wondering if you'd

841
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:57,138
be willing to recognize the name of that one tester you had,

842
00:43:57,158 --> 00:43:59,681
who's in that back room just slaving away and trying

843
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:02,224
to provide the best sort of feedback

844
00:44:02,244 --> 00:44:03,625
he could to make a great game.

845
00:44:03,985 --> 00:44:05,187
His first name was Tim.

846
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,209
And I don't remember his last name.

847
00:44:18,852 --> 00:44:19,613
Any other questions?

848
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:24,535
So actually this is a question more about humongous than about

849
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:30,277
maniac mansion. Software for kids. What's happening with

850
00:44:30,317 --> 00:44:34,459
that and why did you stop doing humongous and stuff like that?

851
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,721
Well I think software for kids is kind of in a sorry state in

852
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:39,221
some ways.

853
00:44:41,004 --> 00:44:45,067
What I wanted to do with Humongous Entertainment was really just make adventure games for kids,

854
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:50,490
not educational stuff, not things that taught kids how to read or write or curriculum.

855
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:54,532
I just wanted to do adventure games, because adventure games are about puzzle solving.

856
00:44:54,552 --> 00:44:56,614
They're about thinking your way through things.

857
00:44:56,674 --> 00:45:01,216
And I thought that those are really important things for kids to be able to know.

858
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:04,979
And so we very purposely did not make our games educational.

859
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:07,600
We just made them really, really good adventure games.

860
00:45:08,811 --> 00:45:11,814
for kids. So, yeah, I mean, I would like to see some stuff

861
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:16,498
like that, you know, come around again. But really what happened

862
00:45:16,618 --> 00:45:21,142
to Humongous is that as games became a lot more popular,

863
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:25,425
licenses just took over. It was all about Disney product. It was

864
00:45:25,485 --> 00:45:29,789
all about Pixar product. It was all about Nickelodeon stuff. And

865
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:33,372
you know, they had these $300 million commercials they were

866
00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:34,893
running on television every day.

867
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,164
and it was just very, very hard to compete with that at some

868
00:45:38,184 --> 00:45:45,629
level. Thank you. So when I hear and read about the environment

869
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:48,111
at LucasArts at the time, it reminds me a lot of the

870
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:51,713
environment when they were making Looney Tunes way the hell

871
00:45:51,753 --> 00:45:56,817
back, which is a creative pool of people being funded by a rich

872
00:45:56,857 --> 00:46:00,119
guy who's smart enough to just leave them alone and let them

873
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:00,780
do their thing.

874
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:05,138
And I'm wondering if you think that's an environment that we

875
00:46:05,178 --> 00:46:07,519
will ever see again in video game development.

876
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:10,300
Yeah, it would really be nice to see that.

877
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,040
It really would.

878
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:15,282
And when I started working at Lucasfilm, George Lucas told

879
00:46:15,362 --> 00:46:16,302
us three things.

880
00:46:16,403 --> 00:46:20,504
He said, stay small, be the best, and don't lose any money.

881
00:46:21,184 --> 00:46:23,225
And that was really all that he told us to do.

882
00:46:23,966 --> 00:46:29,028
And the other thing that was a huge boon to us back then was

883
00:46:29,188 --> 00:46:31,148
that we couldn't make Star Wars games.

884
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,183
because Lucasfilm had licensed that to other game companies.

885
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:39,046
So here we were working at Lucasfilm,

886
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:41,087
and we couldn't make Star Wars games.

887
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:44,250
And we really wanted to, but I think what that really did

888
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:46,171
was it opened it up for us.

889
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:48,893
Because now we had to create our own IP.

890
00:46:48,913 --> 00:46:51,395
We had to create our own ideas and our own games.

891
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,037
And that was a big benefit for us,

892
00:46:54,197 --> 00:46:55,958
not being able to make Star Wars games.

893
00:46:57,419 --> 00:46:57,680
Thank you.

894
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:01,683
Hi, you make Death's Bank.

895
00:47:02,497 --> 00:47:05,358
and it was an action game with adventure elements. Do you

896
00:47:05,378 --> 00:47:09,119
think that the graphic adventure game is truly dead or do you

897
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:12,700
think that it will, you know, in its purest sense, do you think

898
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,001
it will experience a resurgence and be popular again?

899
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:18,862
I would certainly like to think that there is. And I guess my

900
00:47:18,942 --> 00:47:22,964
hope for that is that as the market expands and the games

901
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:27,225
start to attract a much broader range of people, that adventure

902
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:30,326
games will kind of make a comeback. And adventure games

903
00:47:30,366 --> 00:47:31,666
are kind of odd because...

904
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:36,502
Adventure games, to me, it's like the magic of an adventure

905
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:40,664
game is staring at the screen, wondering what to do next.

906
00:47:41,364 --> 00:47:43,385
It's that quiet contemplation.

907
00:47:44,245 --> 00:47:47,246
And a lot of games today, it's really not about that.

908
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:49,787
And I think a lot of gamers have very short attention

909
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:50,207
spans.

910
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:53,669
They need tutorials to move them through things.

911
00:47:55,989 --> 00:47:58,770
What they want to do is they want to know where to go, and

912
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,011
they want to know what to do, and then they want to get

913
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:01,812
really good at that.

914
00:48:02,415 --> 00:48:05,118
And adventure games are about not knowing where to go,

915
00:48:05,438 --> 00:48:07,640
not knowing what to do, and figuring it out.

916
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,841
And I think there's just a conflict there.

917
00:48:09,901 --> 00:48:12,123
But my hope is that as the market grows,

918
00:48:12,143 --> 00:48:15,085
because there certainly are a lot of adventure game fans.

919
00:48:15,366 --> 00:48:17,267
We were selling more adventure games today

920
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:20,129
than we were selling back in the LucasArts days.

921
00:48:20,169 --> 00:48:20,830
We really are.

922
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,192
It's just that the other part of the market

923
00:48:23,352 --> 00:48:26,655
grew so much faster that it just really dwarfed

924
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:27,655
what adventure games were.

925
00:48:29,828 --> 00:48:33,110
Back when you started doing this, a huge part of your job

926
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,111
was dealing with scum in the game industry.

927
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:35,851
I'm just kidding.

928
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,273
Dealing with a scripting language.

929
00:48:38,513 --> 00:48:40,534
And back then, you pretty much didn't have a choice.

930
00:48:40,574 --> 00:48:41,054
You needed to.

931
00:48:41,494 --> 00:48:45,837
How do you feel about scripting languages now with the more

932
00:48:45,897 --> 00:48:48,078
modern programming languages and the need and use

933
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:48,838
and limitations?

934
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,320
I think scripting languages are great.

935
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,021
I think they're the perfect way to build things.

936
00:48:54,562 --> 00:48:57,983
If you're building games in languages like C or C++,

937
00:48:59,484 --> 00:49:02,365
It's very, very hard to rapidly iterate with those things.

938
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:06,448
And scripting language provides this wonderful abstraction

939
00:49:06,468 --> 00:49:06,728
layer.

940
00:49:07,289 --> 00:49:09,690
In all of Death's Bank, that entire game

941
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,932
was all done in a scripting language that I created,

942
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,673
very, very much like Scum.

943
00:49:15,394 --> 00:49:16,895
So there was the core engine, which

944
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:19,697
ran the 3D graphics and the world and everything.

945
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:21,978
But every single piece of logic for that game

946
00:49:21,998 --> 00:49:23,559
was all done in a scripting language.

947
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,761
So I think scripting languages are huge and I think we should

948
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:29,542
always be using them because of that rapid prototyping they

949
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:34,283
allow. Just last, thanks for writing something that inspired

950
00:49:34,323 --> 00:49:37,564
me to get into this industry. I'm sorry.

951
00:49:37,584 --> 00:49:50,389
Hi. Do you have any advice for us other adventure game

952
00:49:50,409 --> 00:49:51,329
developers out there?

953
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,180
Advice for adventure game developers.

954
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,981
Well, I think that adventure games right now, as I said

955
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,901
earlier, that it's a niche market.

956
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:01,642
It's not the huge mainstream that you're

957
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:02,602
seeing with other things.

958
00:50:03,062 --> 00:50:06,423
And so the key to doing that is that you can do quite well

959
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:07,503
in a niche market.

960
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:10,304
There's nothing that says you can't sell a good number of

961
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:11,444
games in a niche market.

962
00:50:11,805 --> 00:50:14,005
But I think it's about identifying that niche.

963
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:16,726
It's coming up with something that's very unique and

964
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:18,806
interesting that will really spark their

965
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:20,207
imagination with things.

966
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:22,287
And it's also advancing stuff.

967
00:50:22,808 --> 00:50:26,970
A lot of people build fan-based point-and-click adventures

968
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:27,410
today.

969
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,371
But I think we need to take adventures beyond that

970
00:50:30,451 --> 00:50:31,211
in some ways.

971
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:35,273
And games like Limbo are actually, to me,

972
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:39,875
a very interesting look at maybe where adventure games could go.

973
00:50:39,895 --> 00:50:43,056
Because there's a lot of incredibly brilliant things

974
00:50:43,136 --> 00:50:43,696
in Limbo.

975
00:50:43,796 --> 00:50:46,877
And I looked at that game, and it floored me when I played it.

976
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:48,198
But it's very linear.

977
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,380
you know, so what, you know, is there a way to take a lot of

978
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,741
that and open that up a little bit? But people were in, you

979
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:59,222
know, enjoyed limbo a lot. So, you know, it's looking at things

980
00:50:59,262 --> 00:51:00,422
like that I think are the key.

981
00:51:01,282 --> 00:51:04,023
Thanks. And I want to join the guy saying the same thing about

982
00:51:04,463 --> 00:51:06,243
you being the reason I'm in the game.

983
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:08,703
Making me feel bad.

984
00:51:12,104 --> 00:51:16,225
Hi. So I was wondering if you could give insight.

985
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:17,365
Where is that voice coming from?

986
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:21,375
I was wondering if you could give some insight, even if it

987
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:24,556
was only an opinion on the Maniac Mansion TV show.

988
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:29,718
Yeah, you know, I totally forgot about the Maniac Mansion TV

989
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:33,699
show. That was really an interesting thing because there

990
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:36,520
were a couple of people at Lucasfilm and it was their job

991
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,541
to start creating television shows. We had Maniac Mansion and

992
00:51:40,561 --> 00:51:43,763
it was a license that we completely owned. So they first

993
00:51:43,803 --> 00:51:47,284
did that. Gary and I were thrilled to have a TV show

994
00:51:47,364 --> 00:51:48,104
based on our game.

995
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:52,358
And every week we would get these memos from the production people.

996
00:51:52,598 --> 00:51:55,541
And every week they would change one thing about our game.

997
00:51:56,242 --> 00:52:01,447
And it just became this joke after a while, as one thing after another was changed.

998
00:52:01,507 --> 00:52:05,751
And I mean, I've seen like two episodes of the TV show,

999
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:09,394
and I think they kept, what, Dr. Fred?

1000
00:52:10,035 --> 00:52:13,298
I think he's like maybe the only remaining thing from the TV show.

1001
00:52:14,954 --> 00:52:18,016
But it was an interesting process. We were really

1002
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:20,618
thrilled to see it. But I wish it had been more like the

1003
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:21,538
actual game, though.

1004
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:22,379
Thank you.

1005
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,863
Hi. So since you were at the forefront of the whole point

1006
00:52:28,883 --> 00:52:31,644
and click adventure games, I was wondering if you could talk a

1007
00:52:31,664 --> 00:52:36,007
bit about some of the more interesting steps in games that

1008
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,709
you've seen in, like, you know, game interfaces and stuff,

1009
00:52:38,729 --> 00:52:39,849
particularly adventure games.

1010
00:52:40,668 --> 00:52:42,789
beyond that that you've seen throughout your career?

1011
00:52:43,069 --> 00:52:46,250
What's really kind of stuck out to you as the most

1012
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,171
interesting advances?

1013
00:52:48,271 --> 00:52:50,992
Well, you know, adventure games started with the parser.

1014
00:52:51,552 --> 00:52:54,853
And when Gary and I decided that we were going to do the

1015
00:52:54,893 --> 00:52:58,514
verbs to be point and click, our original verb list was

1016
00:52:58,574 --> 00:52:59,835
about 40 different verbs.

1017
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:02,616
It was not the 12 that you see up on the screen there.

1018
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:03,836
It was 40 of these things.

1019
00:53:04,492 --> 00:53:08,054
And we slowly pared that down to what we thought was the bare

1020
00:53:08,154 --> 00:53:10,975
minimum of verbs that we could have on the thing.

1021
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,317
But as games went on, you know, Monkey Island has less verbs

1022
00:53:14,377 --> 00:53:15,678
than Maniac Mansion has.

1023
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:19,260
And eventually, you know, Adventure Games was whittled

1024
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,401
down to one verb, which is the use verb.

1025
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:24,783
And so to me, that's kind of an interesting progression.

1026
00:53:24,903 --> 00:53:28,345
And when Maniac Mansion came out, if we had had just a

1027
00:53:28,425 --> 00:53:31,967
single use verb, which you easily could have done, people

1028
00:53:31,987 --> 00:53:32,728
would have screamed.

1029
00:53:33,148 --> 00:53:34,028
They wouldn't have liked that.

1030
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:38,676
So I think it's a slow progression of things with

1031
00:53:39,057 --> 00:53:43,119
changing the interfaces and simplifying things down and

1032
00:53:43,299 --> 00:53:45,901
making things a lot easier for players with interfaces.

1033
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:52,786
Coming off of games like Kuranos Rift and Eidolon, what

1034
00:53:52,926 --> 00:53:56,288
lessons did you guys bring with you onto Maniac Mansion?

1035
00:53:56,308 --> 00:54:00,311
I mean, obviously you couldn't confuse one of those games for

1036
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:03,053
the other, but there were certainly big puzzle elements

1037
00:54:03,113 --> 00:54:04,173
in games like Eidolon.

1038
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:06,547
What was the question?

1039
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:10,469
What lessons did you guys bring coming off of the games you

1040
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,870
worked on before Maniac Mansion?

1041
00:54:18,493 --> 00:54:18,893
I don't know.

1042
00:54:19,313 --> 00:54:20,854
That's a good question.

1043
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:23,696
We did the Eidolon, and before that, there

1044
00:54:23,756 --> 00:54:28,278
was the Labyrinth game, which was based on the Jim Henson

1045
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:28,678
movie.

1046
00:54:29,018 --> 00:54:31,560
And that was really kind of a first step

1047
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,941
into getting rid of a parser.

1048
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:40,897
it had these wheels that you turned, where you kind of lined up verbs with nouns.

1049
00:54:41,557 --> 00:54:46,659
And so we did learn a lot from that game and what that was doing with things.

1050
00:54:46,759 --> 00:54:53,042
But I think just one of the big things that we were always very conscious of was just kind of how you tell stories.

1051
00:54:53,242 --> 00:54:55,222
And that was a part of that core group.

1052
00:54:55,242 --> 00:54:59,824
We were always very, very fascinated with storytelling and storytelling in games.

1053
00:55:00,534 --> 00:55:03,575
And even something like Cronus Rift, which is kind of a

1054
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:06,437
shooter-type game, there's still a big story there.

1055
00:55:06,477 --> 00:55:08,938
And that was a very important part of that to us.

1056
00:55:08,978 --> 00:55:11,599
So I think the storytelling was a very strong element.

1057
00:55:14,821 --> 00:55:16,702
Telltale's doing a lot with episodic games.

1058
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:18,043
How do you feel about that?

1059
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:19,643
Telltale's doing what?

1060
00:55:20,064 --> 00:55:20,924
Episodic games.

1061
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:22,785
I think episodic games are great.

1062
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:26,787
I wish they were a lot more popular than they were.

1063
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:32,790
I think episodic games kind of allow you to tell these very

1064
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,572
bite-sized things to people.

1065
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:37,074
And there are a lot of gamers that

1066
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:39,976
like to sit down and play 30, 40-hour games.

1067
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,058
But there's a lot more people, I think,

1068
00:55:42,098 --> 00:55:45,241
that would be into gaming if they could sit down and spend

1069
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:48,284
two hours playing a game, and they could actually finish it

1070
00:55:48,784 --> 00:55:50,386
and feel successful at that.

1071
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,342
And episodic games, I think, is a good avenue towards that

1072
00:55:54,382 --> 00:55:58,244
stuff. So I wish Telltale all the success in the world with

1073
00:55:58,284 --> 00:55:59,064
episodic gaming.

1074
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:05,107
I was wondering what your thoughts were on how to maybe

1075
00:56:05,147 --> 00:56:07,609
make adventure games more than just single play through

1076
00:56:07,669 --> 00:56:12,811
affairs, as far as keeping their lifespan to more than

1077
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:15,953
just whatever it takes to finish them one time.

1078
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:19,815
I think doing things like multiple endings with stuff.

1079
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:22,682
with Maniac Mansion, you could play the game once,

1080
00:56:22,822 --> 00:56:24,883
but there were five different endings to that game,

1081
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,144
so you could then go back and play it again.

1082
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,724
Doing some things like that with games

1083
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:30,865
could be very interesting.

1084
00:56:30,905 --> 00:56:33,386
And one of the things about an interactive story

1085
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:37,867
versus a linear story is that in a best case,

1086
00:56:38,227 --> 00:56:43,028
it allows the player to explore the story a little bit more.

1087
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:46,348
And I'd like to see games where you can get through them very

1088
00:56:46,428 --> 00:56:50,549
quickly in just a couple of hours, but you can then go back

1089
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:51,509
and play it again.

1090
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:53,669
And not just for multiple endings, but that you can

1091
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:54,729
really explore.

1092
00:56:54,769 --> 00:56:57,290
That you can explore the characters, you can explore

1093
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,510
the situation, and really explore the world.

1094
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,991
Because if people can get lost in a world like that, just

1095
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:05,872
playing things over and over, I think that's a good thing.

1096
00:57:05,892 --> 00:57:09,632
Thank you.

1097
00:57:12,439 --> 00:57:14,480
sort of did wrong and didn't really know about when you're

1098
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,101
doing maniac mansion. I was wondering how long, what was the

1099
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:20,322
point where you sort of realized all the mistakes you made and

1100
00:57:20,342 --> 00:57:21,203
all the things you didn't know?

1101
00:57:21,223 --> 00:57:26,425
It was kind of an ongoing gradual process. Like the thing

1102
00:57:26,465 --> 00:57:31,047
with the seven characters. That sounded great to Gary and I.

1103
00:57:31,087 --> 00:57:35,228
Yeah, seven characters. Woo-hoo, we're geniuses. And then when we

1104
00:57:35,248 --> 00:57:37,909
started doing the programming, and it was really David Fox that

1105
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:40,591
brought a lot of this up because he was really tasked with all

1106
00:57:40,611 --> 00:57:41,391
this programming.

1107
00:57:42,149 --> 00:57:45,672
He would come to us and go, you know, this is like really,

1108
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:46,692
really complicated.

1109
00:57:47,493 --> 00:57:49,054
And we would go through, and we'd

1110
00:57:49,154 --> 00:57:51,396
think we'd have something solved, and we didn't.

1111
00:57:51,496 --> 00:57:53,558
And you know, it's like pulling a thread on a sweater.

1112
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:56,521
It just kind of unravels at some point.

1113
00:57:57,081 --> 00:57:58,983
So it was definitely a slow process

1114
00:57:59,003 --> 00:58:01,525
that we were realizing a lot of the mistakes we'd made.

1115
00:58:05,388 --> 00:58:05,788
Was that it?

1116
00:58:05,808 --> 00:58:07,650
All right, well, thank you.

1117
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,151
Thank you very, very much for coming.

1118
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:09,351
Thank you.
