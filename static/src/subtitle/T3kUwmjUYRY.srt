1
00:00:00,541 --> 00:00:03,842
Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon. If you're on the East Coast, good evening.

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,883
If you are our developer guests, my name is Brian Francis.

3
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:09,944
I am a contributing editor at gamastructure.com.

4
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:13,686
I am a community manager for Game Developers Conference.

5
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:18,945
I am the invisible voice inside your head, but today everyone you hear will be the invisible

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:19,885
voice inside your head.

7
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:22,427
We are here playing GreedFall.

8
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:28,050
This comes from Spiders, which is a Parisian game development studio that I believe was

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,571
recently picked up by Big Ben.

10
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:33,953
I'll correct myself in a minute if it's not that recent.

11
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:42,618
But today, we are checking out GreedFall, which is a party-based RPG from Spiders.

12
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:43,659
Just repeating myself right there.

13
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,542
And I'm joined by some wonderful guests who are unfortunately all invisible.

14
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:53,605
One of those guests is frequent co-host, although I haven't gotten to hang out with her in a bit on this stream,

15
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,626
Alyssa McAloon. Alyssa, how are you doing?

16
00:00:56,226 --> 00:01:00,669
Hi, I'm doing great. Coffee's kicking in, so we are doing wonderful over here.

17
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:09,372
Right on, and then over in the lower left hand corner of the screen, which would be normally where I've just put this nice image of our hero can green ball.

18
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:16,636
I have... so you won't be seeing them, but you will be hearing them, are our two guests, Claire and Sebastian.

19
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:19,577
Claire, how are you doing?

20
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:21,058
Hello! I'm fine.

21
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:24,720
So, it's a good evening in fact for us, because it's 5 o'clock in Paris.

22
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:29,623
And we will go in the stream with you, so...

23
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:39,248
Nice. I really quick Sebastian, could you are you there? Are you still with us? Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. Hello, everybody.

24
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:46,893
There are two guests are let me get their full names up for my own benefit. We have it is clear

25
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:52,297
leisure leisure and Sebastian de Rosa. I hope I said those names. Right. That's Yeah, that's fine.

26
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:57,941
I technically can speak French. Claire, would you please introduce yourself for our guests?

27
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:04,431
Yes, so, hello guys, I am Claire LÃ©ger, I am the game producer on Grid 4.

28
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:09,666
I was joining the company two years ago, during the production of Creed IV.

29
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:17,590
And that's wonderful to see people play our game for one week now.

30
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:26,375
And I hope we can share with you some thoughts about the game and answer your questions.

31
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:29,998
And Sebastian, would you mind introducing yourself as well?

32
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:34,300
Yeah, I'm Sebastian. I'm the game developer manager at Spiders.

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,963
We managed all the game design team and the level and quest design team during the project

34
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:49,226
and we're pretty happy to participate in streaming to answer your questions.

35
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:53,568
Right on, for the folks at home, this is a stream where we talk about how games get made,

36
00:02:53,608 --> 00:03:00,031
we talk about the art and business of making games like Greedfall.

37
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:20,754
I suppose the best place to start off is, would you both mind explaining how the development of GreedFall started and what were your roles in, and what was sort of each of your jobs when Spiders got together and said we're going to make an RPG about exploring a colonial new world in a fantasy setting?

38
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:27,278
So it started like more than three years ago now and we wanted to...

39
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:36,707
We wanted to continue a game based on the foundation from a previous game, Technomancer, which was also an RPG.

40
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:45,530
Regarding all the feedback that we collected from the players, from reviews, etc., we wanted to improve the formula.

41
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:56,873
So we focused on the exploration and we learned to craft a bigger environment to improve that.

42
00:03:57,728 --> 00:04:03,011
Also we wanted to enhance the combat system, but we will talk about this later I think

43
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:10,774
when we will have combat, and to give more predictable and tactical feeling on the fighting

44
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:18,177
systems and we wanted to push the different ways to solve quests that was appreciated

45
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:25,821
on our previous project, but now we wanted to push it further so we started with that

46
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:32,066
We had an ambition regarding all the game design and feeling of the game.

47
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:39,208
And after, we worked on the universe with the art director, cinematic artist and with John

48
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:47,851
to create a new universe that helps to support all the gameplay pillars.

49
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:57,134
So, discovering a new land was a good setting to encourage the exploration for the player.

50
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:00,465
So it started like that, and we went.

51
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:29,510
a better game.

52
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,751
That is to say, we have really focused on the last six months

53
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:41,274
on really all the small settings for level design.

54
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:44,635
And we have made a lot of playtests with our publisher,

55
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:45,775
with Focus Home Interactive,

56
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:52,678
in order to correct some mistakes that we had in the game,

57
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:56,019
especially for combat, the fighting system,

58
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:57,840
also for the tactical pause.

59
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:03,054
which was a big challenge for us to create this tactical pose

60
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:07,075
because it was really new compared to our previous game.

61
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:15,637
Then, we have also changed several times some things in the game

62
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:22,339
concerning the way we travel in the game.

63
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:23,899
For example, we have added some...

64
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:29,989
some points to teleport from one place to another, more points to travel for example.

65
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:35,451
It was something present at the beginning of the development but we have really made some

66
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:42,493
iteration on development with the player community and with playtests to enhance the game experience

67
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:50,495
and also because we are quite a small studio, we are 40 people so it's not big but

68
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:58,672
It's a challenge to do such a big game with such a small team.

69
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:05,376
Also, we have corrected a lot of bugs, more than 3,000 I guess.

70
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:09,439
Also with our publisher, of course.

71
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:21,601
Basically boil down to do we extend development, do we crunch or do we cut features?

72
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:23,723
How does that conversation kind of play out?

73
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:28,347
How do you decide the route that you want to take and how do you kind of work through

74
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:30,229
that complicated issue?

75
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,354
In fact the main idea at Spider is more how can we do a better game?

76
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:46,423
We have talked a lot with our publisher to make difficult decisions sometimes to see

77
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:57,189
what we continue to improve and what we don't, how much time we add to the development, and

78
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,511
is it really necessary to add this development time.

79
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,414
But we had the chance to be able to make a better game without...

80
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:13,342
Not too much constraints concerning a launch date, in fact.

81
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:20,086
We have gone through a stronger iterative process and made a lot of iteration for the

82
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:29,852
fighting system, for example, or for tactical pose and etc. So we focused on iteration on the main

83
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:35,616
content and improving it as much as possible during the development.

84
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:42,214
Just a reminder for folks at home, we are taking your questions in chat.

85
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:49,115
If you have something you'd particularly like to ask Claire and Sebastian, we would love to take your questions.

86
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:55,637
Yes, just concerning the streaming, we just have met Saira.

87
00:08:55,697 --> 00:09:01,198
Saira is your native companion who is with you during the game.

88
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,660
And yes, she will represent you during the game.

89
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:09,216
The native faction, in fact. So the native people.

90
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:45,680
It's similar in that it's a stat-driven RPG, but it's also different in that I think a lot more of these stats influence the way the choices in the game branch out for your character.

91
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:53,806
Would you be able to explain the foundation that Spiders worked on for building this RPG and why it sort of did it that way?

92
00:09:53,826 --> 00:10:04,454
We wanted to give a feeling with stat matters, and we wanted to give more control on random stats, for example.

93
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:14,873
Our previous game was having a critical hit system based on random chances to trigger

94
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:22,400
the critical effect and here we work on a fury bar that gives the player the control

95
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,765
to trigger his fury attack when he wants it.

96
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:30,587
It's one of...

97
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:35,795
The pillars that we put on and also the character development is not class-based.

98
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:53,344
We've got three main presets in the skill tree and we wanted to give the player the free opportunity to specialize himself and to re-specialize and test different builds inside one single run.

99
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:59,828
Also we wanted to have more range of weapons. We've got many different types of weapons.

100
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:11,980
big weapon funnels, and we wanted the player to have a good immersion regarding objects

101
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:19,426
that he can find on enemies, and allows him to use any weapons that human enemies use

102
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:27,413
in the game, for example. We wanted also to give a more tactical feeling with the tactical

103
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:29,595
pose, which allows you to...

104
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:34,526
Displaying all the details on the stats on your attack, etc

105
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:38,488
and in the menus, for example, like

106
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:46,574
In the equipment menu, you can have access to advanced statistics. We wanted to have an accessible game for

107
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:48,435
people who like

108
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:55,500
narrative branching stories, but we wanted also have core mechanical RPGs for

109
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:58,202
people who like more

110
00:11:58,803 --> 00:11:59,783
Dragon Age

111
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:06,829
games or even people who like old school RPGs such as Bargescale for example.

112
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:15,717
With the tactical pause you can play almost as a turn based game for example for a few

113
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:21,962
moments and take the time to analyze the situation and all the stats helps the player to find

114
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:28,008
solution regarding the weaknesses of the enemies with the tactical pause you can analyze.

115
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:35,529
What are the strengths and weaknesses of your targets and adapt your strategy and your tactics

116
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:42,857
regarding that. So we work a lot on that beside our produce games.

117
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:45,845
Yeah, that's actually really interesting.

118
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:47,945
What do you think is the difference between...

119
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:55,268
When game developers go into a game, they often use specific structural restraints, like classes,

120
00:12:55,388 --> 00:13:01,730
like only allowing certain weapons and builds on a run in order to manage the scope of the work

121
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,412
and to manage what combat encounters will feel like and such.

122
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:09,733
How did you accommodate for building a system where you wanted players to have more openness

123
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,294
in the character tree than on your previous games?

124
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:17,380
First, we started with...

125
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,681
The first iteration of the skill tree was very huge.

126
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:27,962
It was more divided, but we worked a lot on the improvement,

127
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:34,184
like every skill point should empower your character.

128
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:39,005
So we decided to focus on a smaller skill tree,

129
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:41,826
but with different type of skill that costs...

130
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:53,425
1 to 3 points. We got active skill that costs 2 points, passive skill that costs 1 point, and ultimate skills that cost 3 points.

131
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:58,166
And that represents the ultimate skill tree of the 3 main archetypes.

132
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:08,188
So at the beginning, we didn't notify the player that we have 3 types of main styles that he can mix up.

133
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:12,369
But we decided to help players to understand that there are...

134
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:26,796
We have three main orientations, but we want to feel the player that he keeps in mind, that he can specialize in different ways at the same time.

135
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:39,364
So we chose to make a skill tree that is more circular, where you start at the center, and regarding how you want to develop it,

136
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:40,524
you can...

137
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:45,308
put your points in different directions.

138
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:55,190
Also, we wanted to have an adventure skill tree, something like that, which, skills that

139
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:58,971
impact the story and your adventure, and not only the combat.

140
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,692
So we worked on talent.

141
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:09,234
It's a system that we started to have on Technomancer, and we pushed it further in that by adding

142
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:11,335
some talent points that allows you to...

143
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:22,302
progress in the levels, for example, to do a balance part on a full tree or to jump across

144
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,586
small holes.

145
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:35,275
And we add also charisma, intuition that you can use on dialogue or to find secret passages

146
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:37,056
on the environment.

147
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:43,931
Right on. We are going to bounce around the world of questions.

148
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:46,613
Alyssa, is there anything you'd like to get in before I move on?

149
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:49,796
I was kind of going to ask, following up on that,

150
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:55,400
when you give players all those different ways to pick up different skill points

151
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,323
and different options to resolve an encounter,

152
00:15:58,343 --> 00:15:59,804
where they can talk their way through something,

153
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:02,686
they can have a secret dialogue thing,

154
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:06,249
how do you kind of manage your quest design

155
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:07,870
and you're designing conversations that...

156
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:15,136
give players plenty of options without making them feel funneled into one specific route

157
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:16,657
for an expansive game like this?

158
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:25,806
It was an iterative process, a lot with playtest and testing your own quests, also regarding

159
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,549
the team testing each other's quests.

160
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,035
It was an hard job for the quest designer.

161
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:40,637
to make the different paths regarding some quests.

162
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:50,862
The most important was to make the player aware that he can do a different path if he has the right skills.

163
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:56,084
Because if all elements are hidden to the player,

164
00:16:57,145 --> 00:17:02,888
the game could have some... give a false vision.

165
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:04,765
of a linear game.

166
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:09,048
For example, on the product that you have played before,

167
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:12,130
or on every quest we put an accent on,

168
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:17,254
showing on the level design

169
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,775
which doors are locked,

170
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:23,158
to make the clues for players

171
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:24,719
like it should have a key,

172
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:30,343
or if I have lockpicking, I can lockpick here.

173
00:17:31,203 --> 00:17:31,964
It's a lot of work.

174
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:35,327
and a balance between level design and quest design.

175
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:43,149
And in the dialogue, you get feedback that you don't have the intuition talent point,

176
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:45,210
for example, it will appear in red.

177
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,311
So, okay, this option is blocked because I don't have the right talent.

178
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:58,574
So maybe I will invest in that talent to find another opportunity to resolve the quest,

179
00:17:58,614 --> 00:17:59,194
for example.

180
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:07,736
Regarding the narrative branching, we work a lot with the writers, Jan and Jan Rousseau

181
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:18,281
also work iteratively with the quest designers to change some elements in quests and we do

182
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:26,245
a lot of iteration during the writing after the first rough quest design.

183
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:32,130
to make it balance on all the games.

184
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,911
Yes, and we have also...

185
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,991
You know, we are using our own engine,

186
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:40,412
so the Seek engine.

187
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:42,632
And for this game, we have also developed

188
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,293
a new nodal system for quests.

189
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,594
So it was really something better

190
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,915
to create multi-branches stories

191
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:55,856
with a visual system.

192
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:02,968
All the systems in Quest Design and the dialogue system are using nodal tools.

193
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:11,234
It allows us to do many different types of branching and to visually work with the branching

194
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:15,917
on the screens to help us to build the different situations.

195
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:22,219
Yeah, and all the complexity in all the situations and relationships between one quest and another.

196
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:30,804
Because there is a main quest, but also there is side quests, companion quests, and quests of factions.

197
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:34,807
And everything is quite interconnected.

198
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:37,348
So of course it was a...

199
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:53,503
A big, really big work for all the team here to connect everything all together and to create a global story, which is, we hope, interesting for the players.

200
00:19:56,082 --> 00:20:00,065
I'm going to jump to our chat real quick before I've got some follow-up questions about that.

201
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:05,429
Statustat, a frequent friend of the show, is hanging out in the Twitch chat.

202
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,293
I'm going to give a brief shout-out to Arcelon20 as well. Thank you both for dropping by the stream today.

203
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,396
Statustat has a lot of great questions. We will probably...

204
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:19,380
We worked a little bit on paper work, but we quickly always

205
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:52,956
try to have a first iteration on our engine to see what it feels or where things can lead.

206
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:58,397
It depends on the different parts.

207
00:20:58,497 --> 00:21:06,239
For example, we got like three iterations around like that of the fighting system, three

208
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,900
big iterations through all the developments regarding quests.

209
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,680
Some quests were...

210
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:18,865
having like one or two iterations, but some quests can have up to eight iterations depending

211
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:27,511
on their position in the game because the middle quest in the game can be really affected

212
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:29,352
by the previous quest, etc.

213
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:38,399
So we had to make a bigger iteration on the middle quest of the game and on the ending

214
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:38,719
also.

215
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:48,433
In fact, sometimes you think that the idea on paper is great, and when you integrate it,

216
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:51,335
it's not so well for the player.

217
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:54,797
And what is important is not to have a good idea on paper,

218
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:57,418
it's to have a good idea for the game experience.

219
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,541
So sometimes we have decided to cut the content.

220
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:06,144
It arrives a few times, but it arrives sometimes.

221
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:08,045
Or simplify the content.

222
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:18,308
Most of the time it was simplifying the content and doing iteration in order to make what

223
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,089
we had in mind really interesting in the game experience.

224
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:27,990
I see that somebody is asking if it takes more time to do some iteration.

225
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:36,792
From my point of view, it takes some time but it's really better to do it like that

226
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:37,653
instead of...

227
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:45,093
creating all the game as it was in the head of only one person,

228
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:53,760
and then at the end, understanding that everything is not so great for the player.

229
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:57,864
So, I think, really, iteration is a good way.

230
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:02,256
working on small details every time.

231
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:08,157
For example, Sebastian was talking about the iteration for the fighting system,

232
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:11,798
but also we have done some iteration on the environment,

233
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:14,779
because some of them were too big,

234
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:17,499
so we have decided to reduce them.

235
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,300
We have also decided to add some small details

236
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,901
in places where it was not planned at the beginning.

237
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:26,561
Always for the same reason,

238
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:27,362
because...

239
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:31,337
We need to make the game experience interesting for players.

240
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:43,021
On my point of view, the only way to do it is to redo one time, two times, three times up to the right results.

241
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:48,702
Different things during iteration can be affected.

242
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:56,545
For example, sometimes iteration on combat system was mostly UI iteration.

243
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,767
more than animation iteration or stuff like that.

244
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:04,911
So, now, during the development,

245
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:17,360
the iteration doesn't focus on the same working type of job.

246
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,103
So, depending on that,

247
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:26,086
we have more iteration that we can count than others.

248
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:35,448
For example, sometimes quest design was affected on how the player was using the local map.

249
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:46,293
So we had to work a lot on our local map UI to make the different paths readable, to make

250
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:51,515
the player understand where he had to go following the quest.

251
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:58,611
I'm going to toss the question ball your way in just a moment, because I'm trying to balance

252
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,454
RPG things and talking to people at the same time, and it's always hard.

253
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:04,738
But there's one really cool feature I wanted to ask about.

254
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,924
Sebastian and Claire, we've seen so far, I've now traveled through two different areas on

255
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:11,306
the way to my quest destination.

256
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:13,348
And in between, the second that the...

257
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:21,110
But the next level began loading, I was popped into a campsite where I could talk to my companions and do inventory management.

258
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,550
There's a merchant here who looks like he wants to help me out.

259
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,451
This is really cool. I've never seen a game sort of skip past, instead of using a loading screen,

260
00:25:31,452 --> 00:25:35,733
give you kind of an option to just sort of hang about your base and do stuff while the level loaded.

261
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:37,313
What did it take to implement that?

262
00:25:37,393 --> 00:25:41,134
Or maybe I've seen examples like it, but I certainly haven't seen it in an RPG like this.

263
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:47,822
So, do we have a specific question on that?

264
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:54,004
Yeah, where did you come up with the idea and how were you able to make it so that you could access CAM?

265
00:25:54,224 --> 00:26:02,847
In the previous game, Technomancer, we were having some dialogue cutscenes when you travel from location to others.

266
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:10,990
Using that system, while we were loading, we were having some cutscenes dialogue with choices, etc.

267
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:21,653
It was like we wanted a game where you explore different locations and go and come back from

268
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:27,475
different locations to others to report stuff to continue your journey.

269
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:36,399
It was like we had some kind of constraint with loading so we have the idea that let's

270
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:43,142
make this constraint a strength because we are able to load a little area.

271
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:47,964
during the loading.

272
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:59,406
So we have that idea that many RPG players have to make some rest scenes to manage their

273
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:05,748
inventory, to upgrade their character, talk to our companions, etc.

274
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,408
And we thought that it was a good idea to take that.

275
00:27:11,594 --> 00:27:19,777
to the loading screen to help the players to manage, upgrade their characters

276
00:27:19,797 --> 00:27:29,122
and to have all the static RPG adventure gameplay inside that loading screen.

277
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:34,524
The idea came up like that, and we were having a small break

278
00:27:34,544 --> 00:27:39,767
that helped us push further to allow the players to move around.

279
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:45,823
And this is how the game comes into the game.

280
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:51,784
Basically, you have a merchant, you have your storing crate,

281
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,544
and you have your companion.

282
00:27:54,584 --> 00:28:00,685
You can trigger side quests involving your relationship with them.

283
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:07,367
Also, we can see we have a home in every town, that is similar to that.

284
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:09,547
And also, we wanted to...

285
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:17,547
Make a relation with all the fire cams that you can find in the game to set up shortcuts

286
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:20,329
on all the different areas.

287
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:28,754
So this is how all cams come from the fire cam and the loading system.

288
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:30,215
Right on.

289
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:31,656
I'm Claire.

290
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:34,618
Before we move on from this topic, was there anything about implementing a system like

291
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:37,980
that that was different than how other games you've worked on?

292
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:52,979
Not really, in fact, loading is always a moment where we need to keep the player involved in

293
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:59,102
the game and having this area is a really big, is an interesting idea because you have

294
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:00,222
something to do here.

295
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:06,746
But concerning the development, it is also a challenge because it's loading, so we don't

296
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:11,148
need to have time to load this area in more of loading the...

297
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:21,388
So it has to be really light and interesting for players.

298
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:30,494
The main idea was to put there some action which takes time and will be useful for the player,

299
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:38,900
like walking on your stuff or talking to a merchant.

300
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:48,205
It was easy to do and not too hard to produce, in fact, and light to load.

301
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,941
build it from the ground up for...

302
00:30:09,261 --> 00:30:13,983
It's the same engine that I've built since more than 10 years now.

303
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,003
Oh wow.

304
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:20,725
It's just, yeah, the engine was built the same as the company's.

305
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,246
We're still on the same engine.

306
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:30,649
Is there, do you think, because obviously managing an in-house engine requires a level of work that you don't get,

307
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:34,270
or that you see with, especially with a smaller team.

308
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:35,551
So would you say that there is...

309
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:42,122
The benefit to working with your own engine kind of makes all the extra work and the extra

310
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,302
team members required worth it there?

311
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:49,744
On my point of view, it has advantages.

312
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:55,045
For example, we can develop the tools we need especially for a feature.

313
00:30:57,645 --> 00:30:59,966
For example, the novel system for quests.

314
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,291
It's exactly what we engine bind.

315
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:07,856
So the localization system that we have to create the game in multiple languages

316
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:12,119
is sized to what we need exactly for this project.

317
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:18,384
So having our own engine is really useful

318
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:22,587
because we can develop what we want when we want it.

319
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:24,028
But...

320
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,592
But of course, that's to say we don't have...

321
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:35,813
updates like for example on Unreal, of course you have updates from the developers

322
00:31:36,293 --> 00:31:41,837
and there are many many more people working on the engines compared to us

323
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:48,983
and that's what is sometimes a little bit difficult, that's to say maintaining

324
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:56,068
the level of qualities that we need for our in-house engine.

325
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:02,122
with a small team is a challenge of every day.

326
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:10,526
Yeah, but we manage our own updates so we have better control when the Chinese are updating.

327
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:18,430
We know that what will be updated and it's always oriented on the project to update the

328
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:18,950
project.

329
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,711
So it's, I think, more...

330
00:32:24,604 --> 00:32:32,208
easier to know which update will affect your project, rather than a middleware when updates

331
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:36,409
are a general update for every people who use this engine.

332
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:44,673
So maybe some of it can be on the wrong way regarding how you want to make your game on

333
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:45,934
the middleware, for example.

334
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,551
We're about halfway through our stream.

335
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:59,337
Folks, we love taking questions from Statustat, and we're going to grab a follow-up question from here in a second, but we also want to hear your questions.

336
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:04,842
Join Statustat in the ranks of the folks who ask questions on the GDC Twitch channel.

337
00:33:06,223 --> 00:33:13,447
As I make my way here through this adventure, as we just watched a pretty disturbing scene just a second ago,

338
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,448
we are going to quickly follow up on Statistat's question.

339
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:20,171
So he kind of asks, when you're having trouble with an in-house engine,

340
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:24,994
you can't Google or go onto forums, as you would with the Unreal or Unity engines,

341
00:33:25,395 --> 00:33:27,336
when you're running into a particular bug or challenge.

342
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:30,398
But I guess the flip side of that coin is you don't need Google.

343
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,300
Google is your engine developer down in, you know...

344
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:39,725
I prefer to speak with the engine developer directly than Google it.

345
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:46,710
We have wonderful engine developers. They have always answers for us.

346
00:33:47,131 --> 00:33:55,638
Yes, we get people who have answers exactly in the studio, so Google might have the right answer.

347
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:04,139
Statue said we do appreciate and love your questions. I was just trying to celebrate your choices while

348
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,162
Begging for questions from our other listeners begging and all I always sound so desperate

349
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,161
Claire and Sebastian, let's dive a little bit into the content of GreedFall.

350
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:18,462
I think we've had a nice chat about design and tools development.

351
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:22,983
There's first one question that I feel like we need to, we'd like to talk about.

352
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:29,445
GreedFall sort of has an interesting setting, I think for both of our countries, just because

353
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:35,326
both of our countries have such interesting overlaps with this fantasy setting in each

354
00:34:35,346 --> 00:34:36,247
of our respective histories.

355
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:46,209
As we just saw in Greedfall, you are a visitor from a far-off industrialized nation coming to this island that has a native population, it has magic and monsters.

356
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:58,871
So, we're going to preface this question by saying, obviously, this is not a historical game, there's not a real historical context hanging over this, but there are still huge metaphors hanging over every moment of the game.

357
00:35:00,252 --> 00:35:01,552
When tackling the tone of...

358
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,675
In the United States, we are still reckoning with this history in many different ways.

359
00:35:06,715 --> 00:35:06,975
Whether...

360
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:14,519
Like, people say, you know, our age of colonialism is hundreds of years past and it doesn't matter.

361
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,940
Well, in reality, we're still dealing with the impact it had,

362
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:20,062
even in legal cases that are still in our court system today.

363
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:24,385
How did you... I know this is maybe a question for other members of your team,

364
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:28,368
but I'm curious what your thoughts were about approaching a subject like this,

365
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:32,412
about sort of the invasion and occupation of other lands,

366
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:34,774
especially lands where people were already residing there.

367
00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:39,638
And I'm curious if you all had any thoughts about portraying that content and what your...

368
00:35:40,178 --> 00:35:45,242
How would you navigate doing it in a way you thought would interest players and make them think?

369
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:50,686
And how would it reflect to their understanding of these events?

370
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:57,791
One of the main acts of reflection when we constructed the universe

371
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:04,456
was also to make an opposition between civilization and nature,

372
00:36:05,156 --> 00:36:06,277
which is more an actual...

373
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,225
an actual subject today with our civilization and the planet and the nature.

374
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:23,315
So we started first by thinking about that type of setting before a more historical inspired

375
00:36:23,435 --> 00:36:23,795
setting.

376
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:32,603
After, regarding the faction, we didn't want a black or white situation.

377
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:43,377
We wanted some great inspiration, like every faction had their motivation, but maybe their

378
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:51,102
lack of information, and this is why they're probably acting the wrong way.

379
00:36:51,342 --> 00:37:00,629
And we wanted to put the player in a situation like a diplomatic person that tried to make

380
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:02,930
people evil in a way or another.

381
00:37:03,893 --> 00:37:11,838
But people are not, all the factions are not the factions that want to do bad things necessarily.

382
00:37:11,878 --> 00:37:20,003
They are doing things because they want to, for example, say, find a cue for the Malico

383
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:21,584
on the continent, stuff like that.

384
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:30,410
It was more the thing that we wanted to talk about than colonization stuff.

385
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:39,998
This was more the subject we wanted to put at the end of the players.

386
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:43,961
In fact, there is also an interesting thing.

387
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,523
The game is live for one week now.

388
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,185
And in fact, Spanish people say,

389
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:54,647
oh, satisfied by our Spanish history.

390
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:56,608
Portuguese people are saying the same,

391
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,029
French people too,

392
00:37:58,169 --> 00:37:59,690
and American people say that...

393
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:03,273
It's related to our American history.

394
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:08,235
So in fact, it's interesting to see that people

395
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:17,340
identify their own culture in this story, which is not true.

396
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,722
It's a fiction created from scratch

397
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:24,063
with people from a continent which does not exist,

398
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:26,264
with an island which does not exist.

399
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,566
And it's really interesting to see how people.

400
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:32,663
interact with that.

401
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:39,788
We wanted to bring humanity during all the different factions and all the interactions.

402
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:49,294
And I think that this is why many people from different countries and with different historical pasts

403
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:54,898
can go through the universe, I think.

404
00:38:56,103 --> 00:39:00,266
I'll ask one follow-up question, and Alyssa, unless you have anything, I may move on.

405
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:08,492
Have you heard from any folks from... I mean, it's great to hear that people from different cultures have weighed in and said,

406
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:10,694
oh man, this feels like our history, this feels like our history.

407
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:15,338
Have you heard from any folks who are from different native populations who've had thoughts about this game?

408
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,784
We don't have specific feedback on that.

409
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:25,105
I think that...

410
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:35,858
We inspired a lot of Gaelic and Celtic populations for the native people.

411
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:42,562
So I think now, nowadays, all of this population has evolved to this.

412
00:39:42,602 --> 00:39:47,084
So it's kind of the same type of feedback.

413
00:39:47,164 --> 00:39:51,186
I guess we don't have an oriented feedback like...

414
00:39:54,317 --> 00:40:03,382
Like we had people who identified the native as the good people, I think, because they are invaded.

415
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:09,926
And so it's a situation that nobody wants invaders.

416
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:22,534
So I think that every player, many players, take the native as allies.

417
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:28,102
in the game. So we cannot see if people are more

418
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:31,323
voluntarily there or not. That's the thing that

419
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:37,445
just, they want to protect nature and want to protect

420
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:42,186
people that are grounding to, bound to their ground.

421
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:47,927
Uh, Alyssa, I'm gonna throw the question ball your way. Oh no.

422
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:51,948
Oh no. Oh no? I am a through... I have some...

423
00:40:52,924 --> 00:40:55,506
Questions about combat, but we haven't seen combat yet.

424
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:57,307
So my question is a little...

425
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,449
Oh, well, I missed it. Sorry.

426
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:01,250
Wow, you don't appreciate my bears?

427
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:02,931
I don't appreciate your gameplay.

428
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:05,213
There is one.

429
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,576
Continue there and you will have one soon.

430
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:11,398
Find some bears, please.

431
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:12,739
I wanted to ask about...

432
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,023
You mentioned the tactical pause quite a bit earlier when you were talking about

433
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:19,685
developing as an iterative process.

434
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:27,978
I guess I haven't played this yet, and I haven't seen much of TechRomancer, unfortunately, but

435
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:31,399
you made it sound like the tactical pause is a feature that's quite different from

436
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:32,640
what you've had in the past, right?

437
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:42,703
Yeah, on the previous game, it was like an active pause with a circular radial system.

438
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:49,825
So we moved on a real pause because tactical pause...

439
00:41:50,807 --> 00:42:04,551
Active pose was putting the player in danger, like he was almost taking a hit and he wasn't

440
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:08,832
able to choose a life potion for example.

441
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:17,735
So I wanted to move to a pose, a real pose that poses the game and helps players to pick

442
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:19,915
up the right thing regarding the situation.

443
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:35,086
After we moved from a Radian menu to a bar menu, because it allows us to avoid limitations

444
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:36,446
regarding the Radian menu.

445
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:43,769
A Radian menu will have 6 slots, 10 slots, but when it's done, it's done to keep the

446
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:47,050
symmetry regarding the design, etc.

447
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,371
Here we were free to add...

448
00:42:50,022 --> 00:42:58,267
additional type of potions and we had for example the revive potions that allows you

449
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:06,531
to revive your companion and we added like at the end of the development but we were

450
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:10,954
free adding that because we didn't have the radial limitations.

451
00:43:11,974 --> 00:43:19,538
So it was quite interesting to add 3D content on the game to balance it.

452
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:23,707
and to add more choices to the player.

453
00:43:24,848 --> 00:43:29,130
Yeah, it seems like an interesting reflection of some of those like RPG and skill tree systems

454
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,472
you mentioned earlier on that give players a lot of options to approach things how they want

455
00:43:33,592 --> 00:43:35,213
and as their own skills dictate.

456
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,585
I'm going to jump in with another question.

457
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,428
Claire, we're going to loop back to the narrative content and the game content.

458
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:51,713
There's one thing that I think is a painful contradiction in game development,

459
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:56,197
which is handcrafted, interesting content is the thing that players,

460
00:43:56,257 --> 00:43:58,279
especially ones like myself, love and adore.

461
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:01,341
It also takes lots of time to create and create well.

462
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:07,672
One little detail that I don't know how late in development it was put in, I really appreciated the camera work during these cutscenes

463
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:12,256
because I loved the way it sort of creeps around these characters for a minute, but I also know that's the kind of thing that

464
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:17,982
someone has to place that camera, even if it's a procedural camera, it has to be made procedural.

465
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:19,424
Um, what was...

466
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:28,454
We talked about how content can vary for the player depending on the choices they made and the skills they picked up.

467
00:44:28,715 --> 00:44:32,779
What was your strategy for keeping all that content organized and efficiently made during production?

468
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,741
ready in a rough at the two-thirds of the production.

469
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:52,183
That is to say, everything was ready one year ago.

470
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:55,904
And then we branched all together at the same time.

471
00:44:59,986 --> 00:45:04,287
Concerning the dialogues, we have created a new system for this game

472
00:45:04,947 --> 00:45:08,488
that allows you for the dialogues to have an automatic camera.

473
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:13,666
And that creates these dynamic dialogues from one people to another,

474
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,788
with different points of view during the dialogues.

475
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,030
It was something new.

476
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:26,053
We have also decided at the beginning of the game that there is some key point in the story,

477
00:45:26,674 --> 00:45:28,295
which needs some cutscenes.

478
00:45:29,775 --> 00:45:35,499
There is a little bit less cutscenes than what we had in mind at the beginning of the development,

479
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,161
but there is still more than one hour and ten minutes.

480
00:45:39,651 --> 00:45:42,554
30 minutes, I guess. It's more than, yeah, one hour and a half.

481
00:45:42,954 --> 00:45:46,718
So that's quite huge for our small size.

482
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:52,022
Sorry, what was the question at the beginning?

483
00:45:52,323 --> 00:45:56,706
Oh, how did you manage, how did you just manage all of the game's content?

484
00:45:56,747 --> 00:45:59,909
What was your top, sort of your broad procedure?

485
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:06,635
It was, what was difficult is there is so much text to record.

486
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:14,043
And we had all the voices at the end of the development.

487
00:46:14,584 --> 00:46:21,987
Because of course, it takes so much time to record all these dialogues with all the actors.

488
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:29,470
And that changed the feeling of the game a lot, to have the voiceover or not.

489
00:46:34,532 --> 00:46:40,477
And we were focused on several details in the same time in the last third of production.

490
00:46:40,518 --> 00:46:43,840
That is to say, we need to improve the fighting system.

491
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:47,804
We need to improve the 10 quests.

492
00:46:47,924 --> 00:46:51,727
We are a little bit boring to make them more interesting.

493
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:59,233
But we can't change part of the text because that is already recorded, for example.

494
00:46:59,474 --> 00:47:01,555
So that kind of things.

495
00:47:02,657 --> 00:47:09,081
are on the top of our head during the last third of the production when we patch all things together.

496
00:47:10,942 --> 00:47:20,549
There is also a part concerning GUI because GUI is important in RPG games and there is so much

497
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:25,772
details, so much information that we need to connect all together. We have changed the GUI

498
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:32,077
a lot of times, maybe from scratch two times and then maybe I don't know.

499
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:40,635
15 different iterations, something like that, to have all the right information at the same

500
00:47:40,675 --> 00:47:43,217
time on screen and not too much everywhere.

501
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:48,381
That's the reason an RPG has too much stats everywhere and information that you don't

502
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:53,265
need when you fight against an enemy, but you need some other information.

503
00:47:53,465 --> 00:47:58,889
For example here, you just add information concerning the factions on the top right for

504
00:47:58,909 --> 00:47:59,810
this specific place.

505
00:48:01,057 --> 00:48:04,720
But you don't need to have this kind of information in all places of the game.

506
00:48:07,442 --> 00:48:12,906
And it was a big deal to connect everything at the end,

507
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:16,209
and to enhance the global experience,

508
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:19,872
because there is more than 35 hours in the main quest,

509
00:48:19,932 --> 00:48:25,496
but you jump to more than 60 hours if you do all the side quests.

510
00:48:27,093 --> 00:48:32,715
And we were not sure before branching all together that it would be fun.

511
00:48:33,095 --> 00:48:34,395
So it was a...

512
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:35,976
That seems terrifying.

513
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:39,697
Yeah, it is a little. In fact, it's a little bit.

514
00:48:40,177 --> 00:48:45,839
We know what we do and we hope that we will be lucky.

515
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,400
That's true, that's true.

516
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,222
It's always a lot of things that we control in how we create the game.

517
00:48:54,002 --> 00:48:56,803
And there is a risk that when we branch all together...

518
00:48:57,182 --> 00:49:00,666
That will not be as great as what we had in mind.

519
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:07,673
And then the only way you have to do it is to redo it several times to make it better.

520
00:49:09,595 --> 00:49:14,059
Oh no, you were gonna, you were gonna say, oh no, I guess Sebastian, were you gonna jump in?

521
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,260
Yeah.

522
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:17,082
Uh, no, no, it's good.

523
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:31,409
I know the answer is going to be something along the lines of it's like you can kind of only go with your gut when you're in a situation like that, but is there anything that helps you determine when it's good enough?

524
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:37,394
Like you said, it's terrifying, you're working and you're working and you don't know if it's all going to work together.

525
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:48,151
I need to say maybe that we still prototyping a lot at the beginning, during the production we

526
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:57,075
prototype a lot small things before putting it all together in the game so that reduce the risks

527
00:49:57,515 --> 00:50:03,997
a little bit. Very good. When you're working on prototyping, sorry, and like going through that

528
00:50:04,017 --> 00:50:07,859
iterative process that has been like really critical to the game's development from what

529
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:10,560
you guys have been saying, how do you...

530
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:22,435
I don't know when something's good enough, because I'm the kind of person where if I go through and keep polishing and polishing and trying to make something better, I will be at it until the day I die, because it's never good enough.

531
00:50:23,216 --> 00:50:31,300
Is there feedback within the team? Is there some kind of communication system you guys have worked out to help you know when to set a feature down and let it be?

532
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,701
It's quite hard.

533
00:50:35,422 --> 00:50:40,544
We always have, as a game development crew, we always have the thing that the...

534
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:43,282
The things are never really finished.

535
00:50:43,602 --> 00:50:49,585
Actually we are working on the next patch, so we still have improvements and we can always

536
00:50:49,645 --> 00:51:02,151
make improvements, but I think that you get to put your pen on the desk many times during

537
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:10,215
the production and the game has to be released on a certain date, so there's a time where

538
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,521
It had to be ready.

539
00:51:13,021 --> 00:51:17,746
And the fact is that we...

540
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:26,934
I think the right way to know it is not to look at the feature that we are working on,

541
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:31,899
but how the feature is represented in the game,

542
00:51:32,419 --> 00:51:36,163
and what is the global state of the game.

543
00:51:37,441 --> 00:51:49,005
We have to keep balance every feature to have a constant finish and polish in all the game.

544
00:51:49,345 --> 00:51:59,048
Because different type of polish, for example, if we have things really polished and something

545
00:51:59,228 --> 00:52:04,050
unpolished aside, it will trigger the player.

546
00:52:05,386 --> 00:52:07,287
Pull him out of the game.

547
00:52:07,347 --> 00:52:12,050
But if you keep the same balancing between all different things,

548
00:52:13,151 --> 00:52:16,213
you will have a constant gameplay experience.

549
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:21,256
So I think that the best way is to stop working on it,

550
00:52:22,317 --> 00:52:24,498
take a step back, play the game,

551
00:52:24,858 --> 00:52:28,801
and see if we have to push further on that feature,

552
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,802
or maybe go back to another feature.

553
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:38,145
Maybe sometime develop a new feature that lacks in the global experience.

554
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:46,090
In fact, playtests were also a bit useful for that because on first playtest for example

555
00:52:46,111 --> 00:52:53,816
there is some feature where on red it says ok we can't continue with this feature like

556
00:52:53,836 --> 00:52:53,976
that.

557
00:52:54,892 --> 00:53:01,354
And we have improved it, improved it, improved it, and there is one moment where it becomes green on playtest.

558
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:04,455
That's to say, okay, players say, that's enough.

559
00:53:05,595 --> 00:53:07,056
We are fine with this feature.

560
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:12,718
And then you know that what you have provided is enough fun for the player,

561
00:53:13,258 --> 00:53:21,481
but you can still improve it a little bit for what you want to propose to the player.

562
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,442
But, yeah.

563
00:53:24,513 --> 00:53:27,914
When you read a feature, then you know that's in us.

564
00:53:28,134 --> 00:53:31,555
And you can make it better, but it's not an obligation anymore, in fact.

565
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:31,875
OK.

566
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:38,337
Sometimes also, if in the playtest the feature is not mentioned,

567
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:43,879
that could be also a type that, OK, the feature is good enough because it is not mentioned,

568
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:46,860
so it doesn't lax or it doesn't...

569
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,741
It is not the best feature ever, but if it's not on the...

570
00:53:53,173 --> 00:53:55,314
core experience, that's good enough.

571
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:23,727
I am currently doing some wheeling and doing...

572
00:54:23,867 --> 00:54:26,549
I am a side quest fiend in these kind of games.

573
00:54:26,709 --> 00:54:31,832
I will not stop until... I will not go on the main quest until I have completed the tiniest side quest.

574
00:54:31,872 --> 00:54:35,375
Like, the volcano could be burning in the background, the end of the world could be beginning,

575
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:40,098
and I will be there clearing out my side quest log because that's the kind of player I am.

576
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,665
I suppose my final question for the moment will be...

577
00:54:48,027 --> 00:54:50,470
Claire, this is kind of a production question.

578
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:54,735
I know France has super great labor laws.

579
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:56,958
We've talked to a lot of French developers and we talk about crunch.

580
00:54:57,799 --> 00:54:59,801
It's a very different conversation in the United States.

581
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:05,724
Because the underlying legal structure is different though.

582
00:55:06,264 --> 00:55:09,826
Games like this, especially with only a 40 person team, I can't get over that number.

583
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:11,127
40 people is so small to me.

584
00:55:12,207 --> 00:55:15,409
Games like this still take a lot of energy making, a lot of time, and a lot of passion.

585
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:23,393
And what do you think was effective about managing people's time so that the team didn't have to pull incredibly long hours to the point that it was affecting their health?

586
00:55:24,573 --> 00:55:28,695
Unless you did have to pull incredibly long hours and maybe that's something I have wrong.

587
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:39,242
As I said at the beginning, here we prefer to extend the time development than crunching, for example.

588
00:55:39,902 --> 00:55:45,664
So there is few to no people here who are doing crunch.

589
00:55:46,064 --> 00:55:56,528
It is part of our company politics here to say that we need people who are enthusiastic and safe at work

590
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:57,248
and do not...

591
00:55:58,179 --> 00:56:00,160
working 20 hours a day.

592
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:08,747
Because of course game development when it's two or three years, it's long and it's better if people are great in the game.

593
00:56:10,588 --> 00:56:17,534
And they want to continue to working on it instead of everybody is totally tired and don't want to work on it anymore.

594
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:25,583
What is difficult is sometimes when we extend the development time, people had in mind that

595
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:33,006
that would be finished, for example, I don't know, in last March, and it's extended to June.

596
00:56:33,446 --> 00:56:39,549
And when we make the decision to extend the development time, sometimes that could be a little bit difficult for people,

597
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:42,470
but because everybody here is...

598
00:56:45,496 --> 00:56:50,960
know that that's better for the game and that they will not do some extra hours.

599
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:58,885
Most of the time it's great. Everybody is okay to continue working in the game.

600
00:57:01,887 --> 00:57:07,671
I hope it answers your questions because of course it's really something really important for us

601
00:57:08,752 --> 00:57:14,636
that people at Spiders feel great about the production.

602
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:25,002
I low-key apologize in that I really honestly believe that discussions about this topic

603
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:31,866
take more time than the five minutes at the end of a stream, so I appreciate the frankness

604
00:57:31,886 --> 00:57:34,268
of your answer, even in that context.

605
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:37,450
With that, Alyssa, do you have any questions you want to get in before we wrap it up?

606
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:38,852
I've ran through my list.

607
00:57:39,152 --> 00:57:40,713
Sweet, that's a good list.

608
00:57:41,114 --> 00:57:42,835
With that, I will begin closing things down.

609
00:57:43,095 --> 00:57:44,857
Thank you all for watching the GDC Twitch channel.

610
00:57:44,877 --> 00:57:49,001
This is a place where, just like we do at GDC, we talk about how games are made

611
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:51,263
and we talk to the people who make them.

612
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,406
Um, uh, today we've been playing Greedfall, but if you check back in the next couple weeks,

613
00:57:55,426 --> 00:57:56,868
we are checking out some other really cool games.

614
00:57:57,208 --> 00:58:00,491
One of them I'm very excited about, and I guess I can go ahead and announce it.

615
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:07,036
Um, next week we're gonna be talking to, uh, the developers who worked on the original Jedi Knight 2, Jedi Outcast.

616
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:10,019
Um, those are the folks at Raven Software, which is still around.

617
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:12,661
They are just making games, uh, under Activision.

618
00:58:12,942 --> 00:58:14,963
Um, so we are going to be talking to them next week.

619
00:58:15,697 --> 00:58:19,800
The week after that we are in looking, looks like we're going to be talking to the folks

620
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,001
from Finji about the making of Overland.

621
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:25,683
So we've got some really, just like in September when all the great games are coming out and

622
00:58:25,723 --> 00:58:30,406
there's too many games and your Steam, your Epic, your PS4 backlogs are full, just so

623
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:33,649
too is our backlog laded with amazing devs to talk to.

624
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:37,331
I'm really excited about Jedi Knight 2 because that was a game I played a lot when I was

625
00:58:38,652 --> 00:58:39,052
12, 13, 14 years old.

626
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:42,795
And getting to talk to the people who worked on that is going to be really good.

627
00:58:43,614 --> 00:58:48,935
With that, we'd love it if for folks who are new, if you click the follow button, you'll get live and you'll get notification when we're going on those interviews.

628
00:58:49,316 --> 00:58:53,077
Otherwise, this channel is pretty dedicated to just running some classic GDC talks.

629
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:56,317
And, you know, we'd like it if you followed us.

630
00:58:57,418 --> 00:59:01,759
Sebastian and Claire, if they have more questions about the making of the game, where should they ask them?

631
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:06,540
On the contact address, I think.

632
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,181
Yeah, you can send emails to our contact address.

633
00:59:12,604 --> 00:59:19,668
You can also post your questions on the Focus Interactive forum of Fritful,

634
00:59:20,928 --> 00:59:24,050
and we'll try to answer as soon as we can.

635
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:29,694
