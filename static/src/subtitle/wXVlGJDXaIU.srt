1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,142
So firstly, thank you everybody for coming.

2
00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:12,644
It means a lot to us that you care about social values

3
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:13,585
as much as we do.

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,847
So we're here from Riot Games and we're here to talk to you

5
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:19,990
about understanding the social values of your players.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,032
Been told to remind you to just make sure you check

7
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:25,394
your email for the mobile survey for this session.

8
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:28,036
It should come to you towards the end of the session

9
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,637
and that feedback means a lot to us

10
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:32,099
and it helps GDC kind of learn what's good.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,480
Cool.

12
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,831
So to get started, by way of introduction, my name is Tash.

13
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,712
I'm a researcher at Riot Games.

14
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:43,595
I've been there for about two and a half years now.

15
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:45,896
Before starting at Riot Games, I did my PhD

16
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:48,398
in behavior and cognitive psychology.

17
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:51,220
Hi everybody, my name is Jeffrey Burrell,

18
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,563
and I'm head of corporate social responsibility at Riot,

19
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:55,724
or CSR for short.

20
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:58,226
I've been at Riot for about three and a half years now,

21
00:00:58,306 --> 00:00:59,927
and I've got a little bit of a mixed background.

22
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:04,030
I've got one foot as an MBA, so I love capitalism.

23
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:09,857
And then I've got one foot as a master's of public policy and administration, so I love

24
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:13,418
fighting social injustices and doing things to support social causes.

25
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:18,719
And so we also wanted to take just a moment to thank Christina Swanenberg for her tremendous

26
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,879
help and support on this project as well.

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,801
This is the agenda we just want to cover quickly with you guys today, is first we want to share

28
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:30,682
a little bit about the context and background understanding of why we wanted to do this

29
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:31,742
research in the first place.

30
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:34,183
Then we'll dive into the methodology.

31
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:36,332
and some of the key findings that we had,

32
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,454
and then wrapping with how we actually applied this research

33
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:43,596
to creating real-world social outcomes

34
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:45,276
with the players and community,

35
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:48,218
and then finally sharing some key insights and lessons

36
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:49,138
we learned along the way,

37
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:51,739
hopefully that you can take with you going forward as well.

38
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,642
At Riot, we consider ourselves a mission,

39
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:00,463
or a values-based and purpose-driven organization,

40
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:01,563
and this is our mission.

41
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:06,528
is we aspire to be the most player-focused game company in the world.

42
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:11,591
And like many game companies, being player-focused to us extends well beyond the game.

43
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:17,215
This includes everything from eSports, to player support and how we answer tickets,

44
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:21,518
to creating comics and music videos for players all around the world.

45
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:26,462
And yes, with CSR, we think that there's a few natural and authentic things

46
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:30,225
that we can do to add long-term value in the lives of our players.

47
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:33,985
our communities and the societies that we serve.

48
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:38,046
But if you'll allow me, I wanted to take just a moment

49
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:39,807
and address everyone here in the audience today

50
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,548
and step up on the balcony and say

51
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:44,929
that I think we in the video game industry

52
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,291
are in a really unique position in the world today,

53
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,992
in that we create products and experiences

54
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:57,575
that gamers voluntarily spend dozens, if not hundreds,

55
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:01,413
if not thousands of hours of their own personal time

56
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:08,475
to engage at the peak of their ability to solve complex problems in real time.

57
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:15,656
Think Celeste. They engage and collaborate with complete strangers

58
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:19,717
to achieve common goals together with people they've never met.

59
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:24,318
And they dive headfirst into exploring new worlds and uncharted lands.

60
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:26,819
They min-max optimal build paths.

61
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:32,477
And they do this all to take on that next challenge, right on the horizon, on hard mode.

62
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:40,081
These are the same skills that educators and researchers have dubbed 21st century leadership

63
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:40,381
skills.

64
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:45,223
And they're highly attributed to being able to solve some of the world's most complex

65
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:48,925
problems now and in the future that we don't know exist yet.

66
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:55,328
So I'm willing to argue that we have a tremendous opportunity as an industry in front of us.

67
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:02,815
and that we can help change the narrative of what it means to be a core gamer for the millions of gamers who are out there.

68
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:09,599
We need to change the narrative so that it's not something to be shunned from from broader society, but rather embraced.

69
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,901
It's because with these skills and the passions that gamers have,

70
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:18,504
they will one day be able to inherit the world and leave a positive mark upon it,

71
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,426
because they are practicing these leadership skills every single day.

72
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:28,577
And we can change the narrative because what it means to be a core gamer is to have tenacity

73
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:32,078
and resilience in the face of tremendous odds.

74
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:36,380
I mean, how many of you have done a raid and you've failed after several hours and you're

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,321
like, all right, let's try again tomorrow?

76
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:44,504
It means that having a narrative of being a core gamer, you can apply creativity and

77
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:50,527
adaptation to solve problems in ways you never even thought possible or even designed around.

78
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,511
And yet gamers find unique ways of solving these issues.

79
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:57,815
And the narrative of what it means to be a core gamer

80
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:02,158
is to have an unrelenting yield for self-improvement.

81
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,040
Just one more level.

82
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,761
Just one more match.

83
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,663
Let me speed run this and I can get a better score.

84
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,145
If I master this technique, I will surely get to gold.

85
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,067
But that's not enough, because I want platinum.

86
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,550
Because that, you get a cool, shiny border,

87
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,051
icon, or something that helps you show off your skills.

88
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,321
And so I think that we as an industry can help,

89
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:27,103
and we can lead by example and show that what it means,

90
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:29,165
the narrative of being a core gamer,

91
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,226
is not just caring about a high score,

92
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:34,168
but also means about caring about your fellow player.

93
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,951
It means saying GG after a hard fought and bruising defeat.

94
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:41,973
And it means that you care about the communities

95
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,294
that you're a part of and you serve,

96
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:44,675
and there's natural things that you can do

97
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:45,595
to help and give back.

98
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:48,537
And so to all the core gamers in the audience here today,

99
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:49,818
I say throw your shoulders back.

100
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:52,839
hold your head high and wear that as a mark of pride

101
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,300
because I think it's something worth honoring and respecting.

102
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,681
And with that, really quick now back onto the dance floor.

103
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,562
This is my team's mission,

104
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:06,024
is we aim to apply Riot's unique resources and strengths

105
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:08,385
to create a positive and lasting impact.

106
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:11,386
And we do that through three primary initiatives.

107
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:14,127
The first is what we call personal karma.

108
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,188
And this is designed to amplify the good

109
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:19,809
that everyone who works at Riot already does.

110
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:24,814
And so we empower programs and do connections and donation

111
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:28,296
matching to amplify the good that writers are already doing,

112
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:30,658
regardless of what it is that they personally care about.

113
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,039
We just want to make it better.

114
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,561
Then we have local karma.

115
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:37,143
And we'll dive more into this here in a little bit.

116
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,544
But local karma is all about partnering

117
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:41,526
with local players and communities

118
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,288
to create meaningful and deep connections

119
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,050
and provide long-term value in the neighborhoods that we're in.

120
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,792
And lastly, we have global karma.

121
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:55,283
And the idea behind this one is we want to invest in organizations and outcomes that

122
00:06:55,383 --> 00:07:00,685
have bold ideas that we think will create a lasting impact on some intractable problems.

123
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:04,727
As you can imagine, I'd love to talk about any one of these in detail, and I'm happy

124
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:10,009
to afterwards, but right now we have to focus on local karma, because that's really where

125
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:12,490
the genesis of this research came to be.

126
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:20,113
We have over 23, 24 offices around the world where we aim to apply local value to players.

127
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:23,886
in their own backyard and how they engage and interact with the world.

128
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,669
And so as our mission with this of fostering those deeper connections, we

129
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,510
needed to really understand the core question

130
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:34,354
of what were the values, the social initiatives that our players cared about

131
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:38,857
and why. And really quick, the first question you want to ask is why?

132
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:42,359
Why did we want to know this at all according to Simon Sinek?

133
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,064
And the first answer is because gamers are already tremendously caring and

134
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:49,684
compassionate.

135
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:53,019
They reach out to game companies and each other all the time

136
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,780
to help get activated and engaged,

137
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,721
everything from charity streams.

138
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:59,862
They put up complete strangers in their homes

139
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:03,184
during times of crises because you're a gamer too.

140
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:06,385
And they even pick up another player after a bad game

141
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:08,266
and say, dust yourself off, let's queue up again

142
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:09,067
and we can make it.

143
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,067
So the demand is there.

144
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:13,349
Players are already asking and want to get engaged

145
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,729
to creating this social impact.

146
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,110
And additionally.

147
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:22,615
As I said before, as I fundamentally believe to the core of my being that gamers can and will change the world.

148
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:28,698
And so what we wanted to do is we want to start with all things that we do at right and that's to start with the player.

149
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:40,423
But really importantly, and I can't emphasize this enough is we wanted to start where the players are not where we wanted them to be or what we wanted to project upon them.

150
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:47,067
But to really understand what's going on in the day to day lives that they're going through every day and what are their hopes and dreams for the future.

151
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:49,503
And so because of that, we really

152
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:51,744
wanted to deeply understand what were the social values

153
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,645
that our players cared about all over the world.

154
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:57,508
And then, of course, the next question is how.

155
00:08:58,588 --> 00:08:59,749
How do you go about doing this?

156
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:04,351
Because as you can imagine, talking about social values

157
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:08,814
is really tricky across cultures and countries.

158
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:11,896
Because what matters to a lot of players

159
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,797
here in the United States is vastly different than those

160
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:15,478
in, say, Brazil.

161
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,976
versus China, versus Germany, versus Korea, versus Turkey,

162
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,036
versus all over the world.

163
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:24,098
And so we also had a hypothesis where

164
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:26,359
that everybody cares about something,

165
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,560
but not everybody cares about the same things equally.

166
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,881
So we needed to really understand

167
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:34,102
not only the breadth of social values

168
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,923
that our players cared about, but also how deeply they

169
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:38,063
may care about each one.

170
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:41,265
And so ultimately, what we wanted to do

171
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:44,146
was we wanted to apply the same rigor and due diligence

172
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:45,306
to CSR research.

173
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,823
as we do to any other game or product decision at Riot.

174
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:52,185
We wanted to be really data-informed,

175
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,067
not necessarily data-driven, but informed

176
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:58,090
so that we could make more robust and impactful decisions

177
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,031
to add values to the lives of players everywhere.

178
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:04,555
And so what we needed was a framework.

179
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:07,678
We needed something that we could talk about these values

180
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:08,438
across cultures.

181
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,561
And luckily, the UN had just what we were looking for,

182
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:12,862
so we didn't have to invent anything.

183
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:17,428
These are the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs.

184
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,569
And for those of you who are unfamiliar,

185
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,550
these are goals set forth by the UN

186
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,812
that address everything from ending poverty

187
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:27,394
to fighting social injustices to protecting the planet

188
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:29,195
and ensuring prosperity for all.

189
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:32,537
They've been adopted by countless governments,

190
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:35,059
non-profits, and a lot of for-profit organizations,

191
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,121
all to collaborate together so that we can move humanity

192
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,203
to the next chapter of progress.

193
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:44,358
And so luckily, we saw this, and it

194
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:48,241
was able to converse around various issues

195
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,382
that we thought players would care about.

196
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:51,983
And they were a framework that we could

197
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:53,864
use to parse through some data.

198
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:56,506
And so we took the list, and we slightly

199
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:57,627
modified it a little bit.

200
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:59,688
Because if you're not familiar with any of these,

201
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,749
you may not necessarily know what we're talking about.

202
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,891
So we just cleaned it up a little bit.

203
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,913
But then we were armed with how we

204
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:10,495
wanted to engage players on the social values they cared about.

205
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:11,696
Cool.

206
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:18,788
research story time. So we'd never measured players' social values before at Riot and

207
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:23,210
for this reason we wanted to take multiple creative approaches to explore this space.

208
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,133
So our research was divided into two parts. We had a focus group which allowed us to really get out

209
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:35,235
there and talk to players and really dive deep into what players care about. And then we also

210
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:39,917
had a survey which allowed us to reach around 3,000 players across seven different regions.

211
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:45,119
So first I really want to show you an activity that we created for the focus group.

212
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,182
So, discussing social values is not always easy,

213
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,624
especially in front of strangers in this focus group environment.

214
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:57,045
So we wanted to make players feel comfortable.

215
00:11:57,886 --> 00:12:02,408
And we devised a method that combined League of Legends with the expression of social value.

216
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,090
So for those of you who aren't familiar with League of Legends,

217
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:08,589
Each game, a player picks a champion,

218
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,251
and that champion can have up to five abilities.

219
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:14,893
And we asked players to design their own champion,

220
00:12:15,313 --> 00:12:16,094
but with a twist.

221
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,816
Their champion should have up to five world-saving abilities

222
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:21,937
that map back onto their social values.

223
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:24,559
And we made it clear that they shouldn't map

224
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,739
onto gameplay in any way.

225
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,200
That's not what we were expecting of them.

226
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,762
And so I really want to show you some examples now

227
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:30,903
because it turned out awesome.

228
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:33,704
So this is Sir Bunnington,

229
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:36,246
and he was created by a player in Dublin.

230
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:41,217
The handwriting may be a little hard to read, so I'll point out a couple of them for you.

231
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:46,701
So, Sir Bunnington's E, climatize, allows him to stop global warming.

232
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:52,685
And his ultimate ability, here comes the money, provides players with well-paid and happy

233
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:53,045
jobs.

234
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:58,649
And as you can see, these can be pretty clearly mapped back onto the SDGs of climate action

235
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:00,350
and job and economic growth.

236
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,761
And as you can see from the right here,

237
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,423
his abilities map onto multiple SDGs.

238
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:07,184
And we were able to talk to this player

239
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:10,266
about what these were and why he really cared about them.

240
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:13,588
And this is Poncho.

241
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:17,850
And Poncho's abilities really just map onto one SDG

242
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:20,812
of good health and mental wellbeing.

243
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:24,555
One of our favourite abilities is his calm palm,

244
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,895
which is big hand here.

245
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:29,858
And this hits angry people until they feel calm.

246
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:38,834
makes sense. And inevitability, or the feels, is warmth, and this provides lonely people

247
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:47,298
with the warmth of their good memories. And this little guy is eternal, and eternal is

248
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:53,920
much more practical. He fixes things from broken machines to computers to rivers, and

249
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:59,403
even removes harmful bacteria from food. So just to bring these together.

250
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:04,148
These kind of illustrate why the focus groups were so important to us in this topic,

251
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:06,829
because we really got to get out there, talk to players,

252
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,810
and after they'd presented the champion to us and the group,

253
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,052
we really talked in detail about some of these issues.

254
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:18,274
And from a craft perspective, it really allowed us to let them open up,

255
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:21,055
and without just straight up asking them, like,

256
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,135
hey, what's your social value? So this was really cool.

257
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,877
And we'll talk about some of the learnings from this at the end.

258
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:32,693
And so we were really inspired by how open they are with some of these issues,

259
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:35,135
and we really saw that some of them meant a lot to players.

260
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:38,478
And so for this reason, we wanted to kind of reach further.

261
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:44,383
So we created a survey that, as I said, reached about 3,000 players in seven regions.

262
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,046
And the key thing here is that we still wanted to be creative.

263
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:50,993
So even though they're not in a focus group environment,

264
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:54,296
and it's probably less awkward to answer a survey online,

265
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:57,600
we still wanted to be creative with the information

266
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,201
that we're asking of them.

267
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,906
So for this, we created the Three Wishes Survey.

268
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:07,429
And in this survey, we asked them to tell us

269
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:09,631
their top three wishes for League of Legends,

270
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:13,895
for themselves, for their country, and for the world.

271
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:17,960
But to keep it focused, wishes for their country and the world

272
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,843
were based on the SDGs that Jeff just showed you.

273
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:23,686
So what were the results?

274
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:26,128
Well, we found that globally, there

275
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,911
were some goals that players valued more so than others,

276
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:30,913
which you may expect for the demographic.

277
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:34,857
And those were quality education and job training,

278
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:36,959
good health and mental well-being,

279
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,881
and employment opportunities.

280
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,653
And in a follow-up study, we really wanted to understand what they meant when they selected these categories.

281
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:47,374
So we really dove deep into subcategories.

282
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:54,718
And importantly, here we found that what they meant was post-secondary education, including college and university,

283
00:15:55,699 --> 00:16:00,262
mental health, including depression and anxiety, and this one was particularly prominent,

284
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,543
and inclusive economic growth.

285
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:08,746
So that was really helpful for us to see, globally, what can we do for our players as a whole.

286
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:13,167
But as we know, that's just one part of the picture.

287
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:15,787
And each country has its own social values

288
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:18,928
based on historical and cultural experiences.

289
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,909
And so if we break down some of the results

290
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,630
that we saw on a country basis,

291
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,270
as you can see here in the US,

292
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:30,772
one of the top goals was quality education and job training,

293
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:34,353
with 39% of players picking this as a top three value.

294
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,554
And this was followed by good health and mental wellbeing

295
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:39,034
and no poverty.

296
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:43,174
And those of you who are from the US might be familiar with these as some goals that

297
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:44,054
you really care about.

298
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:48,715
However, when we look at Brazil, and this is where it's really important for us to understand

299
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:53,597
these regional differences, we see a greater prominence in quality education and job training.

300
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:59,859
So our Brazilian players, 73% of respondents picked quality education and job training

301
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,619
as a top three value.

302
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,081
And the other two were slightly different from the US as well.

303
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:07,985
Those being sustainable employment opportunities

304
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,888
and innovative infrastructure.

305
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:16,180
And again, when we look at Turkey, we see a completely different picture,

306
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,960
with no poverty being their number one value.

307
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,041
And so just to bring that together, as I said,

308
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:26,443
it's easy for us to assume that globally there are three goals

309
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,104
that players really care about and that's what we should do to serve them,

310
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:30,884
but really that's not the case.

311
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:33,945
Looking into the regional data is so important to us as well.

312
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,986
And as Jeff mentioned earlier...

313
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:43,838
One of the missions of our team is to connect with players who are local and foster meaningful

314
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:47,681
relationships and we feel that this is the way to do that, really understanding them

315
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:48,621
where they're at.

316
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:52,644
So Jeff is going to talk to you now about some of the ways that we use this research

317
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:57,748
locally and globally to really create some value in there.

318
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,029
Thank you.

319
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,593
So now that we were armed with this data, what do you do?

320
00:18:05,629 --> 00:18:07,651
how would we go about actually then saying,

321
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:08,972
okay, here's how we can engage.

322
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,314
And one of the first things that we did

323
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:13,977
was actually go to those regional offices

324
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,698
I had talked about earlier and say,

325
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:17,740
hey, here's what we have found in ways

326
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,741
that you could potentially engage local players

327
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:21,923
with local causes that they care about.

328
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:25,146
Because we figure that those offices

329
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,948
would have much more knowledge and autonomy

330
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:29,930
into making those decisions on what they thought

331
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:30,891
was best for their players.

332
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:37,983
And one of the results that we saw from this was our Oceania office partnered with Headspace.

333
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:45,405
It's a national Australian youth foundation focused on mental health awareness and prevention and

334
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:50,767
interventions. And so what they did was they partnered with

335
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:55,228
Headspace during a week of their OPL eSports broadcast.

336
00:18:56,082 --> 00:19:01,987
And during the week of this broadcast, they had people on to help share awareness on issues regarding mental health,

337
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:06,871
to help educate on where to find help, what resources were available,

338
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:10,754
and even potential warning signs that you might find within yourself or your friends.

339
00:19:11,494 --> 00:19:16,158
And they even had pros go on and publicly state what a healthy headspace meant to them,

340
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,621
and how they kept a cool head during times of high competitive stress.

341
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:23,224
This was actually really enlightening and touching to see.

342
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:24,725
And additionally...

343
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:33,432
Rioters in our Dublin office have started to engage with Coder Dojo. This is an Irish national youth

344
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,393
nonprofit that focuses on getting

345
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:40,395
kids tech education skills and so the

346
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:46,239
Rioters in this office have done everything from hosting coding jams into the local office and you can see some of the kiddos

347
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:52,802
Interacting right there and learning how to just use basic coding skills and getting more comfortable with technology

348
00:19:53,637 --> 00:19:58,660
They've started to provide mentorship into some disadvantaged youth into pursuing careers

349
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,660
into tech and the video games industry.

350
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:07,164
And the whole office even pitched in for a 24-hour help-a-thon where they did everything

351
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:11,165
from a whole backlog of projects that the non-profit wanted to engage on but hadn't

352
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:11,726
had the time.

353
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:16,748
So they translated a bunch of learning materials into new languages to reach thousands of new

354
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:17,588
kids the world over.

355
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:22,954
They redesigned the logo and they even helped them overhaul their website to reach more

356
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:24,995
streamlined kids around the world.

357
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:29,718
And we've also begun to use this research on a global level as well.

358
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:34,560
What we have talked about before was how we can start to engage on a local issue, but

359
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:41,443
one global example of how we use this was last year we held a global fundraiser for

360
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:42,623
the players around the world.

361
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:44,845
And it was one of those where it's like, hey,

362
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,506
if you buy this item in-game, it'll

363
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:48,067
go to help support a charity pool.

364
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:52,450
But what we really wanted to do with this campaign

365
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:58,374
was to align in players' mind that their decisions mattered

366
00:20:58,494 --> 00:20:59,935
in real-world social outcomes.

367
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,899
And so we had players vote on one of three organizations

368
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:06,440
that they could go to support.

369
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:11,183
The winning nonprofit got 50% of the overall charity pool.

370
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:13,685
and the other two got 25% each.

371
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:16,126
So it's still a rising tide for all boats.

372
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:19,568
But here was the kicker, was the player's vote

373
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,790
was actually amplified by their in-game honor level,

374
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:25,631
or how sportsmanlike they were.

375
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:28,273
So if they were just a really strong Samaritan

376
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:30,254
and a great teammate and someone who was just

377
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:32,215
a really positive influence on the community,

378
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,917
their vote counted more than someone who may be,

379
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:39,418
say, a toxic jerk bag, technical term.

380
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:47,783
And so what we really wanted to do was the whole premise of this campaign was to give players that sense of ownership and

381
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:52,746
Agency and we had to use this research as a starting point

382
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:59,672
So that we could go and select these organizations that we thought had a global appeal to them and yet one wouldn't be completely

383
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:03,915
Run away from another they had to really internalize in the players mind

384
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:08,919
This is what I want to go into support and as a community. This is what we can achieve together

385
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:13,820
And so we were actually kind of nervous when we were running this campaign.

386
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,940
Was this even a good idea?

387
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,060
How would players respond?

388
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:18,761
And what were the results?

389
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:24,263
And I'm still just gobsmacked by what the community was able to do.

390
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:28,905
They had raised over $2.4 million for these charities.

391
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:33,246
They were extremely happy and some followup research into the organizations

392
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:35,287
that they were able to select and vote on.

393
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:40,208
And over 80% of them wanted future similar events like this going forward.

394
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,167
And what was just really touching to me was after the fact,

395
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:46,367
I'm talking with the organizations and the nonprofits,

396
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:51,028
and they saw a spike in traffic and donations

397
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:54,209
directly to them outside of the in-game campaign.

398
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,190
It turns out that players were rallying their friends,

399
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,590
their family, their schoolmates, and their local communities

400
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:03,431
to go and support these organizations on their own

401
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:04,971
because it mattered so much to them.

402
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:07,972
And so this only fuels my conviction.

403
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:11,280
in the decency and compassion of gamers all over the world

404
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:14,964
who are willing to help hundreds of thousands of lives

405
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:16,665
of people they'll never meet.

406
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:21,649
And with that, we want to share a couple of key learnings

407
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,171
that we learned along the way that we'd

408
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:24,091
want to share with all of you.

409
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:29,796
And the first is that it's really important to us

410
00:23:30,317 --> 00:23:33,299
to apply the same level of research and due diligence

411
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,042
into our CSR activities as we do any other game or product

412
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:36,362
decision.

413
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:43,225
There's a lot of research out there that shows being authentic with your CSR activities is really important.

414
00:23:43,826 --> 00:23:48,988
And so what we found was by using this data-informed process,

415
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:56,191
we can create strengthened connections between our players and our communities to create long-term value and trust together.

416
00:23:57,572 --> 00:24:03,415
Additionally, we found that using RIP to facilitate a conversation is immensely helpful.

417
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:07,497
These are not easy issues to talk about around the dinner table.

418
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:10,007
let alone with complete strangers.

419
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:13,228
But the fact that we were all together and all gamers

420
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,048
and had that in common and said,

421
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:17,169
hey, what matters to you?

422
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,289
What are your goals and aspirations in the game?

423
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:22,590
That allowed us to connect on a human to human level

424
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,311
and really open up some deep and insightful conversation.

425
00:24:26,911 --> 00:24:28,931
And additionally, allowing player agency

426
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:30,052
into these social outcomes.

427
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:32,232
This was something that exceeded

428
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:34,393
my personal wildest expectations

429
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:37,233
on what we could achieve together as a community.

430
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:42,056
and as a whole and we found that players really really resonated with this and we're asking

431
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:44,896
and wanting a lot more of these going forward.

432
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:50,098
And so with that we want to open up for any questions that we have right now and of course

433
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,859
Tasha and I will be right outside if anyone wants to catch us afterwards to talk.

434
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,340
Thank you all so much for coming and spending time with us today.

435
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:07,544
Thank you.

436
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:11,069
What percentage of your user base got engaged with this?

437
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,892
So of the engagement rate in participating regions

438
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:18,575
was around north of 20%.

439
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:20,236
All right, quite a lot.

440
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:20,637
A fifth.

441
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:21,077
Yeah.

442
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:21,838
OK, thanks.

443
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:22,418
Sure.

444
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,481
Hi, thanks for this talk.

445
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,504
Can you see a way that the social values, priorities

446
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:31,545
that you identified amongst the player base

447
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:36,429
could complete the circle and influence Riot Games game

448
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:36,850
design?

449
00:25:38,383 --> 00:25:44,908
Yeah, that's a really robust question. I think that what it is is how we approach all other

450
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:49,512
sort of things is we like to be player informed. So as you can imagine, we don't necessarily

451
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:55,217
only have research on the social values of what our players use, but also what kind of

452
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:59,801
comics they like, what sort of movies do they like. And I think all of that factors in to

453
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:04,665
how we think we can best add value in the lives of players all over the world in future

454
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:06,506
products and any sort of...

455
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:09,369
you know, things that we create in the future.

456
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,030
I think it's definitely a component,

457
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,571
but not necessarily solely driven by that.

458
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,192
Do you think there's a correlation between games

459
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:18,633
that exhibit the social values they prioritize

460
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:19,514
and purchase intent?

461
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:21,395
Sorry, can you explain?

462
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:21,895
He asked a question.

463
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:23,816
Do you think people are more likely to buy a game

464
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:27,497
that exhibits the social values that they prioritize?

465
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:29,458
I have a hypothesis around that.

466
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:30,899
I think it's a little bit early for us,

467
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:32,739
but if you look at some of the research out there,

468
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,680
particularly among millennials,

469
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:39,497
is they are far more likely to engage with products and companies and decisions

470
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:42,678
that support strong sustainable social outcomes

471
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,839
than those that may not necessarily do.

472
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,420
Great, thank you very much.

473
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,701
Yeah, you mentioned the use of the IP was valuable, but how do you know that?

474
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:55,563
Did you try some IP neutral experiments that had less success, or did you just kind of...

475
00:26:57,252 --> 00:27:02,937
Assume that it was better. I'm just kind of curious. That's a good question. We actually ran some kind of practice

476
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:04,898
labs for this and

477
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:12,424
Internally and it was very awkward to open up with just like hey, so we're here to talk about social values. Let's go

478
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:16,967
And I think one of the things is especially with players when they come into our lab

479
00:27:17,227 --> 00:27:22,431
They are expecting to play a new champion or see a new like a new game system

480
00:27:23,212 --> 00:27:25,253
And obviously they come into riot. It looks really cool

481
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:26,594
I mean we wanted to kind of

482
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:28,105
break the ice in that way.

483
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:30,486
So although we didn't practice with players,

484
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:32,947
I do believe based on our internal kind of test of it

485
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:35,688
that it was the most comfortable way to open up.

486
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:36,508
Thank you.

487
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:36,988
Okay, thanks.

488
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:40,990
Hi.

489
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:45,352
Regarding some of the sustainable development initiatives

490
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:46,072
you talked about,

491
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:50,714
I admit I'm a bit more cynical than you are

492
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:54,496
about groups of gamers and how they interact with things.

493
00:27:55,124 --> 00:28:00,746
And I feel like there are a lot of people, some gamers included, not all, that act in

494
00:28:00,786 --> 00:28:04,788
opposition whether intentionally or unintentionally to those sustainable initiatives.

495
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:11,691
Do you feel that it's important to reach out to those gamers to try to get them on board

496
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:18,195
with these things and encourage them both inside and out of the game to explore why

497
00:28:18,255 --> 00:28:22,176
those things are important and helpful to a lot of people?

498
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:23,757
That's a really good question.

499
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:31,752
How I see it is that this is an issue just with humans in general, right?

500
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:38,694
Like I am an internal optimist, unfortunately, but I think that it's really important.

501
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:43,276
What we're doing is talking about adaptive change, about mobilizing entire communities

502
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:45,857
of people to address big challenges in front of them.

503
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:50,278
And I think that you need to listen to all of the voices within the system,

504
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:53,379
whether they are your strongest advocates or your biggest deterrent.

505
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:57,768
And so I think that what normally doesn't work,

506
00:28:57,908 --> 00:29:00,029
what I've seen in terms of politics or business

507
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,509
or any kind of activity like this,

508
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:04,470
is a heavy hand is not necessarily what's needed,

509
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:07,131
but more of that idea of understanding,

510
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:09,012
of communicating and opening and listening up

511
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:11,113
and trying to show what the benefit

512
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,234
of being thoughtful and caring brings.

513
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:14,874
But ultimately at the end of the day,

514
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:17,775
these are individual humans who make their own decisions.

515
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,136
And I think that as part of my,

516
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:22,217
you know, a little bit of a rallying cry up forward is,

517
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:23,137
you know, we can help show.

518
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:28,920
by example of how to engage in our, you know, communities and everything like that to show

519
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,482
that there is a stronger and more powerful way out there.

520
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:32,903
Okay, thank you.

521
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,405
And just to add to that, sorry, I just want to say that I think it's a great question

522
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:40,648
because I love that kind, I love to reach out to players and let them know what we care

523
00:29:40,668 --> 00:29:41,448
about as a company.

524
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:47,292
And the charitable event that Jeff showed you ran in client at peak time and that was

525
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,473
our way of being like, hey.

526
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,661
this is what we care about, these are our values as a company and we really hope that

527
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:55,882
that kind of shines through to players and that's what we stand for.

528
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:59,944
So we'd love for Next Steps to be more outreach for that kind of stuff.

529
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:00,904
Thank you.

530
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:01,525
Thank you.

531
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:10,908
Is the relatively low sample size of 3,000 reflective of the sort of mandate to be data

532
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:12,489
informed rather than data driven?

533
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:19,181
And then is that made easier because the core values are in line with the results and you're

534
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:20,942
more confirming your values at that point?

535
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:27,066
Yeah, so in terms of sample size, we had about 400 players per region, and that tends to

536
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:30,529
be representative of the players in those regions.

537
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:32,670
That's what we tend to do for all surveys.

538
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:38,014
We find that if we do any more than that, we kind of get a diminishing return on investment

539
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:39,014
for that.

540
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:44,861
And yeah, so we do find that that therefore represents the players in that region.

541
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:49,146
And then to kind of go on to the practical side, when we do go out and we, like you saw,

542
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:53,651
Headspace in Australia, when they go and do kind of interact with players in those regions,

543
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:56,694
we do get a big kind of warming towards it.

544
00:30:56,774 --> 00:31:00,499
So yeah, right for the moment, it seems to be working.

545
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:01,980
That makes sense.

546
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,421
Thank you.

547
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:02,861
Thank you.

548
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:11,072
Hi, I was curious about the waiting system for the voting on the fundraiser.

549
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:11,932
I was curious about that.

550
00:31:13,574 --> 00:31:18,398
I was wondering, did you guys think about how it accounts for maybe people

551
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,000
with language issues, like maybe they're on the spectrum

552
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:25,204
and maybe people might just misinterpret, you know, their communication in general?

553
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:27,445
So, how do you guys account for that?

554
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,048
Did you consider that in waiting voters?

555
00:31:31,304 --> 00:31:36,585
Yeah, so this, we worked in strong collaboration with our player behavioral team and they're

556
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:41,726
a group of a bunch of really, you know, talented behavioral researchers and scientists.

557
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:48,788
And so we didn't want to graft on something just for a social value purpose, but really

558
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:52,169
make it a natural extension of it, if that kind of makes sense.

559
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:56,990
So we used the existing honor system that they've already designed in terms of

560
00:31:57,846 --> 00:31:59,347
For those of you unfamiliar, after the game,

561
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:02,490
you can honor someone for being just GG, really player

562
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,431
friendly, to being a strong leader

563
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:06,293
and having good communication skills,

564
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:08,295
or having tenacity and resilience

565
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:09,856
in the face of tremendous odds.

566
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:16,062
And so we used that framework of saying, as you go along,

567
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,103
it does account a little bit for language differences

568
00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:18,564
or all that.

569
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:22,007
It's just how you are in game, not necessarily you

570
00:32:22,347 --> 00:32:25,130
trying to game the honor system so you get a higher vote.

571
00:32:25,664 --> 00:32:26,544
if that kind of makes sense.

572
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:28,525
It's just a natural extension of that.

573
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:31,145
So it's based on the gameplay behavior,

574
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,666
not necessarily language.

575
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:33,306
That's right.

576
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,466
Okay, interesting, thank you.

577
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:35,266
Sure, thank you.

578
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:35,926
Hi.

579
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:36,626
Hi.

580
00:32:36,806 --> 00:32:37,907
As a fellow researcher,

581
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:42,548
would Riot be interested in sharing their modified SDG

582
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,528
as well as potentially comparing notes

583
00:32:44,688 --> 00:32:46,448
on different game titles and IPs?

584
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:48,709
We would love to share the modified list.

585
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:49,849
I think, yeah.

586
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:51,829
Yeah, I mean, it's essentially,

587
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,230
we took the SDGs and just.

588
00:32:54,912 --> 00:32:58,754
dumbed down the language a little bit and kind of made it more digestible.

589
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:03,496
But we're always looking to expand out and to collaborate with others.

590
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:04,297
So we can definitely connect after.

591
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:04,517
Absolutely.

592
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:04,617
Yeah.

593
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:05,438
Yeah, I'll show you that.

594
00:33:05,478 --> 00:33:05,598
Great.

595
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:06,438
Well, Tasha and I will be right outside.

596
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:09,640
But thank you guys so much.

597
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,380
It means so much for us to you.

598
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,640
Thank you.

599
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:10,901
Thank you.

600
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:11,321
Thank you.

601
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:11,601
Thank you.

602
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:11,821
Thank you.

603
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:12,161
Thank you.

604
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:12,361
Thank you.

605
00:33:12,401 --> 00:33:12,642
Thank you.

606
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:12,862
Thank you.

607
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:13,082
Thank you.

608
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:13,302
Thank you.
