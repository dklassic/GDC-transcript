00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:10,979
Hello! Happy day four of GDC Showcase! I'm Gamma Sutra News Editor and Associate Publisher,

2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:15,163
Lizza Macklin, and I'll be moderating today's AMA and fielding all your wonderful questions

3
00:00:15,623 --> 00:00:20,528
with Yacht Club Games' David D'Angelo. We'll be taking your questions on game development

4
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:24,492
throughout the chat, so be sure to use the questions tab in your chat box on the right

5
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:28,936
side of your screen to submit those, and thumbs up other questions from other folks in chat that

6
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:29,777
you'd like to see answered.

7
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:34,823
With that, that's as much as I hope to talk here. We're just going to get some questions,

8
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:39,309
get some expert answers. So let's hand things over to today's AMA guest, David D'Angelo.

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,055
Hello, David, can you introduce yourself and tell everybody what you do?

10
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:47,457
Hey, I'm David. I'm a programmer at Yacht Club Games.

11
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:53,919
I've been here since the beginning, and I've worked on games like Shovel Knight and everything in the series.

12
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:59,020
Before that, I worked on other games, but that's the cool Yacht Club stuff.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,141
So, Shovel Knight, Specter of Torment, King of Cards, Clique of Shadows, Showdown, and more to come.

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,922
And we just published Cyber Shadow. That's the latest.

15
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:12,144
Awesome, awesome. I'm going to kick off with one small question of myself here,

16
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:15,725
and then I will start reading and chat while you're answering that,

17
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:20,147
and we'll get some chat questions going here. Can you talk a little bit about just how Yacht

18
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:25,148
Club makes these very distinctly retro-inspired games, and even Cyber Shadow, which you published,

19
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:29,990
has that same kind of vibe to it. What, as a developer, and I guess now a publishing company,

20
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,610
attracts you guys to that genre?

21
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:41,292
I mean, I think what, you know, one of our goals as a company was sort of make games

22
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:50,816
that make people love games. And when we were, like, I guess what we were interested in these

23
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:56,898
old games is essentially like there's a lot of, there's a lot of cool ideas and gameplay,

24
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:59,279
like design and just.

25
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:07,533
The way the games were made back then, that's like interesting and we thought they should still like they shouldn't go by the wayside by any means.

26
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:13,803
There's like lots of things to love there and we wanted to show people why you should love them. So, you know, with Shovel Knight, we were the

27
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:19,780
We were trying to sort of say like here's like these are like really cool things that people

28
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,426
aren't doing anymore that like we want you to love and we want you know hopefully by the end

29
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:29,991
of the time well when you finish Shovel Knight you like go back in your NES collection or you're like

30
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:30,832
you say to your

31
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:37,573
9 year old you've got to play this old Mario game or you like you can sort of see you can like break

32
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:42,537
into those games easier than you could now because they're sort of hard to right um then Cyber Shadow

33
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:46,319
is like very much the same thing it's like just a different style of a kind of old game that we

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,063
there's ideas in there that we liked and that we thought we could like bring out and sort of show

35
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:55,426
like why this you know why this thing's still valuable and why you should love it and why you

36
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:56,606
should love these kind of games.

37
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:03,911
So part of that, and segueing here to a question from Dan in chat, is this really tight kind

38
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:08,032
of like platforming that's very indicative of the games of that period, and then you

39
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:11,133
have great platforming and tough platforming in Shovel Knight too.

40
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:15,434
Dan wants to know, creating good movement in a platformer is essential to creating a

41
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:16,335
nice player experience.

42
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:19,075
How did you guys approach perfecting this?

43
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:22,797
For us, it's a lot more about...

44
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:28,529
Like the structure of making something like that. I guess that's how we think about designing things

45
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:35,011
in general. We don't like go into something and say like find the fun or like you know willy

46
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:39,873
nilly around with the joystick until it feels just right. I guess a game feels just right to

47
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:45,134
us if it's built to feel just right. Like a building feels just right to be in because they thought

48
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:52,576
Well, a person is, you know, on average, no taller than like nine feet, right?

49
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:55,597
You know, that's like what you'll feel comfortable going in the door doing.

50
00:03:55,677 --> 00:04:03,660
So like, that's how we generally design our player movement to feel like we had, you know, we had the basic idea that we wanted this like one-two punch with Shovel Knight.

51
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,761
That's like, you flip something over and then you down throw since underside.

52
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:07,901
And then we said,

53
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,733
Okay, we're going to make an NES game of this resolution. So that structure means you're going

54
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:20,495
to have like this many tiles on the screen and if you can down thrust, you can jump like we want you

55
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:24,617
to be able to jump five tiles because that would like you know that gives you this amount of space

56
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:28,819
you can cover and then if you can down thrust something you can cover this much much more tiles.

57
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:43,592
And that total will be like nine tiles, and you'll feel like you got to like 80% of the top of the screen and that'll feel really satisfying. And like, and because we've like done this all built it all out with metrics, you know when you jump you cover like one third of the screen or something.

58
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:54,722
And then we sort of we like we put all these numbers in stone, and then we know what the level we're building is going to be like dependent on those numbers, and it will feel fun.

59
00:04:55,565 --> 00:05:00,950
Because we built everything, you know, so your head doesn't hit the door when you're walking through.

60
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,491
Yeah, the math of fun. Yeah.

61
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:08,736
Yeah, that's, I mean, that's like, we really, we really like put an emphasis here on like,

62
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:14,600
like, almost like it's like a math problem. Or, you know, we have like the high idea,

63
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,643
but like that when you drill down to actually putting it in the game, that's like what it

64
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:19,364
comes down to.

65
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:31,068
And there's like, I mean, there's obviously like variations in that like Shovel Knight has a very high gravity like fall to him because we said, Oh, he's a character that's like made out of armor.

66
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:38,670
So like, that's a reason why he should have, you know, he should fall a little heavier than other characters because it would feel like a little unnatural if he didn't.

67
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:46,893
There's like, there's little stuff like that, but it's mostly like we're, you know, we're trying to build it around those metrics because at the end of the day, we think like.

68
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:51,918
The level design in a game like Shovel Knight is what's going to sell it as being fun.

69
00:05:51,938 --> 00:05:57,483
So it being built around how do we... we know we can make a fun level if he's designed this way.

70
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:02,447
And taking that same kind of formula, formulatic kind of approach to it,

71
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:07,252
does that... the same kind of steps and considerations apply when you come back

72
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:10,775
and make your DLC for Plague Knight that plays different and the levels are different,

73
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:13,257
but the same kind of considerations and steps in making that?

74
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:23,578
Definitely, definitely. There's usually like a high level idea like Specter Knight, we wanted it to feel like it was easy to feel cool.

75
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:37,328
And we're like what what feels cool like like being a ninja like walking on walls feels cool and you know something we were thinking a lot about at the time was is like a context sensitive like button is like, oh, is a weird.

76
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:42,954
complicated thing in most games. Like you know you walk up to the thing and you're like waiting for

77
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:47,055
the prompt to show up to be it's okay you can press the button now to pick up the item or whatever.

78
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:52,738
So like we we thought about like well we want to like try to make something with that problem and

79
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,659
that's like where we came up with the dash slash and then like once we had those like

80
00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:00,961
concepts it's like well the wall climb should be like this high and the and the dash slash will

81
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:05,063
like bring you this far and it should only do like two angles because if it did more angles it would

82
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,864
be like too hard to design a lot of.

83
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:11,523
It's like a lot of the same like breaking it down like that.

84
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:16,244
Oh I just had one. You just kind of answered the question I was going to throw at you from

85
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:20,405
Thomas in chat. He wants to know how is the process for you and the team creating such

86
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:25,767
interesting signature moves for each character? But you kind of just talked about that there so

87
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:30,749
that almost works. Yeah I mean it's really often like a lot of those things. It's like we

88
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:32,229
look at the character we say like.

89
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,440
Yeah, or we design a character.

90
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,281
It's either you have the idea first, or you have a character,

91
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:38,921
and you're making the idea out of the character.

92
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:41,982
But often, it's like we have a character,

93
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:45,223
and there's something we want to tackle with it,

94
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:46,664
like I said with Spectre.

95
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:49,205
We have a cool character, so it should feel really easy

96
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:50,125
to be cool.

97
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:53,586
Let's see.

98
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,067
Scott here in chat would like to know,

99
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:58,388
what role do design patterns play in your work?

100
00:07:58,428 --> 00:07:59,828
Do you have any particular favorites?

101
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:05,548
I'm not sure exactly what is meant by design patterns.

102
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:11,590
Move on from that one then. I guess you wear many hats, but it's the programmer hat that

103
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,751
fits the most comfortably, I suppose. Yeah.

104
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:19,674
How about a tools question then? What kind of software development processes do you use at

105
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:23,475
Yacht Club? Agile with sprints, extreme programming, your own kind of thing? It

106
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:26,396
seems like you have the whole team's input on many aspects of the game.

107
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:28,077
So they were curious, and that is from Joseph.

108
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:37,409
We use sprints, we do, we typically, I mean it can change over the course of the project but we do like an agile thing with two weeks sprints.

109
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:43,891
And it's, I mean it's very very loosely agile, I would say, but we are pretty like.

110
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,774
We're pretty adamant about like everyone if you're working on something you made a task and you like

111
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:57,078
put in the bug base and you assigned a number of points to it and like I guess everyone feels I

112
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:00,179
think everyone at the end of the day feels better if they know like this is the thing that's going

113
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:06,463
to ship out of date and I know how long my tasks are taking and we can all sort of like track each

114
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:11,065
other and know when there's like holes in the you know group dynamic or like you know someone

115
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,547
doesn't have enough work or has too much work and that kind of stuff so.

116
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,740
How big is your team?

117
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,642
Right now we're, I think we're 24 people.

118
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:19,002
Okay.

119
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:21,663
The original Shovel Knight was 5.

120
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:24,605
Okay, geez, so quite a ways up there now.

121
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:36,551
With kind of that, and you had mentioned prior when I was interrogating you before we went live that you're kind of a studio that doesn't like titles so much, or a lot of you wear a lot of different hats.

122
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:42,995
How, with that kind of process you just described, how do you as a team make sure everyone knows what they should be doing, or?

123
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,554
has a clear understanding of where they are, where they need to be.

124
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:50,504
Well, we do a lot. We have a lot of meetings.

125
00:09:53,504 --> 00:10:08,090
Yeah, like every, you know, every week or two weeks we'll have a big meeting where we go through like everything on the agile board and we say, you know, this is what progress of everything that's there here's oh here's what we need to do.

126
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:10,211
Oh, you don't have enough things right now.

127
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:15,334
You know, maybe, maybe the next sprint, we should like queue up this thing.

128
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:15,914
You know,

129
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:32,180
But in general, we have a lot of like structure built in by the design, so it's like we know we're making, we're going to work on pride more keep the stage right we know we're going to make five enemies five objects because that's like what goes into a stage.

130
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,682
And like there's sort of like a pipeline and a turn around that.

131
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:42,947
Another question I was going to grab for Joseph is from Joseph, excuse me, as well.

132
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:47,230
Does Yacht Club Games use any third-party tools for debugging, organizing, tiling, etc.?

133
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,092
Or are they all developed in-house? Could you elaborate on the ones you use, if so?

134
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:59,878
Pretty much most stuff is in-house. We use Tiled for our level editor.

135
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:10,362
And we use Google Sheets for putting text in the game.

136
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:15,307
I'm trying to think if there's anything else.

137
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:19,450
Our collision system was Box2D, although that's not great.

138
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,312
And I would not recommend that to anyone.

139
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:23,534
And we've mostly stripped it out.

140
00:11:24,695 --> 00:11:27,738
But I mean, I wouldn't recommend it for our kind of game.

141
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:28,979
Maybe for your kind of game, it's perfect.

142
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:36,522
Yeah, it was just kind of like quizzing you on all like, five years ago, what did you think about this?

143
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:41,767
It's an AMA. Let's see, Luke here wants to know if you have any advice for new developers who

144
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:45,952
are jumping into a large code base for the first time or how to get caught up to speed with a project.

145
00:11:47,647 --> 00:12:02,675
My advice for that kind of thing is always to start doing something. I would, I like, for me it's best, or at least personally I find it's easiest when you like pick something and you say I'm going to do this, and then like the path of

146
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:19,416
Like that leading to you having to get that thing done probably involves you touching a bunch of stuff or like learning it all, as opposed to like I don't know if you just like scan all the files and read them it's like you probably get bored and confused and don't know what's going on.

147
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:28,524
Like setting a lot of breakpoints and just like stepping through the loop of like how things are getting run is an easy, obvious thing to do.

148
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:44,012
Yeah, sometimes like finding us if you like look play like say you had a game and you played it and you find a small bug and thinking like I'm going to fix that bug. Right. And just like trying to do that can just like go a long way.

149
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:54,980
I'm kind of in a similar vein here. Christopher says that their programming teacher once said that being a programmer isn't about knowing how to code something but more knowing how to find out how to make your code work.

150
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:59,544
What are some resources you use when you need to do some research on how to make your code work.

151
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:08,912
Uh, well, that's an interesting question. I don't really use many resources to get it to work.

152
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:16,719
Um, I guess I like really depend on like debuggers and uh like tools and like printing things and

153
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:23,685
making debug tools and uh that kind of stuff. I like uh I you know I uh

154
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:35,563
I like may I have no the ins and outs of all that kind of stuff. And that's not like how I if I can't figure out why something's break broken or whatever I'm like really reliant on that kind of stuff.

155
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:41,746
But if I'm like tackling if I was tackling a new problem that I didn't know how to do I would, I would just be.

156
00:13:44,895 --> 00:14:04,184
So, you know, some kind of math problem or whatever I'd be like looking at old papers or like going through, you know, presentations or projects that people did in the past and just trying to gather as much information as I could, even if I like, I'm not going to do those things at all. Sometimes it's good to just have those things in your brain as like these are techniques people did in the past.

157
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:11,895
Next one here. Sorry, there's a lot of them coming in, and I can only read so fast.

158
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:15,417
When your company was first formed, how did you find key people, artists, programmers,

159
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:20,059
and etc. to work on Shovel Knight? How were you able to fund them when you weren't making money

160
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,400
before your Kickstarter took off?

161
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:26,037
Shovel Knight, the team basically came from another studio.

162
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:29,480
So it was the five of us, we all worked together.

163
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,164
And that's sort of why we left, because we wanted to keep working together and they wouldn't

164
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:34,485
let us.

165
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:39,549
So we said we're going to start our own company instead and make a game.

166
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:48,912
And so, I mean, we started that in January and in March we launched the Kickstarter.

167
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:53,913
So people basically, it was like a few months of running off their own savings.

168
00:14:55,833 --> 00:15:03,495
It's the kind of startup, the indie startup dream there is just kind of like we had savings and we didn't eat expensively for a couple of months before we took off.

169
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,596
The whole Shuffle Knight development, no one was eating.

170
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,715
Um, let's see here. What's your favorite Famicom slash NES game from Peter?

171
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:17,240
Uh, my favorite NES game is Mario 3, I think.

172
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:23,793
It's like, I don't know, it's like one of the best games ever made in my opinion.

173
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:28,779
It's just like a blast to jump in and do a little bit or it's a blast to spend eight hours trying

174
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,925
to go through every level. There's just like a lot of brilliant ideas in there and it's, you know.

175
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:37,248
Is there anything you remember from there that kind of is kind of this

176
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:38,830
inspiration core behind what you do now?

177
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:45,413
Um, you know, what I, what I think about that game the most is just like how much,

178
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:50,039
how many ideas are crammed into every inch of the game. And I, uh,

179
00:15:50,768 --> 00:15:56,112
When I think about the biggest difference between games now and then, it's like now it's like

180
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:02,238
an overworld. It's like a huge massive open world, right? And there's like a million miles of space,

181
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:07,462
but there's nothing to do in that space. Or at least you have to walk a mile to get to anything.

182
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:08,903
I just like the

183
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:22,151
How much like every single screen has like 30 things that are like exciting and new and different and you haven't seen them yet and it just it just is always blowing my mind when I play that game.

184
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:35,858
Um, oh gosh, no I checked on it I scrolled, uh, as a programmer from Misha here. What is your favorite and or least favorite part to code physics for example versus shooting mechanics or anything else kind of applicable for you.

185
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:48,950
Um, let's see. I guess my my least favorite thing is, uh,

186
00:16:54,494 --> 00:16:59,498
I don't know, like plumbing stuff? I don't know how to describe it.

187
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:05,122
I guess some stuff feels like grunt work in a way that's like, well, we like, I don't know,

188
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:09,705
it's like, well, we got to like port this function over to like 50 things or we got to like,

189
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:14,171
I'm going to go ahead and get this.

190
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:17,574
I like the more foundational work that you have to do before you can do the fun stuff.

191
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,136
It's like I got to write a vector class or whatever.

192
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:27,942
That kind of, it's like the stuff that's like, or stuff that people have done like a million times and now I'm doing it.

193
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:33,746
And it's like, well, I don't really have anything to add or there's no nothing exciting or fun about this.

194
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:43,517
Um, oh my gosh. Sorry, I'm so sorry. So many questions. Answered that one here. Ah, let's see.

195
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,422
Do you see design-wise as an advantage to 8-bit constraints that can't just be inherently produced on contemporary platforms?

196
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:58,045
You kind of talked about this earlier with how, like why you were drawn to the kind of like 8-bit, 16-bit area.

197
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:05,728
But I guess how do those constraints that come with that era of game, how do those inform your guys' development process?

198
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:06,888
And that is from Peter in chat.

199
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:12,962
Yeah, I mean I think there's like a few things that constraints are really good for.

200
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:20,248
One is like a big thing about those games was like they couldn't do that much so they had to rely on

201
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:25,753
your imagination a lot and that's like one of the core things we took. It's like Shovel Knight can

202
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:31,698
be a cool guy or a cute guy or a girl or you know whatever you want.

203
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:39,767
Um, and but we're gonna like put like because of those restrictions like the Shovel Knight is like sort of

204
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:45,533
forced into something where we have to rely on people's imagination to make it more exciting

205
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:50,478
and because of that that sort of like inspires our ideas in general to be like it leaning in

206
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:51,339
that direction like.

207
00:18:51,844 --> 00:19:04,610
Well, how about we like don't answer all the questions you might have in the story or how about we, you know, we leave those open so you can like fill in the blanks for like what is meaningful in your life and that, you know, shoveling and shield might have relationship.

208
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:14,154
We don't say what that relationship is but like you could think as if you're an eight year old you like don't obviously have girlfriends or whatever you might be like that your sister, or that's your friend.

209
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:16,996
And that's like what is meaningful to you when.

210
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:26,347
You're reunited with shield at the end of the game. So there's like those kind of restrictions, then I think there's, there's other stuff that just like it helps us.

211
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:34,667
make a game faster and uh you know be there's like less options and we've like restricted our like

212
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:40,292
the set like if you're building with legos you like have to build a certain way and you have

213
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:45,656
to do certain things and you can get a lot of creativity out of legos you can make almost

214
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:52,261
anything right um but like because of that uh i think it helps like you you just don't have like

215
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:55,304
the sprawling of it could be anything in the world what do we do

216
00:19:56,732 --> 00:20:02,937
That applies behind the scenes too, like mechanically, and with the code base that you work with as well, the same kind of constraints come into play in a way.

217
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:09,423
Might have frozen here.

218
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:14,187
We'll be right back in one second. I think we have a frozen webcam issue.

219
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:20,049
So I guess this is a great time if you have any other questions to take your time typing them out.

220
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:20,769
Oh, are we back?

221
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:21,650
I'm back.

222
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,150
Cool.

223
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:22,671
All right.

224
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:23,731
I talked my way through it.

225
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:24,192
We're live.

226
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:27,914
Yeah, I heard that the it like it applies.

227
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:30,236
It doesn't we don't like our code base is very modern.

228
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,297
I guess that doesn't apply in that respect.

229
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:39,782
But you know the way we're the anything we're thinking about putting in the game is like we think with those intentions in mind like we can't.

230
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:46,414
We don't have blood in our game, but imagine we did, and a guy died and you couldn't spew blood, right?

231
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:53,001
Because it's like, we can't just splay 50 particles, that would be weird all of a sudden. So there's like that kind of thing.

232
00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:58,049
I think there's like the game Noida, I think it's called, where they have like, it's yeah,

233
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,130
every pixel simulated.

234
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,391
It's insane.

235
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:01,112
It's wild.

236
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:06,076
So I guess kind of building off of that, was that a deliberate choice when you guys went

237
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:06,817
into Shovel Knight?

238
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:11,101
Because you hear there's a very great Gamma Future blog, I can't remember the name of

239
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:16,005
now, but someone talked about how in 2020, they went and they made a game, an NES game

240
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:17,086
that could run on an NES.

241
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:19,628
They used all the kind of restrictions that you would expect in that era.

242
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:23,518
Did you guys ever think about doing something like that when you made this?

243
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:25,203
Or did you always kind of want to have,

244
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:28,052
here's what this kind of game could be in a modern development setting?

245
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:39,235
We always wanted it to be what the modern thing would be. We wanted it to be like, I guess, an old NES game is hard to get into. Like, it doesn't even fill the whole screen on your TV anymore, right?

246
00:21:40,156 --> 00:21:50,867
So we thought, like, our intention was like, we want it to be like the bridge between those games. We want you to be like, you feel very comfortable with this game because it feels modern in every respect.

247
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:58,138
But it has, you know. But you can also see why it is a retro thing and why you would,

248
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:03,464
once you play that, maybe you are more comfortable trying that kind of food kind of thing.

249
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:07,067
A good starter platformer.

250
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:08,088
Yeah, yeah.

251
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:13,406
Uh let's see uh oh here's one uh from Catherine uh who's been a frequent

252
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,568
question asker throughout GDC showcase so far so thank you Catherine.

253
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:20,370
Um what is it like to see your characters show up in a massive property like Smash?

254
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,111
Did you have any creative involvement in Shovel Knight's representation there?

255
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:27,619
I mean, it's like, it's unbelievable.

256
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:35,007
It's very, it's, I mean, I played millions of hours of Smash in my life, and to see Shovel

257
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:42,634
Knight appear in that is like, it's just so humbling and also extremely bizarre.

258
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,437
It's just lovely.

259
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:46,999
And yeah, we...

260
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:53,848
We were, I mean, we were involved in, like, making sure the character was, like, correct, right?

261
00:22:54,489 --> 00:23:00,658
And that kind of thing. But beyond that, it was, I mean, it's all Nintendo being brilliant.

262
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:07,067
Let's see, Kickstarter, I think I asked that one already.

263
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:11,611
Reading out loud is very exciting content for me.

264
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:23,839
Let's see, oh here's one from Stephen in chat wants to know what is the most challenging chapter of Shovel Knight's development for you. Is there anything that stands out that you can remember and kind of share with the audience today.

265
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:31,625
You know, I think the hardest part was like.

266
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:41,962
actually after we released and it was like oh now we like we like intended this was a real company

267
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:43,805
but now we like have to actually be one.

268
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,664
uh and like we're we gotta like finish this kickstarter stuff and we have to like sustain

269
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:57,569
our lives forever and figure out you know we have to like learn how to hire people and just the

270
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:04,034
just the like learning like i don't know we we had all gotten into video games to make games not

271
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:08,658
to like run a company or uh or none of us had any knowledge about like what

272
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,342
You know, oh, we have to like file taxes now for the company?

273
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:15,223
Jesus, like, this is so stupid.

274
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:18,005
Yeah, that kind of stuff.

275
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:21,408
And just like how overwhelming it was to be like.

276
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,831
I, we have, we've like made a thing that like, it's not just ours anymore.

277
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:26,231
Right.

278
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:31,316
Um, and I, we, we came from, uh, working on making games on contract

279
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:35,120
essentially where, you know, a publisher would hire the studio to make.

280
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,021
A game.

281
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:39,984
And once we released, once we finished the development on the game, it

282
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,346
might not even come out for a year.

283
00:24:41,905 --> 00:24:53,720
And when it came out, it would be like, we had nothing to do with it, you know, and so we like being involved in a game like forever is such a weird, weird thing for us to wrap our heads around as a collective.

284
00:24:54,615 --> 00:24:59,700
In that kind of like difficult transition from just a bunch of people making games to a company, do you think you're through that yet?

285
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,482
Do you still kind of feel at times like, oh my gosh, what are we doing?

286
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,845
I mean, I always feel like what are we doing?

287
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,027
I mean, I think everyone feels like that.

288
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:08,228
That's like part of life.

289
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:16,436
But yeah, I mean, I think there's like some, you know, obviously we figured out more things than we'd had figured out previously.

290
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,378
But I mean, even like I mean, earlier this year, we hired.

291
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:26,214
You know, we were like 16 people or something and we hired up to 24 and we're like, okay,

292
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,157
let's write like what the pillars of the company are, because we like didn't have those before.

293
00:25:30,337 --> 00:25:33,579
Because we hired so slowly over time, we like didn't need to do that.

294
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,521
And now we hired like eight people at once and they're like, what is this company?

295
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:37,161
Right?

296
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,843
And we're like, oh, well, we probably should like tell people what it is.

297
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:50,983
I guess kind of just talking about like the hiring process, because there are a bunch of, we've had a lot of questions from students in past chats and just people who are kind of new into the industry.

298
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:59,232
When you're hiring someone, bringing someone on the team, what do you look for and what do you kind of recommend people looking to get their foot in the door should do to get their foot in the door?

299
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:08,021
Um well if you've like never done anything before ever it's like it's hard to want to hire you I

300
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:11,663
mean it's like a classic problem I know I mean I know I felt this when I was in school it's like

301
00:26:11,683 --> 00:26:14,664
how do you get a job when you've like never had a job because they're like looking for job

302
00:26:14,704 --> 00:26:18,846
experience so I would say like the things you should do are make it look like you've done

303
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:23,348
something uh and are interested in what you're doing so it's like I don't know if you're going

304
00:26:23,388 --> 00:26:28,131
to get a job at to be a level designer you should show like a thousand Mario Maker levels you've made

305
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:33,032
Or if you're going to get a job as a programmer, you should have code you're proud of to show.

306
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:37,813
Or you should be like, here's a little tiny game I made, even if it's embarrassing.

307
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:44,395
It's like, I recreated Snake in Flash or whatever, and I coded it all myself.

308
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:46,856
That shows that you could start and finish something.

309
00:26:50,957 --> 00:27:03,928
And it's like, maybe you could add your own creative idea to like one dumb thing to it. And it's like, then it's yours and someone can point and say, well, they like, you know, they like this kind of thing and they're like, interested and invested in doing it.

310
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:10,274
So I think that's like important and I would say like, it should be clear that you like.

311
00:27:11,582 --> 00:27:18,007
are interested in the place you're applying to. So like do your research when you go in and like

312
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:22,670
show you know like look up the people that work there or like

313
00:27:24,457 --> 00:27:30,883
You know, like play some of their games or like really get into it because like that's that's what they're going to care about.

314
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:41,012
It's not like you, you will be part of the team and you'll fit in and you'll have ideas that like makes sense, and you'll be able to contribute in like a meaningful way even if you like suck right now.

315
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:48,679
Is that an adventure time quote or is like sucking in something the first step to being great at it?

316
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:49,700
Yeah, that's right.

317
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,921
All about the journey.

318
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,902
Let's see, I think I can get one more question in here. I'm just scrolling through.

319
00:27:55,922 --> 00:28:02,104
A bunch of people are curious about developing for the Wii U. Do you have any meaningful tidbits on that?

320
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:07,426
Don't do it. There's no reason to right now.

321
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:12,487
I don't know. It was, I mean, it's like one of the...

322
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,605
It's a weird, it was a weird platform to develop for.

323
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:22,006
Very quirky, right? Like did you guys have touch screen integration in what you were doing?

324
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:23,067
Yeah, yeah.

325
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:23,847
How was that?

326
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:28,328
Between the screens, yeah. I think it was, you just pick the, you could like pick your gear,

327
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:31,189
like what relic you had equipped and stuff quickly from that.

328
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,611
And yeah, it's, and we had Miiverse support too, which is a whole fun.

329
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:39,612
Alright Team Miiverse, we miss you.

330
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:39,752
Yeah.

331
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:46,895
Let's see, let's close off here with one from Kwan in chat who wants to know,

332
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:50,237
how is creating a game that has influenced modern 2D platformers

333
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,199
make you or kind of change your approach to new projects?

334
00:28:56,181 --> 00:29:02,885
Oh wow, well that's great to think that we could have affected anyone.

335
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:04,606
I don't believe it, I'm not on board.

336
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:15,040
I guess it really, it really I don't feel like it has affected how we're what we're developing next.

337
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:27,643
We sort of, you know, I think we said, you know, we said we wanted to make games that like make you love games and that's still are still what we're doing I guess the idea that it like it worked was like okay we'll keep doing it.

338
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:31,904
So that's sort of like where we're going it's like we want to do the same thing.

339
00:29:31,924 --> 00:29:35,625
But we're going to do it a different way we're going to like pull from different things that.

340
00:29:36,705 --> 00:29:44,690
You know, we think are being lost or forgotten, or people say are bad and we think they're like there could be a good version of it.

341
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:47,552
Like that's still what we're trying to do.

342
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:54,496
Sounds like a freeing way to move forward is just to kind of be like now we're gonna do it and got us here in the first place and just go with our gut.

343
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,017
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:29:57,238 --> 00:30:02,361
It's going to come out it's going to be fairly different I think, but you'll like.

345
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,773
Yeah, I think it'll be easy to see like, oh, this is like, obviously this makes sense for them.

346
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:13,357
Awesome. Well, looking forward to hearing that with some proper nouns in the future.

347
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:19,861
With that, we are completely out of time, but a few seconds over here. David, thank you so much
