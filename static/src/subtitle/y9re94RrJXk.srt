Hey Patrick, GDC Talk is in 15 minutes. Are you here?

2
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:11,592
Basically, I might have made a wrong turn at Albuquerque.

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:13,813
But you're all prepped and ready to go, yeah?

4
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:18,234
Yep, sure. Can I hear your opening again?

5
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:23,695
So, I talk about the Firewatch event system, which allows dialogue to interrupt-

6
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:26,055
Oh hey, Will, I found a free coffee!

7
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:31,773
Anyway, uh, the system allows dialogue to be interrupted without losing the conversation thread.

00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:32,594

00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:35,636
And how the object interacts work in the same system.

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,638
Then you were going to talk about our content authoring-

11
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:39,578
Magpie!

12
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,760
Tools?

13
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:45,742
Well, I have no idea where I am.

14
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:50,185
You need to get here like, uh, now.

15
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:52,727
I swear to god if you interrupt me like this on stage-
