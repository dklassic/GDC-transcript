1
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:15,919
As mentioned, my name is Roland IJsselmans, which is very hard to pronounce.

2
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,721
And I'd like to start this talk with an imagination session.

3
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:28,484
Let's imagine that we're all underwater, that the water has reached the top of this building

4
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:30,464
out of the San Francisco Bay.

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,702
And what if we left it there for over a thousand years?

6
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:43,705
Well, that's the same question we asked ourselves

7
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:44,926
five years ago at Guerrilla,

8
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,068
when we started with the concept team

9
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:48,909
on Horizon Forbidden West.

10
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,113
What would San Francisco look like a thousand years from now

11
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:59,437
if it had been flooded all that time?

12
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:06,647
To answer that question, we started looking at studies that showed how the water

13
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:11,350
would flood parts of San Francisco as the ocean started rising.

14
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,833
And what would happen if it would keep rising?

15
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:22,738
San Francisco would turn into a group of islands surrounded by the tops of buildings

16
00:01:23,038 --> 00:01:24,159
still poking out of the sea.

17
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,143
And I'm calling them buildings, but over time.

18
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:33,763
these concrete floors in these buildings would have collapsed.

19
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:40,229
Soil would have built up on top, allowing plants and trees

20
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:44,573
to get a foothold, eventually creating

21
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:45,854
pillars of vertical jungle.

22
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:49,498
But close to the water surface, where the waves hit,

23
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,461
buildings would be reduced to their mere skeletons.

24
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:57,648
And even further down, below the ocean level,

25
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:01,830
corals would start building on top of these ruins.

26
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:08,493
Building interiors would start looking like underwater caves,

27
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:12,615
with ocean tides slowly eroding the sharp edges

28
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:15,956
into round corners, and stalactites

29
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,558
starting to form at the ceilings of these lobbies,

30
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:20,799
like the one we have out here.

31
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:27,454
We also explored what the underwater landscape of San Francisco could look like.

32
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:33,177
How the remnants of the city could hold up underwater after all this time.

33
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,301
Like this iconic landmark, the Palace of Fine Arts,

34
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:43,204
which would largely be standing due to the use of natural rock

35
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:46,286
and marble, which is made out of.

36
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:53,630
Whereas the Ferry Building would have a much harder time.

37
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:57,353
Only the outer wall is made out of stone.

38
00:02:58,393 --> 00:03:00,694
All of its metal interiors would deteriorate

39
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,956
and collapse after a couple of hundred years underwater.

40
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:14,500
As for above the water, buildings would also collapse.

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,261
The buildings that have been built

42
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,282
with exterior metal structures like this one

43
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:23,343
would topple over and sand would start to accumulate

44
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:24,003
on the shores.

45
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,342
of the new shoreline of San Francisco,

46
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:33,227
covering what once were busy streets

47
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:36,990
with a thick layer of pearl white sand.

48
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,355
And although I personally wouldn't mind

49
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,197
having a GDC in a setting like this,

50
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,580
we didn't design it for this reason.

51
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:53,764
I wanted to show you this version of San Francisco

52
00:03:53,844 --> 00:03:56,766
as an example of what the world of Horizon looks like,

53
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,508
as it sets a stage for the different cultures

54
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:01,889
that live in the world of Horizon,

55
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,471
which brings me to the topic of this presentation.

56
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:10,113
Today, I'd like to take you on a tour

57
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,895
past two of the key settlements from Horizon Forbidden West

58
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,116
and share with you the design processes

59
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:19,498
we used when visualizing these settlements.

60
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,527
how we use the world of Horizon itself

61
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:27,250
to shape the design of these locations and its inhabitants.

62
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,773
Let me first talk a bit about myself.

63
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:37,575
I started at Guerrilla way back in 2002

64
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:42,198
after graduating as an industrial designer.

65
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:46,555
And for the past five years, I had the pleasure

66
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,576
of working on Horizon Forbidden West,

67
00:04:49,236 --> 00:04:50,997
the sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn.

68
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:55,319
And just out of curiosity,

69
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,979
I know the game has only been out for a month.

70
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,840
How many of you have already played it?

71
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:01,821
Wow.

72
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,583
And how many of you have already met the Tanakta New Taro?

73
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:08,164
Wow, okay.

74
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:12,133
Now, for those of you who haven't played the game,

75
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:16,994
let me explain briefly what Horizon is about

76
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:18,954
before we look at these settlements in more detail.

77
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:21,415
I'll try to do this as short as possible

78
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:22,795
to avoid any of the spoilers.

79
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:28,516
So Horizon Zero Dawn is set in a post-apocalyptic world

80
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,277
where nature has reclaimed the land,

81
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,157
just like in the example of San Francisco.

82
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:42,037
It's a world that for centuries was uninhabited by humans.

83
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,038
And when they returned,

84
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:48,820
they returned without the knowledge of their past.

85
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,001
They were basically thrown back

86
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:52,741
into a hunter-gathering society.

87
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:57,003
This life was made intensely difficult

88
00:05:57,343 --> 00:06:00,324
by the presence of these giant robotic machines.

89
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:04,546
These machines came in various shapes and sizes,

90
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:06,226
but they had one thing in common.

91
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:09,234
They were all extremely aggressive against humans.

92
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,515
This made settling in this world a big challenge.

93
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:22,316
Now let's look at one of these settlements in more detail,

94
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,957
the Utaru one, with their main capital plains zone.

95
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:29,498
One of the key defining elements for the Utaru

96
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:32,778
comes from the machines that roam the lands around them.

97
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:39,432
Each culture and horizon deals with the threat of these large machines in its own way.

98
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:45,457
For most settlements, these machines are perceived as extremely dangerous wildlife.

99
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:52,223
As a result, they fortified their settlements or placed them out of reach of the dangerous

100
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:52,463
ones.

101
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,288
But for the Otaru, we wanted to try something different.

102
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,392
We wanted to try a relationship with the machines.

103
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,839
where instead of hunting them,

104
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,500
they could grow dependent on them.

105
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:12,641
But how would you grow dependent

106
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,821
on a large machine like that?

107
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:16,862
Let me introduce the plow horn.

108
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:23,723
This is a machine that's designed to grow food.

109
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:29,484
A large machine that uses its horns to fertilize grounds

110
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:33,365
and is planting crops with the use

111
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,234
of those seed pouches you see on the right.

112
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,576
It's basically a combine of four lakes.

113
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,079
These plow horns can turn deserts into grids of,

114
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,080
in grid fields, in fields,

115
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,402
in fields in a grid-like structure,

116
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,322
filled with edible crops.

117
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:57,645
An ideal location for the otaru to settle in.

118
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:01,626
Right in the middle of their own natural food supply.

119
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:05,292
And besides food, they would also need resources

120
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,892
to build their houses and clothing from.

121
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:14,434
One naturally grown resource that they had an abundance of

122
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:15,634
would be bamboo,

123
00:08:16,874 --> 00:08:18,995
which is a great lightweight construction material

124
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:24,016
that we started exploring as using as a base material

125
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:24,636
for their huts.

126
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:30,198
With the bendable qualities of bamboo,

127
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:33,167
We started exploring sort of base shapes

128
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:42,815
as a basis to layer on top the different layers,

129
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:45,938
the external parts of the hut.

130
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,362
And for this, we took inspiration from a variety of weaving techniques

131
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:52,604
from all over the world.

132
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:55,946
One technique that we found very inspiring

133
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:59,049
was the way that ikebana baskets are woven in Japan.

134
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:01,467
just like this one.

135
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:05,491
These baskets make use of lacquered bamboo,

136
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:09,094
long strips that create beautiful patterns

137
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:13,038
along the outside with long, elongated, curved lines

138
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:15,460
all the way through.

139
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:19,223
And we applied this principle on a larger scale

140
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:20,284
to the entire hut.

141
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:24,368
And we were very happy with the unique look

142
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:25,168
that this was giving us.

143
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:31,450
Long curved lines make the hut feel like it was grown instead of constructed.

144
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,912
And with that idea we created a variety of these huts,

145
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:40,493
sort of like giant baskets for people to live in.

146
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:45,395
While retaining that feel of grown instead of constructed,

147
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:51,877
we started to look at different weaving patterns, each unique and

148
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,351
distinctive in its own way.

149
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,272
And we felt that we were hitting on a very

150
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:00,014
honorable and distinctive look for the otaru.

151
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:06,298
A downside of this type of weaving

152
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,700
is that it's not as protective against the rain,

153
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,101
but it does give really nice,

154
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:14,803
allows for light to play at night

155
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:17,104
through the holes in the weaves.

156
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:24,372
And not just the halls, also the bent surfaces play really well with the lights of the Otaru.

157
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:37,696
As for where to place these huts, we used the ancient ruins of a satellite array that was built when the landscape was still a desert.

158
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:43,737
Providing a safe place for the Otaru and adding even more to the unique feel of the settlement.

159
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,558
We started to block out their...

160
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,851
entire settlement on top of a 3D representation of these dishes,

161
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:55,771
designing a purpose for each and every dish,

162
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:58,012
like the one on the right,

163
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:01,093
which was made for cooking and storing food.

164
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:03,673
The one in the center, closer to the ground,

165
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:08,234
was their housing unit, housing dish,

166
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,076
where we designed these support structures

167
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:16,056
to connect the different huts together.

168
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:21,013
and create paths through the entire settlement.

169
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,377
Again, resonating those long, flowy lines

170
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:28,820
that we were inspired by, by the Ikebana baskets.

171
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:37,507
And those pathways eventually ended up on bridges like this one

172
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,329
that connected different satellite dishes.

173
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,792
And just like their houses, these bridges were designed

174
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:45,595
to look like they've been grown rather than constructed.

175
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:51,019
to underline the connection of the Otaru that they have with nature.

176
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:57,064
One of their dishes even still had a giant tree in that

177
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:58,485
that had grown there before.

178
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,969
And the Otaru hadn't removed it, but embraced it

179
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,411
and created the hanging garden around it,

180
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,892
where they grow their own plants

181
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,514
that they can't find close to their settlement.

182
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:13,036
And using these...

183
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:18,829
bamboo techniques, we expanded on not just creating their houses and their environment,

184
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:19,689
but also their props.

185
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:28,113
These decoration items and the two lights on the right that have this nice translucent

186
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:28,373
sheen.

187
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:36,176
Besides these lights, we also looked at tools to gather props from the fields that are surrounding

188
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:37,296
their settlement.

189
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:45,183
and again using bamboo to weave robot parts into handles.

190
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:50,426
Extending this thought onto even their clothing,

191
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:55,550
we experimented with creating hats out of woven patterns

192
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:57,231
and even sandals,

193
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:03,256
which works fine for these sort of stiffer elements

194
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:03,936
that people wear,

195
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:07,799
but it's kind of hard when you're doing the actual wardrobe.

196
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:19,689
to create bamboo that creates clothing pieces

197
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:23,231
that look comfortable to wear made out of bamboo.

198
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:28,535
By combining leaves and machine cables from robots,

199
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,498
we designed these togas that wrap around in a single piece.

200
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,521
Again, creating those longer curves that wrap around the body,

201
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,802
avoiding symmetry and straight parallel lines,

202
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,583
with curved belts and tear-shaped,

203
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:47,204
and a tear shape around their neck.

204
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:49,445
And at the center of that tear shape,

205
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:56,087
a decorated seed pouch to show their appreciation

206
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:57,488
of the plow horn.

207
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:01,989
And as an act of courage...

208
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,028
It's not only the plowhorns that affected the look of the Otaru.

209
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,710
To show their appreciation for these plowhorns,

210
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:14,112
they went into the field and acted as an act of courage,

211
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:18,035
put their hands on these plowhorns with colored paint.

212
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:19,316
So if you walk around the horizon

213
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:22,037
and you see a plowhorn with colored paint on it,

214
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:24,799
that's because the Otaru appreciated them so much.

215
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:28,962
This takes me to the second settlement

216
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:30,182
I'd like to show you.

217
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:35,437
which is the desert Tanakts, main capital, Skoldingspeer.

218
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:42,760
For the desert Tanakts, their origin story is almost the polar opposite.

219
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:47,383
They live in a land with hardly any resources.

220
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,244
And they had a hard time coming by,

221
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:56,187
which made them focus on a more combatant lifestyle,

222
00:14:57,128 --> 00:15:00,670
fighting the surrounding settlements, as well as the robots.

223
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,960
split off into three clans.

224
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,202
They have their origins, not with the machines,

225
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:13,784
but in the ruins that they had discovered.

226
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:17,366
The key defining element for the Tanakt

227
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,206
is a ruin from the old world,

228
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,928
a military memorial that the Tanakt had discovered.

229
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,771
A memorial that was built a thousand years ago

230
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:29,612
before the Tanakt had found it.

231
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:34,300
to honor a military unit that had battled against automated war machines.

232
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,722
These great warriors from the past became a key inspiration for the Tanakt.

233
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,785
But for the Tanakt, the only version of these great warriors

234
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:48,666
that they actually saw was distorted and mangled.

235
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:54,648
Corrupted data and degraded projection had warped the holographic images over time.

236
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,951
So we as a concept team started exploring

237
00:16:00,011 --> 00:16:02,272
how far we could take this broken projection idea.

238
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,534
How could these patterns,

239
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:09,256
how could we shape these patterns?

240
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:15,860
And initially playing with different just color distortion

241
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:21,563
and pulling at the different angles.

242
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:23,344
We still felt that this was too close

243
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:26,105
to the original image of a soldier.

244
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,474
So we took that even a step further

245
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:32,596
and almost like looking through a disoriented piece of glass

246
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:36,437
started warping these warriors into these extended figures,

247
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,538
distorting their shapes even more,

248
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:44,740
which created the interesting and unique silhouette

249
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:46,181
for these warriors.

250
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:51,803
From that, we took a color palette and a

251
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:59,369
a pattern style for each and every one of the different Tanakh tribes.

252
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,951
The Tanakhs are divided into three,

253
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,492
depending on the region that they live in.

254
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,915
There's the desert, jungle and mountain Tanakhs,

255
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:10,617
and they all reference a different group of military

256
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:12,218
that they had seen in the museum.

257
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,581
For the desert, it was the forward and aggressive...

258
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:26,033
operations, and we translated that into this outward motion

259
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:28,836
and this aggression in that face that you see there.

260
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:33,200
As for the jungle, they were more trappers.

261
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:36,743
So their symbology became more inward

262
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:38,625
with pointy fangs pointed inward,

263
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:44,150
whereas the mountain tanaks had more of a height and

264
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:53,843
secure locations high up in the mountains, which we associated with this

265
00:17:56,565 --> 00:18:03,552
more inward and concrete shape language. And from this, for the desert tenact,

266
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,371
we started exploring how this could look in motion,

267
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:11,394
how we could angle up some of these patterns

268
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:14,536
and distort them, combining different patterns,

269
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:16,537
trying to look for that aggression

270
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:20,079
that we felt was suiting for the desert tonight.

271
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:27,644
And these are some of the early sketches

272
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:30,846
that show sort of an overlay of those patterns

273
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:32,627
onto a character trying to mimic.

274
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:36,187
the distorted holograms that they had seen in the museum,

275
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:39,269
where color patterns were painted on

276
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,730
and even additional rubble plates were added

277
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:47,313
to suggest those distorted holograms.

278
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:49,494
For us, this wasn't going far enough,

279
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:52,736
so we created even bigger masks with stranger shapes

280
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:57,859
and had the colors of these patterns

281
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,080
tattooed all over their bodies.

282
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:05,786
resulting in masks like this built from robot parts

283
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:11,810
where they had edged off the different sides

284
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,412
to create the angular pattern

285
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:19,415
that you saw in those earlier studies.

286
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:21,436
Adding all those plates onto these warriors

287
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:25,239
made them look as intimidating as the one you see here.

288
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,723
And again, for them, we also created the tool sets

289
00:19:33,143 --> 00:19:34,364
to allow them to make these things.

290
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:37,287
This is as far as the characters goes.

291
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:38,809
What about their housing?

292
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:43,634
Well, they're fierce warriors.

293
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:45,276
They're not architects.

294
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:51,742
So if you can't build yourself,

295
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,224
why not use an existing ruin?

296
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,352
We thought that that would be an interesting base

297
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:57,413
for them to start off.

298
00:19:58,374 --> 00:19:59,295
As they are in the desert,

299
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:01,477
there's not a lot of architecture that you can lean into.

300
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,865
So we felt that this solar power plant

301
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:13,668
matched the view of the world that the Tanakh had.

302
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,031
It would serve them as a nice fortress,

303
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:19,613
surrounded by these shields that looked like

304
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:23,196
it was already protected, and a nice central tower

305
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:29,782
that they could see the lands around them very well.

306
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,925
So this was the base for their architecture and living,

307
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:35,126
but they still had to put huts on top of that.

308
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:36,408
And as I said,

309
00:20:36,428 --> 00:20:42,433
they're not that great builders.

310
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:46,268
And so we started as simple as we could.

311
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:48,770
Throwing together a bunch of beams,

312
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,171
like a game of Mica dough,

313
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:54,233
and tying them together at each intersection.

314
00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:58,415
And then filling up the spaces in between the beams

315
00:20:58,575 --> 00:20:59,576
with floors and walls,

316
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:02,977
allowing us to create these erratic shapes

317
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:05,839
that also supported the erratic look

318
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:06,860
that we had in the holograms.

319
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:11,022
As well as these nice overhanging rooftops

320
00:21:11,642 --> 00:21:14,003
for some much appreciated shade in the desert.

321
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:19,616
Going back and applying the color scheme

322
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:21,838
of the desert tanak that you'd seen earlier,

323
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:27,261
we finished them by painting them in their work colors

324
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:35,546
and arranged them around the central solar tower

325
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:37,668
that you see here.

326
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:42,736
By arranging them in this manner, this outward way,

327
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:44,757
we started to create a silhouette

328
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,939
that almost looked as aggressive as a silhouette

329
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,961
and almost like an explosion frozen in time,

330
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,664
which we felt was very appropriate

331
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:57,507
for the aggressive desert tanak.

332
00:21:58,087 --> 00:21:58,988
As we were arranging this,

333
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:01,690
we noticed that some of the concrete

334
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,593
didn't fall in line with the tanak thinking of decoration.

335
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:07,675
So we started chiseling into that.

336
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:11,292
seeing if we could bring back some of the patterns

337
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:12,432
also on their outside walls.

338
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:16,934
And then again, using paint and simple wooden decorations

339
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:19,615
to bring that in line with the holograms

340
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:20,475
that they'd seen before.

341
00:22:22,316 --> 00:22:24,936
And at the center of this settlement,

342
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:27,517
there's of course a combat ring,

343
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:30,638
a combat arena where the Desert Tanak train

344
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:32,079
to become even better warriors.

345
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:35,400
And overlooking this combat arena

346
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,001
is their main area.

347
00:22:40,672 --> 00:22:41,533
is their commander's hut,

348
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:45,554
where he can oversee the progress,

349
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:47,315
where the commander can oversee the progress

350
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:49,136
of the Tanakhs in the village town.

351
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,880
We had people come in and question us

352
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,041
when they were looking at this,

353
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:01,802
saying, well, that's quite a reach, Roland,

354
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:08,505
when you're having this entire culture based off

355
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:12,184
A glitch, a misinterpretation of the past.

356
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:15,706
Isn't that stretching things a bit thin?

357
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:23,148
Funnily enough, this happens in our world as well.

358
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:29,350
Where we've interpreted old Roman sculptures

359
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:34,652
to be white, and this white color has resonated

360
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:35,513
in so many of the

361
00:23:38,612 --> 00:23:40,633
derivatives that we've created from that time.

362
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:42,774
Things like even the White House

363
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:45,115
might have had more color

364
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:47,416
if we had found at an earlier stage

365
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:48,757
that most of these Roman sculptures

366
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,118
had actually been brightly colored

367
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:51,359
instead of

368
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,641
polished white to look better in the museum.

369
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:15,281
I've been talking a bit too fast, but this already brings me to the end of my presentation on the two tribes in Horizon Forbidden West, Plainsong and Scalding Spare.

370
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:26,523
And I know my jet lag has been killing most of my this presentation, but I hope you have gotten a bit of an insight of the way that we work at Guerrilla.

371
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:31,457
but some of the decisions that we've made along the way

372
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:36,701
and how most of our design choices have been made

373
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:38,723
not because we think it looks cool,

374
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:42,506
but because we sort of go out into the world of Verizon

375
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:43,827
and discover as much as we can,

376
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:49,571
driving the visual choices that we make at the concept team.

377
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,216
Thank you very much for listening to me being very nervous.

378
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:14,878
That concludes my presentation.

379
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:20,003
Are there any questions?

380
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,550
No, I'm sorry, there.

381
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:28,773
Hello there.

382
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:29,213
Hi.

383
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:33,415
As we've just seen, that can get really, really detailed.

384
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,478
How do you know when you've reached a point of like,

385
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:36,839
this tribe is detailed enough,

386
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:39,242
we have eight other tribes to look at?

387
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:42,266
Because it's very impressive

388
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:44,188
how far in the detail you've gone.

389
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,171
Yes.

390
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,854
Often when we think we've gone far enough,

391
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,950
we get replies that we haven't gone far enough yet.

392
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:58,411
Because once you start modeling these things,

393
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,292
and it's easier when you're doing things

394
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:01,692
that are based on reality,

395
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:02,932
but if you're designing your own things,

396
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,533
you need that amount of detail

397
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:07,974
to actually show in the models that end up in the game.

398
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:11,534
So oftentimes I think, wow, we've done a really great job.

399
00:26:12,595 --> 00:26:13,615
Here's the entire package.

400
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,995
They come back and say, wow, all this weaving,

401
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:16,656
how does that work?

402
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:18,916
Which material is what?

403
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,696
So we go back and look at it again.

404
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:25,348
So by the time that that is quiet,

405
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:27,070
we know that we have done our jobs.

406
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:28,612
Gotcha, thank you.

407
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:29,173
Yes.

408
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:34,557
Okay.

409
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:36,477
Dude, I love the game.

410
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:38,878
Amazing art direction, especially, you know,

411
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:40,719
shipping on PS4, PS4 Pro,

412
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,280
and the PS5 must have not been easy.

413
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:44,441
In the art direction,

414
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,222
what was the hardest thing that y'all faced?

415
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:50,443
Because like any other generation, cross-platform,

416
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:52,164
like what was the hardest thing y'all did?

417
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:59,287
Thank God that wasn't a worry on my discipline.

418
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,762
We design things to maximum resolution or maximum amount of detail,

419
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:12,006
so that we were always able to answer any questions with regards to what material,

420
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:17,790
how things look at, not a microscopic level, but quite a detailed level.

421
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:24,295
Yes, so I think this is not a question for me.

422
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:28,038
It hasn't made it any harder for our team.

423
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,812
Hi there.

424
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:35,784
Hi there, amazing talk.

425
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:39,965
I really loved seeing the amount of concept art

426
00:27:40,145 --> 00:27:42,685
throughout the talk and just how creative it all was,

427
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:44,246
which I guess was what the talk was about.

428
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:47,966
I come from indie, and in the world of indie,

429
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:50,467
you have a lot less resources for stuff

430
00:27:50,527 --> 00:27:52,247
like having concept art for everything.

431
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:54,728
So in my experience, we just end up like

432
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:58,889
making stuff on the fly that might not necessarily

433
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,469
have a concept ready for it.

434
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:02,970
So I'm wondering, in your world,

435
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,070
how much of this...

436
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:07,853
Does everything get a concept? Everything that gets made?

437
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:13,558
Or are the concepts more to guide, like, maybe one version of something, and then the modeler expands from there?

438
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,781
That's a very good question.

439
00:28:17,702 --> 00:28:19,223
Although we do a lot of concept art,

440
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:23,046
we don't concept art the complete world.

441
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:27,269
So we create style guides for each of the different tribes.

442
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,033
And those usually have a showcase of a main settlement

443
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:34,314
and what that could look like, like I've shown you today.

444
00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:38,137
But there are many derivatives of that,

445
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:41,700
where we try to include as much information.

446
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:53,658
In the style guide, sometimes not just technical about how a layout would look, but also how some of the people would act, how they greet each other and things like that.

447
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,399
To inform anyone working on this.

448
00:28:58,298 --> 00:29:02,723
how to best construct or build derivatives and settlements.

449
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:07,469
So there's kind of a trust moving forward to the next levels in the pipeline.

450
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,532
Yes, yes.

451
00:29:09,752 --> 00:29:13,577
It's too big a world to completely sketch out at that level of detail.

452
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:14,117
I see.

453
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:14,538
Thank you.

454
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:14,638
Yeah.

455
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:15,599
Yeah.

456
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:22,186
I'm going to take it.

457
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:23,867
You also heard that, right?

458
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:25,627
I guess.

459
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:28,349
I really love the designs you've got,

460
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:32,791
and especially the research that goes into San Francisco

461
00:29:32,891 --> 00:29:34,972
and building in that water level.

462
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:38,814
And I'm just curious how much of the concept and designs

463
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:40,675
come from a game design standpoint

464
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:43,997
as well with having the flooded sections

465
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:46,198
and how that leads into gameplay.

466
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:48,159
How much of that falls back onto you as well?

467
00:29:53,702 --> 00:29:56,764
So the question is how much of the gameplay is involved

468
00:29:56,884 --> 00:29:59,766
at an early stage when we're designing these things.

469
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:01,067
That happened quite early on.

470
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:06,971
Our initial, we had taken lessons from our previous game,

471
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:11,094
Horizon Zero Dawn, where some of these larger cities

472
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:18,379
had less activities to allow this time to create spaces

473
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:21,821
that were game design friendly as well.

474
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:24,338
So in conjunction with game design,

475
00:30:24,678 --> 00:30:27,540
we looked at the different spaces and where to open up,

476
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,701
and where certain opportunities for

477
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:34,164
certain types of gameplay would work really well.

478
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:35,585
Thank you.

479
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:45,434
Thank you, sorry, wait, one second.

480
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:47,995
I don't wanna take all the applause.

481
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:51,156
There's been a lot of concept artists creating this work

482
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:53,537
inside and outside our company,

483
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:56,038
so please applaud one round for all of those artists.

484
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:56,318
Thank you.

485
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:56,518
Thank you.

486
00:30:56,578 --> 00:31:02,160
Thank you.

487
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:02,361
Thank you.

488
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:02,561
Thank you.

489
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:02,761
Thank you.

490
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:04,181
Thank you.

491
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:04,381
Thank you.

492
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:04,581
Thank you.

493
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:04,822
Thank you.
