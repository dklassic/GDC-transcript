1
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:06,052
Thanks, Matthew.

2
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:08,993
So yeah, today I'll be talking about the making of Little

3
00:00:09,193 --> 00:00:13,756
Inferno, or the many mistakes we made while making Little

4
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:15,717
Inferno, because there were many.

5
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:20,319
So quick overview, Tomorrow Corporation is myself, Kyle

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,980
Gabler, and Alan Blomquist.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,982
We met roughly 10 years ago at grad school at the

8
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:27,743
Entertainment Technology Center in CMU.

9
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:33,046
After that, we all kind of got jobs and internships at various EAs.

10
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:39,612
I went to EA Tiburon all the way down in Orlando, and Alan and Kyle were kind of local here.

11
00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:47,959
Kyle left to start 2D Boy with Ron Carmel in, I guess, like 2007 or 2006 or something like that.

12
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:52,343
They made World of Goo, which I'm pretty sure everybody's heard of here.

13
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:56,212
And then they brought on Alan to help with the Wii port.

14
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:02,874
I stayed on at EA and worked and pitched Henry Hatsworth,

15
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:06,276
kind of internally, which was a DS game,

16
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,277
about a British guy that drinks a lot of tea

17
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:10,918
and gets in a giant robot and kills things.

18
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,667
Um, so what is Little Inferno?

19
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,310
Uh, Little Inferno is kind of like that Yule Log,

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,213
uh, station that comes on for 24 hours,

21
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:21,294
kind of around November.

22
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,956
Um, I don't know if they have that anymore,

23
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:26,558
but you can see it on YouTube for much, much longer.

24
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:28,860
Um, but being that this is an indie title,

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,622
we couldn't just be inspired by one thing.

26
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:37,666
Miyamoto is famous for drawing inspiration from all of his hobbies and you know that kind of stuff so

27
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:43,890
I guess gardening kind of led to Pikmin and wandering around in caves and killing bats

28
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,753
with a sword led to Zelda and then getting ripped I guess led to Wii Fit.

29
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:57,298
We were kind of inspired by ordering lots and lots of things from Amazon Prime,

30
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:02,764
and then waiting and tracking the shipments to see when they would arrive,

31
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:03,845
and then getting them and opening them.

32
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:06,528
It's all very exciting, as anybody who orders things knows.

33
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,816
So, Little Inferno is kind of the mixture of the ULOG with Amazon Prime, in a nutshell.

34
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:23,784
Um, and in the game you basically buy and burn lots and lots of toys that you get from the Tomorrow Corporation catalog.

35
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:32,572
You buy toys with Tomorrow bucks, you burn them, they give you more coins, and that kind of increasingly escalates in a bizarro economy.

36
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:37,428
And packages take anywhere from five seconds to five minutes to arrive.

37
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,755
We kind of found that adding that delayed time increases delayed gratification.

38
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:47,657
Also gives items some value because when we didn't have any time,

39
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:51,661
people would just buy everything at once, chuck them all in, and not see what anything does.

40
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,964
Each item does something kind of unique, so we wanted to highlight that.

41
00:02:55,824 --> 00:03:02,308
But you can speed up the shipment times with tomorrow's stamps, which you get as either random drops or from

42
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:03,849
completing combos

43
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:06,390
Our combos are all kind of like

44
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:14,114
Wordplay so the movie night combo is burning like a TV with a corn on the cob which makes popcorn

45
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:18,397
and then they get really obtuse later on so you'll have like the

46
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:23,360
Burning the uncle Sam fireworks with the rushing nesting doll is like the Cold War combo

47
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:27,238
So yeah.

48
00:03:27,478 --> 00:03:30,119
But, you know, despite the fact that this is kind of like a really weird game,

49
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,299
people seem to like it.

50
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,040
We've since then released on six platforms.

51
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,561
We were there for one of the five indie titles for the Wii U launch,

52
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:40,761
which is pretty awesome.

53
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,301
We're on PC, Mac, Linux.

54
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:47,762
Last year we popped up on iPad and then later on iPhone.

55
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,442
And then at the end of the year we're up on Android.

56
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:52,483
So that was pretty cool.

57
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:57,995
Also, it's in seven languages, so if you live in Europe,

58
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:59,916
chances are it might be in your language.

59
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,638
There were some IGF nominations last year,

60
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:08,260
and we ended up getting the Technical Excellence Award,

61
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,860
which was pretty awesome for Alan,

62
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,241
since that was like a one-man thing.

63
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:17,084
It was totally confusing for just about everybody

64
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:21,386
who played it, but it did sell over a million copies,

65
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:22,946
so that was cool.

66
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:29,530
So yeah, why make a game about something so mundane about just throwing shit in the fireplace and burning it?

67
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:36,816
So we noticed this bizarre trend in games, kind of, I guess, around the time we were thinking of this,

68
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:43,382
where there are these really cutesy kind of games with, like, really nice repetitive tasks,

69
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,603
and they stretched on kind of endlessly.

70
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:49,749
and some of them have weird economics

71
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,730
of indentured servitude and stuff.

72
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:56,775
And we're like, man, what if all of these awesome games

73
00:04:56,915 --> 00:05:00,118
had a horrible secret underlying them

74
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:02,461
that's just festering below this cute facade?

75
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,644
So we decided to make Little Inferno,

76
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:07,445
and I will play the trailer.

77
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:12,130
Oh, audio?

78
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:29,428
Oh, hang on. Do we have? Is that my system? Hang on a second. Uh oh, computer fail. Sorry guys.

79
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:37,032
Um, should I restart quickly? Nah, it's okay. Anyway, um, yeah, thanks Windows.

80
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,501
I would sing it if I knew the lyrics that good, my voice was good, but anyway, it's

81
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:47,324
basically children, if you haven't seen this stuff on YouTube, but it's about kids singing

82
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:51,487
about throwing things in the fire and breathing in the flaming potpourri.

83
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:54,909
Which they're about to do right now.

84
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,611
Um, there we go.

85
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:01,189
It's a little inferno just for me.

86
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:02,949
Anyway, yeah, so it has a really, like,

87
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,330
the trailer has a very, like, kind of cute facade,

88
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,010
and now the kid's like,

89
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,910
oh, but I thought burning things was bad.

90
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:11,171
Well, you're right, but up above the chimney,

91
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:14,092
way up in the sky, it's been snowing for years,

92
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,032
and we just don't know why.

93
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:17,093
Sorry, Kyle.

94
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:21,834
Our world is getting colder, but, oh, man.

95
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:23,094
All right, sorry, it's been a while, guys.

96
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:25,234
But there's no need for alarm.

97
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:27,755
Just sit by your fire, burn all of your toys,

98
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:28,795
and stay warm.

99
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,138
So here's where we get dark.

100
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,686
Sing Little Inferno just for me.

101
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:45,111
I've got the fireplace that burns at 100 million degrees.

102
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:48,935
It's Little Inferno just for me.

103
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:52,838
And that's it.

104
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,591
So yeah, we released this decidedly grim trailer

105
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:02,612
that starts off very cutesy, kind of like Log,

106
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:03,792
if you guys remember Ren and Stimpy.

107
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:08,414
And so Little Inferno is kind of a game that has a secret.

108
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:11,235
And everything in the game kind of

109
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:12,796
drives towards that gradually.

110
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:14,977
So the whole game is supposed to make

111
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:17,198
you feel really uncomfortable the more you play it.

112
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,398
So you start off with the first catalog burning really

113
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:23,740
innocuous things, like letter blocks, batteries that explode.

114
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,962
corn on the cob that spits out kernels of the Internet's popcorn.

115
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,643
By the second catalog, you're burning kind of stranger things.

116
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:36,905
So, like a leprechaun that gives things kind of leprosy,

117
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:39,406
or an unhappy elf that has dynamite strapped to his chest,

118
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:43,587
or a cat that shoots out huge amounts of excrement and launches upwards.

119
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:50,751
And then, as you start playing, you start to get letters from other people in this world.

120
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:57,534
There's Miss Nancy, who owns Tomorrow Corporation, and made Little Inferno,

121
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:01,657
who kind of walks you through, and she's like a Paula Deen-Oprah mashup.

122
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:07,380
There's the weatherman, who kind of tells you about how the weather is increasingly getting colder and colder.

123
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:12,455
And then there's your neighbor, or a girl you find out is your neighbor, spoilers, Sugar Plumps,

124
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:18,838
who, as the game progresses, she's kind of the character that's one step ahead of you and is playing the game.

125
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:25,921
And eventually, as you become better and better friends, even though she's sending you letters and you don't really have a way to respond,

126
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:31,648
She burns down her house and dies, and the game gets kind of dark there.

127
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:37,154
So that's like 90% of the game is constrained to this one view,

128
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:41,418
and you're basically looking at this fireplace for the vast majority of your playtime,

129
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,642
in between, you know, looking at this bright, cheery catalog.

130
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,670
And that was pretty intentional.

131
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,191
Towards the end of the game,

132
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:51,532
once you get your last catalog,

133
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:54,995
you get a letter from this mysterious character

134
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:58,378
who kind of hints, who starts convincing you

135
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:00,079
that maybe you should burn down your house.

136
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:00,960
And we'll see.

137
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:03,121
I do need sound.

138
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:05,724
Actually, sound is less important for this one, it's cool.

139
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:08,205
Oh, you're gonna pipe it in?

140
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:09,627
All right.

141
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,588
Technical assistance here.

142
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:15,904
I don't know if that's going to do it.

143
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:21,913
Anyway, so you get a letter from this mysterious shadow

144
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:27,702
character, who tells you, now we've got to skip ahead.

145
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:28,443
No, it's cool.

146
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,688
go really fast. This is a problem with a lot of slides.

147
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:44,330
So you get a letter from this character. She kind of tells you how to escape your house.

148
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:51,812
Anyway, so you get all of the items that you've been kind of gifting to your friend Sugar Plum till this time.

149
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:56,093
You burn them together. It triggers this magical tenth combo which overrides the

150
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:59,153
fire safety controls in your Little Inferno fireplace.

151
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,996
and all of a sudden everything goes kind of crazy

152
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:10,243
and you find yourself outside of the fireplace in this outside world.

153
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:12,826
There we go, eventually it's going to come crashing down.

154
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:22,195
So suddenly we go from this fireplace, this really casual game, and now it's an adventure game for like the last 10%.

155
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:29,876
And there's an entire town that you're kind of just walking around. It's pretty deserted. There's like nobody out there except for you.

156
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:34,697
Everybody's inside playing with their little inferno fireplace.

157
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:40,658
You meet the mailman, who's this guy that's been actually delivering all of the mail to you behind your back.

158
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:44,159
You never turn around and there's this guy that just kind of comes in and drops off all the packages.

159
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,209
And you just kind of wander around until you get to Tomorrow Corporation,

160
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:56,696
which you eventually find your way in by talking with the gatekeeper and get past their high security.

161
00:10:57,982 --> 00:11:00,565
and just wander down the hall until you meet Miss Nancy,

162
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:03,647
who tells you that the world is gradually freezing,

163
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:06,049
and the whole town, everything is kind of freezing to a halt,

164
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,213
just before she jumps into her giant pink rocket ship

165
00:11:10,313 --> 00:11:13,255
and takes off, presumably to better pastures.

166
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:17,179
And then you kind of just leave the outskirts of the town

167
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:20,682
and go off with the weatherman, jump in his balloon,

168
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:25,386
and sail off to kind of a better future, we hope.

169
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:32,764
So that was mistake number one. It's really risky to put all of your cool content at the end of the game.

170
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:41,374
Which will go directly into mistake number two. So we overthought everything.

171
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:46,750
So back when we started working on this game in like 2010,

172
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,851
or maybe 2009 even, we were like, man,

173
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:49,892
this is going to be six months.

174
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:53,033
Our working project name was My Fireplace at that point.

175
00:11:53,273 --> 00:11:54,834
Ended up taking like two and a half years.

176
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:57,615
So yeah, like five times the length.

177
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:00,356
And back then we were thinking like, man, it'd be great.

178
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,897
So you buy digital stuff, you throw it in this fireplace,

179
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:03,997
and then there are catalogs, and you

180
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:06,358
can buy stuff from the catalogs, and then they'll ship to you.

181
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,279
And then like the.

182
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:12,082
items get really weird. You have like flowers that pop up. There's like popcorn.

183
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:16,906
There are these wooden idols that kind of sing when you burn them. And then one day you get a

184
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:21,209
package from the mailman which is a button that allows you to leave your house. And then you can

185
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:26,913
wander around in this town. It's a snowy kind of town. And you quickly discover it's been snowing

186
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:29,856
for as long as anybody can remember. And, uh,

187
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:37,990
And then there are all these characters, there's Miss Nancy, there are these Christmas carolers, there's another player, there's the mailman, and a bunch of other ones.

188
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,372
Which kind of sounds familiar.

189
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:45,955
Um, except, yeah, we went crazy and overscoped.

190
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:47,896
So that was the game we wanted to make.

191
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:48,977
That was the game we ended up making.

192
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:51,258
In between, we kind of went a little nuts.

193
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,940
So first, we were going to do this whole giant world.

194
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,481
And it was going to be mostly an adventure game.

195
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:59,142
And then it was going to be, there's

196
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:00,783
this weird fireplace mechanic.

197
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,704
And you're trading items with people in town.

198
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,905
And we would have all of these adventure game-y puzzles

199
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:05,946
because we like adventure games.

200
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:09,109
Maybe you have to launch the school bus into the stratosphere,

201
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:12,992
or talk with these time-traveling futurists.

202
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:15,474
There's all sorts of kind of odd things.

203
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:18,597
But your character is trying to get to Tomorrow Corporation

204
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:20,018
because they burned down his house

205
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:21,679
and he's got a legal case against them.

206
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,582
And we had all these weird characters

207
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:26,503
that you were going to meet in town.

208
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:31,107
There's Back Alley Bob, who deals with bizarre off-market items,

209
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:32,448
and this game nerd character.

210
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:35,133
the original developers of Little Inferno, who are now

211
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:41,118
homeless and crazy, and this coffee guy, who's

212
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,319
also a motivational speaker.

213
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,301
And then there are all these fabulous Tomorrow Corporation

214
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:49,465
employees, and more developers, and people just kind of

215
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:50,445
standing around outside the gates.

216
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:54,048
And then we started working on maybe looking

217
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,170
at different art styles for this world

218
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:58,572
that we were excited to build.

219
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:00,822
So really early stuff.

220
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:03,064
And then we were like, man, that's not really enough.

221
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:07,427
So let's add the subway, which travels through time.

222
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:11,010
And in there, you will buy tickets.

223
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,593
And you will use those tickets to advance,

224
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:16,355
to accelerate time so you can get your packages faster.

225
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:17,516
So all of a sudden, you know.

226
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:21,603
need to go a couple minutes or like a couple of hours or some days and yeah

227
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:25,544
why not just hop on the the timeline express we were gonna have this really

228
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:31,146
crazy puzzle where I guess the last thing you got took 10 years to ship and

229
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,627
you either had to figure out some way to break the train to do it or maybe set

230
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:39,129
your system clock forward by 10 years but then really again nobody's gonna

231
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,229
want to do that so

232
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:48,921
And then of course there's a home decorating metagame because, you know, badges and virtual hoarding is kind of what makes games.

233
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:51,682
So obviously we need a home decorating section.

234
00:14:52,923 --> 00:15:05,188
And then we're going to turn this into like a weird Katamari-style game where you're burning shit in a fireplace and then that kind of burns down and suddenly you're in the neighborhood and you're burning bigger and bigger things and then you're in the city and you're burning bigger and bigger things.

235
00:15:05,682 --> 00:15:06,923
And then finally, you're at the world,

236
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:08,684
and you're burning planets, and satellites,

237
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:09,645
and abstract concepts.

238
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:12,467
And it just kind of got out of control.

239
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:17,151
But fortunately, the Wii U became this thing.

240
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:21,274
So we kind of took a long, hard look at everything

241
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:23,235
and just went back to kind of the original,

242
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:27,919
tightened everything up, and made it in time.

243
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,860
So that was cool.

244
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,609
Um, yeah, mistake number three.

245
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:34,990
So we made a game that no one could talk about,

246
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,452
um, including us, which is a problem.

247
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,593
First of all, it was kind of a weird mechanic

248
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:40,894
that nobody had really done,

249
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:42,575
and when you say, what do you do in the game?

250
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,416
Oh, you throw things in a fire and you burn them.

251
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,696
Oh, that great, that sounds like fun.

252
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:48,839
So it's kind of like, that's kind of a weird concept,

253
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,162
but then there's also this kind of secret ending to it

254
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:54,324
that nobody, we didn't want to tell anybody about

255
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,626
to spoil it.

256
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:59,048
And then there was also, this was also kind of at a time

257
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:00,389
when indie games were being ripped off

258
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,470
kind of wholesale rampantly.

259
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,532
So we're like, maybe somebody will beat us to market

260
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,634
with their own fireplace simulator,

261
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:08,256
weird game with Amazon Prime.

262
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:10,178
So we should probably keep that under

263
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:11,319
until we have something.

264
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,003
So, after working on this for two years,

265
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:17,525
we finally started to release details about the game

266
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:19,366
less than five months before launch.

267
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,969
So we announced it on June 28th.

268
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:24,191
Just the name and this image, nothing else really.

269
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:28,014
About four months in, we released the trailer

270
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,677
with the little musical teaser

271
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,699
that I sang for you guys.

272
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:38,750
And then, less than which, we started to get interviews

273
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,852
because, man, that was a weird teaser.

274
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:43,675
So people wanted to know more about it.

275
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:46,157
And we were able to talk about parts of it.

276
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:48,800
But we couldn't really telegraph the end.

277
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,803
So we started using really unclear language.

278
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:53,044
Something else is burning.

279
00:16:54,978 --> 00:17:02,103
And then after that we ended up spilling the beans to Nintendo Power, since we were shooting to be there.

280
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,946
And we were really expecting that somebody would spoil the ending,

281
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:11,629
and we were really concerned about, like, man, maybe that'll get out, that'll be kind of horrible,

282
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,571
nobody will play this thing that we've been working on forever.

283
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:18,714
And we gave them all of the images for the outside stuff, which they put in there.

284
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:19,855
I mean, they're there.

285
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:21,888
It's kind of cool.

286
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,009
They never mention it, and nobody actually ever

287
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:25,810
thought that any of that was going

288
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,071
to be used in the final game, I guess.

289
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:30,333
Just scouring the internet, nobody made that leap,

290
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:31,334
which was awesome.

291
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:35,776
And then finally, we launched in November.

292
00:17:36,877 --> 00:17:39,279
And we kind of waited to see what people were going to do.

293
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,960
What are people going to say about this weird thing

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,540
we've made?

295
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,142
And we were kind of hoping for like,

296
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:48,919
a crying game effect, because their whole marketing thing was,

297
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,201
if you know the ending, don't spoil it, don't ruin it.

298
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:53,201
And we were like, yeah, that's great.

299
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:54,642
That's exactly what we should do.

300
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,623
And that works really well for movies, because, like, man,

301
00:17:57,683 --> 00:17:59,044
you just do the same thing.

302
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:01,405
You sit there, and you watch something, and that's it.

303
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,266
But in a game, obviously, oh, the ending is really cool.

304
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:06,967
But up until then, what are you doing?

305
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:07,747
I don't know.

306
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:08,468
You're burning stuff.

307
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:11,749
So we started to get reviews and comments

308
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:14,230
from people who had played it and had enjoyed it.

309
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:17,333
But all of their comments were kind of like,

310
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:21,576
well, this is what you do, but you don't really want

311
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:23,918
to know what you do or what this game is about.

312
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,079
I don't want to spoil it for you.

313
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:25,799
You don't want to know.

314
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,361
And that may have hurt us.

315
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:31,962
So there's that.

316
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:34,463
Oh, this is a fun one.

317
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:36,664
So if you, mistake number four,

318
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:38,485
the message will be missed or misunderstood.

319
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:42,046
So if you have a message in your game,

320
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:45,548
which ours does, Kyle likes messages,

321
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:49,009
chances are, you know, people aren't gonna get it.

322
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:50,430
And that's, you know, that's cool, that's fine.

323
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,471
So a lot of people thought the game was about global warming.

324
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,270
And we have a lot of cool illustrations from people.

325
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,232
And I guess it could be, but the truth

326
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,032
is we wanted to make a fireplace simulator,

327
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:06,593
and it doesn't really make sense to put that in a world

328
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:09,335
where it's always hot or where you have regular seasons.

329
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:11,675
So you kind of want to set that in a place

330
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:12,656
where it's cold all the time.

331
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:15,637
So the world was kind of bent around that.

332
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:17,778
So, yeah, not about global warming.

333
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,959
And then there was like, man,

334
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,220
is this a commentary on freemium games?

335
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:26,742
Because people hate freemium games, I guess.

336
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:30,183
And, I mean, not really.

337
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:32,224
We did like the bright aesthetics,

338
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:34,845
and some of the loops are kind of fun.

339
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:38,747
But I think a lot of people just don't like freemium games.

340
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:40,047
you know, that's cool.

341
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,988
A lot of people I know that play them

342
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,328
just kind of try to play this metagame

343
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:46,069
where how much of the content can they see

344
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,149
without actually spending money.

345
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,369
So no, it wasn't really about that either.

346
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,610
I mean, what we were trying to convey

347
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,651
was kind of something just a bit simpler.

348
00:19:56,871 --> 00:20:01,232
Indie games tend to deal with the team's neuroses,

349
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,912
and ours was, we were all hitting 30,

350
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,953
so we were starting to feel like old men.

351
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:12,795
and we were kind of concerned just about time and making most of it and not wasting it.

352
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:19,737
So it was really more about just kind of getting un-rutted, getting out of your kind of rut,

353
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:23,678
whether it was a job you hated or a bad relationship or anything like that.

354
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:28,960
In Little Inferno, everybody's just kind of stuck doing the same thing over and over and over

355
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,541
and don't realize there's kind of this whole thing outside of it.

356
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:36,483
this whole world. And after a while, people started to pick up on that message.

357
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:42,807
Aaron's Signal was a prominent YouTuber, I guess, kind of got it dead on.

358
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:46,809
And we started to see other articles that were kind of also grasping onto these themes.

359
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,832
So that was cool. And then eventually, we even saw YouTubers

360
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,434
started kind of correcting each other.

361
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:58,736
So yeah, the first guy thinks that the Earth has...

362
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:03,000
going to freeze up and the sun is getting bigger so everybody has to escape to other

363
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,380
planets.

364
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:06,504
And the other guy's just like, nah man, you're totally wrong.

365
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:10,469
So thanks, brigiers.

366
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:18,031
And then our last mistake was not changing the background,

367
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,814
which was kind of, I mean, we,

368
00:21:22,054 --> 00:21:23,775
I mean, obviously we're making a fireplace simulator,

369
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:25,377
so it should be in a fireplace.

370
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:29,640
But that led to other problems.

371
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:33,303
So the game feels like a really small game,

372
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:36,465
which, you know, to some degree, it's a fast game,

373
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:37,446
you're supposed to be able to play it

374
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,827
in about the length of a long movie,

375
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,850
so you can see the kind of cool twist ending and everything.

376
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,533
But we ended up actually making a lot of stuff for this game.

377
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:48,796
So we have something like 150 unique assets.

378
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,237
All of the art is different.

379
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:52,019
They all have their own sound effects, VFX.

380
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,823
You know, everything has kind of a unique reaction,

381
00:21:56,443 --> 00:22:00,667
which is way more assets than World of Gouhad and, you know,

382
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:01,888
Henry Hatsworth.

383
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,873
So it's just a lot of stuff to make.

384
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:08,195
The tech was also kind of nuts.

385
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:14,820
So every item has bones and physics and joints

386
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:19,784
and can explode or freeze or disintegrate or affect

387
00:22:19,824 --> 00:22:20,305
gravity.

388
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:22,646
They all have unique kind of things that they do.

389
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:24,948
You can pick up a lot of them and just shatter them outright.

390
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:29,922
They also have to know when to blacken and deform,

391
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:33,963
depending on how close they are to our fluid simulator.

392
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:36,744
And then, you know, from there,

393
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:38,724
to make the fire look believable,

394
00:22:38,744 --> 00:22:40,704
the fire has to have, like, you know,

395
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:43,185
good fluency, also heat distortion,

396
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,945
also particles, also a whole bunch of other stuff.

397
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:48,826
And this was all created by one guy,

398
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:50,986
cause he's, Alan's pretty rad.

399
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,561
So it was like, man, yeah, there was a lot of stuff

400
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:58,123
kind of going in there to make this fireplace simulator.

401
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,805
But kind of at the end of the day, it was like, man,

402
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:03,585
you're still looking at the same screen.

403
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:05,186
And when you burn something, it eventually

404
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:07,167
disintegrates and disappears, and you're just

405
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:08,027
back at the same screen.

406
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:09,908
So what can we do?

407
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:13,610
And our kind of fix was to divide the fireplace up

408
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,630
into three distinct phases.

409
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:19,133
In the first act, when it's just you by yourself before you figure out you have neighbors,

410
00:23:20,156 --> 00:23:22,382
it's just a fireplace, there's nothing else kind of there.

411
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:27,749
And in the second act, when you make friends with your neighbor, Sugar Plum, she gives you curtains that are fireproof.

412
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:32,931
So, alright, it's already cozier, and maybe we can change the ambience slightly.

413
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:38,454
And then when she burns down her house, the fireproof curtains are kind of destroyed.

414
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:40,976
And, you know, it's the third act, it's kind of somber.

415
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:44,638
You're supposed to be kind of wondering if, you know, if there's something else going on,

416
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:46,959
and, you know, feel her loss and everything.

417
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,900
So the fireplace kind of reflects that as best it can.

418
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:56,529
But at the end of the day, none of that really helped.

419
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,672
The fact that we were probably linked to one environment

420
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:02,975
made a lot of people feel that this was a very small game.

421
00:24:02,995 --> 00:24:06,798
And that just in the end probably

422
00:24:06,838 --> 00:24:09,320
ended up hurting us quite a bit there.

423
00:24:11,175 --> 00:24:14,257
Um, but in the end, uh, you know, we made something we were, you know,

424
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:17,079
Little Inferno was a pretty great, uh, experience for us.

425
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:21,942
Um, we got a lot of cool, uh, emails from people that had played it and said that

426
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:25,765
it helped them get over a relationship or, you know, they cried at the end, or,

427
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:28,887
um, maybe it made them rethink kind of what they were doing with their own

428
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:32,850
lives, which is kind of weird and awesome for a fireplace simulator.

429
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:33,671
Um.

430
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:43,519
And, like, on a personal note, for Tomorrow Corporation, it kind of helped Alan and I get out of our previous jobs and into the exciting world of indie development.

431
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:50,907
And now that we're basically done with ports and localization and everything, we're just looking forward to moving on to the next thing.

432
00:24:51,928 --> 00:24:52,989
So, that's it.

433
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:05,854
So yeah, I don't know if we have any questions.

434
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:07,456
Show the trailer with sound.

435
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:13,525
I want to know how you know if the miss is actually effective.

436
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:13,925
How the, say again?

437
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:18,172
How do you know if the missing is real misses?

438
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:19,394
The misses were real misses.

439
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:30,047
Oh, we saw a lot of comments where people were either confused why it doesn't work on

440
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:34,669
their like 10 year old Razer phone or why it's not a free Flash game.

441
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:36,790
So if you...

442
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,410
Say again?

443
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:44,633
Oh sorry, the question was how did we... it was in regard to the last mistake with the

444
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:48,235
background, how do we know that the people felt that the game was too small?

445
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:49,855
So...

446
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:52,116
Oh, any of the mistakes.

447
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:57,520
I mean, I guess we can't really know.

448
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,783
I do know that when we overthought it and it took forever, that was definitely a mistake.

449
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:05,465
We wish we could have taken those years back and made some other stuff too.

450
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:06,086
That would have been cool.

451
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:11,950
Um, but, and, and the last one for sure, just from the way people have reacted to it over

452
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,230
time.

453
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,833
But, um, yeah, I guess that's our best guess.

454
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:20,035
Um, anybody else?

455
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,591
There are also microphones up here.

456
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:25,891
I don't know if they work.

457
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,332
Do you have any stats on how many players reached the end?

458
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:31,753
Say again?

459
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:33,253
Do you have any stats?

460
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:34,874
On how many players reached the end?

461
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:37,915
No, we could not track that, unfortunately,

462
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:41,756
without probably getting kicked out by piracy stuff.

463
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:42,716
I don't know.

464
00:26:46,077 --> 00:26:48,858
So when you kind of mentioned the scope,

465
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:52,379
kind of how some of this original idea was so huge.

466
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,138
and how maybe because of the box you guys were given for time and what have you,

467
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:01,506
you ended up kind of focusing so much more on just the burning mechanic.

468
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:02,789
Do you feel like...

469
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:09,309
the previous design was really large in breadth, and then you started evolving the design in depth,

470
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:15,171
in kind of one core mechanic, or was it always going to be as deep as it is in that mechanic?

471
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:19,392
Oh, for the burning? Yeah. Yeah, we kind of wanted the burning to be...

472
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:22,273
The burning was meant to be about as deep as it is now,

473
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:26,114
and that was... just took way longer than we were expecting.

474
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:34,799
So we would have loved to have built a world and done this kind of huge thing, but with like three guys and only two of them doing art, and only one of them doing art well, my art kind of sucks.

475
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,461
It was just too much for us to take on.

476
00:27:38,882 --> 00:27:43,405
And it was also really good to focus. I don't know if having that would have added a whole lot more.

477
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:44,225
Cool.

478
00:27:49,828 --> 00:27:51,810
Cool. Time for one last question, maybe?

479
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:56,133
All right.

480
00:27:56,153 --> 00:27:56,653
Oh, sorry.

481
00:27:56,693 --> 00:27:56,914
You, sir.

482
00:27:56,934 --> 00:28:04,139
How long did it take to get the front half

483
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,540
to be able to be installed, compared to the back half?

484
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,620
Just merge them together?

485
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:06,801
Jeez.

486
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,723
Well, the front, I mean, the burning took the longest,

487
00:28:09,863 --> 00:28:10,303
obviously.

488
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,044
Just the technology kind of took,

489
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:14,986
that in itself was probably a couple of years.

490
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:18,108
And nailing in on the back half was,

491
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:19,570
I mean, it's quite a bit faster.

492
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,991
It's known that it was probably a few months, I guess.

493
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:23,893
But we were doing all this kind of stuff in parallel.

494
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,173
So, cool.

495
00:28:25,735 --> 00:28:31,344
Alright, thanks for coming guys and remember to write us online if you like it.
