Hi, I'm Dr. Scott Kirchhoff from the Volition Institute for the Advancement of Awesome.

00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:08,956
Have you ever had that problem where you have too many layers of alpha and you have to render them in sorted order resulting in

3
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,597
intense pain in the CPU region?

4
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:14,421
Maybe you've heard of weighted blended order independent transparency

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:21,927
but were scared to try it because it wouldn't work with additive alpha. If so, you might need to try our new modification to weighted blended OIT.

6
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:24,700
which extends the algorithm to work with additive alpha,

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,322
and eliminates many other unpleasant side effects.

8
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:31,544
Or, perhaps, you've been unsatisfied with your infinite light clip planes.

9
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:35,726
Would you like to just slap down some finite rectangles and have them block light appropriately?

10
00:00:36,206 --> 00:00:39,588
If so, you might need to try our light blocker and portal solution for

11
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:42,509
tile-based lighting compute and light propagation volume GI.

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,812
Or maybe, just maybe, the artists near and dear to your heart have requested so many lighting features.

13
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:50,694
that your Lighting Compute shader can barely sustain an occupancy of 2.

14
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:55,819
If so, you might need to try our feature spectra optimization for Lighting Compute shaders.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,145
If you or your loved ones have experienced any of these symptoms, come see my talk, Rendering
