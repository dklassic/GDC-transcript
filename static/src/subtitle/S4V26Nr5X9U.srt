1
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:10,583
Hi you guys, thank you so much for coming. I'm Peter.

2
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:20,906
And I guess before we begin, I'm supposed to remind you to please turn off your phones and no videotaping.

3
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:25,027
Because I definitely don't want to be on YouTube.

4
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:30,268
And I just have to say, doesn't this look like my grandpa's pair of pants?

5
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:35,385
It looks like I'm wearing huge pants up here.

6
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:37,391
It's like, you know.

7
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:50,577
Let's see here, I want to thank GDC and Colleen Mickey and my good friend Lee Petty who is

8
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:55,542
one smart and creative guy for inviting me here today.

9
00:00:55,962 --> 00:01:00,467
I'm going to be walking back and forth because that's just how I have to do it.

10
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:01,788
I'm not a podium guy.

11
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:09,774
So, I just wanted to start off by saying I started my gaming experience back in the early 90s,

12
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:19,381
working for LucasArts, and I worked on, you know, Monkey 2, Data Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango.

13
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:20,242
That's where I started.

14
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:31,592
And then I left my dream job three years later and moved my family to San Juan Island up in the Puget Sound in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

15
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:34,653
And I've been freelancing there for over 18 years now.

16
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:41,336
Still making games, designing games, but primarily moved into the movie side.

17
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:51,279
So, for example, I designed Rio, and Rio 2, that's coming out, and Monsters University is my recent one.

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,621
So, let's see, I still draw on paper. I'm really low-tech.

19
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:01,463
I draw on paper. I know, like, three things on Photoshop.

20
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:10,068
And I'm happy to say that just last year I put together my first website.

21
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,070
I know, unheard of, right?

22
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,892
Go Freelance. Thank you, thank you.

23
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:20,957
Go Freelance, what, 18 years ago and not make a website or a blog or something.

24
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:27,001
And I held out, but then I was forced to do it because of the other Peter Chans that surfaced.

25
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:31,584
Because it turns out my name is very common. It's like John Smith.

26
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:40,571
Thanks to the other Peter Chans, it forced me to put together this website so people

27
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:42,213
don't get us mixed up more and more.

28
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:47,817
And so if you're here to listen to the other Peter Chans, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

29
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:56,411
And I happen to teach concept design at this awesome animation

30
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,073
college in Denmark and the students there

31
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:03,757
always ask me variations of the same questions, right? Questions like

32
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:06,399
What feeds your creativity?

33
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,322
How do you produce art?

34
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:17,106
How do you come up with original ideas and thoughts when you've got busy brain or you're running on empty?

35
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:21,926
And one of the toughest questions I've been asked was,

36
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:25,949
what's the one thing that keeps you from doing your best work?

37
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,871
And I couldn't answer that right away.

38
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,513
And I told him, look, let me think about it on my way home,

39
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:35,996
and when I land, I'll answer that.

40
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:44,763
So, I realized the answer to what's the one thing that holds me back from doing my best work are my fears.

41
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:52,640
And so, I started exploring these questions and the word authentic kept surfacing, right?

42
00:03:53,020 --> 00:04:00,627
And so I decided to force myself to answer, what does it mean to me to have authentic

43
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:01,407
creativity?

44
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:06,672
And so by exploring, I decided I'll turn that into my topic for today.

45
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:09,815
And so before I dive into that...

46
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:18,842
Let me just share with you, and this was Lee's idea, share with you what it's like to be in my studio for the week.

47
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:24,845
Okay, so I'm a pre-production guy. I come in super early, usually the script's not finished.

48
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,667
Maybe it's just an idea from the project leader or art director.

49
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:38,611
And he usually gives me this big assignment, like create the world.

50
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,835
But make it believable, make it functional, and make it different.

51
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:51,100
Make it original as much as you can. Yeah, hard assignment, right?

52
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,005
So Mondays are usually reserved for research. I hit the library. Yes, the library.

53
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:02,710
I collect my books. I surround myself with reference material. I start reading because reading

54
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:04,732
gives me pictures in my head.

55
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:13,378
that's not in front of me. And then I supplement by going through my morgue file that I've collected over the years and

56
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:18,422
I use the internet to supplement the rest of my research. And I surround myself with this.

57
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:23,825
Then Tuesday and Wednesdays are the days of problem-solving. I've got to

58
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:29,930
accomplish my assignment and then at the same time I've got to listen to this part right here.

59
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,431
I've got to listen to my gut, my intuition.

60
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:39,080
And sometimes my intuition and the assignment are in line.

61
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,382
And those are like the sweetest weeks to work.

62
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:45,406
And then there are times where my intuition and my assignment clash.

63
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:50,069
But I trust this part in me because it knows me best.

64
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:56,875
So I will try to shove this square peg into a round hole thing.

65
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:00,458
And there's a little bit of compromise, but eventually I shove it in there.

66
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:07,617
Thursday comes around, I have to psych myself to draw, because I can think forever, but

67
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,759
they're not paying me to do that, they're paying me for this piece of paper.

68
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:17,882
So I've got to make myself draw this out, take this half-baked idea, make it readable,

69
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:23,524
and hopefully, with all my reference and everything, it makes sense.

70
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:30,087
Then Friday morning, I've got to put the final touches on it, and if it's a bad idea

71
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:33,609
I highly recommend just making the presentation look sweet.

72
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:35,990
But if you can,

73
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,672
but if and then I send it off an hour before the conference call I send it off and

74
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:47,115
then my drawings get blown up in a dark room somewhere in some studio and

75
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:51,877
usually in that room is the director, the producer, and five other incredibly talented

76
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:53,077
designers.

77
00:06:54,868 --> 00:07:00,790
I'm on an island, so I can't see their faces, I can't see their body language, right?

78
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:04,672
So I don't know if my ideas are any good as I'm pitching it.

79
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:10,614
So I have to just trust that my ideas are worthy.

80
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:17,076
And basically, I'm just on my back, belly up, totally open.

81
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:20,357
And it's scary, but I have to go for it.

82
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,357
Okay, so that's like my week.

83
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:23,638
So I asked.

84
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:30,536
So, as I reflect on the creative process, I ask myself, you know, what are the things

85
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:31,157
that I value?

86
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:33,481
And three things come to mind, alright?

87
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,101
Here they are.

88
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:39,009
Number one, I practice being vulnerable.

89
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:49,259
Folks like Pema Chodron, Thich Nhat Hanh, BrenÃ© Brown, Seth Godin, even Steve Jobs,

90
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:58,504
Neil Gaiman, and a great designer like Stefan Sagmeister, these guys say, in their own words

91
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:07,168
of course, innovation, creativity, personal transformation, connection, and great learning

92
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:09,429
all begin with being vulnerable.

93
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:18,661
Okay? Number two, I practice what I call being good with discomfort, because when I'm brave

94
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:26,565
and I reach outside my comfort zone and I work through my fears, there's opportunity for growth.

95
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:35,970
Okay? And number three, I practice what I call making space in my head for creativity. Making space.

96
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:44,828
Because how can I connect with my intuition and listen to my passions if I'm always overwhelmed

97
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:48,632
or overworked and exhausted and running on fumes?

98
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:51,335
And I'll talk more about that later.

99
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:52,757
But here's the thing.

100
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,849
I don't want you looking up here like I've got this all figured out.

101
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:59,932
I am not an expert in anything.

102
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:01,433
I'm like you.

103
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:09,099
I wake up every morning, I do my best, and if I fall on my face, thank God the sun rises

104
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,761
the next day and I can try all over again.

105
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:17,506
So let's start with number one, practicing vulnerability.

106
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:19,308
So we have...

107
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:26,195
this primal emotion, and it's called shame.

108
00:09:27,196 --> 00:09:32,321
And shame is all around us, and unfortunately, it is a big part of our culture.

109
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:37,828
And, for some of us, it's also part of our upbringing.

110
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:45,051
Shame is all about having fears and our fears come from this place this like

111
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:52,218
smear of a brain that sits at the stem of our spine and that's our lizard brain and

112
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:58,944
That's where our fight-and-flight mechanism comes from right and the lizard brains job is to keep you fearful

113
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,909
It wants to keep you feeling safe and secure

114
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:16,402
And you know those fears, those fears of feeling not good enough, the fear of not smart enough,

115
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:23,548
not clever enough, not fast enough, the fear of being wrong, the fear of failure.

116
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,343
not fitting in. And my big hang-up that I finally let go last year was the fear of being

117
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:41,226
found out as a fraud. The fear of being found out as a fraud. And I wish I had more time

118
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:46,508
to talk about that. That would be like another keynote like 12 years from now. But for me

119
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:53,371
a product of my environment, I ended up being prone to shame. So some people, not all,

120
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:56,439
some people who are who are shame-based,

121
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,380
go down the perfectionist path.

122
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,641
Right? And we all know there's no such thing as being a perfectionist.

123
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:14,242
Right? But I didn't know. I was young. I was inexperienced.

124
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:22,883
And when you're a perfectionist, you're like being a really awesome magician.

125
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:28,182
The one act that you're really good at is the sleight of hand, right?

126
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,864
It's like look over here you guys look at my perfect drawing

127
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:37,666
Right. Look at my perfect life. Look at my perfect job. Look at my perfect kids

128
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:42,247
Look at all my accolades, right? But don't look over here. Don't look at my other hand

129
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:47,269
Don't look at my fears. Don't look at my weaknesses. Don't look at my addictions

130
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:53,231
Don't look at my shame, right? And when you stuff your fears down there you put up

131
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:56,596
protective armor in front of you.

132
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:10,519
And that protective armor, that veneer, that ego, facade, those masks that are in front

133
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:14,920
of you, that's to keep people at a safe distance, right?

134
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,701
Because that's the shield that you want people to look at and to believe, not this stuff

135
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:20,921
down here that you're hiding.

136
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:30,093
So, the problem is that armor prevents any kind of connection, and that's what it's all about, isn't it?

137
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:30,733
Connection.

138
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:37,614
We do art so we can connect with the audience on the other side, with the people we want to connect with.

139
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:39,014
Right?

140
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:42,875
I mean, that's what we desire as humans, right?

141
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:43,515
Is connection.

142
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:45,155
That's why Facebook is so popular.

143
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:49,536
So, to be vulnerable is to soften.

144
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:50,756
And you're visual people.

145
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:52,857
Just imagine being softer.

146
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:59,229
being kind, being honest, being compassionate to yourself first.

147
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,191
Alright?

148
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:07,313
Because the more vulnerable you are, the more courageous and brave you will become.

149
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,035
I know it sounds counterintuitive, but it's true.

150
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:12,076
You've got to trust me.

151
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:18,939
So to be true to yourself, my suggestion is to be more vulnerable.

152
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:24,480
by shedding those protective armors one layer at a time.

153
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:31,903
Or at least pound them down so then it's like paper thin.

154
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:39,404
So can you imagine not having to worry about those protective layers? Can you imagine that?

155
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:44,306
How liberating and free that would feel. How light you would feel. You don't have to switch

156
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:50,508
them out when you go to like a family reunion or when you have to present your artwork in front

157
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:55,170
of all your peers or when you're on Facebook and Twitter. You don't have to switch out your masks.

158
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:03,633
Right? You can actually be you. You can actually be authentic. That'd be pretty sweet.

159
00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:07,106
So by shedding means reaching in,

160
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:10,389
means reaching into that dark corner,

161
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:16,032
pulling out that fear and exposing it

162
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,575
and let the sun shine on it.

163
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:22,957
And while it's out, you want to label it.

164
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:26,079
You want to name it and say it out loud.

165
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,700
You don't have to say it in your head.

166
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,341
That's not good enough.

167
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:33,181
Even if you're alone in your room, you've got to say it out loud.

168
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:37,002
Because by saying it out loud, you're taking the power out of it.

169
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:39,683
And guess who hates that?

170
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:41,703
The lizard brain hates that.

171
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:44,564
Because the lizard brain wants to keep you secure.

172
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:51,466
So the lizard brain hates it when you say it out loud because it's no longer hiding

173
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:51,866
anymore.

174
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:53,647
It's no longer controlling you anymore.

175
00:14:55,766 --> 00:15:00,087
So a long time ago, when my kids were really little, and don't forget I was a perfectionist,

176
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:07,589
and I was setting really high expectations, and my kids were just being kids, they would

177
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,111
do something and it would trigger something inside me and I would get angry, get mad.

178
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:21,874
And years and years would go by, and then one day, my kids, being kids, did something

179
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:24,795
and it triggered something deep inside me and I saw red.

180
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:32,443
And fire came out of my mouth and I heard my dad's voice for the first time and I freaked out.

181
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:36,425
And I knew right then and there I had to go and do something about it.

182
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:43,948
And because, hey, I want to be a responsible parent, I don't want to pass my crap down to my kids.

183
00:15:44,008 --> 00:15:45,209
It's got to stop with me.

184
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:46,709
Right?

185
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,252
So, you're probably thinking, what does that have to do with creating art?

186
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:55,333
Well, for me, parenting and creating art aren't that different.

187
00:15:55,942 --> 00:16:00,685
You have an idea, you bring it to life, you help it develop, not knowing how it's going to end.

188
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:06,949
All right, so the point I'm trying to make is, if I kept my protective armor up,

189
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:14,373
and I stuffed my anger issues down, would that be fair to my kids? No way.

190
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:21,277
So, let me ask you, if you kept your protective armor up, and you stuffed your fears down,

191
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,498
would that be fair to your creative self?

192
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:30,704
So you see, you, the authentic you, deserve to be truly seen.

193
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:32,665
You are worthy of it.

194
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:37,787
You guys good?

195
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:42,630
So let's go with practice number two.

196
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,952
Practicing being good with discomfort.

197
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:53,615
So it's entirely natural for us to be fearful with the unknowns, but that's because the

198
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:55,656
lizard brain is part of who we are.

199
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:03,050
So, it wants us to play things safe, because safe equals no pain.

200
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:09,412
And I'm not talking like life-threatening pain, I'm talking about the pain or the feeling

201
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:13,473
that you get when you are outside your comfort zone.

202
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:24,897
So when you're not feeling any pain, that means you're not doing anything new.

203
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:26,278
You're not learning anything.

204
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:34,894
So the advantage to moving past our fears and taking more risks is seeing it out as an opportunity for growth.

205
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:47,440
So being good with discomfort means to stretch your comfort zone to a new, more creative normal.

206
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:54,643
The goal is to eventually, with practice, become more comfortable with change.

207
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:56,484
It's not so scary anymore.

208
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:01,701
Sure, there's always a chance for failure when you take risks,

209
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:05,165
but there's also a really good chance of succeeding too.

210
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:06,546
You have to just go for it.

211
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:10,631
Like Neil Gaiman says,

212
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:12,913
to make glorious mistakes.

213
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:17,399
And that's because making mistakes means you're doing something.

214
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,800
It's all good.

215
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:28,604
So, I have many examples of being good with discomfort, but I think the best example is

216
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:33,809
just me standing here in front of you right now, because for one, I'm vulnerable, I'm

217
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:40,195
sharing some personal stuff with you, but also, my friends know that I'm an introvert,

218
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:44,319
so for me to be up here is kind of a big deal, it's really difficult for me.

219
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,486
But I know deep down that what's important is this connection that I'm making with you right now.

220
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:57,752
And also that I know at the end of the day I'm going to learn something about myself.

221
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:00,235
Something good will happen.

222
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:10,325
But being good with discomfort all the time is not sustainable.

223
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:19,737
Every once in a while, you're gonna have to stop, take a break, have some solitude to reflect.

224
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:29,548
and give yourself a quiet break and let your inner critic focus on the present moment.

225
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:34,774
You know, have some nurturing time for yourself. Ask yourself how you're feeling.

226
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,396
You know, slow down. Have a cup of tea,

227
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:40,179
sit by the window and ask how you're feeling.

228
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,601
And if

229
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:47,854
You did really well that week, go out and get yourself a scoop of ice cream because you deserve it.

230
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:52,596
And if you're wounded because you had a really rough critique or you had a rough week,

231
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:56,258
still go out and get yourself a scoop of ice cream, you still deserve it.

232
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:57,318
Right?

233
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,981
And then you can recharge your batteries, get back on the horse,

234
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:07,982
and get ready for the next round.

235
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:10,483
Because if you're serious about your art,

236
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:14,708
you will always be seeking out that discomfort.

237
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,752
Which segues nicely to number three.

238
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:27,256
Practicing making space in our heads.

239
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:33,620
We live in a world that is, I mean, you guys know,

240
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,602
we live in a world that is overwhelming, overstimulating,

241
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,303
full of distractions.

242
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:47,364
full of worry and stress, full of clutter, visual clutter, material clutter, mental clutter, right?

243
00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:53,308
So, how in the world can we come up with original thought and even listen to our intuition?

244
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,892
Sometimes our brains are like an episode of hoarders, right?

245
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:04,097
It's just so full and we're really lucky if there's like a clear path that runs through our mental house.

246
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:11,617
So, to make space, let's look at our mental house.

247
00:21:12,057 --> 00:21:16,218
Imagine there's a spare bedroom in the back of your head,

248
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:17,758
and you clean it out.

249
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:21,879
Nothing on the walls, nothing on the floor,

250
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,020
it's all white.

251
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,620
Sounds good, right?

252
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,341
You get open a few windows, let the breeze go through.

253
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:30,342
And then there's an air shaft that runs from

254
00:21:31,242 --> 00:21:33,603
that bedroom down to your heart.

255
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:35,152
or your gut.

256
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:41,396
So now you've got these two rooms, there's a clear path between and for clear communication.

257
00:21:43,477 --> 00:21:45,258
Guess who's going to find out about this plan?

258
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,299
Your lizard brain.

259
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,223
And he's going to throw in distractions, and he's going to sabotage this idea.

260
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:58,266
And I know you know what I'm talking about because how many times have you decided to

261
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:02,628
do something and then at the last second you pull out and you stop?

262
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:04,597
That's blizzard brain.

263
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:06,817
Making you safe.

264
00:22:08,138 --> 00:22:09,138
Keeping you fearful.

265
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:13,158
Doesn't want you to have any experiences or learn anything new.

266
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,520
Right? That's like artists who draw the same style all the time.

267
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,980
Or people who always just draw the same subject matter all the time.

268
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:24,981
Right? It's cozy in there.

269
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:26,621
It's familiar.

270
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,342
They get a lot of kudos.

271
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,856
But what happens if someone knocks on his door and says,

272
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,377
hey, I want you to design this game for me.

273
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:37,840
But it's this style, and it's maybe

274
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,961
this kind of subject matter.

275
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:42,063
Pretty scary?

276
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:44,905
Is it worth taking?

277
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,570
So here's my suggestion in making space.

278
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:55,512
It's what Leo Babauta calls.

279
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:04,932
media fasting, and some others call it taking a digital Sabbath.

280
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:07,593
So this is called media fasting.

281
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:10,514
Media are all the things that you love, right?

282
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:17,536
Watching movies, surfing, social networking, playing video games, right?

283
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:24,971
And then fasting are those diets, those detox diets that cleanses your body of toxins.

284
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:28,812
Some of you have probably tried it with some success.

285
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:35,674
So what I'm proposing is cutting back on your media intake, cutting back on your media intake

286
00:23:36,654 --> 00:23:42,435
for short periods of time to set healthy limits and do things in moderation.

287
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:45,416
I didn't say cut it out completely.

288
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:47,377
I love technology.

289
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:58,157
But you're adults, I want you to figure out how to set those limits, how long you should

290
00:23:58,177 --> 00:24:01,279
be doing this, you know, set some boundaries around them.

291
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,583
Because as you know, when you overindulge in something, there's usually a consequence

292
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:10,484
that follows, so moderation is good.

293
00:24:12,465 --> 00:24:14,606
Notice that I did not mention reading books.

294
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:21,407
Neil Gaiman says reading books, especially fiction, is a great way to exercise your imagination

295
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:21,807
muscle.

296
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,948
That's why you always hear people say, oh I prefer the book over the movie.

297
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:30,249
It's because your imagination is a powerful thing.

298
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:32,389
Can you imagine tapping into that?

299
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:42,331
I know this works because I practice this most of my life.

300
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,849
And I also challenge my students.

301
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:51,911
And the serious students always come back to me the following year and tell me basically the same feedback.

302
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:58,534
I always get, I feel like my days are longer, I feel rested, and I feel more creative.

303
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:02,916
And these guys are like 20-year-olds, right?

304
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:11,680
And if they've already figured out how to set healthy boundaries around their media intake, then they're off to a really good start.

305
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:18,228
So let's say you guys are brilliant, you guys decided I'm going to give this a try.

306
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:24,350
Your mental house, you've got that clean bedroom in the back of your head and you've kept it

307
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,250
pretty clean for a long time.

308
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,271
Now it's time to fill it.

309
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:33,332
And you want to fill it with cool experiences.

310
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:38,413
Because what's nice about experiences, they don't take up any room.

311
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:49,470
And I believe if you want to be original and different, you'll need to add something to

312
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:49,910
the mix.

313
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,272
You're going to have to add something to your art.

314
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:55,814
And that's where your personal experiences come from.

315
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:59,297
Because the way each of us sees the world is very distinctive.

316
00:26:00,337 --> 00:26:04,220
By doing this, you've just automatically made your art yours.

317
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:08,437
you've automatically made your art unique

318
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:10,998
because only you have had that experience.

319
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:12,659
We have it.

320
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,000
Sorry about that.

321
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,641
That was very dramatic.

322
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,403
But only you have had that experience, you see.

323
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:28,906
Because I know that this is true because when you are tired,

324
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:31,167
and I'm guilty of it, too, because I'm human,

325
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:34,448
when we're tired, we go into automatic mode.

326
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,662
We grab a couple things off Google search, we do a mashup and we call it good.

327
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:44,285
No pain, we're just rehashing ideas.

328
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:54,171
So who do you think, I mean, why do we think so many movies and games always look alike?

329
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:55,672
Who's in charge?

330
00:26:55,752 --> 00:26:57,813
Is Elizabeth in charge or are you in charge?

331
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:05,054
And I believe that that's where our personal experiences come in.

332
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:06,775
It's kind of like set us apart.

333
00:27:07,215 --> 00:27:11,737
So having experiences can be traveling the world, and I know that's expensive sometimes,

334
00:27:12,217 --> 00:27:16,539
but it could also mean just walking around a block to have an experience.

335
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:19,781
Look, we have the Golden Gate Bridge here, right?

336
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:23,623
People travel all over the world to come here and walk across the bridge,

337
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:29,285
and we live here, or you live here, and you see the bridge, but you've never walked across it.

338
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:30,206
And it's free!

339
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,823
Or you go grocery shopping, you go to Safeway, and rather than taking a right turn to Safeway,

340
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:43,025
you take a left turn, you'll still get to Safeway, you just happen to see something else along the

341
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:50,587
way. And that experience, you might see something that you can take and put it into your artwork.

342
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:54,669
You see what I'm saying? Just shake things up a little bit.

343
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,962
And having experiences also means picking up new skills.

344
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:02,664
Take a cooking class, right?

345
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:04,125
Take a sewing class.

346
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,748
Figure out how to do your own electrical, your own plumbing.

347
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,453
And if you, you know, mess it up horribly, that's when you can call the professional.

348
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:16,375
But at least you gave it a try, right?

349
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:18,517
And in that process, you've learned something.

350
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:22,940
Because fresh ideas come from that.

351
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:25,262
You just need to start doing.

352
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:34,280
A while back, I went to visit my friend Tim Schafer.

353
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,481
I don't know if you've heard of him.

354
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:37,522
He makes games.

355
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:42,244
And I visited Tim, and he took me out to dinner.

356
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:47,846
And we had a really nice dinner, and after that, I thought we were just going to go home.

357
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:49,627
And he...

358
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:55,163
Instead, he took me to a bar and he bought me a drink and I said,

359
00:28:55,924 --> 00:28:57,304
Tim, you don't have to do this.

360
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:58,885
You don't have to entertain me.

361
00:28:58,925 --> 00:29:01,926
We can just go home, watch Letterman, and go to bed.

362
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:04,167
And he goes, no, Peter.

363
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:08,569
He goes, when I come to your island, you give me an island experience.

364
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,990
And when you're in the city, I'm going to give you a city experience.

365
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:13,911
And he's right.

366
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:21,480
After the bar, and I totally enjoyed myself, we had another long visit, and I soaked it all in.

367
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,581
And then he took me to another place that played live music, and it was already midnight.

368
00:29:28,742 --> 00:29:33,143
And next thing you know, I'm head-banging with the rest of them, and then eventually I found

369
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:37,984
myself passed out on a sofa. But I'm so grateful for that!

370
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:45,904
because he gave me, he pushed me, he gave me this opportunity to do something that normally I wouldn't do.

371
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:54,631
But now, if I ever had to design something that needed that vibe, I can now go back in

372
00:29:55,531 --> 00:30:00,535
and pull that experience out, right, the essence of that experience out and use it.

373
00:30:03,777 --> 00:30:07,920
So, it's time to share my

374
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:09,217
some work with you.

375
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:18,084
And I'm going to be vulnerable again, because some of these drawings aren't all that impressive,

376
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:22,728
but it kind of gives a good example of what we're talking about.

377
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:30,695
So this first one is when I was helping...

378
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:35,456
double fine with this game Broken Age.

379
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:38,999
And this is what I consider a freebie.

380
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,363
I call it a freebie, or you can call it a treat.

381
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:53,251
Seth Godin calls it a gift, where you have an idea and you give it away without reciprocity.

382
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:54,292
It's one way.

383
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:58,396
The reason why I do this drawing is for the sake of connection.

384
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:06,896
Because really, it's not really part of the environment, it's not really part of the game,

385
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:13,601
it was just an idea that I had, and obviously this idea is really wacky and strange, right?

386
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:22,889
It was when I took a knitting class with my kids, you know, to knit scarves for Christmas,

387
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:25,972
and I remember looking around the room and seeing these...

388
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:32,577
the people knitting, stars and reindeers, and it was like, it was mesmerizing.

389
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:37,600
And I thought, wouldn't it be cool that maybe you can knit an environment?

390
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,763
So I just sucked that idea away, hoping that one day I can pull it out and use it.

391
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:48,145
And so I thought, I'm just going to go for it.

392
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:54,968
Even though it's like so lame and so weird and unusual, I'm still going to just draw

393
00:31:54,988 --> 00:31:55,608
it up and...

394
00:31:56,866 --> 00:31:59,527
give it to them.

395
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:05,131
So it's a freebie for the sake of connection.

396
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:13,015
And this next one is from Monsters University.

397
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:18,398
And so if you can imagine how scary that is, this is again a great opportunity.

398
00:32:18,498 --> 00:32:21,400
Pixar gives me a call and says, we're going to give you a shot.

399
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:27,486
And I want you to figure out what the university is going to look like.

400
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:32,489
And so I came in super early, right?

401
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,610
We didn't have a script or anything.

402
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,312
The characters weren't even designed yet.

403
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:38,953
So my job was to figure it out.

404
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:42,676
And fortunately, the year before, I visited Princeton.

405
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:48,880
The only experience I got from walking through an Ivy League college, because obviously I

406
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,601
did not go to an Ivy League college.

407
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:59,586
And so I remember walking around and looking at the ivy growing on the buildings, not knowing

408
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:01,668
that Monsters University was coming up.

409
00:33:03,369 --> 00:33:09,955
So I do this thing, because I don't take a lot of photographs, I do what's called mental

410
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:10,356
noting.

411
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:13,619
It's a form of meditation where you can memorize things.

412
00:33:14,974 --> 00:33:22,341
And so I remember seeing the ivy growing on the walls and I remember the silhouettes,

413
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,663
the beautiful silhouettes and shapes that came from that.

414
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:32,830
And then that's when I realized I'm going to use that ivy as a second level motif, right?

415
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,594
Because there's the architectural monster's motif and then I thought I'll use the ivy

416
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:39,816
as the second layer.

417
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:46,418
to enhance, hopefully enhance the monster look.

418
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:53,320
And this drawing means a lot to me because as you can see it says 001.

419
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,601
So there was a lot of anxiety on this drawing because this is going to be the first drawing

420
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:04,183
that I'm going to pitch to them and try to sell them my look and my ideas.

421
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:18,299
The next one is, again, your job is to design, or my job was to design the dorm room.

422
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,319
Now, if I just did a plain dorm room, that would be boring.

423
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:26,960
Usually boring and playing things safe never leads to connection.

424
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:34,561
So I always add a little extra something to my drawings for the sake of connection.

425
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:38,342
So I put in the characters so you can relate to them a little bit.

426
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,842
Now again, I don't know anything about the story, not that much.

427
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:48,465
The only thing they told me was that Sully at the time was studying to be a dentist and

428
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:57,409
Mike was, he's only in college to party, but his skill was, he knew a lot about scaring.

429
00:34:58,627 --> 00:34:59,587
And that's all they gave me.

430
00:35:00,088 --> 00:35:07,012
So again, it's going into your memory banks and your experiences of visiting, like for

431
00:35:07,052 --> 00:35:11,175
me visiting my friends in dorm rooms and seeing how they decorated.

432
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:15,738
You know, I've got my Bruce Lee poster on the top.

433
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:18,300
I've got my beanbag and Rubik's cubes.

434
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,782
I got my vinyls out because those things are nostalgic.

435
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:22,403
Those things mean something to me.

436
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:31,372
And it did connect because I get the feedback was, this made us laugh.

437
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:35,894
You know, because Mike, why would he have a turban?

438
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:36,895
He has no hair.

439
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:41,017
And why is he wearing a towel around his waist when he has no privates?

440
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:48,861
And so then I knew that these things, my drawings were connecting with Pixar.

441
00:35:49,402 --> 00:35:51,443
So I'm just reaching out to the art department right now.

442
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:54,735
You see the free hat you get at Chevy's?

443
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:56,776
See it's at the top?

444
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:06,500
Next one is, so this one here, this is what, this is called a freebie as well.

445
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,060
This was a freebie to Pixar.

446
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:13,643
Obviously the background, there's not really much about the architecture, right?

447
00:36:13,943 --> 00:36:15,643
It was just an idea that I had.

448
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:21,366
I wanted to give them this treat, this gift.

449
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:26,022
and the idea of history at this college.

450
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:33,270
I thought it would be really cool to have the students rub the feet of the sculpture

451
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:39,678
or the statue for good luck and before games, big games, right?

452
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:41,860
You rub it before exams.

453
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:48,783
And I got that idea from, I don't know if you guys have been to Seattle, but there's Pike Place Market.

454
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:55,045
And out in front of Pike Place Market, there's a, where they throw the fish, the fish market there,

455
00:36:55,085 --> 00:37:00,507
there's a bronze pig out in front, and everyone rubs the nose on that bronze pig.

456
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:04,788
That's where I got that idea, from that experience.

457
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:19,184
And what's cool about this, for me, is that here I am, I've got this idea, I doodle it up, I throw it one way to Pixar, not expecting anything back.

458
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:25,026
All I'm trying to do is reach to the art department.

459
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:30,110
And then I find out later, I get a call from the production designer, and he goes, guess

460
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:30,410
what?

461
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:37,796
Pete Docter, who happens to be, he was the director on this at the time, he directed

462
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:44,841
Monster, the first Monsters, and he said, I like these so much, have, have, uh,

463
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,651
have it all blown up, have all Peter's drawings blown up, and put down the hall between the

464
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:52,752
art department and the story department.

465
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:57,133
So then when the story guys go through, it'll get them inspired.

466
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:04,994
So here I was, with this simple doodle, I'm now reaching the art department, and now I'm

467
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:07,735
reaching, connecting with the story department.

468
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:11,676
And then I find out that it ends up in the movie.

469
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:21,693
So now, I'm reaching beyond that, from just having this idea and listening to my intuition

470
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:23,655
and going for it.

471
00:38:27,077 --> 00:38:29,359
So, that's that one.

472
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,481
Do we have time?

473
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:35,564
Yeah, we're on a good schedule here.

474
00:38:35,624 --> 00:38:37,265
So, do you guys want to see a little more?

475
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:38,626
Okay.

476
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:43,090
Now, this is a little different, but I still have you guys in mind.

477
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:44,858
Alright?

478
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:54,828
Now you guys thought I was going to show you more of my artwork, right?

479
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:02,816
But I know that if I shared my artwork, that wouldn't really get you motivated to go out

480
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:03,457
and do stuff.

481
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,346
I wanted to show you real people doing stuff, having real experiences.

482
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:19,878
And because I know that if you went out and had these experiences, you can draw from them too.

483
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,680
Right? Literally.

484
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:31,029
Now, that slideshow was put together from the help of good friends and family.

485
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,112
Some of it was mine too.

486
00:40:34,492 --> 00:40:35,413
But what's what's

487
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:42,605
What I found out when I was putting it together, that these people in my life inspire me.

488
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:48,167
And they remind me to get off my butt and do something.

489
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:57,870
And I realized when I was putting it together that I wasn't really doing it for you, I was doing it for me too.

490
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,990
I need to be reminded to do that.

491
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:03,251
So, in conclusion...

492
00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:06,619
Brene Brown says,

493
00:41:06,979 --> 00:41:09,200
allowing ourselves to be truly seen

494
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,821
is a powerful source of innovation,

495
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:15,862
creativity, personal transformation, and connection.

496
00:41:16,622 --> 00:41:18,463
It starts with being more vulnerable.

497
00:41:19,483 --> 00:41:21,404
And while the rest of the world is busy

498
00:41:21,504 --> 00:41:23,524
hiding out in their cozy comfort zone,

499
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:26,745
I believe the best art are done by people

500
00:41:27,426 --> 00:41:29,046
who listen to their intuition,

501
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:30,787
who have an idea, give it a try,

502
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,427
not knowing how it's going to end.

503
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:36,865
So choose courage over comfort.

504
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:42,849
And lastly, there's value in doing things in moderation.

505
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:45,111
Cutting back on things that don't matter.

506
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:46,852
Simplify.

507
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:56,998
Making space so you can rediscover and reconnect with your authentic self first, and then your

508
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:58,820
authentic creativity will follow.

509
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:06,569
So, as we know, the games industry is evolving.

510
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:07,890
Right?

511
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,351
It's ever-changing.

512
00:42:10,032 --> 00:42:13,675
So, I ask you, do something different.

513
00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:18,819
When you have an opportunity to make a game or design a game, make it unique.

514
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:25,104
Don't fall into the land of compliance and mediocrity.

515
00:42:26,405 --> 00:42:27,826
Listen to your intuition.

516
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,208
Trust your gut.

517
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:30,608
Okay?

518
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:30,989
That's part.

519
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,964
And don't let this part talk you out of it.

520
00:42:38,026 --> 00:42:38,287
Okay?

521
00:42:38,787 --> 00:42:40,770
So, thank you guys.

522
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:41,951
Thank you very much.

523
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:47,298
Thank you.

524
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:49,040
Thank you, thank you.

525
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:51,323
No, thanks.

526
00:42:51,423 --> 00:42:51,844
We have time.

527
00:42:53,172 --> 00:42:55,495
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be open to take some questions.

528
00:42:55,555 --> 00:43:00,483
And if I don't know the answer to them, you know, forgive me and I'll take it.

529
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:02,466
I'll write it down and I'll get back to you.

530
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:05,171
I just don't want to BS anybody.

531
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:06,353
I want to be thoughtful.

532
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:15,431
Hi, when you get the idea for something like a Monster's Inc. version of The Thinker,

533
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:21,337
do you then go and reference the actual Thinker, or is that just as you remember The Thinker?

534
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:28,865
That's a great question. I do get reference, but when I tap into my personal experiences,

535
00:43:29,546 --> 00:43:31,348
it's usually just the essence of it.

536
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:37,809
Right? And so, if that's, like, the thinker is more like a memory of what the thinker is,

537
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:42,211
because obviously it's a monstrous version of it, so it doesn't have to look like the real thinker.

538
00:43:42,712 --> 00:43:47,434
Like, I shouldn't, really, I shouldn't have used the thinker, because it should have been more

539
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:55,598
like a founding father of the college, right? If I had more time to do the, well, think about it.

540
00:43:58,144 --> 00:44:01,847
It's hard because, you guys, if you think about, like right now I'm working for Paramount Pictures.

541
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:05,189
I'm working for this really awesome production designer.

542
00:44:05,249 --> 00:44:10,674
He designs for most of Tim Burton's films, like Frank and Weenie, Nightmare, right?

543
00:44:11,534 --> 00:44:11,815
And so...

544
00:44:13,055 --> 00:44:17,337
I, he has me pitching twice a week, Tuesdays and Fridays.

545
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:21,579
So, if you can imagine, I have to like move along fairly quickly.

546
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:25,681
So, I don't always have time to get reference.

547
00:44:26,181 --> 00:44:28,782
I just have to go with my gut and just go for it.

548
00:44:29,123 --> 00:44:33,244
And sometimes, you know, you can see some of those drawings are okay.

549
00:44:34,345 --> 00:44:35,025
It's the idea.

550
00:44:35,045 --> 00:44:36,586
And that's the thing.

551
00:44:37,546 --> 00:44:40,288
If you guys have good people skills and...

552
00:44:41,357 --> 00:44:44,958
and you're a problem solver, you'll be alright.

553
00:44:46,578 --> 00:44:49,439
Anyone else? Don't be shy.

554
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:53,319
Hello. I do have one question about

555
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,680
we apply what you say to art

556
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,061
and then do you feel like you can apply it to anything else?

557
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:05,001
That's right. That's why I said art. It's whatever you want it to be.

558
00:45:05,021 --> 00:45:09,402
I mean, you can, it can also move into your life

559
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:10,562
if you wanted to.

560
00:45:11,171 --> 00:45:14,773
So that's actually leading to another question.

561
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:20,517
So if someone else, he or she was asking a question

562
00:45:20,597 --> 00:45:23,018
about this type of creativity,

563
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:25,320
but what you realize actually,

564
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,482
she or he doesn't do anything what we mean

565
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:30,763
about go out and to have the experience,

566
00:45:31,204 --> 00:45:33,365
will you just encourage them to do that?

567
00:45:34,746 --> 00:45:35,126
Yes.

568
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:37,147
Okay, that's my question.

569
00:45:40,008 --> 00:45:43,050
Yeah, here's the thing, it's balance.

570
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:48,092
Basically I'm just telling you to have a life too, okay?

571
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:52,774
I mean, I believe you guys all work really, really hard,

572
00:45:55,195 --> 00:45:59,917
but at the same time, you need to take care of yourself too.

573
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:01,238
You need to have balance.

574
00:46:02,398 --> 00:46:04,939
And I know you work like 10 hours at work,

575
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:06,600
and then you go home and you play some more,

576
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,041
or you work some more.

577
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:16,535
But we only have this one life. It's not a trial run. So you might as well fill it, right, with experiences.

578
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:20,420
So all I'm saying is just have balance.

579
00:46:22,723 --> 00:46:22,823
Yes.

580
00:46:24,945 --> 00:46:27,727
This is from a personal thing.

581
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:34,410
A while ago we were in a class and we were supposed to come up with our idea of a game.

582
00:46:35,031 --> 00:46:40,694
And I came up with this, what I thought was a creative idea.

583
00:46:41,474 --> 00:46:46,756
and the class liked it and everything, but at the end I couldn't sell it, and then they went with this

584
00:46:47,836 --> 00:46:53,458
typical pirate idea, and they told it like, your idea is so weird, we cannot connect with it,

585
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:59,120
we don't know if people like it, and I couldn't sell it. And to this day, I still think that

586
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:06,423
it would have been an original thing, but they decided to go with something safe.

587
00:47:09,972 --> 00:47:11,293
people with your ideas?

588
00:47:12,714 --> 00:47:14,395
That's a great question.

589
00:47:15,656 --> 00:47:17,177
Well, they don't know what they're doing.

590
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,800
Because they're listening to the lizard brain,

591
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,322
and they're just, you know,

592
00:47:23,362 --> 00:47:26,324
they think by keeping it safe,

593
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:28,525
they're not going to make any money.

594
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:31,528
So, let go of them.

595
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:33,629
Don't listen to them.

596
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:35,931
I still say...

597
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:39,497
Keep that in your back pocket.

598
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:42,859
Keep that great idea because it's important.

599
00:47:42,919 --> 00:47:43,980
You're passionate about it.

600
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,062
And one day, you'll find the right people

601
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:48,302
that will listen to you.

602
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:51,565
That's why when you see these games that are so innovative,

603
00:47:51,845 --> 00:47:53,366
there's a reason why it's so innovative.

604
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:58,349
They're taking a chance, not knowing how it's going to end.

605
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:00,210
Right?

606
00:48:01,971 --> 00:48:04,713
So try to find companies that support.

607
00:48:05,747 --> 00:48:11,029
that, that they're open to that if you can. I know I have.

608
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:15,490
And I find myself, I don't work for those kind of people then.

609
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:23,673
And I mean I'm fortunate enough now that I can, you know, find who I want to work for.

610
00:48:25,713 --> 00:48:30,375
But I know when you first start out, yeah, sometimes you have to compromise.

611
00:48:32,311 --> 00:48:37,934
But that's where I was telling you about, you know, you listen to this part and then you have your assignment

612
00:48:38,755 --> 00:48:43,797
and sometimes you have to compromise a little bit, but I still shove that my idea into it

613
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:51,061
and I still accomplish the assignment and at the same time I still feel a little bit good about what I did

614
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:59,526
because I got to sneak in my personal experience into it or my idea into it.

615
00:49:01,186 --> 00:49:01,346
Yes.

616
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:05,703
It was very encouraging to hear all of the different techniques you used.

617
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:08,125
One of them that you mentioned was mental noting.

618
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:11,448
I was wondering where you got that from, or did you develop that on your own?

619
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:12,489
No, no, no.

620
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,271
I'm not that smart.

621
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,015
Sylvia Beerstein, I believe, is her name.

622
00:49:18,075 --> 00:49:19,356
She is a Buddhist.

623
00:49:23,756 --> 00:49:28,620
She taught me through her book, I went on a silent retreat.

624
00:49:29,581 --> 00:49:36,066
Once a year, I try to go on a silent retreat, which means I go and camp by myself.

625
00:49:36,687 --> 00:49:37,687
I don't talk to anybody.

626
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:39,209
I don't say anything.

627
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:43,652
And it is an opportunity to go inside.

628
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:47,295
And so what happens is, it's really cool.

629
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:53,203
When you don't hear your voice, you get to slow down, you actually listen to your body.

630
00:49:53,883 --> 00:49:58,105
Like you don't look at the clock, you leave all the technical stuff, all the gadgets at

631
00:49:58,145 --> 00:49:58,345
home.

632
00:49:58,985 --> 00:50:04,267
You listen to your body, you listen to when you're hungry, that's when you eat, right?

633
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:06,948
And if you feel sleepy, go to sleep.

634
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:11,430
So you get in tune, you kind of reset, okay?

635
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:17,293
When you do that, and when you go walking, for example, it's like

636
00:50:18,535 --> 00:50:21,740
mental noting means, for example, if I'm walking

637
00:50:23,102 --> 00:50:27,989
through and hiking, I pay attention to everything.

638
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:38,617
I hear, I note in my head if I hear a bird, if I hear the waves, and then I'm also sensitive

639
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:40,198
to what I'm feeling.

640
00:50:40,598 --> 00:50:45,962
I feel the wind on my cheek, I feel the warmth of the sun, I feel the coolness of the shade,

641
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:47,523
and then I also listen.

642
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:54,788
to the crunch of my feet, the leaves, the gravel, the feeling I get from the bottom

643
00:50:54,848 --> 00:51:01,512
of my soul, you know, sharp stones, or I'm walking on grass, I just call it out in my

644
00:51:01,552 --> 00:51:01,812
head.

645
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:09,337
Now, what's cool about being in the moment when you do that, 15 minutes goes by and you

646
00:51:09,377 --> 00:51:10,798
haven't thought of one thing.

647
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:14,220
You just meditated while walking.

648
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:20,651
And by doing that, by being in the moment, you actually memorize your environment.

649
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:29,934
So when I'm in a situation like my wife and my kids know, that if I'm walking around and

650
00:51:29,994 --> 00:51:36,517
all of a sudden dad's gone, and it's because I'm standing and I'm looking at something

651
00:51:37,057 --> 00:51:40,418
and I'm just taking it all in, I'm memorizing it.

652
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:45,420
And then it's socked away, because I don't take pictures.

653
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:54,115
And so, when that time comes, when I'm sitting at my desk, that's when I can pull out, you

654
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:57,657
know that Harry Potter thing where you take the wand and you see him take the memory out?

655
00:51:57,717 --> 00:51:59,799
That's what I've, it's like that.

656
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:06,423
You can just take out that one idea or that essence of that experience and then you can

657
00:52:07,243 --> 00:52:07,483
use it.

658
00:52:08,004 --> 00:52:11,946
So mental noting is just a form of being in the present.

659
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:24,831
Hey, I was just like when you were talking about the struggling and how you wrestle your fears and like the specific

660
00:52:26,032 --> 00:52:31,454
Being afraid of the people we will find out that you're a fraud like this. Oh, we do have time

661
00:52:32,394 --> 00:52:35,095
Okay, so that's okay. Thank you for bringing that up

662
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:37,456
All right, so being found out as a fraud

663
00:52:38,236 --> 00:52:40,617
that's a big big one for me because I

664
00:52:43,007 --> 00:52:44,850
I didn't have formal training, right?

665
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:51,400
I kept it a secret until I got to college and then I was forced to start drawing in

666
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,021
public.

667
00:52:53,182 --> 00:52:59,144
And then I went to an art school that didn't have any film classes back in those days.

668
00:52:59,224 --> 00:53:05,607
It was back in the day of illustration, doing editorials, you know, that kind of stuff,

669
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:06,707
spot illustrations.

670
00:53:06,787 --> 00:53:09,848
There were no film classes back when I was in school.

671
00:53:10,768 --> 00:53:13,750
So I was a traditional illustrator, right?

672
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:18,211
And so I had this opportunity to do games.

673
00:53:20,435 --> 00:53:23,958
And at the same time, while I was at games, I was a fraud, because I didn't play games.

674
00:53:24,378 --> 00:53:26,620
I wasn't really into games.

675
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,482
But here I was making games, designing games.

676
00:53:30,042 --> 00:53:31,363
So I felt like a fraud there.

677
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:37,347
And then when I finally had the opportunity to do film work, right, like my first job

678
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:41,790
was a storyboard episode one, like I think, no, design ants.

679
00:53:43,129 --> 00:53:46,050
I designed ants from the island.

680
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:50,371
And I've never designed film before, so I was a fraud.

681
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:53,932
And then storyboarding, right?

682
00:53:53,992 --> 00:53:54,872
I've never storyboarded.

683
00:53:54,892 --> 00:53:56,332
I never took a class on storyboarding.

684
00:53:56,652 --> 00:54:00,553
And then episode one comes around and says, hey, you want to storyboard some shots?

685
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:01,994
I was like, I had to fake it.

686
00:54:02,214 --> 00:54:03,234
I was always pretending.

687
00:54:03,354 --> 00:54:04,234
I was always faking it.

688
00:54:05,295 --> 00:54:07,695
So for the longest time, people would come up to me and say,

689
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:12,558
you know, hey, I really like your work, you know, you did a great job.

690
00:54:12,738 --> 00:54:15,099
I wasn't able to really receive it back then.

691
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:19,142
I wasn't able to, like, take it in and look them in the eye and say thank you.

692
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,684
It was always like, because I felt like a fraud,

693
00:54:21,704 --> 00:54:27,448
I would always, like, look away and say, oh, it's all right, you know.

694
00:54:28,985 --> 00:54:38,828
And so finally, I worked on this one film last year for Blue Sky Studios, and they're making it right now.

695
00:54:39,268 --> 00:54:45,171
They totally gave me freedom to figure out this entire world, and it was the hardest project,

696
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:52,573
because I was problem solving throughout the whole thing, how this part connected to this part,

697
00:54:52,753 --> 00:54:58,455
connected to this part, and I thought of every little bit of it. And they're making it now.

698
00:54:59,751 --> 00:55:03,776
And after that experience, I thought, what am I afraid of?

699
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:08,761
I can, they hired me to figure this out.

700
00:55:10,103 --> 00:55:11,664
Even though I didn't have proper training,

701
00:55:11,744 --> 00:55:13,907
it's like I helped them do this.

702
00:55:14,307 --> 00:55:16,770
And that was when it finally dawned on me.

703
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,352
I remember I was on a walk.

704
00:55:18,932 --> 00:55:21,976
And then I was like, I'm going to let that go.

705
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:27,389
You know, that's what I was saying, you know, pull out that fear and label it and

706
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:32,671
It's like I finally did that and I let that one go. So now I don't

707
00:55:33,832 --> 00:55:36,513
You know now I I don't think about it anymore

708
00:55:37,353 --> 00:55:38,073
it's like if

709
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:45,176
If people come up to me and say hey, would you like to give this a try now? I'm cool with it

710
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:48,617
You know, thank you. Thank you. Uh-huh

711
00:55:50,518 --> 00:55:50,618
Yes

712
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:56,882
Hi, I know with a lot of creative work,

713
00:55:57,743 --> 00:56:00,405
there's a certain nebulousness

714
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:02,366
when you're in the thick of it,

715
00:56:03,246 --> 00:56:06,328
and you're in this state of uncertainty

716
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:09,391
where you have no idea whether it's good or not.

717
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:13,413
And I know at my stage,

718
00:56:13,573 --> 00:56:17,016
I have yet to receive validation.

719
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:20,650
for a lot of the work I'm doing.

720
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,652
And I feel like you have received that validation

721
00:56:24,712 --> 00:56:25,512
over and over again.

722
00:56:25,952 --> 00:56:30,214
And I'm wondering if that has changed the way you

723
00:56:30,914 --> 00:56:33,416
do your creative work, or if you use,

724
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:36,677
or if you still have that uncertainty

725
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:39,478
throughout the process, and you use that to your advantage.

726
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:41,159
That's a great question.

727
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,160
And if my wife was here, she would say

728
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,442
that even at this stage, where I'm at,

729
00:56:48,435 --> 00:56:53,617
I eat a lot of ice cream because I'm wounded.

730
00:56:54,898 --> 00:57:01,020
Because some days I walk home, my studio is across from the house, my lawn is my commute,

731
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:07,523
and there are days where I just drag my feet home because I feel like I didn't come up

732
00:57:07,543 --> 00:57:08,223
with a good idea.

733
00:57:09,064 --> 00:57:13,510
And she feels it, you know, the whole family feels it.

734
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:17,114
And then I find out later that, oh, they like the idea.

735
00:57:17,295 --> 00:57:19,658
And then it's like, I'm better again.

736
00:57:20,018 --> 00:57:22,201
But hey, I go through the motions, you know.

737
00:57:24,414 --> 00:57:31,278
Yes, to answer your question, yes, I do have moments almost every week where I feel like

738
00:57:31,338 --> 00:57:32,519
this is not a good idea.

739
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:36,561
But I have to listen to my gut.

740
00:57:37,202 --> 00:57:42,065
Because if I don't listen to my gut, then I'm just rehashing ideas and it's just going

741
00:57:42,085 --> 00:57:43,345
to be like everyone else's.

742
00:57:44,366 --> 00:57:47,088
So I have to try.

743
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:48,348
It's rewiring.

744
00:57:49,009 --> 00:57:53,792
You have to rewire yourself and just go for it.

745
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:55,559
Thank you.

746
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,000
We only have a couple minutes left, but I have to ask.

747
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:05,864
A whole generation loves your work in film, but a lot of us fell in love with you through

748
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:06,884
the games that you made.

749
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:14,468
So can you talk a little bit about the stuff that you're doing currently for Double Fine?

750
00:58:14,488 --> 00:58:15,188
I won't tell Tim.

751
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:17,269
Yeah, don't tell Tim.

752
00:58:18,446 --> 00:58:22,290
No, I can't really talk about what I'm doing for Tim.

753
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,833
I'm done doing stuff for Tim.

754
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:26,995
He's... no, I meant...

755
00:58:30,078 --> 00:58:32,841
I meant he doesn't have any more work for me to do.

756
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:37,206
He's got all these wonderful projects going on.

757
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:39,889
And I have to say, I mean, I'm not supposed to...

758
00:58:41,749 --> 00:58:47,231
hype any companies or anything. But, you know, the onlyâif it wasn't Double Fine, if it

759
00:58:47,311 --> 00:58:55,113
wasn't Tim, if I found a company that is innovative or these guys actually listen to their gut

760
00:58:55,993 --> 00:59:02,835
and go for it, that's the company I'm looking for. You know, they're the people that will

761
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:08,617
receive my silly, goofy ideas of knitting robots or whatever, right?

762
00:59:11,622 --> 00:59:16,946
That's who I seek out and those are the people I want to surround myself with right

763
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:20,648
It's like picking your friends

764
00:59:21,669 --> 00:59:25,732
You want to surround yourself with supportive people in your lives, right?

765
00:59:26,532 --> 00:59:26,692
Yes

766
00:59:28,134 --> 00:59:34,358
Yes, when you were talking about mental noting and you said, you know, your family kind of knows when daddy's away. Yes

767
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:42,344
How did you kind of transition your family into that and like when you have smaller children, you know, they don't really

768
00:59:43,004 --> 00:59:49,346
Understand. No, I I got them going on it when they were really little they're adults now. My kids are 21 and 18

769
00:59:51,706 --> 00:59:56,687
I got my son zach. He's uh, he's he's doing silent retreats now

770
00:59:58,388 --> 00:59:59,088
So, um

771
00:59:59,908 --> 01:00:00,768
My daughter's different

772
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:04,709
You get one of each so, um

773
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:09,940
But when they were little, I did. I did get them. You know how you get them going is

774
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,482
I have them, like we go to the beach, because I live on an island, you go to a beach and I have them

775
01:00:17,562 --> 01:00:25,644
close their eyes and I have them just listen to the ocean or listen to their surroundings.

776
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:31,286
And then I have them and I ask them, what do you hear? You know, it's a game to them.

777
01:00:32,618 --> 01:00:37,639
They don't know what they're doing, but it's a game to them, and that's how you can bring them into it.

778
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:39,979
And another way to get them...

779
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,961
Having little kids, it's so important to build up their curiosity, their imagination.

780
01:00:47,021 --> 01:00:52,382
So I used to get them into classical music, for example.

781
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:58,643
I would play certain soundtrack songs, and I would have them listen to it.

782
01:00:58,683 --> 01:01:00,443
Not a long one, like a two-minute song.

783
01:01:01,164 --> 01:01:05,745
And then I have them close their eyes and they listen to that one particular soundtrack song.

784
01:01:05,805 --> 01:01:08,427
And then I ask them, what did you see?

785
01:01:09,287 --> 01:01:11,708
Because when you listen, you actually can...

786
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:18,491
you see animated things happening or you see, you know, you have feelings.

787
01:01:18,811 --> 01:01:21,172
And that's exercising their imagination.

788
01:01:21,752 --> 01:01:25,994
And for any of you guys, and that's a really good thing, and I teach this in my class,

789
01:01:27,294 --> 01:01:32,856
I play various songs, and I have them listen to it.

790
01:01:33,877 --> 01:01:40,239
And each of the students, hearing one song, everyone has different stories to tell.

791
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:47,841
And so, if you're ever blocked, creatively blocked, I highly recommend not listening

792
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:54,784
to your rock and roll or anything like that, just to find a song and listen to it.

793
01:01:57,465 --> 01:02:05,471
you know, imagine what that short film is happening in your head and that will help you get out of that creative block.

794
01:02:06,872 --> 01:02:10,855
So I highly recommend giving that a try, especially with young kids.

795
01:02:11,716 --> 01:02:11,916
Yeah.

796
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:12,917
Okay, thank you.

797
01:02:12,997 --> 01:02:13,557
Yeah, you're welcome.

798
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:21,323
Hi, I'm a game designer by trade and I find that my best work comes from collaborating with others.

799
01:02:21,584 --> 01:02:22,064
Yes.

800
01:02:22,104 --> 01:02:26,627
You talk a lot about trusting your gut. How do we balance trusting other people's gut as well?

801
01:02:28,498 --> 01:02:29,179
That's a good one.

802
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:34,862
Well, yeah, you have to trust them. That's for sure.

803
01:02:36,463 --> 01:02:39,365
It's hard, because that's a great, great question.

804
01:02:43,487 --> 01:02:44,368
That's a good question.

805
01:02:45,655 --> 01:02:47,256
Again, it's been a long time.

806
01:02:47,537 --> 01:02:54,081
If I'm working with a company that I'm familiar with, of course I trust the people in my life,

807
01:02:54,282 --> 01:02:58,344
and the production designers or the project leads.

808
01:02:58,925 --> 01:02:59,425
I trust them.

809
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:02,466
They know what they want.

810
01:03:03,327 --> 01:03:06,630
My job as a designer though, is to make them happy.

811
01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:09,493
I'm not making the game, it's not my money.

812
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:14,178
It's them, it's for them.

813
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:18,603
But to be true to myself, that's where the experience part comes in.

814
01:03:20,418 --> 01:03:26,519
That's where I add my piece of the puzzle into the mix.

815
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,880
And that's where the compromise comes in.

816
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,240
Because it's for them, ultimately.

817
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:32,601
I've got to make them happy.

818
01:03:33,581 --> 01:03:36,582
If you want to do something all by yourself and independent,

819
01:03:36,662 --> 01:03:38,122
then you've got to go for it.

820
01:03:38,562 --> 01:03:39,622
You've got to use your own money.

821
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:43,663
But if you're going to work with somebody else, then...

822
01:03:45,235 --> 01:03:49,278
you know, hopefully they'll respect you too, and that they'll listen to your ideas.

823
01:03:50,439 --> 01:03:55,021
Right? So you, again, it's compromise and seeking out the right people,

824
01:03:55,862 --> 01:04:02,526
the right companies you want to work for that support your creative drive. Anyone else?

825
01:04:05,028 --> 01:04:12,872
No? Well, you guys are my gaming community, so I, you know, I support you guys.

826
01:04:14,103 --> 01:04:21,481
Good luck with everything. Do good work. Be well. See you guys.
