00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:06,510
It was known from the beginning that the main character, she's a kind of ballerina and modern dancer at the same time.

2
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:14,951
But the story I got to know when I arrived here just before we started working and also the story is a bit touching to myself

3
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:16,632
it's about the

4
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:24,296
woman who wants to go on with her life and solve her family issues with her parents her father left the family

5
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:28,719
And now she has to decide if she wants to see him or she wants to continue

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,742
Be with her mother or other way around so I have it myself my

7
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:35,843
My parents unfortunately are separated as well.

8
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:37,943
Inner fight is quite close to me.

9
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:40,964
I'm also in that age when I'm trying to make decisions.

10
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:44,245
Whose fault was that and what should I do with it?

11
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,266
I think it's nice also that the people who's gonna play

12
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:49,567
the game, they would have them to make your own decision

13
00:00:49,587 --> 00:00:51,447
because it's a big decision.

14
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:04,428
In the beginning, I had a chance to see myself put into the skin of the character.

15
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:09,191
It's very funny to see something else moving like you.

16
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:11,874
It's a bit abstract, I would say.

17
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:15,797
But at the same time, we have a very similar body.

18
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,759
She moves as I move, so I make it.

19
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:28,083
It's gonna be looking really cool.
