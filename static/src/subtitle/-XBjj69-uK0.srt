00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:10,560
Hi, I'm Karen Stevens, EA's Director of Accessibility.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,463
In my presentation today is Accessibility Best Practices,

3
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:15,724
Mobility Considerations.

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,706
This is for GDC Summer 2021.

5
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:22,430
I strongly advocate for accessible presentation templates

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,411
as accessible as possible.

7
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:27,053
So yes, I used my own in this case,

8
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:28,455
but this is for GDC 2021 Summer.

9
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:34,163
Now, accessibility really matters to me,

10
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:35,804
and especially mobility too.

11
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:38,345
I have problems with my own hands.

12
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:41,366
So I have tendonitis in my wrists and thumbs,

13
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:42,086
especially thumbs.

14
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:44,687
I have carpal tunnel syndrome,

15
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:46,528
and I have centralized nerve damage.

16
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:47,348
You put that all together,

17
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:50,729
and it's really hard for me to use a lot of games.

18
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:52,990
So a lot of what I'm going to talk about today

19
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,611
is actually personal observations

20
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:57,612
of things I've had to deal with myself.

21
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:03,218
but this also covers a wider variety of things that I know others encounter

22
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:06,562
and it's just an overall thing. We'll notice a lot of personal notes in this

23
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:09,726
talk just simply because of my issues with my hands. So

24
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:14,071
let's go to a few statistics before we get rolling.

25
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:18,176
This is all from the U.S. Center for Disease Control.

26
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:22,203
So if people who have, if you talk about all ages,

27
00:01:22,203 --> 00:01:25,528
about one in five people have a permanent disability.

28
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:28,654
When you get to 18 plus, you're at one in four.

29
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:32,069
By around retirement age, it's two and five.

30
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,630
By the time you're in your mid-70s, it's one and two.

31
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,992
And statistically speaking, the majority of people

32
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:41,973
will be permanently disabled before they die.

33
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,093
It's just a numbers fact.

34
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:46,034
So it's important to try to consider

35
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:47,815
how do we keep people gaming?

36
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:50,356
And how do we have as many people

37
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:52,237
be able to game as possible?

38
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,337
Inclusion really matters.

39
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:58,113
There is a wide variety of devices out there that help different needs.

40
00:01:58,113 --> 00:02:01,915
For example, you could have an eye gaze technology,

41
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:07,118
which is what the upper left image is, where it shows a screen.

42
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,600
You have people that can use their eyes sort of like a mouse,

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,201
and that allows them to play some games.

44
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,262
Like, I know Sims 4 can be played that way.

45
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:21,427
and you might have VR like the PSVR and may have motion sensors and things.

46
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:26,269
You could be using a mouse and keyboard or you could be using something like the

47
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:29,030
switch controls that have two different pieces.

48
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,172
There might be one piece like the Xbox Elite controller but they have buttons

49
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:34,273
on the bottom. There might be a touch screen involved.

50
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:35,853
It might be something like the Xbox.

51
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:40,977
Accessibility controller, which has a lot of different devices that can be attached to it.

52
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:47,201
All of those are super helpful. The more things you have and the more ways there is to interact

53
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:53,625
with games, the more likely it is there's a combination that will help a person. However,

54
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:59,208
it's not a magic bullet. You still need to consider the games itself because these devices

55
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:04,592
alone is not enough. You have to actually design for accessibility. It's not just a device thing.

56
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:12,917
So one nice thing I love seeing is that more console games

57
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:17,718
now support keyboard and mice from the get-go.

58
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:19,719
That is wonderful.

59
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,720
Every time you would allow a different type of device

60
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,961
and make it a or type of thing,

61
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:27,882
this means that more people can play your game.

62
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:31,303
Some people may have easier time using a mouse,

63
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:34,224
some people may have an easier time using the sticks.

64
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:40,506
it varies by the person and what type of mobility issues they may have or just even their preference.

65
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:46,811
Now one thing I really love seeing even better than the Halo Master Chief Collection's preferred

66
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:55,798
device is Minecraft has a full keyboard gameplay. This means it's keyboard only support. So in

67
00:03:55,798 --> 00:04:02,404
addition to saying you have mouse and keyboard or controller, you also have keyboard.

68
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:06,325
Every time you get rid of the and in a device,

69
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:12,307
you open doors because some people may be able to use it in other ways.

70
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:14,788
It's important to try to have as many of those different type

71
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,948
of individualized options as possible.

72
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:20,849
Now, when we talk about devices and trying to figure

73
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:25,951
out what type of inputs and how to deal with inputs,

74
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:33,973
Dead zones traditionally exist so if a controller has a tweak on their stick, their character may

75
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:38,598
drift. So to keep the sticks from drifting, you have this dead zone saying that if it's

76
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:41,521
within this area of the controller, ignore the input.

77
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:48,396
Now, having this be custom helps people with mobility issues too, because it allows them to

78
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:53,279
say if I have hand jitter or something, it allows them to go through and say, okay, so I only want

79
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,521
to worry about the edges, ignore any time my hand shakes, I just care if it's full throttle or

80
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:05,245
nothing. This lets them be more able to do this. At the same point in time, this is Borderlands 3

81
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:05,645
Scream.

82
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:09,639
This game allows access dead zones.

83
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,661
That means that if you have something

84
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:13,322
where you want to bias it,

85
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:16,685
so up, down, left, right on a stick is most of it,

86
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:18,186
and diagonals are mostly ignored,

87
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,928
they're shifted to the edge,

88
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,009
it allows you to do that.

89
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,070
So if you just want to be able to look up and down

90
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,991
or left and right,

91
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,214
and you keep having your controller drift in various ways,

92
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:29,876
this gives you more options to do that.

93
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:31,458
And I love that that exists.

94
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,791
Analog sensitivity fits multiple needs.

95
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,794
It needs to be faster for those who have trouble

96
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:42,737
with large motions, but it needs to be slower

97
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:46,942
for those who lack dexterity to handle small motions.

98
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:50,465
So you put that together, it's important for sensitivity

99
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:52,568
to both go up and down.

100
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:59,708
Now, some people may have more issues where I accidentally keep looking up and down and I don't want to.

101
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:04,830
So being able to set horizontal and vertical separately is important.

102
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,451
Even better is to have this on every single axis.

103
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,411
And for the screenshot here, it's Portal 2.

104
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:15,532
Single sticks. I love single sticks.

105
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:21,714
Stretching my hands out on a controller hurts.

106
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:25,134
The more I have to stretch, the harder it is.

107
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:29,797
So only needing one stick means that it gives my right hand a break.

108
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:33,200
And my right hand needs as many breaks as possible.

109
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,643
So Diablo 3, I played it hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of hours.

110
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:41,626
And the main reason being, it has one stick!

111
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:44,909
You don't have a camera stick, you just have one stick.

112
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:48,711
Most games that I played for hundreds of hours, I have noticed,

113
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,092
have one stick.

114
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:56,840
In addition to this, I also have it configured so I don't have to use as many buttons as possible

115
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,143
so I can avoid the triggers. It's hard for me to stretch.

116
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:04,266
So I'm basically most of the time using one stick, A and B.

117
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:08,710
And yes, it's true that not all builds work great for this,

118
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,393
but plenty do where I can finish the season.

119
00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:16,396
And it's not about being the most ultimate number one gamer.

120
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:17,877
It's about having an experience.

121
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:24,119
it's so important to allow experiences. I can play this game with my friends with no problems

122
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:26,099
and I absolutely love that.

123
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:35,822
Now stick flipping is important too and this is a Halo Master Chief collection screen.

124
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,823
Stick flipping means that if you're left-handed it probably helps and that's probably the

125
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:44,284
reason why most people think about stick flipping but for someone like me

126
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:47,458
One hand is harder to use than the other.

127
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,361
It varies by day as to which one of my hands

128
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:51,662
is a harder time.

129
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:53,704
So being able to move things around

130
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:56,927
and figure out where the sensitivity matters

131
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,449
makes it way, way easier

132
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:02,452
for people with mobility issues to play the game.

133
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:08,417
So I recommend making things as configurable as possible

134
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,419
and stick flipping is great.

135
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:10,699
Now,

136
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:17,762
Another thing is toggle versus hold versus button mashing versus quicktime events.

137
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:19,964
And this is Jedi Fallen Order.

138
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:25,448
Here you have, you can disable button mashers and quicktime events.

139
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:28,811
Quicktime events are usually a wall for me.

140
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:31,393
I cannot hit buttons very quickly.

141
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:35,797
And if it's using the bumpers and triggers and the face buttons,

142
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,939
I am going to have a problem, especially if it involves bumpers and triggers.

143
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:44,213
because my hands just do not do that motion very well.

144
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:52,580
So the fact you can turn it all off is amazing. I love it so much. You can also turn off things

145
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,181
like if you hold out A and there's like a little you know meter to say that you really want to do

146
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:02,462
something you can turn that off and just hit a button. The longer I hold buttons down the more

147
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:07,043
likely my hands are going to be fatigued. So the fact that there is a way to turn that off

148
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:09,043
really really matters.

149
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:15,366
They also have lots of auto motion like auto walk on target and auto grip on wall.

150
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:20,289
And I'll tell you, I probably would not be able to make the jump as you see in the screen here

151
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:23,730
where I'm jumping onto a fence and having to grab the fence.

152
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,532
Having to hit a button to jump and then hit a button to hit the fence

153
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:28,753
is probably not going to happen.

154
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:33,275
So the fact it's an automatic motion as soon as I touch the fence, I cling.

155
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:40,319
That's great. That lets me be able to play. Otherwise, I would probably just keep falling and falling and falling.

156
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:43,240
Like I did when I tried to take the screenshot with the character in air,

157
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,484
it's really hard for me to take screenshots and play it at the same time.

158
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:55,066
So, I'm really glad these auto-motions exist.

159
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:55,127
Now...

160
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,092
Auto aim is another thing that matters.

161
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:02,635
This is great for a wide variety of people.

162
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,897
But when it comes to mobility issues,

163
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,579
it means that I know if I just hit this button,

164
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:11,222
I don't have to try to make a stick to pick something.

165
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:12,363
And in case you noticed,

166
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,645
my whole thing is about not having to use sticks very much.

167
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:16,046
I have problems.

168
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:23,331
But this means I don't have to use that. If I see that there's like this little blue cone,

169
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:32,436
this is an NHL 20, if I see I'm within that blue cone, that means I'm good. And that means that

170
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:39,060
I can just hit a single button and it goes much, much better than it would otherwise.

171
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,141
Now I know in this particular screenshot I'm not looking.

172
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,865
at the actual goal.

173
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:47,648
Again, I have trouble taking screenshots

174
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:53,235
and actually playing the games at the same time.

175
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:57,701
I actually did all these captures myself.

176
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:57,801
So...

177
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:58,642
I'm my home Xbox.

178
00:10:58,642 --> 00:10:59,363
Auto jump.

179
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,044
Any auto anything

180
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:00,264
is wonderful.

181
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,232
Auto jump with Minecraft means,

182
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:05,593
most of Minecraft is only a one block jump anyway.

183
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:08,975
This means that instead of jumping every single time

184
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:10,076
I want to go up one block,

185
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:12,457
I just keep moving the controller forward

186
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:14,398
and it just keeps going.

187
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:18,220
That is great.

188
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,022
So I strongly recommend

189
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,363
allowing as many different auto features

190
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:24,444
as you possibly can.

191
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:28,466
Auto grab, auto jump, auto open something, auto anything.

192
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:30,527
The more auto you have, the better.

193
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:40,714
Another thing that matters, and this is Dragon Ball FighterZ, you wouldn't think, you know,

194
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:48,517
mobility issues in fighter games. They can work. Dragon Ball FighterZ has a great single player

195
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:52,698
mode, and I bought the game specifically for the single player mode, and it's really the

196
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:55,400
only fighting game that I have a really...

197
00:11:56,797 --> 00:11:59,398
easy time, relatively speaking, playing.

198
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:00,779
Because,

199
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:01,880
even though it says 26 hits,

200
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,161
you've got this wonderful combo going

201
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:05,722
as it shows on the screen.

202
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:07,683
I think I probably only hit three or four buttons.

203
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:10,485
There are combos in terms of having to do

204
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:12,406
complicated sequences.

205
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:13,726
You don't actually have to use them.

206
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:18,028
And because of that, that means I can only hit a few buttons

207
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,749
and it does all those wonderful things.

208
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:22,650
It's true that those moves may be slightly weaker,

209
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,551
but at the same point in time,

210
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:27,692
the game allows grinding of levels in story mode,

211
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:30,134
which means that even if I'm not doing as much power,

212
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,975
I will eventually be able to beat it anyway.

213
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,936
And it's all about having an experience.

214
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:39,098
So one of the nice things about this game

215
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:39,478
is that it's custom,

216
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:43,780
you can fully customize what button does what.

217
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:48,042
And it lets you pick certain button combinations,

218
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,823
like heavy, medium attacks, that sort of things.

219
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:53,885
And it lets you assign one button

220
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:55,085
to multiple button presses.

221
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:58,387
Anytime I have to hit less buttons, it's a win.

222
00:12:58,387 --> 00:13:00,547
The fact that it originally,

223
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,988
none of those double buttons are aliased,

224
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:04,869
you have to do that yourself.

225
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,410
You can even alias the menu button.

226
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,271
So I have the menu button doing something that I think is supposed to be a tapping event.

227
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:14,092
I don't know, I've never actually been able to do a tapping event.

228
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:16,212
My hands don't do that.

229
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:21,994
But this means that I was able to use some combos just because they're hitting multiple buttons at once.

230
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:26,035
And I was able to play the story mode and I had a wonderful time.

231
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:31,456
It's true that I probably won't do well in multiplayer because I can't do all the fancy things.

232
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:35,357
But at the same point in time, I still had a wonderful time with single player.

233
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,458
I bought it knowing of that.

234
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:40,850
And it was great.

235
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,611
Anytime somebody has an experience,

236
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:45,933
even if it's not the ideal experience, that's still a win.

237
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,134
Ideal is wonderful too,

238
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:52,537
but an experience is really, really important.

239
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:55,118
It may actually not be that hard to do.

240
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:59,941
Reduce button modes.

241
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:02,243
This is FIFA 20, I believe.

242
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:07,934
it has the ability to reduce the number of buttons you play.

243
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:11,116
And I think if the two-button mode was introduced

244
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,418
around 19 or 20, I'm becoming a little vague

245
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,339
on what was released when.

246
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,402
But I do know that, actually it was probably released in 19.

247
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:23,444
In 20, they added in, like if you have the two-button modes,

248
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:25,485
you have less options to do.

249
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:30,128
But then they have, in 20, they added in the one-button mode.

250
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:34,649
This means you just need one stick and one button.

251
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:36,230
That's it.

252
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,014
And let's say someone's using an Xbox accessibility controller

253
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,255
and they have a rudder control attached to it,

254
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,237
so they're using a foot to move one stick,

255
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:49,000
and they have one giant button they're using their arm on.

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,181
That's enough to play FIFA.

257
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,930
That's great.

258
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,631
This is exactly the type of experience

259
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:57,092
we want people to be having.

260
00:14:57,092 --> 00:15:00,413
It's really important to be able to say, I can't play.

261
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:05,315
And it's okay if it's not the same for everyone.

262
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:06,936
It doesn't matter.

263
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:10,237
It's about having an experience.

264
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:13,479
Now, optional haptic feedback is important to me

265
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,500
in particular because it makes my hands go numb.

266
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,475
The more vibrations there are to a device,

267
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:22,358
the harder time I'm going to have playing.

268
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:26,263
So it's really important to me to be able to turn that off.

269
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:28,525
When I was playing Sea of Solitude, as you see here,

270
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:32,090
the menu, the main menu, has to control your vibrations.

271
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:34,918
And I'm like, no, my hands are already going numb.

272
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,279
I immediately went to the menu and I was able to turn it off.

273
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,880
The thing is it actually had multiple levels of it.

274
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,381
So I could say I want maximum controller vibrations,

275
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:45,442
or I could say I just want the things

276
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:49,043
that are really important and all the, you know,

277
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:51,264
environmental stuff, I don't care as much.

278
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:52,064
Or I can say none.

279
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:53,085
I immediately said none,

280
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:57,826
but I really deeply appreciate that they had multiple levels.

281
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,908
And I also would love to see things like,

282
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:04,690
really vibrations could have tracks like audio has tracks.

283
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,511
So like when you have the environmental sounds

284
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:12,993
and you have music things or special effects,

285
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:14,194
you could do the same thing with haptic.

286
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:20,458
And the fact that you can turn on and off things is wonderful because that means that if it's

287
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:26,241
something that cues in on like, oh, there's a special key in the room, I might still be able

288
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:32,365
to feel that. But at the same point in time, I don't necessarily need to hit every single time

289
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:39,209
a bomb drops. I don't need my controller vibrating. So I love the fact that these exist. It helps so

290
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:39,510
much.

291
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:46,233
Provide as many difficulty options as possible.

292
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:47,974
Easy mode is okay.

293
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:51,096
And really, easy varies for everyone.

294
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:52,197
When it's easy for one person,

295
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:54,238
could be impossible for someone else,

296
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:56,279
and we should not be policing experiences.

297
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,281
The most important point is to have an experience.

298
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:04,187
This is Celeste. Celeste is known to be hard to play.

299
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:08,609
And one of the first things I did is that I set the game to half speed,

300
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,270
going, okay, this should be enough.

301
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,471
Maybe I don't need infinite stamina and visibility,

302
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:15,952
but that at least means that when I have this fast moving jumps,

303
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,614
I might be able to react in time.

304
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,815
I will say that that was absolutely not true.

305
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:23,416
Oh my God, this game is so hard, so fast.

306
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,137
And I kept jumping and blowing up

307
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:28,418
because as soon as you touch a spike, you are dead.

308
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,642
unless you turn on invulnerability.

309
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:33,404
At that point, you touch the spikes,

310
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:34,325
you're not instantly dead,

311
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:35,726
and you can figure out,

312
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:38,229
so what am I supposed to do now?

313
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:40,792
And you don't have to start the whole screen over.

314
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,714
It is wonderful that either way,

315
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:44,136
you only have to redo a screen.

316
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:50,600
But overall, I didn't think I was going to need this, and it turns out I very desperately did.

317
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:57,144
And that meant that I played. Now, if I didn't have those options, I would have hit a wall

318
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:02,467
very, very early that I would not have been able to get past. At that point, I only played a couple

319
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:08,050
percentage points of the game. So this means that I can play and experience the majority of the game

320
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,532
and story. And that's what really matters, is having an experience.

321
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,730
Friendly fire.

322
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,852
Now, to avoid dragging my friends' gamer tags in this,

323
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:21,973
the screen capture of Diablo III

324
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:23,455
is technically single player.

325
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:26,397
However, the visualization still applies.

326
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:30,360
When I'm playing as a wizard, fire is everywhere.

327
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,782
Literal fire is everywhere.

328
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:35,985
This means that it's difficult

329
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:38,187
to avoid hitting other people.

330
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:41,590
And if Diablo allowed friendly fire,

331
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,792
I think everybody would have a hard time

332
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:44,432
playing it together.

333
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:51,665
So it's wonderful that it doesn't, but that type of behavior is true for pretty much any game.

334
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:55,827
Because I am not going to be trying to attack friendly targets.

335
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:58,688
However, my hands are terrible.

336
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:03,190
So if I'm trying to shoot and somebody gets in the way or whatever,

337
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,873
or my hand drifts a little bit or whatever, I'm probably going to hit friendly targets.

338
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:13,114
and I really don't want to shoot my friends. That's really not the goal here.

339
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:16,715
So I greatly appreciate what options exist to turn it off,

340
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:19,296
or if it's just not there in the first place like it is with Diablo.

341
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:25,898
Um, yeah, I love this game so much. I love games in general. I've played the

342
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,738
majority of the games we have here and then some.

343
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:33,180
Um, how much I play varies on my hands and I'm very careful about it,

344
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,660
but I am a very much a hardcore gamer.

345
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:42,621
Can chat means less typing, so when you're playing with your friends,

346
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:46,312
friendly fire is not the only thing that matters. Communication matters too.

347
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:50,495
Now, CanChat's wonderful for so many reasons.

348
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:53,417
It means that I don't have to do extensive typing,

349
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,978
but I can still get the point across.

350
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:57,140
It's great for localization.

351
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,661
And let's say I'm playing with somebody

352
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,262
who speaks a different language.

353
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:02,243
I send a message, they get it in their own language.

354
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:02,503
It's great.

355
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:07,607
It's also great because it means you don't need a mic.

356
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,969
You can just pick a number, pick whatever you want.

357
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,411
And what I really, really love, and this is Apex Legends,

358
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:16,632
what I really love the most about Apex Legends

359
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:21,415
is that you can specify what your quips,

360
00:20:21,415 --> 00:20:23,677
or, okay, can chat, is.

361
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:25,638
I prefer friendly messages, and like,

362
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:26,479
hi, how are you doing?

363
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:29,461
Everything's great, you know, great game.

364
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,543
And I can do that, and I can pick all positive,

365
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:33,723
friendly-sounding messages,

366
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:36,505
and still have a persona in the game,

367
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:38,927
and it's all done through can chat.

368
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,148
I absolutely adore this.

369
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:48,070
Now, I will say one thing.

370
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,911
This is Skyrim, which I recently rediscovered again.

371
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:54,772
Starting by playing this and realizing it was re-released.

372
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:58,013
I didn't realize it was re-released, so now I get to get the achievements all over again.

373
00:20:58,013 --> 00:20:59,934
So I'm having a great deal of fun.

374
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:06,427
Well, one thing I love about the Elder Scrolls series in particular, saves.

375
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:12,209
They have saves. You can have saves as much as you want in so many different ways.

376
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:17,271
In Skyrim, it allows you to save when you're about to go to sleep in the game.

377
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:21,153
You can save if you're just like, there's an option to wait, so you can just let time pass.

378
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:23,373
So if you're waiting for a store to open, you don't have to wait.

379
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:25,815
Game speed, you can just jump ahead.

380
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:30,458
You can save on fast traveling between locations automatically.

381
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,700
And you can pick how long you want save periods to happen.

382
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,122
If you're just sitting at the character menu and walk away for a while.

383
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:40,544
So it goes, game goes, oh, in this case here I set for 15 minutes.

384
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:44,366
15 minutes has gone by and it's like, I should probably save just in case something happens, type of thing.

385
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:52,964
And the nice thing about all this, you can have as many save slots as you want, hard drive notwithstanding.

386
00:21:52,964 --> 00:22:03,431
But, I mean, I have hundreds. At this point I'm on save slot thousand something, but I do reuse them, I don't have literally that many, but I do have quite a few.

387
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:10,700
I love the fact that the auto saves are all their own slots too. That's fantastic. That means if I

388
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:18,363
do forget to save before I do something, then luckily an auto save will be close enough.

389
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:24,686
I save a lot. I am terrible at jumping. I am terrible at anything that requires dexterity.

390
00:22:24,686 --> 00:22:29,568
So if I'm going to jump, or if I'm going to try to do something, and I know that it's very likely

391
00:22:29,568 --> 00:22:33,430
I'm probably going to fall over and just die from a fall, I will save first.

392
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:38,259
I love the fact it lets me do this.

393
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,860
If I make a mistake like that,

394
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,361
I can just go back to my previous save. That's great.

395
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:48,806
Another thing that Elder Scrolls Skyrim lets you do is it has mods.

396
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:57,532
It's so amazing to see mods being allowed in a console game.

397
00:22:57,532 --> 00:23:00,253
What I love is they also have categories for it.

398
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,656
One thing I would love to see in the future is an accessibility category.

399
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:06,435
And not just this, but all games.

400
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:14,359
Because then people who are purposely trying to make things

401
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:20,462
to get past some of the issues they may encounter,

402
00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:21,502
have an avenue to do this.

403
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:22,363
And that would be fantastic.

404
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:25,584
It's all about having an experience.

405
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:27,745
Now, to recap, I will rattle these off

406
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:29,486
for those of you who are listening only.

407
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:35,128
We talked about multi-device support,

408
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:39,490
dead zones and sensitivity for each analog input and access,

409
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,212
stick, single stick support, stick flipping,

410
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:46,214
toggle versus hold versus button mashing,

411
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:47,775
and optional quick time events.

412
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:53,638
Auto action support via jump, aim, or anything else.

413
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:56,539
Simple button presses over combos,

414
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:00,021
customizing input layout, reduced button modes,

415
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:09,229
optional haptic feedback, friendly fire safe, custom can chat, save options, and allow mods.

416
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:13,934
And you're welcome to screen cap this as a quick summary to remember

417
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:19,600
of the types of things that really do help people with mobility issues, myself included.

418
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:19,660
Now

419
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,933
There is going to be a live Q&A.

420
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:27,514
You can check the schedule for it.

421
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,855
I don't know the schedule at the time of this recording.

422
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:32,816
And I would strongly suggest you attend.

423
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:36,157
You are welcome to ask me anything outside of this

424
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:37,337
from my previous presentations too.

425
00:24:37,337 --> 00:24:37,958
I really don't mind.

426
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,358
So if you have any questions

427
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:42,219
in the realm of accessibility in general,

428
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:43,160
feel free to ask.

429
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,340
I look forward to seeing you there.

430
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,781
If you have questions, you want to reach me online.

431
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:48,962
The easiest way to reach me really

432
00:24:48,962 --> 00:24:51,803
is the Twitter, EA underscore accessible.

433
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:53,585
I am there all the time.

434
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:56,869
And if you're looking for more information

435
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:00,453
on electronic arts and accessibility in games,

436
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:02,055
EA.com slash ABLE is our portal site.

437
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:03,256
I recommend looking at it

438
00:25:03,256 --> 00:25:05,839
if you're looking for more information.

439
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,521
Thank you so much for watching my presentation

440
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:10,044
and have a wonderful GDC.
