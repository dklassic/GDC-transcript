1
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:11,133
Welcome everyone to the 1500 Slot Machines Walk Into a Bar

2
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:14,035
talk, Adventures in Quantity Over Quality.

3
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:16,377
A couple notes before we get started.

4
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,458
Please silence your phones.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,520
Also, you may have heard that there is a.

6
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:26,871
event given next door by Microsoft with some servers that need some extreme cooling, so

7
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,092
it's extremely cold in here.

8
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:29,633
That's untrue.

9
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:34,357
We told them to turn the heat way down because the heat's going to get way up in this talk.

10
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:34,738
Am I right?

11
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:34,858
Yeah.

12
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:34,938
Yes.

13
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:35,038
Yeah.

14
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:35,138
Yeah.

15
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:35,238
Yeah.

16
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:35,678
Yeah.

17
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:35,879
Yeah.

18
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:36,119
Yeah.

19
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:36,359
Yeah.

20
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,180
Yeah.

21
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:39,261
Yeah.

22
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:39,902
Yeah.

23
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:40,002
Yeah.

24
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:40,102
Yeah.

25
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:40,202
Yeah.

26
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:40,803
Yeah.

27
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:50,973
So my name is Alex Schwartz and I founded and ran Alchemy Labs, the folks behind mobile games, Smuggle Truck, Jack Lumber, Discourse.

28
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:53,956
We also made Job Simulator and Rick and Morty VR.

29
00:00:54,777 --> 00:01:01,165
We were acquired by Google a little over a year ago and I left recently to found an unannounced new venture.

30
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:03,287
And I am Zaiba.

31
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:07,270
I run Pop Cannibal, makers of such gems as Adult Swim's

32
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,512
Girls Like Robots, the IGF-nominated Elegy

33
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:13,854
for a Dead World, and Boat Building crowdfunding success

34
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,636
Make Sail, now in early access.

35
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,979
So let me first start off by, you

36
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,180
may have read the description.

37
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,362
You may have come to this talk thinking, what's going on here?

38
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:25,663
Let me tell you what we did.

39
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:30,626
In 2013, as a joke slash experiment, the two of us

40
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:31,307
built a robot.

41
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:34,989
that builds slot machine games, a lot of slot machine games.

42
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,591
And this robot went on a journey to automate

43
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:41,651
the process of creating, re-skinning, theming,

44
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,332
and launching those slot machines on the Android Google

45
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:44,812
Play Store.

46
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:49,714
We eventually created 1,500 slot machines.

47
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:55,455
Way beyond our expectations, we received over a million

48
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:59,057
installs of these slot machines and made actual money.

49
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,401
So, let's talk about this.

50
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:06,402
So, we are going to tell our tale today in four parts.

51
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:10,402
First, Alex is going to describe the seed of our discontent,

52
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:12,023
which blossomed into this enterprise.

53
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:15,863
Second, you will ride with us as we roll this snowball downhill,

54
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:17,264
collecting mass and speed.

55
00:02:17,744 --> 00:02:20,604
Until third, we realize this may not be a joke.

56
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:24,745
And finally, we will enrich your lives with conclusions

57
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:26,885
that can only be arrived at by people

58
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,426
who have breathed the rarefied air

59
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:29,866
from heights such as we have achieved.

60
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,480
So let's go back to 2013.

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,021
Just a quick heads up.

62
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:40,723
If you're watching the slides during the talk,

63
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:43,104
at the bottom in the footer, every once in a while,

64
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:46,026
we'll have actual slot machines that were created and released

65
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:49,007
and downloaded with real stats displayed next to them.

66
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:52,249
So keep an eye out for those gems like 3D Puffin slots

67
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:53,490
with 42,000 downloads.

68
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:55,811
So 2013.

69
00:02:56,091 --> 00:03:00,513
Here's a picture of Zybon and myself, just two indie game

70
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:01,514
developers with Hulk hands.

71
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:04,609
And we were working together in a co-working space,

72
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:05,450
making video games.

73
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:10,273
And at the time, we had actually just launched

74
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:12,314
premium mobile titles.

75
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,876
And we're kind of coming across subpar sales

76
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:19,058
and discontent with the whole market.

77
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,139
2013 was a different time.

78
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,781
And we felt like we were doing everything right based

79
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,223
on what we knew about the mobile market at that time,

80
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:28,084
everything within our power to succeed.

81
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:31,066
So by that, I mean we were hitting all these kind of like,

82
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:31,767
we're doing it right.

83
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:37,072
check boxes on mobile, we were working with big brand name publishers, which was Sega,

84
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:38,093
Adults and Games.

85
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:41,175
We were winning awards.

86
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:42,796
We were getting good reviews.

87
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:49,120
And none of that seemed to actually make a difference in making our money back and being

88
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,821
able to make enough money to make the next game.

89
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:57,466
So at this point, we're pretty much concluding that the mobile space is dying, at least for

90
00:03:57,506 --> 00:03:58,166
premium games.

91
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,015
And we weren't feeling too happy about that,

92
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:04,417
and sharing that unhappiness with our other indie friends

93
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,679
and seeing that, hey, this is not really a great market.

94
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,201
And we were looking through the App Store

95
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:15,863
and realizing how kind of scummy and gross some parts of it

96
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:16,784
can really be.

97
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:19,165
And there's clones everywhere.

98
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:22,006
There's garbage reskins, low effort shovelware,

99
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:25,848
and casino phone bill.

100
00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:26,529
I have no idea.

101
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:27,589
What is this gummy bear?

102
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:35,557
card game? I have no idea. Jackpots all around. And so we thought, you know, this garbage,

103
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:41,161
how do we do better? How do we do gross better? How do we hit rock bottom and find that spot?

104
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:51,569
So Global Game Jam was coming up and it was at MIT and we're feeling so burnt out on mobile

105
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,271
and we just thought, you know, let's just build something really, really out there.

106
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:58,893
So I did most of the tech on this project.

107
00:04:58,933 --> 00:04:59,633
I'll admit to that.

108
00:05:00,753 --> 00:05:04,134
So at this point, we want to make a terrible game.

109
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:06,914
I didn't know if I was capable of that,

110
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,554
but I was going to try really hard.

111
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:11,395
Then we need to clone it over and over.

112
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:16,496
So this involves pictures and sounds and assets.

113
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:19,016
And it just sounds exhausting.

114
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,877
And how even do slot machines work?

115
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:21,817
Nah.

116
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:23,597
Let's not bother with any of that.

117
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:28,564
Sorry.

118
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:31,425
There we go.

119
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:35,227
We just bought one off the asset store. $15.

120
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:39,269
So that's right.

121
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,790
Our whole talk, our whole enterprise,

122
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,132
is all based on a $15 game that we did not even make ourselves.

123
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:48,553
It was just this generic machine.

124
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:51,094
You pull the handle, you get noises and spinny things

125
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:51,894
and coins sometimes.

126
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:52,314
I don't know.

127
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:53,575
I don't actually really know much about how

128
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:54,275
these slot machines work.

129
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,936
Don't judge us too harshly, though,

130
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:00,357
because we did put in effort to make it our own.

131
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:03,959
We stuck advertising on it.

132
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,361
Thank you.

133
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:06,821
You're welcome.

134
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,223
Playhaven adds to be specific, and Alex

135
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:12,224
will tell you later how they eventually felt about that.

136
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:16,226
So this is going great, but we only have one game.

137
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,728
And I needed infinite games, which

138
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:22,529
required further and deeper customization.

139
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:27,415
So we swap the name, curling slots becomes cantaloupe slots.

140
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,499
Curling stone becomes a cantaloupe.

141
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,500
Are you feeling that yet?

142
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,182
This is, OK, wait, there's more.

143
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,186
So we also added in an about blurb for every slot.

144
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,568
It's this flavor text.

145
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:43,790
It just really brings the feel of the theme to you.

146
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:48,655
In this example here, we have hair slots, which

147
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:51,574
Did you know hair is a protein filament?

148
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:54,077
These are practically educational games at this point.

149
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:56,700
And the piece de resistance.

150
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,643
Every slot gets a custom-themed song.

151
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:01,965
So we use text-to-speech for the vocals,

152
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:04,367
and then we deftly match that in with our fat beats.

153
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:05,348
Are you ready for this?

154
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:05,949
Let's do it.

155
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,373
["CANTALOUPE"]

156
00:07:09,473 --> 00:07:11,034
Cantaloupe.

157
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:20,234
Oh.

158
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:25,240
So then we just swamped those assets about 1,000 times

159
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,801
by hand.

160
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:27,343
Of course not.

161
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:32,249
We wrote a Unity editor script that would just take one word,

162
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:35,493
and then it would use Google to download the text

163
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:36,715
to speech for our hot track.

164
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:42,228
It would go to Wikipedia to pull in a blurb for the about page.

165
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:44,950
Sometimes we'd end up with a disambiguation page

166
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,091
because it's like GDC also means General Dental

167
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:48,332
Council and other stuff.

168
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:52,074
I didn't really care because sacrifices to quality

169
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:54,495
weren't just made, they were sought after.

170
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,358
We use Google's image search API to find the images

171
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,420
until we hit a rate limit.

172
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,622
We use Bing's image API to find some images.

173
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:08,378
Thank you, Bing.

174
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,440
So at this point, we can just type themes into Unity,

175
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,660
and it pulls in all these images.

176
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,420
It makes the app, and this is amazing.

177
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,501
But that does not cover publishing these

178
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:23,901
in the Google Play Store.

179
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,822
The Google Play Store, it wants screenshots.

180
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:32,123
It has these check boxes and blurbs and more screenshots

181
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:33,704
and dropdowns.

182
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,564
And Google, you are asking too much of me.

183
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,871
Are you trying to ruin my entire day?

184
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:42,095
Oh, privacy policy, yeah.

185
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:45,438
So the screenshots and the icons are not a real problem.

186
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:48,841
We just go into Unity, we move the camera around,

187
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,602
we throw up a sassy frame.

188
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:50,682
Bam.

189
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:54,766
That's quality.

190
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,153
But for the actual Android developer page, enter Selenium.

191
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:06,155
So Selenium is this super potent web automation tool

192
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:08,955
that lets you record, customize, and play back

193
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:10,176
these web browser interactions.

194
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:13,836
So we connected that into our Unity editor script,

195
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:17,917
and we got it to open up Chrome, log in as our Google account,

196
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:21,818
create a new Android app, fill in all these text boxes,

197
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:28,239
screenshots, blurbs, more nasty, nasty checkboxes, upload the APK

198
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:29,420
and it's live.

199
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,591
So, at this point, we have reduced the gap between conceiving of a game and having it

200
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:40,492
live in the marketplace to typing in one word and pressing enter.

201
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:44,373
So, you might be wondering...

202
00:09:44,393 --> 00:09:44,473
What?

203
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:45,713
Now what?

204
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:45,933
Now what?

205
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:46,113
Now what?

206
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:46,293
Now what?

207
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:46,473
Now what?

208
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:46,653
Now what?

209
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:46,833
Now what?

210
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:47,014
Now what?

211
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:50,574
Now what?

212
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:50,754
Now what?

213
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:50,934
Now what?

214
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:51,155
Now what?

215
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:51,335
Now what?

216
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:51,515
Now what?

217
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:51,735
Now what?

218
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,440
Well, some stats for you.

219
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,322
First two months, we launched 126 games, had 32,000 downloads.

220
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:13,045
Some old classics, such as Richard III slots.

221
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,345
71 downloads in the US, great.

222
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:18,427
Got the Harlem Shake slots.

223
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:18,847
2013, remember.

224
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:20,348
It was cool then.

225
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,509
Sure it was.

226
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:26,650
So you know.

227
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:28,397
This thing's chugging along.

228
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,678
We launched some games.

229
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:30,438
We had our fun.

230
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:33,960
So we did what any self-respecting game

231
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,701
developers did is we walked away and forgot about it.

232
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:42,644
And we actually came back many months later

233
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:43,645
after the holidays.

234
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:47,227
A lot of times app stores have kind of a bump

235
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:47,907
during the holidays.

236
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,768
We're like, oh, I wonder what happened.

237
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:52,709
And we saw the downloads went way up.

238
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,691
But then we checked our Playhaven ad network back end.

239
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,270
And, you know, we were surprised as you.

240
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:04,852
We first saw that in January and throughout the holidays,

241
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,092
we were making $210 a day on ads.

242
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:11,793
Not only that, we saw that the ECPM

243
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:14,114
for those interstitial ads was at $59.

244
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:18,015
And so, you know, I think we promptly Googled what is an

245
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,275
ECPM and that's way too high.

246
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:22,456
We also saw

247
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:25,126
And I'm, you know, I'm no scientist,

248
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:28,448
but 27% click through on the ad?

249
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,970
There's no way that humans click on ads

250
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,771
anywhere above somewhere around 1%.

251
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:39,133
So, we needed to step back and think,

252
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:40,094
what have we done?

253
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:40,974
What's happening here?

254
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:43,216
What the fuck is going on?

255
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:47,318
And after thinking for a bit,

256
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:50,860
we have to kind of step back and think about the basics.

257
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,051
What are video games, and why do people show ads in games?

258
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:59,173
So the typical mobile model for ads,

259
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:02,415
which I'll dub the retention model, is, as I see it,

260
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:06,637
you make something of a quality game for the intention

261
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,198
of having human beings have fun in said game

262
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:12,399
so that they will stay inside of the app.

263
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,120
And if they're playing for longer,

264
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,321
you could show them more ads, right?

265
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:18,142
And this is in one game.

266
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:20,043
Now.

267
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:24,524
What if you took this model and you turned it completely on its head?

268
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:30,306
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the signal-to-noise anti-retention model.

269
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:37,348
You have an obscenely low-quality game, thousands of them in fact,

270
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:40,909
that are found via hyper-specific keyword searches.

271
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,190
If you really love unicorns, we've got like nine slots for you. It's great.

272
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,611
Then you get the game and you're instantly bored, disappointed.

273
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,432
dismayed, disgusted.

274
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,374
And then, bam, we show you an ad.

275
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:59,575
But not just any ad, a perfect ad.

276
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:03,097
This ad looks so damn good.

277
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:10,439
The idea that a real game, a real game of quality

278
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,840
is just out of reach.

279
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,422
That with a single click, you could be onto.

280
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:19,032
Greener pastures.

281
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:22,475
The contrast in quality between where you are in this garbage pile

282
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:25,797
and where you could be is so high that of course you click.

283
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:27,178
You click to escape.

284
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:28,880
You click for a better future.

285
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:35,024
And maybe that's why our games are making a lot of money.

286
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:36,125
I don't know.

287
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:39,908
So, it's just a theory.

288
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,571
So clearly, you know, chugging along.

289
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:45,532
Thanks, Shutterstock.

290
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:51,697
The next thing is, well, clearly we have to put more time into this, obviously.

291
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:54,339
So next step, got to incorporate.

292
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,601
Signal to noise LLC, you're welcome.

293
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:57,482
We are the noise.

294
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:03,347
And yeah.

295
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:07,310
OK, so technically, what we had was good, but my life was not yet all just

296
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,992
champagne and three Musketeers bars.

297
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,194
I had two major problems.

298
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:14,376
One, we had to sit there and type in.

299
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:17,950
Theme after theme, wait for the process, type in another theme.

300
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,991
Imagine sitting at a computer for up to 20 minutes a day

301
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,572
just so you could publish a half a dozen games.

302
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:25,412
No.

303
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:31,795
Second problem, we discovered Google had a max 15 app a day

304
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:32,735
upload limit.

305
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:34,236
I mean, come on.

306
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:35,736
It's like they're not even trying

307
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:36,957
to support our workflow.

308
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:39,758
It's time to re-architect.

309
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:43,259
So I wrote a web service and a website, Middleman.

310
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,080
We call it The Goose.

311
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,501
Golden goose.

312
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:49,423
And it's a PHP MySQL server with this HTML front end,

313
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:51,144
and it takes keywords, and then it

314
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:53,385
lets me pick from several of Bing's finest images,

315
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,787
and I can tweak the blurb if I'm feeling artsy.

316
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:57,948
And it lets us build up a long queue.

317
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:01,130
We can just pile 100 different ideas into this.

318
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,353
Most importantly, I stole Unity's documentation style

319
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:08,414
sheets for this site, so at a distance,

320
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,715
my activities look very legit to my office mates.

321
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:14,237
Please note, there's only one language.

322
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:16,920
Yeah.

323
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,020
Yeah.

324
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:24,285
So we put these hundreds of apps into the goose,

325
00:15:24,485 --> 00:15:26,286
and then back in Unity, it doesn't have to talk

326
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:27,667
to all these crazy different APIs,

327
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:28,788
it just talks to the goose.

328
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:30,810
It says, hey goose, give me an egg,

329
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,992
which describes one of these apps,

330
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,594
and then it builds its 15 of the day,

331
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:38,915
and now it publishes it,

332
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:40,456
and we can now do this from a web browser.

333
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:43,458
Anywhere in the world, we are just typing in our ideas

334
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,900
and willing these slots into the world.

335
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:50,422
But what I don't like is that I have to leave a Unity license open

336
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:52,744
in a machine running that's capable of building all these.

337
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:56,065
And it ties up my license, and I have other side hustles

338
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,067
that I need to be getting on with, and I'm not trying to break any terms of service.

339
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:03,989
So, the next idea is how do we free up Unity license?

340
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:10,372
We realize we only need Unity to build the slots, not to publish them.

341
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:13,654
So, we have the website where we just throw a hundred ideas in.

342
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:18,179
We go to Unity and then we just build hundreds of slot machines all at the same time,

343
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:21,362
but instead of publishing them, we just shove them back up into the goose.

344
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:24,265
And moving on to the next step.

345
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:28,454
we built a standalone game that does the publishing.

346
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,295
It says, hey, Goose, do you have anything that needs published?

347
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,376
It opens a Chrome, does its thing, and publishes.

348
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:37,157
So now any cheap computer can be a publishing terminal.

349
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:40,479
And so you can think of this very much like Steady at Home.

350
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:43,720
There's this central repository of important work

351
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,701
that any computer can now process

352
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,582
to advance the state of mankind.

353
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:55,758
What you're explicitly seeing here is that every time Marcus Phoenix from Gears of War gets hit in the head by an image from Bing,

354
00:16:56,258 --> 00:16:57,879
a slot machine is born into the world.

355
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:10,203
So with this, we could keep a stream of 15 games a day being published as long as we had this queue of them ready to go in a garbage laptop waiting to do its bit.

356
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,584
On a good day, we did absolutely nothing.

357
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:17,865
So you might be wondering...

358
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:22,615
What resulted of this next adventure?

359
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:26,859
10 people still playing Lobster Slots.

360
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:28,900
I don't know why.

361
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:35,286
One year in, we had launched 750 games

362
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:39,229
with over 200,000 downloads across those games.

363
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,331
So a couple quick stats.

364
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:44,553
We've got bowling slots.

365
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:45,574
That's simple.

366
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,840
Simple bowling game with 8,000 downloads.

367
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,542
We've got Dolphin Slots, which is killing it.

368
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:54,303
17,000 downloads just for Dolphin Slots.

369
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:56,324
It's very America and Malaysia.

370
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:02,568
And we've got now hundreds of apps on the store.

371
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:06,450
We're bound to get some takedowns, or arbitrary

372
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,451
takedowns from Google, right?

373
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:11,653
First, we saw apparently side boob is no longer OK.

374
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:21,155
Which that image alone, if I were to show it to you

375
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:23,557
with no other context, no one would know that that is,

376
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:24,998
that's side boob.

377
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,220
Once you add the text, maybe.

378
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:31,663
We're starting to get bug reports from users in emails.

379
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,745
So that means that someone's so engaged

380
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,728
and so upset about their diaper slots having crashed

381
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:42,030
that they opened up Gmail, screenshotted,

382
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,732
sent it to us and had a whole thing about it.

383
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,414
We're getting user reviews back.

384
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,816
These are actual user reviews, I swear to you.

385
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:55,497
Why are people enjoying any of this?

386
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:57,178
I don't understand.

387
00:18:57,198 --> 00:19:01,059
OK, some fair, fair content.

388
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,599
This person really wants to rate it lower than one star.

389
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,300
That's fine.

390
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
But this person really loves dolphins,

391
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,001
and they were very satisfied.

392
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:11,461
This person also loves dolphins.

393
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,362
And you know what?

394
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:14,722
I think we served them well.

395
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:17,463
So at this point.

396
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:19,995
the robots arrived.

397
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,077
And this is in the form of automated email outreach.

398
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:24,478
So let me clarify.

399
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,800
Our automated B2C casino app company

400
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,083
is now starting to attract automated B2B outreach.

401
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:32,964
So here's a good screenshot.

402
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:38,148
App Eggs was very interested in promoting 3D cabbage slots.

403
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:38,888
I could see why.

404
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:42,010
This baby's headed straight for the top.

405
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:46,193
But we're also getting a couple other pieces of outreach

406
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:46,994
from that company.

407
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:53,680
And, you know, we both run actual companies,

408
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:55,741
and we get a lot of spam,

409
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,502
and our bullshit detector's really high,

410
00:19:57,522 --> 00:19:58,963
and a lot of, you could tell, like,

411
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:00,264
hey, they're not actually talking to me,

412
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:01,544
that's just a robot that said this.

413
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:05,146
And when I get those at the real company that I run,

414
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,988
I feel like, man, I don't deserve getting all this spam.

415
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:10,289
But here I kind of feel like

416
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:14,671
we deserved, absolutely deserved getting all this spam.

417
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:16,892
And, you know, that's fine.

418
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:20,539
OK, so third push.

419
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,302
Already on a good day, we are doing nothing.

420
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:28,446
But we still have to occasionally shovel keywords

421
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:29,326
back into the goose.

422
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:32,569
So it's time to optimize.

423
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:36,392
Question is, what makes great garbage?

424
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:40,495
Why are dolphin slots hot and hot tamales not?

425
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:45,145
Well, when we started making these slot machines,

426
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:47,908
we were just kind of randomly coming up with these themes

427
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:48,528
willy-nilly.

428
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:49,989
It's kind of like Kaiser Sosay.

429
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:50,930
We're looking around the room.

430
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,493
We're making microphone slots, handsome co-presenter slots,

431
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:56,614
beautiful audience slots, whatever we want.

432
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:57,655
We're just throwing them out there.

433
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:01,398
But it occurs to us that most people are probably

434
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:04,941
getting to our apps by searching for something

435
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:08,023
they actually wanted and just stumbling over us instead.

436
00:21:08,724 --> 00:21:14,288
So how can we figure out what it is they're searching for so they are sidetracked by us more often?

437
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:23,035
Well, we couldn't find any actual search lists for the App Store, but there does exist Google Trends,

438
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:27,459
which is just a global list of what people are searching for on Google.

439
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,261
So here's a shot of Google Trends last week.

440
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:33,364
The stuff in red are sort of the problematic things.

441
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:34,485
It's a bit of a copyright.

442
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:40,979
landmine. So once you filter out all the celebrities and sex offenders and litigious institutions,

443
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,225
what you're left with are mostly current events, and often they're actually very weird current

444
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:54,993
events, which of course we used. This led to an early favorite of ours, deer antler

445
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:55,894
spray slots.

446
00:21:57,752 --> 00:22:01,775
This was at the time, there was some sort of NFL doping scandal where people were

447
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:07,340
spraying themselves with deer antler derivatives. I don't know, I'm not a reporter,

448
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,504
I don't have a responsibility to actually carry this story to you, I just made the slot machine.

449
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:16,068
So this one has a particular spot in our hearts,

450
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:19,552
but surprisingly it actually failed to garner an audience.

451
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,082
If Google Trends isn't working for us, there's not enough of them, and people aren't into it,

452
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,984
what can we do to automate this more?

453
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:32,545
How can we think less?

454
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:34,966
Word lists.

455
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:38,168
So I downloaded several large lists of words.

456
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:42,210
And you may also have noticed that we have a bit of a formula to our slot.

457
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,411
So let me give you a tour of that.

458
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:46,492
First, 3D, because 3D is hot.

459
00:22:46,672 --> 00:22:47,253
It's the future.

460
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,826
Also, it's really good for the alphabetical optimization.

461
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:53,608
It's right there on the top of your phone.

462
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:56,551
And then an adjective, any old adjective will do.

463
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:59,113
I have a very long list of them, and they're not all great.

464
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:01,835
And after that, we put in a subject.

465
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:04,277
Every country got a slot machine.

466
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:08,420
And slots, note it is, because with this audience,

467
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,441
there are some questions.

468
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:12,583
And free, so you know what an incredible value this is.

469
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:15,866
Then we made a button in the goose

470
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:17,006
where I could just click.

471
00:23:17,852 --> 00:23:21,412
try again over and over, and it would just iterate through this,

472
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:24,553
shuffle them together, go through the APIs and stuff.

473
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,633
And this is how we came up with genius such as Viceroy Butterfly

474
00:23:28,753 --> 00:23:31,034
and tremendous face pain slots.

475
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:31,974
I did love that one.

476
00:23:33,154 --> 00:23:36,335
Which culminated in the creation of a masterpiece.

477
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:38,535
By far my favorite slot.

478
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:41,776
Maybe the greatest slot of our generation.

479
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:45,416
Something so specific that one pure soul out there

480
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:46,437
might see it and think, wow.

481
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:49,453
They really know me, they know my needs,

482
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:51,314
and they know my generation.

483
00:23:51,574 --> 00:23:56,476
And I present to you, 3D inexperienced great horned owl

484
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:57,437
slots free.

485
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,802
I mean, I was training a great horned owl recently,

486
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,903
and I had some difficulty with their owl related drills.

487
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,024
And I thought, oh man, I should go to this slot for comfort.

488
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:15,765
But yeah, maybe it is slightly too specific or too targeted.

489
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:19,336
So at this point we thought, we need a professional.

490
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:24,079
We need to bring on a contractor who can help us decipher all this data and optimize.

491
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,141
Yeah, let's do it.

492
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:29,643
If you recall from our presentation, description on GDC,

493
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:31,965
we said that we involved an MIT statistician.

494
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:37,269
I regret to inform you that we forgot what university they were from and that was incorrect.

495
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,092
They were actually a Harvard psychology PhD.

496
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:43,713
I regret that small error.

497
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:47,676
So she came back to us with some real scientific looking data.

498
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:50,957
And I won't bore you with the statistics.

499
00:24:51,777 --> 00:24:54,098
But I will call out one of my favorite parts

500
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:58,799
in the middle, which was that in the spirit of automation,

501
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,400
she employed Amazon Mechanical Turk

502
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,521
to do all the mundane tagging and sorting of the slots, which

503
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,122
for those who are not familiar, Mechanical Turk

504
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:09,562
is a farm of human beings who complete tasks

505
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:12,783
that robots cannot yet get to the level of automating, which

506
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:13,123
is just.

507
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:18,703
Perfect. Our consultant on her own without inquiring with us outsourced monotonous work

508
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:23,306
to essentially a human-robot farm so that we could better automate creating robots.

509
00:25:26,427 --> 00:25:32,990
Anyway, the final slide of the presentation was the most important one. What are the takeaways?

510
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:38,593
What have we learned about all this data? We learned that sex is great, people hate

511
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:42,055
other people, and they hate objects, but

512
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:45,206
They love dogs, specifically dogs.

513
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:48,008
So you're welcome, everyone.

514
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:51,411
This is the hot, juicy data that you could use in your games

515
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:52,151
moving forward.

516
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:56,655
So yeah, we're giving it away for free, which is incredible.

517
00:25:58,376 --> 00:26:00,457
We also, after seeing all this, are

518
00:26:00,497 --> 00:26:01,999
wondering about all the inputs.

519
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,540
And there's so many things we could test against.

520
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,363
One thought was, what if we did a side experiment

521
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,825
to see and try to answer the question?

522
00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:14,561
does quality actually play a role in all of this?

523
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:18,625
So we thought, let's just rewrite the entire slot

524
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,187
machine from scratch and make a really good slot machine

525
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:24,650
and see how it compares to our really bad slot machine.

526
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,412
But we clearly were not incentivized to do that.

527
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,574
So we used some of the money that

528
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:34,198
was coming in to outsource the entire process to Romania.

529
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:38,684
And you know what? We reached out and found a fine Romanian developer who...

530
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,806
Well, we reached out to him under a pseudonym, Ron,

531
00:26:42,826 --> 00:26:47,328
and paid them hourly to mock up art, design, program a new slot machine temple from scratch.

532
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:50,390
You can see this looks very complicated. I have no idea what it does.

533
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:50,810
No idea.

534
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:53,992
Apparently you can bet on 15 separate lines,

535
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:58,694
and there's all these kinds of knobs and buttons that people who play slot machines like.

536
00:26:59,454 --> 00:26:59,895
So we did that.

537
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,581
And it got built, and it's beautiful,

538
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,041
and it had audio and all these things.

539
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,242
And we never ended up launching it,

540
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:08,683
because we were too busy creating the low quality ones.

541
00:27:08,743 --> 00:27:10,324
But I regret that part of the story.

542
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:15,666
So at this point, we have lots of questions and opportunities

543
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:17,166
of what to do next.

544
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:20,828
And what do you do at your company

545
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:22,649
when you need to make high-level decisions?

546
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:25,310
Company retreat.

547
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:28,797
So just like our original slot machine,

548
00:27:28,837 --> 00:27:30,858
we did not set up this retreat ourselves,

549
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:31,958
we used somebody else's shit.

550
00:27:32,598 --> 00:27:35,100
It was time, coincidentally, for the annual Indie Cabin.

551
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,861
So every year for almost a decade, East Coast Indies,

552
00:27:39,642 --> 00:27:42,023
we pull in about 10 to 20 game developers in a cabin

553
00:27:42,223 --> 00:27:45,124
in Vermont or New Hampshire and we work and play for a week.

554
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:48,246
So this particular cabin, we show up,

555
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:50,047
we have this growing awareness that we've kind of

556
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,408
been torching our friends with our hilarious slot stories

557
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:54,389
and how easy it is to make money for years now.

558
00:27:55,674 --> 00:28:00,621
We came with a pile of booze, sort of as a bribe or apology to forgive our exuberance,

559
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:06,811
and as a stunning counterpoint to demonstrate our inability to stop celebrating ourselves,

560
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,456
we showed up wearing deer antler spray t-shirts.

561
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:23,532
By the way, we created one extra, and this is the last and final shirt that exists in the world for deer antler spray slots.

562
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:29,537
It's a medium. Raise your hand if you would like it, and we will throw it directly into that pile of hands somewhere.

563
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:44,148
Thank you.

564
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:45,901
Oh, yeah, we have the picture of that.

565
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:46,681
That's it.

566
00:28:46,721 --> 00:28:47,962
For all you who didn't get one, this

567
00:28:48,022 --> 00:28:49,302
is what you're missing out on.

568
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:52,323
It's really comfy, too.

569
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:55,704
All right, so at this point, we are literally

570
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:57,344
drunk on our own power here.

571
00:28:58,885 --> 00:28:59,585
It was excellent.

572
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:00,805
I regret nothing.

573
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:04,146
But this is when a lot of the negatives and the opportunity

574
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:06,027
costs start to come into focus for us.

575
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:09,948
So let me paint a picture of this pivotal point.

576
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,469
So this cabin we've rented is actually

577
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:14,209
an off-season sex therapy retreat.

578
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:17,192
that was last rented by strong and vigorous people.

579
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:20,495
So Alex and I are in a room with beautiful tapestries

580
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:22,918
of barely abstracted genitalia and a shattered bed.

581
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,500
And we are there.

582
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,145
This is, you know, this is where you hold your business meetings.

583
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:32,048
We are there with a friend who is a perennial advisor

584
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,790
and investor in the indie sphere.

585
00:29:34,631 --> 00:29:35,271
And he's telling us.

586
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,182
This really isn't a joke.

587
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:39,343
Looking at your growth curves and what's happening,

588
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,705
and if you actually paid more serious attention to this,

589
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,726
you could pull in real investors.

590
00:29:43,846 --> 00:29:45,928
You could maybe sell your company, sell your data,

591
00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:49,190
or just go further yourselves and maybe make piles of money,

592
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,591
but you'd have to take it seriously.

593
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:54,814
So we're looking down that road,

594
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:58,076
and the question is, are the people down that road still us?

595
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,257
Would this be our first steps

596
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:02,539
to wild success as a business person,

597
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:02,899
or?

598
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:08,488
Is it going to convince us to cross lines we maybe didn't want to cross and we become super villains?

599
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,072
Should we really go all in on this crap factory?

600
00:30:14,454 --> 00:30:20,660
So this is the point at which a number of mounting issues and back-to-back kind of surprise issues

601
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,746
arose, all adding to the overall friction of this enterprise that we're trying to do on the side.

602
00:30:27,337 --> 00:30:33,119
So keep in mind, first off, this is several hundred hours of work so far.

603
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:39,341
The entire enterprise is a fragile scaffolding with so many points of failure,

604
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,821
it's incredible and hard to even explain.

605
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:45,002
So the whole process end-to-end relied on so many...

606
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:49,804
external services, over a dozen, all remaining functional

607
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:51,545
every day for this to keep going.

608
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:54,266
There's servers, databases, text-to-speech,

609
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:57,108
the developer back end remaining consistent,

610
00:30:57,408 --> 00:31:00,310
Bing, Wikipedia, Unity updates, ad network stuff.

611
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,931
In fact, if a new language or country

612
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:05,412
is added to Google Play, or a checkbox

613
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:07,313
gets moved 10 pixels to the right,

614
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:08,654
the entire thing falls apart.

615
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,895
And that's not to mention when Unity updates

616
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,976
and you need to fix things, and Android SDK updates

617
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:15,537
that are required for the Play Store.

618
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:17,040
hosting issues that come up.

619
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,383
And so, in addition to all of that pain,

620
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:23,786
there's now competing interests in our lives as developers

621
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:26,568
doing real things outside of the side hustle.

622
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:32,013
VR is just beginning to take off as the Oculus DK1 Kickstarter happened

623
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:34,175
and Alchemy was jumping on that and focusing there.

624
00:31:34,915 --> 00:31:36,697
LG was getting some great attention, I believe.

625
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:40,020
My sensitive poetry writing game is in the experimental gameplay workshop.

626
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:40,941
I'm an artist.

627
00:31:43,187 --> 00:31:45,349
And right around this time, this is all happening very, very

628
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:47,831
quickly after the advisor meeting,

629
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,874
is we were contacted by our ad provider, Playhaven.

630
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:52,315
And they said, hey, can we have a meeting?

631
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:57,039
And we were like, why are we so nervous about this?

632
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:59,281
Is it because we did something wrong?

633
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:00,522
Did we do something wrong?

634
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,563
We tried not to.

635
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:05,587
And so we had this call, and I'll describe it to you.

636
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:07,969
They said, we're seeing some.

637
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,012
Fairly erratic data coming from your side of the world.

638
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:14,115
You did not break any terms of service.

639
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:15,196
We'll be very clear.

640
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,798
We did not break any terms of service.

641
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:18,960
You're not doing anything wrong per se.

642
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,623
You're just inconvenient to us.

643
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,430
And they said we're not interested in continuing

644
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,434
to serve ads in your games, plural.

645
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,880
And also, by the way, you have the worst users somehow.

646
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:41,942
No one who comes from your apps wants to spend any money.

647
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:45,324
And I think there's another way to think about that,

648
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:48,766
which is you're welcome for segmenting your users so finely,

649
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:50,487
and you should be able to capitalize off of that.

650
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:51,387
But you know what?

651
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,369
Fine, we're off to ChartBoost immediately.

652
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:55,589
No worries.

653
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,550
And you know what?

654
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,651
That relationship turned out quite well.

655
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,952
We even received this little digital postcard from them

656
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:03,194
after a few months, so how sweet.

657
00:33:03,394 --> 00:33:04,014
Thanks, ChartBoost.

658
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,071
At the same time, Google, anyone who's a Google developer

659
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,091
knows that you just get emails about the store

660
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:13,832
and what's changing and new terms of service updates.

661
00:33:14,352 --> 00:33:16,472
And they send out these periodic emails.

662
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:18,893
And they seem to start kind of mentioning

663
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:22,333
some common topics, which are about repetitious apps

664
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:27,174
and duplicate content, and then specifically,

665
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:31,535
unique functionality being maintained within the ecosystem.

666
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:33,875
And so it sounds increasingly like.

667
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:35,933
They're talking directly to us.

668
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:37,434
Um...

669
00:33:39,014 --> 00:33:40,495
And we're wondering, you know, okay,

670
00:33:40,615 --> 00:33:42,276
we need to actually make that decision now

671
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,277
as, like, where are we going, what are we doing.

672
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:46,558
Uh, so you might be wondering...

673
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:48,399
what happened next.

674
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,920
Uh, this thing is

675
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,160
making real money.

676
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:53,441
Some.

677
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:56,856
There's some obvious issues to deal with,

678
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:58,337
but they're not insurmountable.

679
00:33:58,797 --> 00:33:59,497
We could fix them.

680
00:34:00,097 --> 00:34:01,558
It requires serious dedication,

681
00:34:01,598 --> 00:34:03,819
pulling back from the main things that we're doing.

682
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,500
So what did we do?

683
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,661
We walked away again.

684
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:10,382
That was our big decision?

685
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:10,702
Yes.

686
00:34:11,222 --> 00:34:12,963
Lazily stop touching the entire thing.

687
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:16,564
Inaction was absolutely the decision that we took.

688
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,726
And I think the weight and the responsibility

689
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:21,286
of all the things that we could not,

690
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:23,607
that we still could not automate away from ourselves.

691
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,341
was what ultimately drove us from not wanting to continue.

692
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:29,882
Don't get us wrong, don't get me wrong,

693
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:32,463
we left the keys in the car and the car running.

694
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,564
You know, we didn't shut it down,

695
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:38,805
we just let it die slowly over many years.

696
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:43,347
So, you know, we watched the empire slowly crumble

697
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:45,788
and just focused on making real video games.

698
00:34:46,268 --> 00:34:48,609
But the enterprise lasted way longer

699
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,789
than we thought it would.

700
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:51,370
So when you log into Google Play Now,

701
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,652
It alerts you at the top, very helpfully, that, hey,

702
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:56,372
one of your apps needs attention.

703
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,214
That is the understatement of the century.

704
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:03,496
There it is, a ghost town, hundreds of apps all removed,

705
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:05,497
the ghost town of its previous grandeur.

706
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:10,139
Of course, installs dwindled over time down to zero.

707
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,161
But it lasted years past the mission it was constructed for,

708
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,283
much like some other proud robots out there.

709
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:25,075
And I think it's worth going over a couple fun facts

710
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,796
about the ashes of our empire.

711
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:31,517
First, the Middle East loves puffins.

712
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:36,279
Useful.

713
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,302
The US loves Obama 62 times more than Malaysia.

714
00:35:44,002 --> 00:35:47,924
And India is super into sexy librarian slots.

715
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:49,785
We see you, India.

716
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:55,724
And so here we are, present day.

717
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:00,646
And I think it's worth reflecting on the journey

718
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,127
about what we built, why we built it,

719
00:36:03,148 --> 00:36:04,228
and how it changed the world.

720
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:06,169
So clearly you're thinking,

721
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:08,170
well what's the legality of all this?

722
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,831
I will answer that.

723
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:12,532
We're always within the legal lines to our knowledge.

724
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:15,594
Our auto-generation algorithm did occasionally

725
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:17,555
stumble upon some trademarks.

726
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:20,236
Sure, if we ever got a takedown.

727
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,031
from Google, we would of course comply.

728
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,192
For example, the time that we stumbled upon someone

729
00:36:26,212 --> 00:36:28,973
who had a very aggressive trademark for Bible slots.

730
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:31,494
You know, we received the takedown,

731
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:32,374
of course we removed it.

732
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:35,656
We want to let the Bible slots person continue on their way.

733
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:36,416
They worked hard for that.

734
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:41,138
Yeah. So if it's legal, sure.

735
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:42,418
But is it ethical?

736
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:44,899
Zaiba?

737
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:48,921
So first question, did we harm players?

738
00:36:50,322 --> 00:36:52,384
We never took their money. That was a big line for us.

739
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:55,487
It's gambling. Some people have problems with that.

740
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,850
I'm not really educated in that area and I don't want to be involved in these problems.

741
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,653
We only took money from ad providers and I don't feel bad about that.

742
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:05,964
And in fact, I think that puts us a cut above a lot

743
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:07,645
of other slot machines.

744
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:12,108
And we're actually creating a safer place for players

745
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:15,050
to come and enjoy this kind of entertainment.

746
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,691
Similarly, we never took anybody's data.

747
00:37:18,091 --> 00:37:21,393
Have you ever seen an app as low quality as ours

748
00:37:21,513 --> 00:37:23,554
and felt safe that it's not stealing your data?

749
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:28,297
We were a real cut above in being a steward

750
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:31,699
of our players' money and privacy.

751
00:37:33,495 --> 00:37:35,936
Of course, you saw we had quite a few good reviews.

752
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:39,258
Not all, but some people were happy with this.

753
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,019
We were bringing joy into the world.

754
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,861
And as a tangent, if you remember,

755
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,542
that is actually against our business model.

756
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:48,924
If we really wanted to go further,

757
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:52,146
we would have brought more disgust into the world.

758
00:37:52,747 --> 00:37:54,808
But the virtuous beings we are could not

759
00:37:54,868 --> 00:37:57,610
bring ourselves to do that, and we couldn't help but make

760
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,510
people happy.

761
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,393
Did we harm game developers?

762
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:04,964
I love you all, I wouldn't want to do that to you.

763
00:38:05,104 --> 00:38:07,725
So we had the same tools as everybody else.

764
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:09,165
We didn't have some secret back end.

765
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:12,526
We just used them a little differently, possibly more

766
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:14,027
aggressively than the rest of you.

767
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,028
But we generally played by the same rules.

768
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:19,909
We drove the speed of traffic.

769
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:22,730
If you look particularly at the Android store,

770
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,891
it is a pile of unlicensed Star Wars things

771
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,952
and weird clones of your games.

772
00:38:28,612 --> 00:38:29,292
We did none of that.

773
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:34,254
And as Alex alluded to earlier, you know, when Playhaven dropped us

774
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,915
because they didn't like our users coming out of there,

775
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:41,336
what we had done is we had taken chaos and created order.

776
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:45,818
We had filtered people through into a group.

777
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:49,399
And if they couldn't figure out how to use that knowledge we presented them,

778
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:50,039
that's their loss.

779
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,220
But I say we made this ecosystem better by doing that.

780
00:38:55,821 --> 00:38:57,601
Did we harm platform holders?

781
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:02,640
We never knowingly broke the terms of service.

782
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,202
We didn't argue any of the takedowns.

783
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:10,204
I will still contend that Tasteful Sideboob Slots

784
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:12,225
deserves its shining moment in the sun,

785
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:15,007
but I'm not going to engage in that email thread

786
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:15,927
with anybody at Google.

787
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:17,508
They don't have to worry about that.

788
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,231
And I think we exposed some insufficiencies, generally.

789
00:39:23,674 --> 00:39:26,275
when terms of service have to change,

790
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:28,377
it's because some sort of catastrophe happened.

791
00:39:28,437 --> 00:39:30,738
Somebody really gamed something, did something bad,

792
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:31,459
there was a leak.

793
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,541
But we were, I think, a really gentle partner

794
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:36,923
in this period of discovery about what they did

795
00:39:36,963 --> 00:39:38,224
and did not want on the store.

796
00:39:38,684 --> 00:39:41,106
Kind of like, if you have a rash on your arm,

797
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:42,927
a doctor may draw a line around it

798
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,128
just so you can see if it's growing

799
00:39:44,188 --> 00:39:45,569
outside of that line or not.

800
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,330
But we were respectful of that line.

801
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,052
We were like a very manageable rash

802
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:51,653
that just.

803
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:55,812
It helps to remind you that you should wash your arms more often.

804
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,273
Here's a shot of what our actual impact looked like on the store

805
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:03,354
on an average day when we were operating roughly at capacity.

806
00:40:03,674 --> 00:40:08,855
So here we are, we're all the way down on like page 6 of specifically top new free casino.

807
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:11,136
Everything outlined in red is ours.

808
00:40:11,736 --> 00:40:14,637
And yeah, if you go down to 7, 8, 9, 10, they're probably very similar.

809
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:17,397
There's a lot of us there, but we're not right at the top.

810
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:20,538
And I mean, imagine we were not on this page at all.

811
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:21,978
Number one fan.

812
00:40:22,582 --> 00:40:27,007
Marijuana light might have been half a page higher and I hope they can forgive us

813
00:40:27,168 --> 00:40:31,853
But I don't think we did too much damage there. So what I'm really getting at is

814
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:36,739
Every hour we spent on this was an hour

815
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:42,606
We didn't spend competing with the rest of you for a feature on Android or Apple or Steam

816
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:49,568
We didn't spend our runway funding on a four-year passion project that nobody but us wants,

817
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:52,471
underpaying contractors and promising rev share,

818
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:55,234
filling every subreddit and Twitter thread with our GIFs,

819
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:57,957
and elbowing to get cozy with platform holders.

820
00:40:58,618 --> 00:41:01,201
We just quietly put out crap.

821
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:03,463
If...

822
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:07,414
If you spend four years making a game that nobody wants,

823
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:09,175
and I spend four seconds,

824
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:11,856
who squandered more of their precious life?

825
00:41:12,356 --> 00:41:14,777
Who used more of the world's resources

826
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:17,619
and who took everybody's attention and time?

827
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:20,020
We are the good guys.

828
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:24,442
You all are animals.

829
00:41:28,744 --> 00:41:28,904
Yeah.

830
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:31,386
Okay, so...

831
00:41:32,844 --> 00:41:36,589
That last bit was half disingenuous, and we can argue about that later.

832
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,154
I don't really believe all that, though I'm afraid some of it is true.

833
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:44,402
So let me leave you with a bit more of a sincere lesson, which is that

834
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:49,382
This whole project was an itch that felt so good to scratch.

835
00:41:49,762 --> 00:41:51,663
We conceived of this improbable idea,

836
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,224
and we used our talents to make it come true,

837
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:56,904
and we received rewards.

838
00:41:57,424 --> 00:41:59,725
And we thumbed our noses at the mobile market of 2013

839
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:01,225
that broke our hearts.

840
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:04,286
We got to share these joys with dozens of our friends,

841
00:42:04,846 --> 00:42:08,407
and it culminated in this overblown spectacle right here.

842
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,888
And the itches scratched, and now we are done.

843
00:42:12,422 --> 00:42:15,223
We have not put out a new slot machine in well over a year.

844
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:16,985
They are all gone from the store,

845
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:20,747
because all that is left would be maintaining this machinery

846
00:42:20,787 --> 00:42:23,549
and turning the crank to poop out more slot machines.

847
00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:28,092
And you probably realize by now, I do not care about slot machines.

848
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:29,613
So we have moved on.

849
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:32,595
And if there is a business lesson in that,

850
00:42:32,835 --> 00:42:37,077
I would say scratch that crazy itch and try your dream idea there.

851
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:43,169
Be prepared to walk away, even if it is successful,

852
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:45,731
because it may just be the attempt that made you happy

853
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:46,771
and not the result.

854
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:49,473
Well said, Zaiba.

855
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:52,596
I think it's worth going over some final stats

856
00:42:52,816 --> 00:42:53,516
to close this out.

857
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:57,219
How many downloads did you actually receive in total?

858
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,742
It was 1.6 million downloads of slot games

859
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:04,484
over the course of the history of the company.

860
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,346
What was the number one slot?

861
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:07,767
I'm sure everyone wants to know.

862
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:08,647
What was it?

863
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,852
3D Sexy Skin Slots, free, 200,000 downloads.

864
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:17,513
And how much money did you guys make

865
00:43:17,673 --> 00:43:18,633
over the course of all this?

866
00:43:19,293 --> 00:43:21,433
About 50 grand off of ads.

867
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,174
That is what happened.

868
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:28,795
Of course, it is worth saying, oh yeah, sorry,

869
00:43:29,255 --> 00:43:30,535
click through, 50, we did it.

870
00:43:30,915 --> 00:43:33,175
What is the weirdest stat that you came up with?

871
00:43:34,056 --> 00:43:35,756
The Sexy Skin Slots, which is number one,

872
00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:37,376
huge in Iran.

873
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:39,297
We see you, Iran.

874
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,131
And I think we need something special to play us out.

875
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:45,751
So here we go.

876
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:49,312
So we would love to take questions now.

877
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:50,513
But before that.

878
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:13,754
Just one more thing.

879
00:44:15,816 --> 00:44:16,796
Okay, so I lied a bit.

880
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:22,802
We have revived enough of the machinery just for today and today only that if you email

881
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:28,748
slots at signal-to-noise-apps.com with your idea in the subject line, it will reply to

882
00:44:28,788 --> 00:44:30,570
you with a custom slot machine.

883
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,713
Today only, you get a slot, you get a slot, etc.

884
00:44:38,495 --> 00:44:39,296
Thank you very much.

885
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:42,699
Please fill out your surveys and don't say

886
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:43,940
we never gave you anything.

887
00:44:45,962 --> 00:44:46,363
Questions?

888
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:54,711
Hi, I'm Simon Rakestraw.

889
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,675
I work at a company that makes real actual slot machines

890
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:01,918
in casinos in Las Vegas.

891
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:07,567
For us, it costs literally tens of thousands of dollars

892
00:45:07,627 --> 00:45:08,827
to get a new game approved.

893
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:11,808
So is there any takeaway that I could get from this?

894
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,571
So the question is, I'm doing this for real,

895
00:45:21,191 --> 00:45:22,011
and it's expensive.

896
00:45:22,031 --> 00:45:23,772
Like theoretically, let's say the app store

897
00:45:23,812 --> 00:45:25,252
had a publishing cost.

898
00:45:25,512 --> 00:45:27,113
How would this work?

899
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,894
I mean, how much work are you doing?

900
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,300
Can you do less?

901
00:45:36,823 --> 00:45:37,123
Well...

902
00:45:37,263 --> 00:45:39,825
We still spend a lot less time than like actual games.

903
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:41,386
It's still like a couple of months.

904
00:45:41,686 --> 00:45:42,207
Have some pride.

905
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:43,328
These are all actual games.

906
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:53,476
I don't know what's going into your budget to do all that, but if you just try harder

907
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:59,261
to make worse things, you'll have some metrics to see which path is going to lead you to

908
00:45:59,321 --> 00:45:59,661
victory.

909
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:01,923
Okay, metrics.

910
00:46:01,963 --> 00:46:02,183
Thanks.

911
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:02,723
Yeah.

912
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:07,193
Remember, it's dogs and sex and not people or objects.

913
00:46:07,874 --> 00:46:08,514
Hi, I'm Evan.

914
00:46:08,574 --> 00:46:10,216
I'm also a slot game developer.

915
00:46:10,556 --> 00:46:15,580
I did not expect this talk to be what it was actually about.

916
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,941
Have either of you considered a career in comedy?

917
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:20,944
Slots pays better.

918
00:46:20,964 --> 00:46:25,827
I have nothing to add.

919
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:29,810
Hey there.

920
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,070
My name is Daniel.

921
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,430
I'm a business consultant.

922
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,931
And on Monday, I spent my day watching mostly mobile talks.

923
00:46:40,112 --> 00:46:41,752
And they were quite depressing, the way

924
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,093
that people are monetizing games.

925
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,353
And I got to say that this is way better

926
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:46,274
than all of that stuff.

927
00:46:48,654 --> 00:46:49,015
Thank you.

928
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:52,096
I think the depression cycle is like a 360 loop.

929
00:46:52,116 --> 00:46:54,136
And if you go too far, it becomes back positive.

930
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:55,137
It's like yin and yang.

931
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:56,597
You know, one becomes the other.

932
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:57,998
And I'm wondering with.

933
00:46:59,685 --> 00:47:01,185
kind of somewhere the trends that you're

934
00:47:01,205 --> 00:47:03,586
seeing in the mobile market and automation

935
00:47:03,606 --> 00:47:05,026
through artificial intelligence.

936
00:47:05,986 --> 00:47:08,387
Do you see this becoming a growing problem

937
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,087
with game developers in the market?

938
00:47:12,168 --> 00:47:13,888
This type of thing, being exploited?

939
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:14,788
Repeat the question.

940
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:17,249
Do we see what we're doing in automation

941
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:20,529
becoming a growing problem in the mobile market?

942
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:20,930
Yeah.

943
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,491
I've been so far removed from the mobile market

944
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:29,372
for many years because personally.

945
00:47:30,754 --> 00:47:34,437
As someone who focuses on weird new innovation

946
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,918
in experimental hardware and new markets,

947
00:47:37,578 --> 00:47:40,020
mobile is a more mature market where you need user acquisition

948
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,762
and you need much bigger budgets,

949
00:47:42,782 --> 00:47:44,283
so it's not really well-suited for me.

950
00:47:44,883 --> 00:47:49,466
Will machine learning change the entire ecosystem of mobile?

951
00:47:49,986 --> 00:47:52,988
I think it will for targeted user acquisition.

952
00:47:53,588 --> 00:47:55,269
I think that will get more and more honed,

953
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:59,192
but you're still relying on an ecosystem of quality.

954
00:47:59,812 --> 00:48:03,856
So I don't know that machine learning is going to help

955
00:48:03,956 --> 00:48:05,918
with the creation of higher quality art.

956
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,321
If there are a way to optimize for that,

957
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:10,442
that would be very interesting.

958
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:13,585
But it seems very far removed from the end goal of getting it

959
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:16,307
onto mobile and making money through ads off of that art.

960
00:48:17,488 --> 00:48:22,513
So I don't see a, I mean, spam.

961
00:48:22,893 --> 00:48:24,875
Spam will get more until it gets better.

962
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,579
Yeah, this is all just terrifying.

963
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,240
And it's not just mobile.

964
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:32,921
It's everywhere.

965
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:37,223
Everything is going to be susceptible to bold new methods

966
00:48:37,263 --> 00:48:39,124
of creating things in volume.

967
00:48:39,964 --> 00:48:41,365
And we're just on a wave of that.

968
00:48:41,445 --> 00:48:42,005
It's going to happen.

969
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:43,245
Let's all enjoy that.

970
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:47,167
Well, I think that leads to curation just becoming

971
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:48,068
more and more important.

972
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:51,549
Every app ecosystem, and so the whole free Wild West

973
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:53,130
of, well, whatever gets downloads

974
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,711
is going to be the top thing that you open and see,

975
00:48:56,171 --> 00:48:56,371
I think.

976
00:48:57,324 --> 00:48:59,345
Maybe we're starting to realize that that's not the greatest

977
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:03,168
method of creating a good user experience for players.

978
00:49:03,749 --> 00:49:05,210
So more curation.

979
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:09,454
Which is not where a lot of the markets are going, anyway.

980
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:11,075
I mean, it's not what the platform holders are doing.

981
00:49:11,135 --> 00:49:12,456
That is not what platforms are doing.

982
00:49:12,676 --> 00:49:14,197
So maybe automated curation.

983
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:18,171
Maybe.

984
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:19,752
And then you subscribe to things,

985
00:49:19,772 --> 00:49:21,272
and they'll just make automated purchase for you.

986
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,793
Like Humble Monthly, that's just them.

987
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,573
Maybe they have algorithms deciding what's in there,

988
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:25,413
and you've just stolen their money,

989
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:26,614
and it's automating the purchasing.

990
00:49:26,654 --> 00:49:27,694
It's automating the advertising.

991
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:28,694
It's automating putting it in the stores.

992
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:30,175
We don't have to do anything anymore,

993
00:49:30,215 --> 00:49:31,295
and we're great consumers.

994
00:49:32,276 --> 00:49:34,516
We don't even have to play the things that we automatically

995
00:49:34,576 --> 00:49:34,896
bought.

996
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:37,897
Yeah.

997
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:39,898
It's actually interesting you mentioned automating curation,

998
00:49:40,118 --> 00:49:42,959
because another side project they did over a weekend

999
00:49:42,999 --> 00:49:46,820
a few years ago was when Steam Curator program was announced.

1000
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:49,322
built a website called Steam Curator Curator,

1001
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,023
so you can curate which curators you want to look at.

1002
00:49:51,743 --> 00:49:54,144
So I think there's a couple levels deeper

1003
00:49:54,184 --> 00:49:56,945
that we could go there, and I think that's a ripe opportunity.

1004
00:49:57,085 --> 00:49:57,745
Oh, thanks, guys.

1005
00:49:57,785 --> 00:49:59,306
This was a great way to start my day.

1006
00:50:01,307 --> 00:50:03,908
OK, so I'm a huge Slots fan.

1007
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:09,430
Are you drunk right now?

1008
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:09,950
Maybe.

1009
00:50:13,146 --> 00:50:15,507
No, I was going to ask both of you if you could speak to,

1010
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:17,847
apart from all of this, related to mobile,

1011
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:20,248
if you have a mobile game in the last year

1012
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,908
that has really stood out to you,

1013
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,809
just to give a moment of curation.

1014
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:26,490
Oh, wow.

1015
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,131
Check my phone.

1016
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:32,271
Polytopia is incredible.

1017
00:50:33,232 --> 00:50:33,932
That's what it's called, right?

1018
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:34,732
Polytopia?

1019
00:50:34,892 --> 00:50:35,112
Yeah.

1020
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,453
No one went, woo.

1021
00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:37,873
Am I the only one who likes Polytopia?

1022
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:38,793
Is that a thing?

1023
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,234
Did I make that game up?

1024
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:41,334
Did I imagine this in a dream?

1025
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,541
It's like that little Civ-like game.

1026
00:50:44,561 --> 00:50:46,061
It's incredible.

1027
00:50:46,241 --> 00:50:46,722
Go play it.

1028
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:49,643
A real recommendation?

1029
00:50:50,123 --> 00:50:52,064
I would say anything that Zach Gage makes.

1030
00:50:52,104 --> 00:50:54,625
I've been playing Pocket Pool on my phone for months now.

1031
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:55,806
It's absolutely incredible.

1032
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:00,148
Yes, Cinco Paus.

1033
00:51:00,588 --> 00:51:01,208
That's a good one.

1034
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,991
Anyways, how many times did Google

1035
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:10,473
break your automation for publishing?

1036
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,400
Well, one too many, at least.

1037
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,061
The question was, how many times did Google

1038
00:51:15,082 --> 00:51:15,862
break our automation?

1039
00:51:17,763 --> 00:51:19,563
Repeatedly, because it was probably

1040
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:23,245
in the somewhere in the low double digits.

1041
00:51:23,505 --> 00:51:24,806
I would say we had to go in and fix it,

1042
00:51:24,826 --> 00:51:26,066
because things like a new country comes in

1043
00:51:26,106 --> 00:51:27,827
or a country would change its policy about gambling.

1044
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:32,769
So we actually had to be aware of Korea's no longer

1045
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,709
allowing gambling apps.

1046
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:36,840
We had to go in and add a privacy policy to everything.

1047
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,661
And then we had to actually, there

1048
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:39,744
were changes where we would have to actually add a privacy

1049
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,025
policy link to every app.

1050
00:51:41,085 --> 00:51:43,628
So we wrote the infrastructure for updating every app,

1051
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,771
not just publishing, which is a whole different set of APIs.

1052
00:51:46,531 --> 00:51:48,994
And once, if you update to just add the app at all,

1053
00:51:49,014 --> 00:51:50,436
they're going to require you to catch up.

1054
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,665
to all the not required updates before.

1055
00:51:52,745 --> 00:51:54,505
So they introduced new screenshot sizes,

1056
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:57,466
which was fine until you actually updated your app.

1057
00:51:57,486 --> 00:51:59,227
Now you have to also do new screenshots.

1058
00:51:59,647 --> 00:52:01,467
I had to find these images from it.

1059
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:02,308
It was a hot mess.

1060
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,408
There was actually a lot more weird moving bits

1061
00:52:04,448 --> 00:52:06,229
than we talked about, because this isn't a tech talk.

1062
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:13,491
So I feel like you've found this gem of the anti-retention model.

1063
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:16,472
Do you ever feel like there's some new way

1064
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:18,633
that you've wanted to wield it in the future?

1065
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:22,051
or any ideas in the past that you've had?

1066
00:52:24,052 --> 00:52:26,094
What more can be done with the anti-retention model?

1067
00:52:26,194 --> 00:52:27,275
Yeah, that's the question.

1068
00:52:28,196 --> 00:52:30,297
I mean, like escapism as a business model?

1069
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:32,900
I think it's travel agencies.

1070
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,501
No, what do we?

1071
00:52:36,142 --> 00:52:37,844
I feel like Microsoft's doing that right now

1072
00:52:37,884 --> 00:52:39,845
with the refrigeration and chasing people out

1073
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,706
of the room somehow.

1074
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:43,088
If they can benefit from that, if we

1075
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:45,910
can apply that to other spheres of our life, like talks,

1076
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,352
and somehow profit from scaring people away from things,

1077
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:49,333
we'll keep an eye on that.

1078
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:52,969
Yeah, I don't know that anti-retention scales

1079
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:54,611
across multiple people trying to do it.

1080
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:55,872
I haven't thought about that.

1081
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,015
Is that a one-takes-all type of model?

1082
00:52:59,035 --> 00:53:01,057
I think we have a lot to think about,

1083
00:53:01,437 --> 00:53:03,980
as a society and as a group here.

1084
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,941
We're gonna need another retreat.

1085
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,383
Yeah.

1086
00:53:07,443 --> 00:53:08,484
Yeah, it seems like the only way

1087
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:09,885
you could make this more legitimate

1088
00:53:09,965 --> 00:53:11,627
is to add a blockchain.

1089
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:13,068
Yeah.

1090
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:13,388
Yeah.

1091
00:53:13,428 --> 00:53:13,549
Yeah.

1092
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:13,809
Yeah.

1093
00:53:19,302 --> 00:53:21,423
I had like a slide that came after this that says,

1094
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:22,264
what about blockchain?

1095
00:53:22,664 --> 00:53:23,925
And then I deleted it.

1096
00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:26,287
But I would have shown it right then.

1097
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:33,012
So I would posit that anti-retention is actually

1098
00:53:33,032 --> 00:53:35,214
just curation, because you're sending people somewhere.

1099
00:53:37,095 --> 00:53:39,217
Well, hopefully after the curation process

1100
00:53:39,237 --> 00:53:40,698
and then you get the thing, you enjoy it.

1101
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:42,839
Oh, fair enough.

1102
00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:43,840
So I had a real question as well.

1103
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:49,393
Did you actually do any source control for these things you were generating?

1104
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:52,274
Or was it sort of a once-off and they're all gone?

1105
00:53:52,374 --> 00:53:54,475
Or is there a GitHub with these things somewhere?

1106
00:53:55,176 --> 00:53:59,318
The question is, is there a pile of slot machines somewhere?

1107
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:00,779
Yes.

1108
00:54:04,461 --> 00:54:05,141
It's a big pile.

1109
00:54:06,122 --> 00:54:06,742
I managed to get...

1110
00:54:06,762 --> 00:54:10,924
I don't know if Dreamhost is regretting their unlimited space offer right now on the hosting.

1111
00:54:11,545 --> 00:54:12,325
A lot of slot machines.

1112
00:54:14,397 --> 00:54:14,817
Thanks, guys.

1113
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:16,718
This was extraordinarily entertaining.

1114
00:54:17,399 --> 00:54:18,099
Just a quick thing.

1115
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:21,421
I don't know if there are people from Google Play in this room

1116
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:24,282
and or watching this on the GDC vault later in the future,

1117
00:54:24,842 --> 00:54:25,803
but I hope there are.

1118
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:27,544
And on the off chance that there are,

1119
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:31,806
what would you tell them they should do to fix this shit?

1120
00:54:32,846 --> 00:54:33,727
Alright, thanks guys.

1121
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:34,247
Later.

1122
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:37,509
Peace.

1123
00:54:37,529 --> 00:54:39,289
Alex, what's your what is your message to Google?

1124
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,430
Do you know anybody at Google?

1125
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:42,311
As an ex-Googler.

1126
00:54:44,784 --> 00:54:46,685
There was a point in here that I don't think was drilled home

1127
00:54:47,065 --> 00:54:49,406
as hard as it could have been, which was, you know,

1128
00:54:49,426 --> 00:54:53,967
you got into arm rashes and the idea was

1129
00:54:55,368 --> 00:55:00,670
if people are sneaking by with garbage, the thing that we did was

1130
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:05,471
to put a huge neon sign with an arrow pointing at ourselves

1131
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:09,213
and the garbage next to us, illuminating the entire underbelly

1132
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:11,674
of dark, weird App Store shit.

1133
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:12,894
And so.

1134
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:15,893
the idea that if you do it at scale,

1135
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,514
clearly they're going to notice, and clearly they're

1136
00:55:18,534 --> 00:55:22,537
going to change the terms of service slowly to ice you out.

1137
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:26,019
Hopefully others went down with us in the wake of that.

1138
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:28,540
Like we provided the perfect targeted spot

1139
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,541
to drop the missile.

1140
00:55:30,701 --> 00:55:35,644
So hopefully that helped get rid of duplicate apps

1141
00:55:35,724 --> 00:55:38,426
that were also in the area.

1142
00:55:38,466 --> 00:55:40,787
But I mean, that's the like.

1143
00:55:41,302 --> 00:55:43,744
billion dollar question is in an open market,

1144
00:55:44,965 --> 00:55:47,748
how do you prevent bad things?

1145
00:55:47,788 --> 00:55:49,030
And actually, I think that's the wrong question.

1146
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,611
It's like the bad things should be there,

1147
00:55:50,631 --> 00:55:52,093
but they should just be so invisible

1148
00:55:52,893 --> 00:55:54,996
that it has no consequence to someone

1149
00:55:55,036 --> 00:55:56,978
who took their phone out, opened.

1150
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:01,021
Google Play and then saw things of value that were great.

1151
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:02,682
And to me, that is curation.

1152
00:56:03,323 --> 00:56:05,905
But curation, like the argument that everyone makes

1153
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:08,927
is we're a group of semi-homogenous people

1154
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:09,808
in one part of the world.

1155
00:56:09,848 --> 00:56:12,350
How could we be the tastemakers for the entirety

1156
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:14,472
of all cultures and all people of all backgrounds?

1157
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:16,474
We can't just say, these are the best things

1158
00:56:16,934 --> 00:56:18,035
because we believe that.

1159
00:56:18,415 --> 00:56:21,718
We have to figure out what is best to you individually

1160
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:22,939
in this targeted curation.

1161
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:29,533
Somehow I think it revolves around curation, but it revolves around a way better version of curation that is different for each person

1162
00:56:29,813 --> 00:56:32,975
Yeah, I mean you guys mentioned earlier very early in your talk

1163
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:38,139
I mean this obviously is an extreme example, but early in your talk you mentioned that the Google Play and

1164
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:43,602
App stores in general are filled with clones right like not this extreme

1165
00:56:43,642 --> 00:56:48,686
But nevertheless filled with clones, and I think it all ties together, and I was hopefully there's a message here anyway. Thank you

1166
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:54,755
And if I could suggest to Google that they employ their own small team inside

1167
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:56,776
whose task is to grief them themselves.

1168
00:56:58,597 --> 00:56:59,578
I think it might seriously work.

1169
00:56:59,618 --> 00:57:00,418
They could, you know, they'd...

1170
00:57:00,438 --> 00:57:03,360
I mean, it's the equivalent of security...

1171
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,381
White hat, right.

1172
00:57:05,401 --> 00:57:08,542
Yeah, so like in machine learning, you have these adversarial networks.

1173
00:57:09,203 --> 00:57:11,044
I don't know much about machine learning, but I'm saying

1174
00:57:11,064 --> 00:57:13,025
they should just do it themselves.

1175
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:16,706
They should do what we did to themselves.

1176
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:18,027
See how they like it.

1177
00:57:24,627 --> 00:57:27,049
Hey, first time Caller long time fan.

1178
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:36,456
So, is this and are we currently in Frog Fractions 3?

1179
00:57:37,878 --> 00:57:39,339
So if I could repeat the question,

1180
00:57:39,479 --> 00:57:41,941
it was how did you two gentlemen get

1181
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:43,662
both so handsome and so clever?

1182
00:57:43,802 --> 00:57:45,083
I think that's what was whispered

1183
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:48,086
with a grovelly, velvety, soft voice.

1184
00:57:52,149 --> 00:57:53,129
Is this Frog Fractions 3?

1185
00:57:54,189 --> 00:57:54,889
That's the question.

1186
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,472
Just email slots at signaltonoiseapps.com

1187
00:57:59,492 --> 00:58:01,573
with the subject frog fractions 3,

1188
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,774
and it will come back to you, and you've got it.

1189
00:58:03,854 --> 00:58:05,834
As many frog fractions games as you want right now

1190
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:06,275
on your phone.

1191
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:07,415
This is the rabbit hole, everyone.

1192
00:58:07,455 --> 00:58:08,196
Go, go, go.

1193
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:14,979
We have, I think, time.

1194
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:18,060
CAs, we have time for, what, we have three minutes?

1195
00:58:19,101 --> 00:58:19,561
Couple minutes.

1196
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,123
Hi. If you would have taken on this project without scruples,

1197
00:58:26,184 --> 00:58:28,966
and I don't know how much data you collected, if any,

1198
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:32,149
but do you have any idea how much money you could have made

1199
00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:34,730
if you allowed your users to play with the real money?

1200
00:58:36,712 --> 00:58:38,913
What if we'd gone full force, no scruples,

1201
00:58:38,993 --> 00:58:40,174
collected money from users,

1202
00:58:40,815 --> 00:58:41,735
what do you think the outcome would be?

1203
00:58:41,876 --> 00:58:44,177
Like real money gambling, wagering, et cetera.

1204
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:51,309
Some of you here who actually make slot machines, you tell us, I guess.

1205
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:54,972
I don't know if you if you took what we could talk about that later,

1206
00:58:55,012 --> 00:58:58,154
if you if someone who has a slot machine that does those things

1207
00:58:58,695 --> 00:59:02,317
and then we multiply them by the number of times we put out these slot machines,

1208
00:59:02,357 --> 00:59:03,578
we may be able to come up with a number.

1209
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:05,440
I don't know if I want to see it.

1210
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,022
Yeah, it'd be interesting to see that.

1211
00:59:09,143 --> 00:59:09,503
That's thanks.

1212
00:59:12,472 --> 00:59:13,053
Oh, that was another thing.

1213
00:59:13,073 --> 00:59:14,033
When we started, we actually would

1214
00:59:14,053 --> 00:59:15,754
have had to take money from users.

1215
00:59:15,794 --> 00:59:18,156
We would have to put in more personally identifying

1216
00:59:18,196 --> 00:59:20,237
information to Google about what we were doing,

1217
00:59:20,277 --> 00:59:21,518
and we didn't want to do that at first.

1218
00:59:22,919 --> 00:59:23,099
Yeah.

1219
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:27,762
And we'll take one more.

1220
00:59:28,183 --> 00:59:30,344
I'm curious if you tracked how many times people pulled

1221
00:59:30,384 --> 00:59:32,926
Vuleva on average, total?

1222
00:59:33,606 --> 00:59:36,889
Oh, so I have the answer to that.

1223
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:38,710
It is definitely did not.

1224
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,477
Actually, but yeah, I think we're in the same page

1225
00:59:42,897 --> 00:59:49,042
We forgot to even add save data at all to the app and I think one of those reports

1226
00:59:49,102 --> 00:59:51,824
We only saw it while we're putting together the slide deck years later

1227
00:59:52,085 --> 00:59:54,887
It said when I close the app and I open it back up all my data is gone

1228
00:59:54,987 --> 00:59:57,129
And I looked at sideburn. I said did we add saving I?

1229
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:02,273
Don't know and we're like I don't I don't know and it's really not important to the philosophy

1230
01:00:02,493 --> 01:00:07,398
No, so you don't know this actually I did implement stats for tracking every time

1231
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:14,761
slot machine was pulled. I don't remember on what stat platform and I haven't looked at it in years. It's somewhere out there

1232
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:19,426
It's gonna be huge. I don't know. We'll do a whole talk on just that number next year

1233
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:23,089
Thank you fantastic question I learned a lot from it
