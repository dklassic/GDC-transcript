1
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:07,862
I pressed the right button.

2
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:10,043
I'm apparently good at pressing people's buttons.

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:13,004
I've proven that over many years.

4
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:15,145
First of all, thank you very much for the introduction.

5
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:17,346
Thank you all for being here on the first day of GDC.

6
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:20,447
The whole idea of these 30-minute talks

7
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:22,168
is that we are trying to pack, in my case,

8
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:24,769
46 years of wisdom-building games into 30 minutes.

9
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:26,710
So I'm gonna talk really fast like this,

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,211
and you better listen really carefully,

11
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:30,392
because I'm gonna go really fast like this,

12
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:31,052
and it'll be all like that.

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,672
No, I actually won't do that.

14
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:39,760
But it will be a case, instead of me blurting 30 things I think are true, I'm actually going

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,428
to take a few things I think are true and talk about them in detail.

16
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:49,115
by this part quickly, but as I mentioned,

17
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,996
I've been doing this for 46 years.

18
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:52,496
Basically, I am a lucky guy.

19
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:56,318
I've been at the right place at the right time

20
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:58,759
since 1971 a number of times.

21
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,060
The key point for this talk is I've been CEO or GM of studios

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,181
for probably a total of 30 years,

23
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,622
and a number of other years advising and coaching

24
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:08,603
CEOs and GMs.

25
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:11,084
And that's the part of my background,

26
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:13,685
as apart from game design or game production,

27
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:15,865
that I'm bringing to this talk.

28
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:25,140
In the last few years in particular, I've been working both on original designs and working with teams,

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,642
really ranging from very tiny indie teams all the way up to top 20 publishers in the world.

30
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:35,185
Now, I want to tell you I have a lot of opinions here.

31
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:41,408
I think that you should be very, very cautious in the modern time about automatically accepting people's opinions.

32
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:43,049
People who look like this,

33
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,250
to me, are very suspicious.

34
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:50,646
Thank you. I agree.

35
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:51,827
I would not trust this man.

36
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:53,269
Just from this photograph.

37
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:56,072
I think I would want to run from whatever country he's gaining

38
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:59,935
power in.

39
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:00,095
So,

40
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:01,957
so on that note,

41
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:03,479
if I

42
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,462
I do not have a requirement that you agree with me.

43
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:09,425
If I if you find yourself in dinner tonight in a discussion

44
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:13,228
or even a disagreement or an argument a friendly argument.

45
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:20,901
about things I say, I'm happy because if you think about it and you're debating it,

46
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:23,622
that's all I think that any speaker can ask. So that's my goal here.

47
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:30,086
So here's the first point I want to make. When I first started running a company, when

48
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:37,470
I founded my first company in 1988, an advisor took me aside and he gave me one of many wonderful

49
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,132
gifts I've been given by advisors and mentors over the years. And he said,

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,704
Let me tell you one thing, starting out as a company, if I give you one thing, let me

51
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:51,686
tell you what it is.

52
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:53,186
And that is, cash is king.

53
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:56,249
Not Earl, not Duke, not Prince, but king.

54
00:02:56,249 --> 00:03:00,591
And by saying cash is king, I thought, okay, yeah, cash is king.

55
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:01,692
That sounds good.

56
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,833
Okay, preserve cash.

57
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,755
Watch, people have told me that.

58
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:07,096
Watch out for cash.

59
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:07,576
I've got that.

60
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:07,776
Okay.

61
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:10,498
I'm going to be careful with, my wallet's right here.

62
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:12,159
I'm going to be careful with cash.

63
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,144
But he didn't stop there, he said, there's more to it than that.

64
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:22,469
The thing about cash is, it's different from any other resource you have.

65
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,411
If you run out of time for something, it sucks.

66
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:32,157
There's a problem with your project, it ships late, a project can get cancelled.

67
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:35,380
It is not automatically dooming the organization.

68
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,624
If you run out of resources, if you run out of printer paper or ink.

69
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,593
If you run out of people to do a certain task, if you run out of anything, it's a problem.

70
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:50,677
It could really create a chain reaction, but it's not fatal to the organization.

71
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:56,200
If you run out of cash and you can't pay people on time, in the United States that is almost

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:03,485
always fatal because of the way the laws work requiring how we do these things.

73
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:07,167
And by the way, I think those are good laws because I like getting paid.

74
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,934
So if you can't pay for your offices, if you have offices and you need them,

75
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,075
you have a little bit of leeway there,

76
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:20,159
but pretty soon the doors are locked and everything you own as a company is

77
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:24,162
inside the office that is now with you locked out and they have changed the

78
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:24,322
locks.

79
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:31,247
So the reason why we say cash is king is because it is the single most precious

80
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:34,590
resource you have. And if we think of it in game design terms,

81
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,573
think of this business as being a game that has permadeath.

82
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:43,731
And this is the one resource that can kill you.

83
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:48,994
If you think of it in those terms, you will protect cash in a different way.

84
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:56,338
What we all tend to do starting out, and I can still catch myself doing this at the start

85
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,060
of projects, even after I'm supposedly wise, is...

86
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:04,508
You're enthusiastic, okay, we have to get machines for people,

87
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:07,389
okay, we need two more people to do this,

88
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,370
okay, we don't have enough chairs.

89
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,331
You start spending money, you're setting up the team,

90
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:14,792
everything is new and it feels great.

91
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:15,833
And spending that money,

92
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,594
you're trying to spend it intelligently,

93
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:21,375
but there is a pleasure in spending that money

94
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,256
while you set up the company.

95
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:25,817
At some point later, where you kind of go,

96
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,918
okay, we're fighting for this deadline,

97
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,039
you know, money is tight, we're really watching it.

98
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:38,059
You're watching money in a different way. You're being more conservative. You're being more cautious with what you do with money.

99
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:43,945
As veterans of starting companies and starting teams, one of the things you can do is start to look at,

100
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:47,368
okay, how would I spend money late when it's tight?

101
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:51,772
How can I take that same attitude and bring it to early in the process?

102
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:56,666
so that I make it less likely that money is tight later,

103
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,607
and if something goes wrong and it turns out we needed

104
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:03,048
more of something than we have, that money is there.

105
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:05,148
That is what he taught me about cash as king,

106
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,468
and it was a wonderful gift.

107
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:07,349
But now there are more kinds of money,

108
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:08,589
and I use this as my picture to illustrate this,

109
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:15,490
but I'm not really talking about currencies.

110
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,112
There are actually three kinds of cash.

111
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:26,865
And this is a very important thing that I learned by experience.

112
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:34,590
So kind of cash number one is if you look in your wallet or your purse right now,

113
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,331
you will find some cash.

114
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:36,771
That is cash you own.

115
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,374
If you have cash in the bank that no one can take away from you,

116
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:41,374
that's cash you own.

117
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:43,816
So that's type number one of cash.

118
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,177
Type number two of cash.

119
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:51,588
is money that somebody can take away from you.

120
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:55,389
Well, what are... if I were robbed in the street,

121
00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:01,672
that would be somebody taking money away from me. That would be the cash out.

122
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:06,054
That is not what I'm talking about. The money in your bank account is often as a

123
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:06,914
company, not

124
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:09,755
all yours. For example,

125
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:14,677
if you don't pay your payroll taxes, or some other kinds of taxes, the government

126
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:17,538
can get an order and they can come and take the money from your bank account.

127
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:23,989
without your permission. So that is money you don't actually, any money you owe in taxes

128
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:29,270
is no longer your money because you will either pay it directly or you will pay it indirectly

129
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,892
at your bank account. But that is no longer your money, it's money that can be taken away

130
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:41,375
from you. If you get a credit card from the bank and you don't pay that bill, typically

131
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,916
you're only going to get a card like that for a small start-up business from the same

132
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,917
bank you're banking with.

133
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:50,334
Well, if you don't pay the bill, the bank will simply pay it for you.

134
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,316
It's a service that we offer.

135
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:55,299
We're very happy to do these things for our customers.

136
00:07:55,299 --> 00:08:00,223
Yes, we'll take your money and automatically pay something without your permission because

137
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:01,704
it makes everything easier.

138
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:05,228
So that's money you don't really control.

139
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:08,451
The credit card company can come and they can take it.

140
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:09,812
If you have investors.

141
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:19,593
Or if you have taken any kind of other deal where somebody has advanced you money.

142
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:22,234
For example, you've got a publishing deal and you've been advanced money.

143
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:28,697
If something is going wrong, typically in investment deals, the investors have the right

144
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:32,698
to come and take what's left of the money and say, hey, this isn't going to work, it's

145
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:33,698
not going to pan out.

146
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:36,638
Don't spend any more money, we're just going to end it here.

147
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:41,902
So that investment money you raised, if you read the fine print, normally is not money

148
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:43,903
you actually own and control.

149
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:50,968
If you have a deal with a publisher, a distributor, and they give you refundable advances, if

150
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:54,631
you look on the contract, it may say refundable advances.

151
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:05,113
That would only apply if, say, you engaged in criminal activity or you did something reprehensible or you simply left the country.

152
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:08,454
That's the only case. Don't worry about that part of the contract.

153
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:13,195
Keep moving, keep moving right along. Nothing to see right here.

154
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:21,316
But in reality, a publisher who wants to can almost always introduce and create an excuse to say,

155
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:24,158
You know, this isn't going so well.

156
00:09:24,158 --> 00:09:29,986
We don't, you know, you, you, you gave us a delivery and you,

157
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:34,833
you delivered it and it, oh, it came in at two in the morning

158
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,315
and there's a penalty.

159
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:38,398
You're not supposed to do anything after midnight,

160
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,399
so you have to give us the money back.

161
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:44,181
I'm joking around about it, but that stuff does happen.

162
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:48,884
So when you get an advance from a publisher or distributor, you always want to say a non-refundable

163
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:49,825
advance.

164
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:53,867
You would like it to say that explicitly, that it is a non-refundable advance.

165
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:57,570
So if you ever do ship them something at 2 in the morning, you will not be facing any

166
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,430
consequences.

167
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:06,636
Final example, if you have your personal bank account and your company bank account in the

168
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:07,317
same bank.

169
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:13,302
and you have some loan or payment that you have taken out from that bank,

170
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:14,984
you may have personally guaranteed it.

171
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:18,086
In fact, if it's a credit card, you almost always will find the fine print.

172
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:20,027
You have personally guaranteed it.

173
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:22,950
What that says is, oh, the company couldn't pay us.

174
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,352
What a pity. Well, we'll just take it from you instead.

175
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:29,255
So now, not only do we have company money

176
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:32,157
that you don't really control in your bank account,

177
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:35,880
now suddenly you've got your personal money that you don't really control.

178
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:40,380
So that's why thinking about that second kind of money is so important.

179
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,082
So to recap, we've got our first kind of money, cash you got in your hand,

180
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:45,824
cash that nobody else can take away.

181
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:49,506
The second kind is cash that somebody can take away.

182
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:51,767
And there are many ways for that to happen.

183
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,889
The third kind of cash is cash you don't have yet.

184
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:55,730
And I have many memories of.

185
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:02,097
Oh, Don, Don, it's good to talk.

186
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:04,518
How's the wife and kids, Don?

187
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:05,558
Oh, good, I'm glad.

188
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:07,639
Yeah, the check will be there Tuesday.

189
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,420
We'll FedEx it out Monday.

190
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,781
The check will, oh, no, no, don't worry about Don.

191
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,441
Everything's gonna be fine, yeah.

192
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,222
Check will be there on Tuesday.

193
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:21,803
Well, Tuesday comes, and usually there's a FedEx delivery

194
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:23,284
and there's a check, but sometimes there's not.

195
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:27,025
And sometimes that check comes Wednesday.

196
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:28,986
Sometimes it comes the following Monday.

197
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,108
Sometimes it comes a couple of weeks later,

198
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:36,250
and there have been a few times it never came at all.

199
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,132
So money you don't have yet is not really cash at all.

200
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,134
I call it the third kind of cash, but it is not cash.

201
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:46,715
Because until you have it, it ain't there.

202
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:50,718
The place I see this hurt people by accident.

203
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:56,879
Because in reality, almost all of the people I've done business with in this industry over

204
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,543
decades have been trying to do the right thing, trying to be honest people.

205
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:10,510
Where I see the greatest incidence of this with teams that I advise is they have a good

206
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,794
game, they're talking to some publishers, there's some interest there, there are discussions

207
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:16,355
going on.

208
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:20,535
and you feel really encouraged because the business development people

209
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:23,096
are encouraging you. They're encouraging you because they like your product and

210
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,456
you're thinking, hey,

211
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:28,038
if we could do this, this could be cool. While they are saying,

212
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,099
and they mean it, when they're encouraging you, that is not an intent,

213
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:34,981
in almost all cases, it is not an intentional

214
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:36,901
way to blow smoke of any kind.

215
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:41,423
And while they're saying this to you, they're saying to the company, hey, this

216
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:42,024
could be cool.

217
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:44,585
What do you guys think of this? And the company...

218
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,908
is reacting and there's an internal discussion about your game.

219
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:53,250
All of us have a tendency, including me, to go home and go back to the team and say,

220
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,851
hey, this is looking pretty good. They're really interested in it. We don't know

221
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,111
what's going to happen,

222
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:01,233
but they're interested. And we start to think about what we would do if we

223
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:01,973
signed a deal.

224
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:05,815
And we start to get to where we think of maybe cash.

225
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:10,116
Well, it's not maybe cash anymore. Now it's probably cash.

226
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:14,138
That's a psychological difference. Now we're handling cash differently.

227
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:17,968
Then maybe we get offered a draft contract.

228
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:18,948
You know, we're interested in this.

229
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,729
We'd like to give you a contract and talk about

230
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:23,050
the exact terms where we could do this.

231
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,810
You're looking at the contract.

232
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,391
They're talking about terms and good faith.

233
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,631
You kick some things around.

234
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:31,192
You know, there's some things where you disagree,

235
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:34,113
but it looks like it's very doable.

236
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,633
And so you now have, hey,

237
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,154
it looks like we're gonna have a deal.

238
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:40,554
And there's this moment where you turn to each other

239
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:40,955
and you go,

240
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:43,898
we could actually, this could work you guys.

241
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:45,378
This could really work.

242
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:50,660
And you start to think, wow, this is going pretty well.

243
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,021
Maybe two weeks, we'll have the kickoff check.

244
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:57,902
That could be very, two weeks, okay, two weeks.

245
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:59,202
And now we start to think, hey, two weeks is cash.

246
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:02,263
Few years ago I had a conversation

247
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:04,864
with a number of people who have run teams,

248
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:06,604
run companies, are advisors.

249
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:08,865
And we were all talking about,

250
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:14,598
How long do you think on anything other than a super simple small project, on any deal of any scope,

251
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:21,682
from the moment where you start to feel good to the point where you have a signed contract,

252
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:24,904
how long do you think that typically takes?

253
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:28,506
We were talking about it, the consensus we developed was 90 days.

254
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:32,208
And you could be sitting there going,

255
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,070
No, you're still past the mid-stack.

256
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:40,276
90 days. I mean if it looks good and you're having a deal, deals close faster than that.

257
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:44,039
And they do close faster than that. It often does happen they close faster than that.

258
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:50,704
They could be a simpler deal or whatever. But what happens is once we start to feel good,

259
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:54,327
we have a good link with the producer or whomever we're working with,

260
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:59,951
we start to feel that something is imminent and we start working as if the deal were done.

261
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:03,594
And it can be weeks, months or never before the deal gets done.

262
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:09,668
And that becomes a trap where a lot of cash can escape us very, very quickly.

263
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:12,049
So remembering to think about those things is key.

264
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:15,410
We also come down to the idea of we can have letters of intent.

265
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,592
A letter of intent is a short form agreement that can tide you over while you're negotiating

266
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:21,853
a contract.

267
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:27,075
It can also tie you up and take away your negotiating freedom in the contract.

268
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,616
Even letters of intent can take a while.

269
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:34,418
I had a case once where I was doing a deal that we ultimately signed.

270
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:42,611
On September 1st, the very senior level producer at the company said,

271
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:45,133
no this feels close, we should be underway shortly.

272
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:51,078
I said, well, why don't we do a letter of intent just to kind of cover it

273
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:52,479
and make sure we have everything clear.

274
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:55,362
So let's see, that was September 1st.

275
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:59,485
On December 20th, I actually got the draft letter of intent.

276
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:04,309
So it was about three months roughly just to get the letter of intent.

277
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,171
And we signed the deal on February 24th.

278
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:10,991
So let's recap.

279
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:11,512
Let's see.

280
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,192
September, October, November, December, January,

281
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:15,373
and most of February.

282
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,113
Yes, almost six months from.

283
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:17,513
This feels good.

284
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:19,474
It feels like we're about to do it.

285
00:16:19,474 --> 00:16:23,295
And them saying, hey, this is straightforward.

286
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,635
No problem.

287
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,156
Almost six months.

288
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:27,156
And that's a deal we signed.

289
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:29,517
I've seen deals like that that never get signed.

290
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:31,918
So that third kind of cash.

291
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:35,930
It draws us, our optimism, our hope, our love for our game.

292
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,851
If you're building a game, you love your game.

293
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:43,033
And when other people love it, that's a great feeling.

294
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,234
And I will tell you, I start to fall into the same thing,

295
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,354
and I have to keep reminding myself,

296
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:48,295
three kinds of cash, three kinds of cash, third kind of cash,

297
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:49,816
don't, listen, listen, listen in there.

298
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:53,157
But we have to watch that, because once you're

299
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:56,259
running a company, there isn't somebody else watching it

300
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:56,779
for you.

301
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,160
Once you're leading a team, there

302
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,600
isn't anybody else watching it for you.

303
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,041
You have to watch it for yourself.

304
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,562
I use this slide of a chess game.

305
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:13,805
I just published a book called From Dream to Delivery, which is basically about shipping

306
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:17,087
projects from scratch, doing something you love.

307
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:19,669
I tell a story in there that I call the chess game.

308
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:24,332
It's basically one time when we encountered a company where they very deliberately tried

309
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:25,472
to rip us off.

310
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:28,274
Very large, very well-known media company.

311
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:33,144
that deliberately had one executive in the company deliberately tried to steal several

312
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:38,031
hundred thousand dollars from us simply by manipulating what they did with the contract.

313
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:43,544
As I say, in my career, most of the people I've ever dealt with have been very reasonable,

314
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:44,785
tried to be fair.

315
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:47,446
You can argue about business terms, but they're fair.

316
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:49,187
People like that do exist.

317
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:49,687
They are rare.

318
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:51,989
And you have to keep it in the back of your mind.

319
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,309
That's why you want contracts.

320
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:54,990
That's why you want letters of intent.

321
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,252
That's why you check with lawyers about things.

322
00:17:57,252 --> 00:18:01,874
That's why you're careful, is you do find some people out there who are like that.

323
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:06,697
I'm delighted to say what a small minority they are, but you have to allow for the possibility

324
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:07,177
in what you do.

325
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,172
Salvador Dali understood many things.

326
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:19,398
He's the gentleman who painted this and many other paintings of this type about a hundred years ago.

327
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:24,643
And that is the nature of time when you're an indie team or you're doing a startup.

328
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:28,827
So rather than my telling you a lot about this issue,

329
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:33,752
I want to ask you to please do an assignment outside of this session.

330
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,242
Talk to more than one person who has been part of a startup,

331
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:45,564
who has led teams, indie teams, and ask them the question.

332
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:47,184
When you started out, you had an idea

333
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:49,465
about how you would be spending your time.

334
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,986
Once you guys got the team going,

335
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:54,167
what was the difference between what you expected

336
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,528
and how your time really was spent?

337
00:18:57,528 --> 00:19:00,249
Whatever you hear will be wisdom worth listening

338
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:01,989
to from any particular team.

339
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,490
And if you ask a bunch of people that question.

340
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,945
they may be some of the most valuable speakers you get out of GDC is just talking to them.

341
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:15,789
Because the issue is inevitably we don't end up spending our time the way we plan to,

342
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,351
but by talking to other people you get a diversity of answers to how that works

343
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:20,092
and what the deltas are.

344
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,334
Petri dishes. There are many stories you can tell with petri dishes.

345
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:22,774
Yes, some sad, some happy.

346
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:37,967
But here's the story I want to tell, because I'm a nut about game culture.

347
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:42,289
If you are a game designer, and then you end up leading a team,

348
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:48,151
you discover that the culture of running a company, a team, in any area,

349
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:51,733
any discipline, any technology, is in fact a game.

350
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,334
And it's a game with very real stakes.

351
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:56,295
It's a game that people care about.

352
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,056
And you want to keep your players playing, and you want to get great results,

353
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:01,257
and you want to win that game.

354
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:06,369
And so I joke about it sometimes, but I'm actually dead serious when I say that

355
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:11,791
the most important game design you may ever do is the culture of your company.

356
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,573
So the way I think about it is, if you picture,

357
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:19,634
if three of you were starting out on an indie project together,

358
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:24,096
and you picture in a room, picture three petri dishes that have scattered microbes of whatever sort,

359
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:28,118
and you put them on the table in the room,

360
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:31,739
and then you bring in seven brand new petri dishes, you take off the top.

361
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:39,894
You put them there on the table, you turn on a fan, and leave the room for two days.

362
00:20:39,894 --> 00:20:44,297
When you come back, what's going to be in the seven new petri dishes?

363
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:47,499
It's going to be microbes that are remarkably like those in the first three.

364
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:52,303
The first three of you, I've heard people say, well, there's only three of us.

365
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:55,245
I mean, culture, I mean, we sit across the table from each other.

366
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:58,066
Culture is sitting across the table from each other.

367
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:58,287
That's true.

368
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:03,125
but then if you bring in that fourth, that fifth, and that sixth person,

369
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:07,186
you are transferring to them the good, the bad, and the ugly

370
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:09,167
of how the three of you work together.

371
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:09,947
You get to 10, 20.

372
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:15,270
The first 10 then transfer that worldview to the next 10,

373
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,671
and to the next 30, and the next 50.

374
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:21,672
And being part of companies that started small

375
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:23,453
and then went up to having hundreds of people,

376
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:27,255
if there's something you don't like when your team hits 200,

377
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:34,055
Very often you can look back to something in the first 10 people and you can find the roots of where that went.

378
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:41,219
So those petri dishes, as you keep bringing in new ones into the room, they will keep getting most of the same microbes.

379
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:48,003
I have one piece of advice for how to deal with this issue, and that is to think about it.

380
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:51,945
If you sit down by yourself, if necessary,

381
00:21:52,994 --> 00:21:55,555
or just with your core team when you're starting something.

382
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:58,376
And this can be done for projects as well as for companies.

383
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:01,857
And you say, hey, what do we stand for?

384
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:03,078
What do we want to stand for?

385
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:04,438
What will our team be about?

386
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:09,820
If you could write three or four things just about what we stand for as people

387
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,762
and as a team and it's like to work with us, what would those three or four things be?

388
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:17,683
And you can debate them and argue them and then actually write them down.

389
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:22,762
What that does, it means that to the degree we control ourselves,

390
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:27,104
you're deciding what some of those microbes are in that first petri dish.

391
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:32,386
And you're deciding what kinds of people, in terms of character, not just skills,

392
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,407
you want to bring in to be around you.

393
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:37,228
So that's a very valuable and important thing.

394
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:41,709
That's how you control how the bacteria grow and spread.

395
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:45,451
You know, spreading everywhere, across the entire world, spreading infection.

396
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:48,411
of a wonderful or terrible sort, it's all up to you.

397
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:50,634
But you want to control, and you control by planning ahead and thinking about it.

398
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:51,735
I love the expression on these women's faces.

399
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:52,716
If I were sitting that close to a flame that big,

400
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:53,517
I think my face would look like that too.

401
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:13,538
Now, my point in this slide is to think about when, before this restaurant started putting

402
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:19,200
150 people in a room with six of these things and setting them all on fire at once, they

403
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,501
probably talked about exactly how to do this and they may have installed some processes

404
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:28,523
and equipment to make sure they did not burn down the building, let alone any of their

405
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:29,023
diners.

406
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:32,304
When we set up teams...

407
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:37,599
Very often, you're with people you've already worked with, you're used to how you do things,

408
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,161
and you just start working the way you've always worked.

409
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:43,323
And that may work out great, it may be wonderful.

410
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:50,207
But one thing I believe is if you are trying to make a startup, a new team, an indie project

411
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:55,971
a success, it is worth the time at the start to ask yourself a series of questions.

412
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:59,053
Okay, how are we going to organize this project?

413
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:01,786
What are our pipelines going to be?

414
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:05,328
How does an art asset go from a concept sketch

415
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:08,850
to being in the game and actually running properly

416
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,394
in the game and not creating chain reaction problems when

417
00:24:13,394 --> 00:24:14,234
we install it in the game?

418
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:16,656
And the same for every other kind of asset.

419
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,957
How will we know we're on time?

420
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,378
How will we track our progress?

421
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:24,101
OK, we want to go agile, we want to use hand stuff,

422
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:26,162
we want to use Favreau, we want to use Giro.

423
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:27,843
Or whatever you're going to do.

424
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:33,757
It actually matters less, in my opinion, what you choose,

425
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:38,520
than it matters that you choose and that you start at the very beginning and you say,

426
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,561
let's decide what to do.

427
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:43,283
Having some system is what's critical.

428
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:49,107
The system is what you pick and you're in control of your own fate.

429
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:50,708
But I think that not choosing.

430
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:54,481
is where I see a lot of problems happen with teams.

431
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:57,404
A certain amount of the work I do is I get called in

432
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:59,045
because teams are having problems.

433
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:01,667
I would much rather get called in at the start

434
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,689
before there are problems.

435
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:08,073
And very often it's good people doing good work,

436
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,814
but it is the lack of a consistent way

437
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:12,036
to organize and know how they're going to do it.

438
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:14,365
that ends up hurting them.

439
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:18,326
So I would just say figure out at the start what is your process.

440
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:23,668
And pick, you can picture, if you're going to start six bonfires in a room

441
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:25,669
with 150 people, there's a certain amount of planning.

442
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:27,430
You need to take your planning equally seriously.

443
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,210
I just like this picture.

444
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,170
What I think about with this picture is the,

445
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:44,187
You know, we've all seen dogs chase cars.

446
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:47,608
What does a dog do when they catch a car?

447
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:51,169
Normally, they stand there and they look confused

448
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:53,929
and they have no idea what to do next because they never

449
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,690
conceived of catching the car.

450
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,431
This is an unlikely outcome that we see pictured here

451
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:01,071
of a dog chasing a car.

452
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:04,852
But yet, very often we start companies,

453
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:08,233
we start teams because we have a project we love

454
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:08,773
that we believe in.

455
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:10,653
We go out and we build that game.

456
00:26:12,174 --> 00:26:15,617
and we ship it and down the road we think it's going to make money.

457
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:22,863
And then we have the question of, oh God, what do we do next?

458
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:30,249
So one of the things we have to think about is if you're actually starting a company and

459
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:35,333
not just doing a project, is what do you want your company to be?

460
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,595
What do you want your company to be when it grows up?

461
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,736
That's a critical question.

462
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:45,674
Again, the only one who will know the answer is you.

463
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:49,356
But if you don't ask that question at the very start,

464
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:52,156
you'll now be in a position where you finish your project

465
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:55,397
and you don't know necessarily what to do next.

466
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:57,918
And there's another issue that comes when you finish your project.

467
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:02,039
And we see the lion family on the savannah,

468
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,260
feasting on the night's kill.

469
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,802
They languidly stroll across the beach.

470
00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:15,622
Feeling the feeling of full bellies for the first time in three days

471
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:19,385
Now if you're a lion and you kill something big

472
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:27,752
First you eat a lot and then you lie around and eventually you go. I got to go hunt and kill something again as

473
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:31,735
Game studios what very often happens is we ship a game. We finish a project and

474
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:35,319
the next Monday

475
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,400
We have to know what we're going to do to pay

476
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:41,233
for the next paychecks for the team.

477
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:46,234
And it really isn't fair because in a fair world, in my view,

478
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:49,055
what would happen would be you'd finish,

479
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:51,616
everybody could take some time off the way you can at a big company,

480
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,836
and then you come back and you figure it out.

481
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:58,298
The trouble is the payroll requirement keeps coming up from the bank

482
00:27:58,298 --> 00:28:00,518
during that time.

483
00:28:00,518 --> 00:28:04,279
The last two or three months of a project are very often crazed,

484
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,940
and yet you have to be thinking about what are we going to do next,

485
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,140
where is the next money coming from.

486
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:14,637
What sometimes will happen to teams is they may not have thought about the big picture

487
00:28:14,637 --> 00:28:18,800
of what they want the full team to be, what they want the long term of the company to

488
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,704
be, and they are so busy finishing one game that they can only half-heartedly think about

489
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:24,845
what they do next.

490
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:30,468
Then they do a great job on a game, release it, there's no money coming in yet from that

491
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:34,351
game, and they don't have another project and they can run out of cash before they find

492
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:36,593
that next project because sometimes it takes a while.

493
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:44,126
remembering that fact of we're not like the lions, we have to feed ourselves constantly.

494
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:48,730
It is one of the bad parts of what we do, that we have to think about money that way,

495
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,170
but we do.

496
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,251
So I've talked about all sorts of problems.

497
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,752
I would like for this slide to come up.

498
00:28:52,752 --> 00:28:54,534
Thank you.

499
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:57,496
I've talked about all sorts of problems.

500
00:28:57,496 --> 00:29:00,978
I want to finish by talking about the other side and why we do this.

501
00:29:00,978 --> 00:29:02,559
This is an old board game.

502
00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:08,057
Actually, this board game was published for like 60 years before it finally was shut down.

503
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:12,179
And when I was a kid, I grew up in an alcoholic family.

504
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,282
And about 5 o'clock at night, things would usually start to get rather loud

505
00:29:16,282 --> 00:29:18,563
and unpleasant around our place.

506
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:23,506
And I would retire away into a corner in my room and I would play this game.

507
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:26,168
And I played this game for years and years.

508
00:29:26,168 --> 00:29:28,849
And then later it turned out I got to design computer games

509
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:32,752
and computer baseball games were part of it, which was just incredible.

510
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:39,281
But I, part of what got me through, part of my life, was this game.

511
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:40,841
Just a plain old board game.

512
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:45,404
If you do this for a while, you'll have people come up to you and say,

513
00:29:45,404 --> 00:29:46,745
oh, I played one of your games.

514
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:51,628
And they won't tell you how great the level design was on level six.

515
00:29:51,628 --> 00:29:55,130
They won't talk to you about game mechanics.

516
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,051
They'll tell you where they were when they played.

517
00:29:57,668 --> 00:30:01,511
who they were with, and why they still care enough now,

518
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:03,973
one, five, ten, twenty years later,

519
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:05,274
they want to tell you about it.

520
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:08,656
That's because you didn't just entertain them

521
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:10,057
for a couple of nights.

522
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:11,178
That's because you got to them.

523
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:14,200
You created a link between you and them

524
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,081
that made their life more fulfilled,

525
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,504
and they wanted to tell you because they now care about you

526
00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:22,905
because through your game you showed that you cared about them.

527
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:23,386
So why do we do all this?

528
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:33,119
Why do we put up with all the crap, a lot of which I've talked about in this presentation?

529
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,221
We do it because this is what we do.

530
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:37,061
This is our dream.

531
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:39,982
This is what we were made to do.

532
00:30:39,982 --> 00:30:42,803
I've done this 46 freaking years and I still love to do it.

533
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:45,544
I don't want to do something else.

534
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:49,846
I can report that you can do this for 46 years and not get bored because that's my experience.

535
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:55,408
But we have to keep doing it and to do it, we have to be willing to deal with the crap.

536
00:30:56,403 --> 00:31:00,404
We have to be willing to learn the negative parts of running a business,

537
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:02,905
many of which are just incidental parts of the gameplay

538
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:06,126
because God likes a well-balanced game.

539
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:08,627
But we have to be willing to do it

540
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:10,587
because this is an art form,

541
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:13,749
and if we're going to prove it to the world,

542
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:16,109
and if we're going to impact those lives

543
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:18,450
and give them something to come tell you,

544
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,291
is a reason you made their lives better

545
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,611
and they want to talk to you

546
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:23,092
because you've linked to them

547
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,792
and you connected to them with your game.

548
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:28,826
We can't be discouraged about all this other stuff.

549
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:32,711
We have to believe in ourselves, our teams, our projects, and our games.

550
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:36,675
And we have to deal with the crap and go out and build what you were meant to build.

551
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:40,079
That's the most important thing I could possibly say to you today.

552
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,382
And thank you guys very much for being here.
