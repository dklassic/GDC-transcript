00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:05,273
Yeah, I'm super excited about speaking at GDC this year, about unleashing your creative side.

2
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:09,857
Ever since I was little, I've always wondered what it meant to be a creative person.

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:15,101
I tried all sorts of things to unlock that potential, but when I joined Rare,

4
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:18,524
I learned that creativity comes in many forms.

5
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:27,211
I also learned that there's no one way to put yourself into an inventive mindset.

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,453
And that you can always find inventive ways to express yourself with what's around you.

7
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:43,916
I can't wait to share what I've learned on my journey through the industry and hopefully

8
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:46,057
help other people to find their creative spark.

9
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:51,400
The most exciting thing about GDC is that exchange of ideas and it would be so great

10
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:55,563
if people could go back to their teams with new ways of thinking and hopefully we can

11
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,684
unleash new creative weirdos out into the world.

12
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:04,934
There's always one! There's always one!
