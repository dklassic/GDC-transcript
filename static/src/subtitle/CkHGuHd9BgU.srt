1
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:10,304
Thank you all for coming, and would you kindly please

2
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:12,905
silence your phones.

3
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:15,525
And if you would also be so kind as to remember

4
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:17,186
to fill out the surveys at the end,

5
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:19,907
they get a lot of valuable information from them.

6
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:23,468
Hi.

7
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:26,969
My name is Soupy, at least to 98% of the people

8
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,030
that I work with, to the other 2%, I'm Chris.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,791
And this talk is about a way of prototyping gameplay

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,033
that we call action blocks and how

11
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:42,874
we use them to find the core of Titanfall 2's single player

12
00:00:42,874 --> 00:00:44,935
campaign and to develop the levels.

13
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:48,296
A little bit about me.

14
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:52,077
I've been working in games for about 13 years.

15
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:53,898
I started making some.

16
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:59,401
World War II Call of Duty games, and then I worked on Modern Warfare,

17
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:04,524
and for the last eight years or so I've been working on the Titanfall games.

18
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:11,689
I'm a level designer. My focus is mostly on layout, and I've done both single-player

19
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:16,952
and multiplayer levels. And a little bit about the folks who made Titanfall.

20
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:21,473
So years and years ago, a group of guys

21
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:23,635
made a really fantastic game called

22
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:26,276
Medal of Honor Allied Assault.

23
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:29,579
I remember this playing, or I remember playing this

24
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,940
before I even thought I could make video games

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,322
as a profession and loving it.

26
00:01:34,322 --> 00:01:38,165
And then some things happened, and some of those guys

27
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,926
made a new company called Infinity Ward,

28
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:42,768
where they made the Call of Duty franchise.

29
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:46,050
And then some things happened, and those guys,

30
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,111
some of those guys.

31
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,812
and me went to form Respawn Entertainment.

32
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:55,714
That is to say, there were a lot of talented people

33
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:59,375
who had worked together for a really long time.

34
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:03,757
And because of that, there was a lot of collective institutional knowledge

35
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:08,259
that created this well-oiled machine that had the skills and experience

36
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,060
at making a particular type of game.

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,441
But now we had to make a brand new game.

38
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:20,756
And this was exciting, and it was scary,

39
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:25,058
and we flailed around a bit, and we experimented with things.

40
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:29,319
And finally, inspired by different gameplay prototypes

41
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,841
and pitches and concept, we found the core of that game,

42
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:37,362
which was a first-person game with wall running

43
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:40,163
and double jumping and giant robots.

44
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:43,104
And it was pretty great.

45
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:45,905
We also wanted to make a single-player game.

46
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:51,014
One that was new and went with all of those new mechanics that we had.

47
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:58,857
And that was a bit harder, particularly because we fell into some bad habits.

48
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:00,518
Like pitching levels as a series of cool movie moments.

49
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:09,702
Because this assumed that we knew what the core gameplay was going to be,

50
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:15,384
but the movie moments didn't help create that gameplay on their own.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,602
or long, meandering, brainstorming meetings

52
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:25,265
that were full of arguments and whiteboard vomit and tears.

53
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:29,148
And on top of that, in AAA, you have a whole bunch

54
00:03:29,148 --> 00:03:33,390
of other departments that are just hungry beasts waiting

55
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,650
to be fed.

56
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,253
Still, we spent some time making a single-player campaign.

57
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,935
And some of that stuff was really, really cool.

58
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:44,596
But the gameplay never quite got there.

59
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:47,975
Because of that, because of production constraints,

60
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:49,435
we ended up cutting single player

61
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:52,838
so that we could focus on making multiplayer, which

62
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:58,581
ended up as Titanfall, this crazy mobility, giant robot,

63
00:03:58,581 --> 00:03:59,882
MP game.

64
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:02,724
And we managed to sneak a little bit of single player flair

65
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:02,944
in there.

66
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,087
So when we finally got to make the sequel,

67
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,148
we had some of the same questions and problems.

68
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,729
We knew we wanted a single player campaign,

69
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,971
but we didn't know exactly how to get there.

70
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,738
We had a sense we were going to make a first person

71
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,259
platforming shooter, something that

72
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,540
used all of those things from Titanfall,

73
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,961
like our mobility and our Titans.

74
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:27,683
But we also needed to change our process a little bit

75
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:31,905
so that we didn't fall into the same familiar traps.

76
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,986
And that's when we had a design meeting,

77
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:37,607
and the design team was told, go do some action blocks.

78
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:40,669
Sorry about that.

79
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:43,890
So action blocks.

80
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:46,899
are kind of game jam style design sprints.

81
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:51,160
The point of them is to encourage creative play

82
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,601
and to get designers thinking about game play.

83
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,863
And they came with a few simple guidelines.

84
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:01,284
They needed to be quick and dirty.

85
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,245
I made this guy my blocky buddy titan.

86
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:07,806
Rather than finding a model and posing it

87
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:10,107
and doing all of that, this was quicker.

88
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:11,128
I got him into the game.

89
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,221
And that is to say, these should be short.

90
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:15,663
They should take days or a week.

91
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:19,425
Every once in a while, if something's a bit more complex,

92
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:20,925
it can take a little bit longer.

93
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:23,607
But we sort of had a hard limit on two weeks.

94
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:25,368
And that was the exception.

95
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:29,871
They should also be a single designer working alone.

96
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,693
Unless two designers work together

97
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:35,334
because they complemented each other,

98
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,795
like one designer doing layout and the other doing

99
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,577
script for a particular action block that needed that.

100
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:46,015
And most importantly, things needed to have a skill test

101
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:47,676
that could fit into a level.

102
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:52,399
So that could be platforming or resource management

103
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,901
or combat or puzzles, whatever,

104
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,522
but it had to be about gameplay.

105
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,683
And the designer was supposed to take that

106
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:03,145
and iterate on it, dive deeper.

107
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:08,028
And to that point, we were not allowed to do awesome moments.

108
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:11,350
You couldn't just put something in because it was cool.

109
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:16,424
unless you were able to turn it into a gameplay skill test.

110
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:20,486
Now when we were finding gameplay,

111
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:24,467
we were told that it was okay to be as abstract as we wanted.

112
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,848
It didn't need a theme, story, or setting

113
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:30,390
as we were just kind of exploring what was going to be fun.

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,652
But, context wasn't necessarily discouraged

115
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:38,333
if it helped get the idea across.

116
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:41,859
as long as it didn't suck up too much of that time

117
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,640
developing the gameplay.

118
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,521
And finally, it had to be playable.

119
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:49,702
Not perfect, but playable.

120
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:53,984
We weren't going to do on-rails demos.

121
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:56,185
We needed to solve the hard design problems

122
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:58,686
of making something fun for somebody else to play.

123
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:02,167
So that means pulling people in for hallway testing

124
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,768
and iterating on the idea.

125
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:06,869
And this was super important because

126
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,810
We were pushing into unfamiliar territory

127
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,891
and trying to explore gameplay that

128
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,673
was outside of our wheelhouse.

129
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:16,134
It was really necessary to make that playable

130
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,776
so that we could figure out what the hard problems to solve

131
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:19,216
were.

132
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:23,659
But it wasn't always possible.

133
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:25,720
See, sometimes you would hack controls,

134
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,882
or there would be particularly difficult bugs

135
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:31,924
in some of the more complicated action blocks.

136
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:34,466
If there's so much duct tape that it's not

137
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:35,867
safe to let somebody else drive.

138
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:39,159
It's OK for the designer to do that as long as they're still

139
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,219
working at solving the hard problems of how

140
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,960
we're going to get the gameplay across to a player.

141
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,580
And then at the end, we did our show and tell.

142
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,081
We'd gather the whole design team.

143
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:52,721
Sometimes people from other departments would wander by.

144
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:56,102
And we would do this every week and show all of the action

145
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,962
blocks that we had worked on, especially things

146
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:00,242
that didn't work.

147
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:03,303
Because if you just stick those in a file cabinet

148
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:06,103
and hide them away, other people are doomed to repeat them.

149
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:14,211
Sometimes the designers would explain what their thinking was or their process to help everybody understand it.

150
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:17,312
And if possible, when we were playing it, we would do

151
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:25,573
a little bit of hallway testing right there, have somebody play it who had never played it before.

152
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:32,775
And at the end, we'd discuss, we'd give some honest feedback and a lot of cheering for the really cool things.

153
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:35,356
But there was no decision and no action items.

154
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:36,296
Like this was.

155
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:42,564
really about getting everyone together, sharing ideas,

156
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,266
learning from them and getting inspired.

157
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,547
So now we just had to use them.

158
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:55,494
The design test, the first thing that we did was

159
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,096
to take the design team and say,

160
00:08:58,096 --> 00:09:00,378
use your action blocks to try to figure out

161
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:02,760
what Titanfall 2 single player was gonna be.

162
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,082
And this was a very open-ended exploration.

163
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,362
In the end, we did come up with what the core of the game was.

164
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:16,124
After a week, we had a bunch of different ideas.

165
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,765
We had a maze, a chase, a few different takes

166
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:21,927
on platforming and mobility, an old school shooter,

167
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:25,368
some Titan Buddy combat, a new movement model.

168
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:28,369
And we were all excited about the potential for the game

169
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:29,830
that we could make.

170
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,431
We did this for another six weeks.

171
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:36,240
And we ended up with about 45 different action blocks,

172
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,041
each one exploring a new type of gameplay.

173
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,082
And we were really excited at this point.

174
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:46,664
See, these specific chunks of gameplay

175
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:49,085
cut through all of our grand prototyping

176
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,965
and our rambling debates.

177
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,647
They gave the team a shared, clear vision of the game

178
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:56,888
that we wanted to make.

179
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:57,928
So how did this work?

180
00:09:57,928 --> 00:10:00,249
I'll go through the process a little bit.

181
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,051
I'm going to start with an example.

182
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,132
This was my first action block.

183
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:08,193
And I think it's representative of the process

184
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:10,594
and some of the results.

185
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:15,156
As a layout guy who's done a lot of Geo in my time,

186
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,578
I started with this question.

187
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:23,841
What interesting gameplay can I get with a Pilot and a Titan

188
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:26,762
by just using layout?

189
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:28,323
My answer was a maze.

190
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:29,864
Now, as a kid, I loved mazes.

191
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:32,025
I've kind of always loved mazes.

192
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:36,298
As an adult who played games, I kind of hated mazes.

193
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:39,360
Because every first-person game that I've played that had a maze,

194
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,121
I didn't enjoy.

195
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:45,484
But this was about the time that Maze Runner had come out.

196
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:49,327
And that changed the scale of what a maze could be.

197
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:50,287
And I got this idea.

198
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:53,870
What if, as the pilot, you got out of the maze,

199
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,971
you looked at it from above, and you solved it,

200
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:58,353
and then you got in the Titan and you went through the maze?

201
00:10:58,353 --> 00:10:59,613
So you weren't hitting dead ends.

202
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:03,445
So I did some pen and paper stuff,

203
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:06,907
and then I got in the editor and started blocking things out,

204
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:10,949
and I made a nice, simple maze.

205
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:11,009
OK.

206
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:14,451
It really wasn't that simple.

207
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:17,493
I was frustrated when I played this and walked around.

208
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,454
So I started trying to work out the kinks,

209
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:22,396
trying to do the design thing of solving the problems.

210
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:26,798
And I separated out different pieces of the maze,

211
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,519
made them a little bit simpler.

212
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,774
Honestly, it was still over-designed and over-complicated.

213
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:41,998
I felt at the time like it was important to have a significant challenge that would really

214
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:46,081
force people to get out and solve the maze, but I have a lot of sympathy for the hallway

215
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,463
testers that I dragged into my office.

216
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:49,623
None of them enjoyed this.

217
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:53,606
They did exactly what I did every time I went through a maze, which is just kind of walk

218
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:55,267
through and bonk my head into the wall.

219
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:58,409
So I thought, oh, they just need the right incentive.

220
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:02,098
So the next version, I added deadly ground lasers.

221
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:05,081
Because pain is motivation.

222
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:11,125
It turns out this was also not a success.

223
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:16,169
Pain and complexity just kind of make something really annoying.

224
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,491
So there were a few people who did what I wanted,

225
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:20,012
but nobody enjoyed it.

226
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:23,315
And finally, I ended up learning the right lessons, which

227
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:26,197
were to simplify it down, keep some of the things

228
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:29,320
that I learned on the way about landmarks and even the damage.

229
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:34,160
but make it straightforward enough that people would go in,

230
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,442
solve the puzzle of understanding

231
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:39,163
the environmental exploration, go aha,

232
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:42,586
and then get through it and move on to the next thing.

233
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:45,368
We played this at the end of the week.

234
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:49,371
Somebody played it who had never seen it before,

235
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:50,792
and it was really enjoyable.

236
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:53,194
Everyone kind of gave it a thumbs up,

237
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:57,077
and we identified, because of action blocks like this,

238
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,558
a tone that fit in the game.

239
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:03,783
This particular one set up an idea that we could do light exploration

240
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:08,386
and environmental puzzles as long as they were on the relatively simple side.

241
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:12,670
And we ended up having a lot of action blocks like this.

242
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:19,516
All of these were examples that didn't directly make it into the game.

243
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:24,460
Like there's no maze in Titanfall 2, but the tone in the central idea

244
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,363
had a fairly direct influence on different parts of the game.

245
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,954
There is environmental exploration and light

246
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:33,194
environmental puzzles throughout.

247
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:37,116
And then some of these early action blocks

248
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,276
did even more than that.

249
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:43,378
So designer Sean Slaback had an idea.

250
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:48,059
He wanted to create an alternate use for the smart pistol.

251
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:50,520
Smart pistol was this auto-targeting gun

252
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,821
from Titanfall 1 that was either the best or the worst thing

253
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:56,122
in the world, depending on who you asked.

254
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,882
He made the gun lock on to switches

255
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,622
that would cause panels to flip down

256
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:04,403
and create a cool little wall running path.

257
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:09,705
The light context was a construction area,

258
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:11,446
but more importantly, it was fun.

259
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:17,928
Like the maze, this action block helped us understand

260
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:20,029
kind of what the core of the game was going to be,

261
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,450
that we wanted to have platforming

262
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,671
and that the platforming could be a little bit more dynamic.

263
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,805
Now, we didn't have any idea where this was going to fit into the game that early on,

264
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,305
so we filed it away.

265
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:37,869
Until eventually, that is not the right thing.

266
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:44,214
Until eventually, Diner Jason McCord was blocking out the level The Beacon,

267
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:49,218
and he needed a way for the player to traverse this big open area.

268
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:53,561
And he had a unique weapon for that level that locked on to switches,

269
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,643
and he had a construction theme.

270
00:14:56,293 --> 00:15:00,456
This action block fit perfectly.

271
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:02,638
And so he used it to traverse that space.

272
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,499
And this wasn't the only one.

273
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:05,440
There we go.

274
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:14,006
From crane puzzles to titans throwing the player,

275
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:16,748
we had this good library of gameplay segments

276
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,550
that we could pull from and slot into designs

277
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,691
later on in development.

278
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:24,583
These were things that we knew were fun,

279
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:29,086
even if we didn't know exactly where we were going to use them.

280
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:31,908
But action blocks didn't just tell us what we should do.

281
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:35,130
They also helped us figure out what we shouldn't do.

282
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,593
So if you look at Titanfall 1, we had pilots and we had titans.

283
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:44,417
And there were kind of these four food groups of gameplay.

284
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,677
There were human versus human.

285
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,579
There was human versus titan.

286
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,820
There was titan versus human.

287
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,841
And then there was titan versus titan.

288
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:54,005
And we, when we started on single player,

289
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:57,766
we wanted to have all of that because they were all fun,

290
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:59,507
good parts of what the game was.

291
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:02,989
So during development, during this early development,

292
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:05,230
we used action blocks to explore each of them.

293
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,752
One of the things that we thought in particular

294
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:11,933
would be great were human and titan interactions.

295
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:14,314
To be a pilot fighting a giant enemy titan

296
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:17,396
or next to your giant big buddy titan on the ground.

297
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:22,139
We tried giving the player different special weapons.

298
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,140
We tried using disposable titans.

299
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,342
We'd had titans that would go into a shield state

300
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:28,823
and get repaired.

301
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:32,224
And some of it was genuinely cool,

302
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:36,127
but they also showed some very real challenges

303
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,308
with this kind of gameplay.

304
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:42,370
Fights were either too easy because your big buddy titan

305
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,672
destroyed all the enemies, or too hard

306
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,232
for the little pilot on the ground

307
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:48,013
when enemy titans were smushing you.

308
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:51,905
there were a lot of hard problems.

309
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:55,027
And at this point, we hadn't even figured out

310
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:55,647
the fundamentals yet.

311
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,029
We still needed to get human-sized and Titan-sized

312
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:00,130
combat good.

313
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,372
So we decided to just not figure that out this game.

314
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:07,694
Because of those early action blocks,

315
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:12,236
we knew that we didn't want to solve that hard problem that

316
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:15,198
would, if we had kept working on it through the whole project,

317
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:17,779
led to bloated production.

318
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:18,220
And

319
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,564
a lot of time where eventually we would have had to cut it.

320
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:27,868
The early action blocks let us narrow our focus and really not underestimate some very

321
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,549
hard problems in design.

322
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:40,117
And all of these action blocks set up different fences for the design of single player.

323
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:45,881
By saying that, by saying no to things like mix, tighten, and human combat

324
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:48,719
We were able to scope the combat experience

325
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,219
to solve the problems that we already

326
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,800
knew that we had to solve, like Titan on Titan,

327
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,160
human on human.

328
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:02,602
Then there were some very special action blocks.

329
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:05,982
Sometimes you get context and you get gameplay,

330
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:10,583
and it creates this defining moment in development.

331
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,023
Jake Keating had this idea.

332
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:16,024
What if the player could control time travel?

333
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:22,658
This is kind of a crazy idea, but he wanted to get in there and do it.

334
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:26,540
And he needed a context to make it work.

335
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,844
So he took this Titanfall 1 map that he had designed for multiplayer, and he made a quick

336
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:37,207
overgrown duplicate of it so that it looked like it was from a different time.

337
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:40,509
And this set up the temporal research facility.

338
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:43,070
Then he set up...

339
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:48,110
some script so that you would teleport between the two locations at the press of a button.

340
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:55,391
And after that he built a path through the environment using that to explore

341
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:59,672
different gameplay elements with his new ability.

342
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:10,955
It was awesome. The entire team just fell in love and he sold the idea beautifully.

343
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:14,651
We saw a great idea for a level, and much of it

344
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:18,694
worked so well that it just made it into the final game.

345
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:22,437
Things that he did early on when he action blocked combat

346
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:25,539
with his new ability translated really well.

347
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,822
And there were other cool platforming puzzles

348
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,964
that he did because that's what he thought would be fun that,

349
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:35,006
again, directly made it into the final level.

350
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:37,728
But this did something else for the team.

351
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:39,930
It also showed us what a level could be.

352
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:44,858
what the tempo and the sense of timing and pacing

353
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:48,880
and how all the different parts of mobility and puzzle

354
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,122
solving and combat, how they could fit together

355
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,383
into one space.

356
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:55,324
And this was really wonderful.

357
00:19:55,324 --> 00:20:00,227
This was also the only action block

358
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:02,869
that made it directly into the final game

359
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,530
as an entire level like this.

360
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:10,514
There were other ones that had this kind of levelish action

361
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:10,854
block.

362
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,103
feel to them. And they helped us evolve what our sense for a level was going to be.

363
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:24,167
But they really weren't the defining aspect of this early action block time. It was all of the

364
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:28,690
action blocks together. The things that inspired us and the things that guide us and the things

365
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,993
that set up those fences. And even ones that didn't come close to making it in the final game

366
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:38,875
had very real impact on what the final game was.

367
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:48,812
when Moe Lavi made this awesome action block that was absolutely never going to ship.

368
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:54,475
So he wanted destructible environment.

369
00:20:54,475 --> 00:21:02,259
And it was awesome. Like the titan walking through the buildings was great.

370
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:08,162
And there was gameplay in there. You'd play hide and seek with this giant robot who was smashing through buildings.

371
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:12,699
But it was way out of scope for the team and the production

372
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:13,859
schedule that we had.

373
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:15,820
There were code reasons, and design reasons,

374
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,421
and production reasons, and art reasons.

375
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:18,981
And it was just too much.

376
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:21,502
We weren't going to be able to do it.

377
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:26,705
But in a really unexpected way, it

378
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:28,425
was the inspiration for the level

379
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:32,887
that I worked on for most of the project, Into the Abyss.

380
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:37,389
Now, not only did Mo's action block inspire this level.

381
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:40,068
But action blocks also played a significant role

382
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:41,289
in shaping the level.

383
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,750
A little bit of background.

384
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,712
Into the Abyss is the third level in the campaign.

385
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:48,654
It's sort of a Mines of Moria.

386
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:51,515
It's a shortcut through a bad place to get to the other side.

387
00:21:51,515 --> 00:21:58,660
It ended up being this crazy underground factory that

388
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,082
constructed military test chambers,

389
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:05,024
but it started with Titans crashing through walls.

390
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:12,173
Because after finishing that action block in that sort of six week sprint,

391
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:18,155
we actually started designing levels, or pitching levels is a better way of putting it.

392
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:24,636
One of our designers, David Shaver, wanted to do the destruction that he saw in that action block.

393
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:28,557
And he knew that we weren't going to be able to do it for the scope of the entire game,

394
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:34,558
but he thought, well, what if we limited it to military testing facilities

395
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,019
that were made out of plywood shacks?

396
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:40,868
And then you could destroy the town with robots and stuff.

397
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:43,049
And then you could replace the town again.

398
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:48,351
And it was literally a boom town, a town that goes boom.

399
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:50,212
So the pitch went on.

400
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:54,314
If you're going to replace this town that's being destroyed,

401
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:58,035
you also need this crazy automated factory that

402
00:22:58,035 --> 00:23:00,316
keeps replacing the parts of the town.

403
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:02,317
And of course, as the player, you'd

404
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,818
have to go into that factory.

405
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:05,898
I heard this pitch, and I got it.

406
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:15,240
really excited. I thought that there was a lot of potential. And the factory that built towns,

407
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:22,744
it tingled something in my brain. And it made me think of this particular piece of concept from

408
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:30,648
Jung Park. I love this concept. I just thought this was beautiful and inspiring. And I thought,

409
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:35,511
well, this fits really well with those towns that Schaeber was pitching.

410
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,953
What if we tag team on the development of the level?

411
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:40,374
I had more Geo experience.

412
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:42,356
He had more scripting experience.

413
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:45,618
And we could both design it together and come up

414
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:46,139
with a pitch.

415
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:47,039
And he said, sure.

416
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,862
So we rolled up our sleeves and we got to work.

417
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:53,645
And this was diving deeper and trying to design a level.

418
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:57,948
It's coming up with and pitching the entire thing.

419
00:23:57,948 --> 00:23:59,529
So trying to figure out what the story was,

420
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:01,511
what the characters were going to be,

421
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:04,473
and the setting, and the beats, and the cool moments,

422
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:05,694
and of course, the game play.

423
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:11,111
Often, the gameplay would be inspired by those early action blocks.

424
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:14,232
And we did cool platforming early on.

425
00:24:14,232 --> 00:24:16,653
What if we were wall running on those grassy panels?

426
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:20,114
What would it be like to play in that factory?

427
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:22,595
Or we would expand on the town fighting idea.

428
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:26,316
Like what about the town collapsing around you?

429
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:31,218
We wanted to find the best gameplay though, before putting it into the final design.

430
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:36,378
So while art was diving deeper on a style for the level

431
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:39,819
and we were exploring layout and story stuff,

432
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:43,340
we also took those ideas and used action blocks

433
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,941
to drill down on the gameplay.

434
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:54,424
And we started with a little open-ended, context light,

435
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:56,825
context light action blocking.

436
00:24:58,024 --> 00:25:00,786
The idea was to quickly play with ideas

437
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,146
and figure out what was going to be fun

438
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:05,608
and what was going to work in the space

439
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:08,370
and get a handle on what the fundamentals were.

440
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,872
So as an example, platforming in that factory.

441
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:16,914
So art was worth wasting no time.

442
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:18,515
Todd Su, the lead environment artist,

443
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:22,898
did this 3D sketch of what the giant underground factory could

444
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:26,380
look like, because this is the obvious place to put a factory.

445
00:25:27,408 --> 00:25:32,132
It looked cool, so we figured, yeah, we should use that.

446
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:37,396
And I used this with those ideas of big grass panels

447
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:40,459
as a starting point to do some simple platforming action

448
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:40,819
blocks.

449
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:44,603
I blocked out a space that looked almost as good

450
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:46,404
as what Todd had done.

451
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:50,888
And I put some giant rectangular grass panels in them.

452
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:54,571
And over a few days, I played with static platforming.

453
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:55,152
And I started.

454
00:25:55,792 --> 00:26:00,934
those panels moving across and then moving up and down,

455
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,696
using them as elevators, just trying different ideas.

456
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:07,898
And this created a library of gameplay ideas,

457
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:12,360
but also helped me solve some of the design problems.

458
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,802
How do I translate my skills at making mobility

459
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:18,803
in an open multiplayer environment to a linear path

460
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:20,684
that we're trying to guide a player down?

461
00:26:20,684 --> 00:26:24,686
I figured out what worked and some of what didn't.

462
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:29,155
While I was doing this, Shaver had a different approach.

463
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:31,936
He wanted to play with hazards and riding along

464
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:32,796
those platforms.

465
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:35,617
So he thought of things that could knock you off

466
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:38,297
the platforms, or things that you had to jump over,

467
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:42,598
or things like these beautiful rollers of death

468
00:26:42,598 --> 00:26:45,679
that had pretty simple and straightforward platforming

469
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,819
to get around.

470
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,840
Now, really didn't have a clear idea

471
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,501
of what these were going to be in the factory.

472
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:58,321
But they were fun, and that was the first thing.

473
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:00,983
And they also solved some problems

474
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:04,266
with first-person platforming, like letting the player know

475
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:07,008
that there was a big threat they needed to watch out for

476
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:10,230
and having simple platforming navigation so

477
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,052
that they weren't overwhelmed by what they had to do.

478
00:27:13,052 --> 00:27:15,874
So we took this and filed it away in the library.

479
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:18,176
Now, how does all this make it into the final game?

480
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:19,337
Eventually, we started.

481
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:24,649
doing level design.

482
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:26,410
Shaver wrote the level design doc.

483
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:34,235
And this is a page from that section about the factory.

484
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:39,198
I actually took this doc and did the layout for the level,

485
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:42,419
or this chunk of the level, and started

486
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,021
with the grand reveal of the world foundry.

487
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:48,503
So I wanted to do the best grand reveal.

488
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:52,225
And I went and asked an artist, specifically Jose Zavala, who

489
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:52,785
was the.

490
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:58,091
environment artist that was working on the level.

491
00:27:58,091 --> 00:28:00,953
And I said, OK, we have this big factory.

492
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:02,474
What's the best view to look at it from?

493
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:07,658
And he gave me this view, which had a problem,

494
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:09,859
because that's where I needed to get to.

495
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:16,043
The doc, of course, reads, the pilot crosses the chasm

496
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:17,965
on blank moving terrain panels.

497
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:21,826
So this line existed because of those old action blocks.

498
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:24,347
We didn't have to have the specific details of what

499
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:25,588
the platforming was going to be.

500
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:28,049
Figure that out when we're actually blocking out the level.

501
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:31,410
But because of them, I was confident

502
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,572
that I'd be able to make good platforming to cross the space.

503
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:37,212
So I added some platforms.

504
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:40,074
And then I got them moving.

505
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:42,475
And then I did a little bit of testing

506
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:43,815
and a little bit of tweaking.

507
00:28:44,752 --> 00:28:46,553
and made some adjustments, and eventually it

508
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:48,774
was a fun little platforming that

509
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,075
got you across the section.

510
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:53,858
I also added a little bit of context in my block out.

511
00:28:53,858 --> 00:29:01,143
But just enough to get across the space, the timing,

512
00:29:01,143 --> 00:29:04,125
the important points, so that when art came in

513
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:08,267
and the scripter finally made it work, for real,

514
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:09,448
it could all come together.

515
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,730
So when we got to full production,

516
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,372
Chad Grenier, who scripted this.

517
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:18,263
section of level, he came in and he just made it amazing.

518
00:29:18,263 --> 00:29:20,604
The timing was adjusted a little bit.

519
00:29:20,604 --> 00:29:23,185
There were definitely slight adjustments to the positioning

520
00:29:23,185 --> 00:29:27,447
as the robot arms were taken a bit more into consideration.

521
00:29:27,447 --> 00:29:29,048
But fundamentally, it was building

522
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:34,251
on the platforming principles that we'd already established.

523
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:37,132
Now, we had another problem, which

524
00:29:37,132 --> 00:29:41,615
was, how do we get our pilot from one platform where he's

525
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:41,955
just?

526
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:45,829
squished a bunch of bad guys to the next platform

527
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:47,110
where he's got to fight new ones.

528
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,573
Again, in the document, it said, the pilot

529
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:53,235
jumps on a grassy terrain panel and rides

530
00:29:53,235 --> 00:29:54,476
to another assembly area.

531
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:58,199
Well, riding didn't seem quite interesting enough.

532
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:01,122
And we actually still needed the detail

533
00:30:01,122 --> 00:30:03,283
of how the grass got added to the panel

534
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:05,405
somewhere in this design.

535
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:09,669
So I came up with this freaky farm equipment hybrid.

536
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:12,151
It looks like a machine that.

537
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:14,759
you know, adds grass to things.

538
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,840
Art agreed that we could probably make something work like that.

539
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,261
But then how does this translate into gameplay?

540
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:24,402
Well, that's where Shaver's action blocks came in.

541
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:30,844
See, his exact layout of action block platforming,

542
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:33,945
where you jump from one to the other, that didn't work in the space.

543
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:38,607
But the general lessons, the big hazard and simple platforming,

544
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:40,207
that actually worked really well.

545
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:44,425
So when I ended up blocking this out,

546
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,186
I got to a point where I made a simple platform

547
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:50,407
that you jump on and then you see

548
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:51,508
the giant rollers of death.

549
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:54,489
And that forces you into the one path,

550
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:55,749
which is a simple wall run.

551
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:56,870
You jump around the other side

552
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,891
and when you land on the platform, it's covered in grass.

553
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,552
We ended up making a lot of abstract

554
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:04,472
platforming action blocks.

555
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:06,713
And some of them, like those, made it in.

556
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:11,015
There were lots of them that didn't.

557
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:15,890
They didn't work or they didn't actually fit the gameplay that we needed,

558
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,811
but all of them guided the gameplay in the section.

559
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:24,495
They were lessons in how to design that kind of platforming gameplay.

560
00:31:24,495 --> 00:31:32,260
It's kind of like how a good piece of concept art guides the visuals of a level

561
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,542
without actually giving you the level layout.

562
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:45,291
These action blocks guide the gameplay and give you a target to shoot for without necessarily saying this is exactly what you're doing.

563
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,592
But we did use them in a lot of other ways too.

564
00:31:46,592 --> 00:31:55,720
More specifically, we wanted to try to use action blocks in a more focused and directed way.

565
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:04,347
So we would take an initial idea and then explore it with theme and context and try to figure out what was going to work.

566
00:32:04,347 --> 00:32:04,987
In this case...

567
00:32:05,597 --> 00:32:12,861
what are the details of a factory? So we started with some just factory reference.

568
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:17,343
How are cars built or houses? Because apparently there are factories that build houses.

569
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:26,268
And this inspired memories of I think one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.

570
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:27,989
And this particular scene.

571
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:28,410
Well screw that!

572
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:37,476
How are we supposed to get through this?

573
00:32:37,476 --> 00:32:40,278
I don't think she said screw.

574
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:46,842
So what about something like this for our crazy factory

575
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:47,723
assembly line?

576
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:53,406
I took that and decided, well, we need to make panels.

577
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:56,008
We need to make parts of these houses.

578
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,830
So let's block out an actual assembly line.

579
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,511
I started with it turned off.

580
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:03,723
static environment that was blocked,

581
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:06,084
but that you could go through and do some simple platforming

582
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:06,884
on.

583
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,425
You get to a control room, and you turn it on.

584
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:11,226
And rather than trying to make it work in that area,

585
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:13,127
I just teleported you to another area

586
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:14,968
where everything was already moving.

587
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:19,649
And then I started playing with a bit more context ideas,

588
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,730
like laser things.

589
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:26,452
And screw this.

590
00:33:26,452 --> 00:33:28,373
These were terrible.

591
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,433
It was not fun at all.

592
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:33,534
But rather than, you know, redesigning that little chunk,

593
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:35,895
I just kind of went forward and I started doing things

594
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:37,777
that you could jump over, figuring out that, oh,

595
00:33:37,777 --> 00:33:40,239
if you had a place where the player could stop and rest,

596
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:41,140
that worked better.

597
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,103
And, you know, adding these in a row and having fire,

598
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:49,106
like there were different gameplay things that worked.

599
00:33:49,106 --> 00:33:51,648
And we got to some place where some

600
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:53,109
of these were really pretty fun.

601
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:54,750
Learned some good lessons.

602
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,013
And then I moved on to a different problem.

603
00:33:59,483 --> 00:34:01,505
What about building the house?

604
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:03,806
Because this was another idea.

605
00:34:03,806 --> 00:34:06,008
We thought, wouldn't it be cool

606
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:08,570
if you had the house built around you

607
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,052
while you were fighting on it?

608
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:11,773
So I made a really simple frame.

609
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:17,698
I put some enemies around you,

610
00:34:17,698 --> 00:34:19,759
and while you were fighting them,

611
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:23,102
I just had the walls of the house start to drop in

612
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,523
and block up the fight.

613
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:25,524
It was fun.

614
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:28,786
Like, it was a fun little dynamic moment.

615
00:34:29,731 --> 00:34:31,992
when I played through it.

616
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:33,772
And then when I had other people play through it,

617
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,213
I started to see some problems.

618
00:34:35,213 --> 00:34:38,333
They didn't just stay on the platform

619
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,934
and wait for the walls to fall into place.

620
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:42,875
So the next version,

621
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,235
I added a little bit of cover in there,

622
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:49,376
those white walls that are now around the frame.

623
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:51,517
That drew people to them,

624
00:34:51,517 --> 00:34:53,398
because cover always draws people.

625
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:55,158
And they stayed there,

626
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:57,779
so they were in roughly the right position

627
00:34:57,779 --> 00:34:58,919
while the walls dropped in.

628
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:03,301
Now, sometimes people would ignore that completely

629
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,823
and then just run off to go fight the enemies.

630
00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:11,247
So the next version, I ended up putting it over a giant pit.

631
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:15,150
And that kept the players on the platform

632
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,713
because they didn't feel as encouraged to run and jump off.

633
00:35:19,713 --> 00:35:22,876
The walls kept them roughly where I wanted them.

634
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:25,818
And I still had some problems with players being squished.

635
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:27,940
So I ended up making the walls come in from the front.

636
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:30,515
But this was a pretty cool little moment.

637
00:35:30,515 --> 00:35:33,997
And I'd solved some of the design problems

638
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:36,418
with making this kind of gameplay and space

639
00:35:36,418 --> 00:35:41,160
work before we were in full production for the level.

640
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,462
Now, it turns out we had to make a decision.

641
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:48,343
The problem was, in the final level design,

642
00:35:48,343 --> 00:35:49,984
considering production constraints,

643
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:52,065
we couldn't do both of these.

644
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:55,066
We had to pick one that was more fun and better.

645
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,048
But because we had the action blocks to look at.

646
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:01,340
it was easier to make that decision.

647
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,521
Getting the house built around you

648
00:36:04,521 --> 00:36:07,103
was the more enjoyable, the cooler choice.

649
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:09,905
We didn't need to, on top of that,

650
00:36:09,905 --> 00:36:12,006
there were a couple of extra bonuses

651
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:14,287
from doing those early action blocks.

652
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:17,609
We didn't need to discover the design lessons all over again

653
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,870
when we were in full production.

654
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,771
The cover was already on the platform.

655
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:23,933
I knew it needed to be over a big pit, which

656
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:27,154
worked really well in that giant underground space.

657
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:27,235
So.

658
00:36:27,878 --> 00:36:31,380
I just put them in and blocked it out when it came to blocking out this section.

659
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:38,723
The other thing that we got out of those high context action blocks were good

660
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:42,124
reference for art and animation and script.

661
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:47,326
See the level block out when relatively quick and it saved a bunch of time to be

662
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:51,868
able to see to say this is what we're going for.

663
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:56,890
Now there was still a ton of work to do from a lot of valiant people to put all

664
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:57,630
of this.

665
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:04,134
together but we had already solved the hard gameplay problems so at least that wasn't getting

666
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:10,980
in the way and causing us to redo animations and change art and set up like different rigging

667
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:18,425
throughout the process. We didn't waste time with that. Unfortunately there are some things that

668
00:37:18,425 --> 00:37:28,093
just don't work out. There are ideas that you just love and those ideas are almost too good to test.

669
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:40,305
And action blocks are so far the best way that I've found to test those exciting and kind of untested things

670
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:43,447
Figure out what could make them fun or that we just shouldn't do them

671
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:45,469
So one of the earliest things

672
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:48,171
As I mentioned a while ago now

673
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:53,955
It feels like was that we wanted to have the test chamber combat like that was a big part of what the level was

674
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:55,236
going to be

675
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:57,077
the town was going to

676
00:37:57,897 --> 00:38:04,001
switch around you. So while you were in a fight, we wanted floors to drop out and buildings

677
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:09,085
to be raised and everything to change in this dynamic battlefield and give you alternate

678
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:13,588
ways of flanking. And it was going to be really cool. And it sounds really cool. Like all

679
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:19,772
the ideas we had when we were talking about it were great. And we spent weeks trying lots

680
00:38:19,772 --> 00:38:21,153
of variations on this.

681
00:38:23,443 --> 00:38:29,705
Simple rooms with just very clean flank paths where you could go underneath and you would drop stuff out

682
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:35,966
It was okay, but it didn't add anything to the fight when you could just shoot the guy who was across from you

683
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:44,648
We tried more complex interesting environments with bigger enemies and a chance to use your mobility underneath and it ended up being too

684
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:51,629
Challenging and there were still reward issues and on top of that once you get underneath you didn't understand what was going on up above you

685
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:54,248
Interactivity.

686
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,750
Shaver made these cool pistons that you

687
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,091
could shoot from underneath.

688
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:01,034
And you could shoot them while enemies were standing on them,

689
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:03,336
and it would drop guys down and kill them,

690
00:39:03,336 --> 00:39:07,700
which seemed like it was going to be obviously great.

691
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,162
And it still wasn't worth it, even

692
00:39:10,162 --> 00:39:13,184
when there were giant rollers that they fell into

693
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:13,505
and they died.

694
00:39:13,505 --> 00:39:16,107
We didn't stop there.

695
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:17,968
There were so many more action blocks

696
00:39:17,968 --> 00:39:19,190
trying to figure this out.

697
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,932
Buttons on the top that would drop panels.

698
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:26,185
Sometimes we did some puzzle game play in the arenas.

699
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:29,286
We tried all sorts of enemies, glass floor,

700
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:31,086
whole houses being built around you.

701
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:34,087
But there were really too many problems

702
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:36,328
and it never ended up being fun.

703
00:39:36,328 --> 00:39:39,109
They were a little bit too random.

704
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:40,650
There wasn't enough reward.

705
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,111
It just didn't quite work out.

706
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:46,011
I'm sure that there is a solution

707
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,892
and that there is a really cool dynamic arena fight

708
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:49,953
that can happen somewhere.

709
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:54,489
but we did not figure out what it was going to be.

710
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:57,091
And so it didn't go into the final design.

711
00:39:57,091 --> 00:39:59,432
We still got cool stuff out of this time.

712
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:00,273
We learned a lot.

713
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:05,236
And there were even things like this little section that,

714
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,437
again, a little too random when you were fighting in it,

715
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:12,460
but it ended up being a template for moving the town

716
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:12,960
into position.

717
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,680
And honestly.

718
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:21,340
It was really great that in the end,

719
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,042
it just ended up being this little intro to the town.

720
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:29,165
It's a cool scene and it feels good when it's happening.

721
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:32,167
But more importantly, we figured this out

722
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:34,408
before we were neck deep in production

723
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:36,450
trying to do that final push on the game

724
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,192
where everyone is in full swing

725
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:42,013
and you're trying to figure everything out,

726
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:43,154
not having to figure out

727
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:46,116
what that dynamic town gameplay was then

728
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:47,937
because we'd already decided not to do it.

729
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:49,880
was incredibly valuable.

730
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:58,186
So let me give you one final example in the process.

731
00:40:58,186 --> 00:41:01,648
Much like the noble platypus, nature's Frankenstein monster,

732
00:41:01,648 --> 00:41:05,430
there are lots of different ideas

733
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,772
and things that come up in development.

734
00:41:07,772 --> 00:41:10,534
Design is busy designing, art is arting,

735
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,814
coders are codering.

736
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:15,717
And we're getting a lot of new things.

737
00:41:15,717 --> 00:41:17,078
And throughout development,

738
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:17,738
action blocks are...

739
00:41:18,216 --> 00:41:23,880
a nice way to experiment with those new things and then try them out and see if you can mush them

740
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,704
into the level that you're working on. So to step back a little bit, there was a time where we were

741
00:41:28,704 --> 00:41:36,350
still convinced that we were going to make that dynamic town work and that it was going to be fun

742
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:44,216
gameplay. During this time, like I said, Art was still exploring the space. Well, I went down to

743
00:41:44,216 --> 00:41:47,438
Jose and I asked, how could we make this happen?

744
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:52,022
without using magic floating platforms.

745
00:41:52,022 --> 00:41:54,242
And to me, because I wanted those individual pieces

746
00:41:54,242 --> 00:41:56,762
to come out, I thought, oh, let's do giant robot arms,

747
00:41:56,762 --> 00:41:59,223
and they'll pull out some and replace it with others,

748
00:41:59,223 --> 00:42:00,763
and we can do cool stuff.

749
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:04,464
So he begrudgingly obliged me and made this little mock-up.

750
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:05,944
But he had another idea.

751
00:42:05,944 --> 00:42:09,565
He thought, well, what if we put all those long panels together

752
00:42:09,565 --> 00:42:10,065
in a strip?

753
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:14,646
And then that strip is mounted into this big underground

754
00:42:14,646 --> 00:42:18,387
cavern where it rides on rails, and that moves up to position.

755
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:21,244
I hated this.

756
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:27,867
It was so against the gameplay that we were at the time

757
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:30,268
trying to figure out.

758
00:42:30,268 --> 00:42:33,269
It was a great idea for solving the mechanical problem,

759
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:39,772
but it didn't fit the arena that I thought we were going to make.

760
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:40,793
So I filed it away.

761
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:43,694
Now I'm going to jump to the side a little bit.

762
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,515
The tech that we had initially did not

763
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:49,157
support players interacting with moving geo.

764
00:42:50,094 --> 00:42:55,156
We knew we wanted to and so code put it on the schedule and John Haggerty,

765
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,578
one of our programmers, made it work.

766
00:42:58,578 --> 00:43:04,301
And it supported players navigating and wall running through stuff like this.

767
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:09,863
Now, I'm flying around it just to show you broadly all of the things

768
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:15,406
that Jason McCord took and experimented with once this feature came online.

769
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:18,887
He made this big abstract funhouse where we could just...

770
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:23,706
play, or he could just play with a bunch of different ideas,

771
00:43:23,706 --> 00:43:27,288
and try things to figure out now that we had moving Geo,

772
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:30,709
what was actually going to be fun, a fun challenge

773
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:31,470
for the player to do.

774
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:37,972
At the end of this giant, crazy Plinko machine that he had,

775
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:39,913
you'd get to the top of it.

776
00:43:39,913 --> 00:43:42,954
And when you landed here, under your feet,

777
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,195
the entire thing would start rotating.

778
00:43:45,195 --> 00:43:49,417
And it would go from vertical to horizontal.

779
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:58,221
And this was just a great example of like what you can do with action blocks.

780
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:00,682
You don't even know like where it's going to go.

781
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:04,263
But it was really cool and it was really inspiring.

782
00:44:04,263 --> 00:44:08,085
So again that got filed away a little bit jump to the side one more time.

783
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:13,927
Shaver and I were talking about the overall flow and layout of the level.

784
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:20,630
And we had a problem which is how do you get from the factory to the arena that the factory has built.

785
00:44:21,377 --> 00:44:23,619
Now, we knew a few things at this point.

786
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,600
We knew we were going to have a factory,

787
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,281
and we knew that we were going to have

788
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:30,963
the house built around you.

789
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:33,264
We also knew that we were going to have an arena

790
00:44:33,264 --> 00:44:34,685
and that it wasn't going to be dynamic.

791
00:44:34,685 --> 00:44:36,566
And I was just sitting there and kind of thinking

792
00:44:36,566 --> 00:44:38,608
about this one day when I had an idea.

793
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:40,729
That sort of clear, beautiful vision

794
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:44,031
where maybe you start in the house in the factory,

795
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:46,472
and that moves through the space.

796
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,533
And it gets turned on its side and stored in this sideways

797
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:53,834
town that you do platforming to get up.

798
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:58,056
And then that entire town flips directly

799
00:44:58,056 --> 00:45:00,438
from McCord's funhouse.

800
00:45:00,438 --> 00:45:04,400
But also, because Jose had done that particular type

801
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,283
of contextualization, that would be a good delivery system.

802
00:45:09,283 --> 00:45:11,464
And then you'd get to the top, and you'd fight.

803
00:45:11,464 --> 00:45:15,186
So action blocking this, I got into the editor.

804
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:15,286
And

805
00:45:16,273 --> 00:45:17,694
I just started building a little town.

806
00:45:17,694 --> 00:45:20,714
I instanced it and stuck it on its side

807
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:22,735
so that when I was in the test map,

808
00:45:22,735 --> 00:45:26,375
I could fight around the town, walk around the town,

809
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,896
and then jump up there and try to do some platforming.

810
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:30,816
And I learned a couple of valuable lessons

811
00:45:30,816 --> 00:45:34,297
about guiding the player and mobility

812
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:35,737
in that kind of an environment.

813
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:37,918
And then I just took the thing, and I cut it

814
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:40,178
into a bunch of different pieces.

815
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:44,199
And I took all of those pieces, and I did the brute force

816
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,379
like mash them.

817
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:48,757
riding down a hall and then onto the side

818
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:51,860
and I put a couple of rails on the side

819
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,981
to sort of imply where it was gonna go.

820
00:45:53,981 --> 00:45:58,866
And then eventually made it playable.

821
00:45:58,866 --> 00:46:06,112
This was kind of a bit risky as a total idea,

822
00:46:06,112 --> 00:46:08,534
but it turned out that it worked pretty well.

823
00:46:08,534 --> 00:46:11,376
And like the other action blocks that I did,

824
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:15,059
I learned a lot that guided us in making the final.

825
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:16,812
block out of the level.

826
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:20,054
I got a lot of confidence that I could make something

827
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:23,235
that would be fun, even though I'd have to make some changes

828
00:46:23,235 --> 00:46:24,476
to make it work.

829
00:46:24,476 --> 00:46:27,318
And I made a template for what the final section

830
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,801
was going to look like and what the gameplay beats could be.

831
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:34,002
Not one-to-one, things definitely changed

832
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:38,044
as we did the work, and Chad added a whole bunch of touches

833
00:46:38,044 --> 00:46:41,186
to it when he was scripting it that made it better.

834
00:46:41,186 --> 00:46:43,188
But personally, this was, I think,

835
00:46:43,188 --> 00:46:45,589
one of my most successful action blocks.

836
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:53,953
And there were a lot of them throughout the entire project of Titanfall 2 that influenced

837
00:46:53,953 --> 00:47:01,136
the final design of the game in so many different ways. We had other abstract action blocks from

838
00:47:01,136 --> 00:47:06,918
all sorts of other designers. We had wall running on spinning concentric rings and

839
00:47:06,918 --> 00:47:13,281
arbitrary wall hazards. We had level experiments like deadly sludge and poisonous gas.

840
00:47:13,735 --> 00:47:16,518
We played around with core loop for mobility and combat

841
00:47:16,518 --> 00:47:19,540
exploration, and the list kind of keeps going on and on.

842
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:24,044
Directly or indirectly, all of these

843
00:47:24,044 --> 00:47:25,826
influenced the final design.

844
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:29,769
Now, this whole talk might imply that we actually

845
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:32,932
got the process right in Titanfall 2 development,

846
00:47:32,932 --> 00:47:37,496
but it was genuinely a bit more messy

847
00:47:37,496 --> 00:47:39,437
like game development always is.

848
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:44,856
And we made some mistakes in how we used action blocks.

849
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:50,840
I think I've tried to give a bit more of an idealized process

850
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,821
than what it was actually like.

851
00:47:52,821 --> 00:47:54,282
But I'm going to try to help you avoid

852
00:47:54,282 --> 00:47:54,902
some of the same pitfalls.

853
00:47:54,902 --> 00:47:57,164
So one of the things that we fell into

854
00:47:57,164 --> 00:48:00,486
was naturally just trying to make something perfect

855
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:04,108
and polished and finished.

856
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:06,229
But action blocks are supposed to be quick and dirty.

857
00:48:06,229 --> 00:48:07,470
You're supposed to get to them.

858
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:11,611
and get them done and then move on, generate more ideas

859
00:48:11,611 --> 00:48:13,472
once you've found the good gameplay.

860
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:17,774
And there is some friendly competition that goes on.

861
00:48:17,774 --> 00:48:19,715
There's a little bit of action block envy,

862
00:48:19,715 --> 00:48:23,097
especially when you see Jake's time travel action block.

863
00:48:23,097 --> 00:48:29,000
It's a thing to watch out for only in that it

864
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,762
can lead to spiraling out of control

865
00:48:31,762 --> 00:48:36,104
to the point where action blocks blow into this giant thing.

866
00:48:36,104 --> 00:48:37,265
They have to be kept.

867
00:48:37,645 --> 00:48:44,047
quick and dirty. There is definitely a problem where the action blocks can

868
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:55,229
create the impression that things are going to be easier than they are. It's a

869
00:48:55,229 --> 00:49:01,270
lot simpler to move a few pieces together and make a house than it is to

870
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,630
art and rig and animate.

871
00:49:04,388 --> 00:49:08,551
and deal with the collision on having a house in there.

872
00:49:08,551 --> 00:49:13,013
And so things like that, as part of the process of designing

873
00:49:13,013 --> 00:49:15,035
the levels, they just need to be called out.

874
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,796
And the real production cost has to come.

875
00:49:16,796 --> 00:49:20,618
And it's easy to spend a lot of time doing action blocks that

876
00:49:20,618 --> 00:49:24,100
imply a much bigger game than you actually have time to make.

877
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:24,661
We did that a little bit.

878
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:25,441
There's also a problem with

879
00:49:31,914 --> 00:49:34,816
making action blocks that are a little too abstract,

880
00:49:34,816 --> 00:49:39,058
unless you end up with a game that's a really abstract game.

881
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:41,220
Because at some point they need to be turned

882
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,721
into the real world equivalent.

883
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:45,522
Now this doesn't mean that you shouldn't

884
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:47,043
make abstract action blocks,

885
00:49:47,043 --> 00:49:50,985
just that the part of the process where you decide

886
00:49:50,985 --> 00:49:53,687
what the thing really is,

887
00:49:53,687 --> 00:49:56,669
has to happen during the level design phase.

888
00:49:56,669 --> 00:49:58,570
You don't wait till the end of the project and say,

889
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,171
hey art, make something that looks real here.

890
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,381
you figure it out while you're working on it.

891
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:08,204
And finally, action blocks are not level design.

892
00:50:08,204 --> 00:50:10,425
I personally fell into this trap a lot,

893
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:14,287
where I would do both, not only a little bit of block out,

894
00:50:14,287 --> 00:50:16,768
but a lot of block out, and then I would just kind of like

895
00:50:16,768 --> 00:50:20,871
mash action blocks in, and it ends up

896
00:50:20,871 --> 00:50:24,973
being an easy trap to fall into,

897
00:50:24,973 --> 00:50:27,034
but it's really important that action blocks

898
00:50:27,034 --> 00:50:29,655
in the gameplay prototyping are separate.

899
00:50:30,032 --> 00:50:35,273
from the actual problems of solving game flow and level design,

900
00:50:35,273 --> 00:50:37,234
and that they're not mashed together.

901
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:42,896
So we have actually formalized the process a little bit

902
00:50:42,896 --> 00:50:46,337
because of some of those problems that we had with it.

903
00:50:46,337 --> 00:50:51,199
We do use action blocks early on to find the gameplay foundation.

904
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:53,680
Sometimes we do them with no direction,

905
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,361
and sometimes we have light guidelines,

906
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:58,242
like play with titans a little bit.

907
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:02,353
We also use them to get 100% confidence in our level designs.

908
00:51:02,353 --> 00:51:05,096
We try to find the most fun gameplay,

909
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:08,359
but also make sure that we've solved the hard gameplay

910
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:11,301
problems before we commit to them in the production process.

911
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,264
And then we continue to sprinkle them out through

912
00:51:14,264 --> 00:51:17,167
as inspiration strikes.

913
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:19,529
And of course, the rest is just making games,

914
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:21,090
which is the easy part.

915
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:29,234
So I would really like to thank everybody at Respawn.

916
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:31,976
It is an incredible team of people to work with,

917
00:51:31,976 --> 00:51:35,478
and especially the design team, who

918
00:51:35,478 --> 00:51:38,420
I wish I could call out all of their individual contributions

919
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,701
to that whole process.

920
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:42,623
There are so many of them.

921
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:45,344
Additional special thanks beyond the people

922
00:51:45,344 --> 00:51:49,187
I already mentioned to Carlos Pineda, who

923
00:51:49,187 --> 00:51:52,008
helped me with the submission process for this.

924
00:51:52,561 --> 00:51:58,125
And to Rick Grubel who captured almost I think all of the video footage you saw and really just

925
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:06,191
saved my bacon. And GDC for having me and Amy Hennig for mentoring me through this process.

926
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:13,156
And finally, my daughter for her artistic contributions and my family for their love

927
00:52:13,156 --> 00:52:19,661
and support. I am Soupy. I twit relatively infrequently at Mr. Soupy. Thank you so much

928
00:52:19,661 --> 00:52:20,001
for coming.

929
00:52:30,571 --> 00:52:32,972
And I believe we do have time for questions.

930
00:52:32,972 --> 00:52:33,912
There are mics.

931
00:52:33,912 --> 00:52:37,113
Hey, I've got a question.

932
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:38,374
By the way, awesome talk.

933
00:52:38,374 --> 00:52:39,894
Thank you very much.

934
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:40,375
Thank you.

935
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:44,436
I've got a question about the production scheduling

936
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:46,697
of action blocking.

937
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:50,418
You mentioned at some point that the player interacting

938
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,439
with dynamic environment feature was not

939
00:52:52,439 --> 00:52:55,840
in the beginning of the production or in pre-production.

940
00:52:56,592 --> 00:53:03,758
I'm just wondering where, how do you reconcile the lack of gameplay features and systems

941
00:53:03,758 --> 00:53:06,320
with building prototypes that require them?

942
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:12,625
And how do you, do you assume that you will get these systems later on or like where do

943
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:16,188
you, at which point do you do these action blocks basically or do you polish them later?

944
00:53:16,188 --> 00:53:20,171
So let me see if I'm clear on this.

945
00:53:20,171 --> 00:53:24,595
Your question is about when we do, when we commit to.

946
00:53:25,751 --> 00:53:30,095
other things that we need to do for production of the game versus when do we do the action blocks

947
00:53:30,095 --> 00:53:36,840
in the production schedule? Yeah, exactly. Okay, so we try to do the action blocks, the big action

948
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:43,806
blocks very early on to get a general idea for what we wanted and so for example we knew because

949
00:53:43,806 --> 00:53:48,569
of those early action blocks that we liked platforming with moving geo but we also knew

950
00:53:48,569 --> 00:53:50,331
that we kept getting stuck in the moving geo.

951
00:53:50,903 --> 00:53:55,427
So, one of the earliest code schedules, because we knew that there was something good there,

952
00:53:55,427 --> 00:53:59,471
one of the earliest code features was, okay, let's make that.

953
00:53:59,471 --> 00:54:03,735
And we use that to sort of imply what we're going to do later.

954
00:54:03,735 --> 00:54:08,259
And then as the project goes on, we tend to be just a bit more aware of what we have the

955
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:10,801
time to maybe add in as a code feature.

956
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:18,953
Versus you know what we should be prototyping with action blocks and we tend to be a little bit more selective about prototyping action blocks

957
00:54:18,953 --> 00:54:22,856
It'll represent gameplay that we can actually make in the time that we have left

958
00:54:22,856 --> 00:54:23,717
All right, thank you

959
00:54:23,717 --> 00:54:30,342
So you stop action blocking like in the beginning and just don't come back to it later on you just use whatever was there

960
00:54:30,342 --> 00:54:36,287
We'll use it what we do action when we do action blocks for levels throughout development

961
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,382
We'll use it more in the context of the tech and the features

962
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:42,023
that we know are going to be coming online

963
00:54:42,023 --> 00:54:43,384
or that we have online.

964
00:54:43,384 --> 00:54:44,844
So we still will do action blocks,

965
00:54:44,844 --> 00:54:46,285
but they're more limited in scope

966
00:54:46,285 --> 00:54:48,306
to what we can reasonably make.

967
00:54:48,306 --> 00:54:48,847
OK, thank you.

968
00:54:48,847 --> 00:54:51,048
You're welcome.

969
00:54:51,048 --> 00:54:54,310
Hi, a bit of a similar question.

970
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,172
In your first round of action blocking,

971
00:54:57,172 --> 00:55:00,433
it sounds like you had a leg up because you

972
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:01,474
were making number two.

973
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:02,595
So you already had your.

974
00:55:02,868 --> 00:55:05,889
traversal mechanics and your metrics.

975
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:09,410
So how would you approach doing the first round

976
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,291
of Action Block if you're working on a new IP?

977
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:17,753
Yeah, so the question is how would you approach

978
00:55:17,753 --> 00:55:21,975
doing Action Block on a new IP where we really didn't have,

979
00:55:21,975 --> 00:55:23,615
where you don't really have anything?

980
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:29,837
I think I would take more of an approach

981
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:31,098
from like a game jam.

982
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:33,315
perspective so.

983
00:55:33,315 --> 00:55:47,060
And that was a little bit similar like there were we did have experiences that were kind of like that during Titanfall one development and that's where some of our first game play John Haggerty would.

984
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:54,503
Made all the moving geo he made the first like wall running and double jumping stuff in source and some of that was just.

985
00:55:54,503 --> 00:55:59,385
Coming up with the idea and then in a similar way making it work as quickly as you can.

986
00:56:00,142 --> 00:56:04,704
The problem there, of course, is that you have so much more of a broader place.

987
00:56:04,704 --> 00:56:11,247
And so I think there, it's important to have the step before then, which is to just do

988
00:56:11,247 --> 00:56:15,770
a little bit of that talking about and pitching ideas and coming up with potential games that

989
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:20,172
you want to make so that you know what the first set of things you want to experiment

990
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:21,193
with are.

991
00:56:21,193 --> 00:56:24,574
And then treating it a bit more like a game jam where it's, okay, what are we going to

992
00:56:24,574 --> 00:56:25,355
figure out with this?

993
00:56:25,355 --> 00:56:26,235
Okay.

994
00:56:26,235 --> 00:56:26,996
Thank you.

995
00:56:26,996 --> 00:56:27,456
Welcome.

996
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,853
So this is a bit of a follow-on question to contextualness,

997
00:56:31,853 --> 00:56:33,634
but you mentioned the, like for instance,

998
00:56:33,634 --> 00:56:35,436
the prototype that you were working with,

999
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:36,957
with the building house and everything,

1000
00:56:36,957 --> 00:56:38,838
and obviously that has quite a tie

1001
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:39,999
into the environment that you're going through,

1002
00:56:39,999 --> 00:56:42,602
and I was wondering if you're mindful of the narrative

1003
00:56:42,602 --> 00:56:43,662
that you already have at that stage,

1004
00:56:43,662 --> 00:56:45,424
are you thinking about that specifically,

1005
00:56:45,424 --> 00:56:48,186
or are you trying to not think about that

1006
00:56:48,186 --> 00:56:49,667
and then shape that later?

1007
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,869
I'm wondering where the narrative sort of flows

1008
00:56:51,869 --> 00:56:54,511
into the types of prototypes you're coming up with.

1009
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,813
Are you asking about the narrative of the entire game,

1010
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,675
or the narrative of like a specific level?

1011
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,495
Well, you had a specific script for what the pilot does

1012
00:57:01,495 --> 00:57:03,476
and the environment they go through

1013
00:57:03,476 --> 00:57:05,598
at this particular stage, but was that,

1014
00:57:05,598 --> 00:57:07,079
it was loose enough that it could fit

1015
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:09,561
into any particular environment, or?

1016
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:13,104
No, that was actually more specific in that case

1017
00:57:13,104 --> 00:57:15,385
to the way that that level was being designed,

1018
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:18,708
and some of that was because in this particular case,

1019
00:57:18,708 --> 00:57:22,310
we were doing the action blocks alongside

1020
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,032
trying to come up with the level and the story

1021
00:57:24,032 --> 00:57:25,953
and the beats and what the tone was gonna be for the level.

1022
00:57:25,953 --> 00:57:26,113
In...

1023
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:32,672
you know since then the way that we've tried to refine and formalize the

1024
00:57:32,672 --> 00:57:37,556
process is to do the action blocks kind of before

1025
00:57:37,556 --> 00:57:40,698
with only a rough rough sense for what the

1026
00:57:40,698 --> 00:57:44,341
beats are going to be so you know when you're doing the brainstorming come up

1027
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:47,083
with the this is what i think the level is going to be

1028
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:51,906
and then uh based on that go oh this would be an

1029
00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:54,769
interesting place to play this would be an interesting place to play and go in

1030
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,771
and start doing more specific action blocking

1031
00:57:58,302 --> 00:58:01,044
around figuring out what that gameplay is going to be.

1032
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:04,887
But the actual level design as it was described,

1033
00:58:04,887 --> 00:58:07,910
it was aware of what those action blocks were

1034
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:08,950
and some of that prototyping

1035
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,332
and all that kind of discussion that went on with it.

1036
00:58:11,332 --> 00:58:12,853
Cool, okay thanks.

1037
00:58:12,853 --> 00:58:13,374
Yep.

1038
00:58:13,374 --> 00:58:17,076
I was just wondering how you would apply action blocks

1039
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,398
to something like an indie group

1040
00:58:19,398 --> 00:58:23,841
that had maybe up to five to 10 people

1041
00:58:23,841 --> 00:58:26,644
as opposed to a very large company

1042
00:58:26,644 --> 00:58:28,045
like Respawn Entertainment.

1043
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:36,112
Hmm, how to apply action blocks to a smaller indie group.

1044
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:44,276
I feel like the biggest difference is in what happens

1045
00:58:44,276 --> 00:58:47,258
after having done the prototyping phase

1046
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:51,660
and how you transition from that to full production.

1047
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,221
And in some ways taking that into account

1048
00:58:54,221 --> 00:58:57,283
when making the decisions about what to go forward with.

1049
00:58:57,713 --> 00:59:01,315
So with a bigger company like Respawn,

1050
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:08,459
where we have fairly big animation and art department

1051
00:59:08,459 --> 00:59:11,381
and they're really good and you can kind of say,

1052
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,302
all right, we need all of this.

1053
00:59:14,302 --> 00:59:15,923
It's a little bit easier to say,

1054
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:19,485
these are all the pieces that we wanna have

1055
00:59:19,485 --> 00:59:20,706
and kind of try to do everything.

1056
00:59:20,706 --> 00:59:23,267
And I think, I would think with a smaller group,

1057
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:25,068
you'd get the same benefit of.

1058
00:59:25,414 --> 00:59:28,315
finding out what the gameplay was that was going to work,

1059
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:31,275
but then have to be a lot more diligent

1060
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:35,616
about what in production you decided to focus on

1061
00:59:35,616 --> 00:59:38,257
and what you actually had the time to take from it.

1062
00:59:38,257 --> 00:59:40,818
Because, and I didn't even get close to this,

1063
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:43,298
like I showed the grid of 45 action blocks,

1064
00:59:43,298 --> 00:59:46,359
like there were probably 200 by the time we shipped the game

1065
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:48,719
and it was way more than we could actually,

1066
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,200
we could make in the time that we had by a large amount.

1067
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:57,651
And part of the process, which I don't think we respected as much on this project, was that step

1068
00:59:57,651 --> 01:00:03,234
of saying, here are a bunch of good ideas. Let's decide on only the ones that we have time to make.

1069
01:00:03,234 --> 01:00:07,757
And I think the big difference would just be would be in being how selective that would have to be,

1070
01:00:07,757 --> 01:00:10,879
and at what point you'd need to cut off and decide. Thank you. Welcome.

1071
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,959
And I think we are now done. So thank you all very much.
