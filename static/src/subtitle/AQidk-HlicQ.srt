00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:11,038
Hello there, I am Kelly Wallach, the CEO and founder of the Indie Mega Booth,

2
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:15,521
the chairperson for the Independent Games Festival and community builder for the OneUp Fund.

3
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:20,384
And this is the Hades fireside chat with Amir,

4
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:22,926
the studio director of Supergiant Games.

5
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:25,968
So I want to welcome Amir to our virtual stage.

6
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:32,108
Hello, I'm Amir Rao. I'm the Studio Director of Supergiant Games. I've worked on all our games,

7
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:35,809
Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades, which is the game we'll be talking about today.

8
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:43,752
At Supergiant, I coordinate our work and I do game design. So I'm one of the designers who

9
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:49,535
is responsible for tuning various parts of the game and making sure that the game is coming

10
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:49,815
together.

11
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:53,197
Yeah, I'm excited to talk about our experience making Hades.

12
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:56,138
I'm excited to be back at GDC in some form.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,700
I know.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,502
Yeah, I've always loved this conference.

15
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:04,984
I was a conference associate in like 2004

16
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:09,046
or something like that as a volunteer for GDC.

17
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,668
So it's really, really cool to be back here

18
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:14,789
and to be speaking at it.

19
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,991
I think the last time I spoke at GDC

20
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:18,271
was at the failure workshop.

21
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:19,932
So this is like pretty good.

22
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:23,103
pretty good gap between that.

23
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:24,464
We were talking about Bastion actually.

24
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:27,006
I believe that was the last time I spoke at least.

25
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,288
So yeah, that was a long time ago.

26
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,530
My impression was Bastion was not a failure.

27
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,692
So I don't know what the workshop was about.

28
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:36,593
Yeah, well, you know,

29
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,014
the failure workshop is really interesting.

30
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:41,196
It was actually talking about mechanics that didn't work.

31
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,677
And one of the mechanics that didn't work in Bastion was.

32
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:48,138
we had this whole gardening game inside of Bastion

33
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:49,119
that really didn't work.

34
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,741
And so it was discussion of the things

35
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:54,765
that didn't really pan out inside that game,

36
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:57,128
even though the game came together pretty well.

37
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:58,870
Actually, yesterday was the 10 year anniversary

38
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,591
of Bastion coming out.

39
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:02,034
So that was exciting too.

40
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:04,036
So it's a lot of exciting stuff happening.

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,581
Yeah, one of my favorite kind of, um, I don't know, super giant connection

42
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:13,822
stories for me as I actually still have the bastion, um, bandana that you guys

43
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,983
were giving out and I don't even know what conference that was.

44
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:17,703
I feel like that was the first time.

45
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:22,165
PAX in 2011, I think before the game came out.

46
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:22,785
Yeah.

47
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:23,565
9 million years ago.

48
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:23,665
Yeah.

49
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:27,966
Yeah, it was, it was, uh, the, yeah, the show floor was a little

50
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:29,087
different than it was PAX East.

51
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:29,547
Yeah.

52
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,848
It was, it was exciting to, to see those everywhere.

53
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:35,326
Yeah, a lot has happened since then.

54
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:41,748
And yeah, so I mean, I've known you and most folks on the team since since those days.

55
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:44,148
And I think we're talking a little bit about this.

56
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:47,770
So part of my homework for this is I watched the entire Noclip documentary,

57
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,210
which is amazing, by the way, if you have an extra five hours

58
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,391
and you really want to hear a lot of things about Supergiant and game development,

59
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:55,152
I'm like, total thumbs up on it.

60
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,032
I highly recommend it.

61
00:02:56,772 --> 00:03:00,233
But it was like a very interesting insight after knowing all of you for so long

62
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:02,994
and through so many different like games and iterations of.

63
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:05,495
not so much the studio,

64
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:07,516
cause a lot of the core components of the studio

65
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:08,096
stayed the same,

66
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:10,017
but just like to kind of be along on that journey

67
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,098
and then like kind of see this like climax

68
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,379
of how well Hades has done and been received

69
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,619
was like very, very cool.

70
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,060
So as a friend situation,

71
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,221
I'm like super happy for all of you.

72
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:22,642
And I'm really excited to see that.

73
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:23,682
Well, thank you.

74
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:27,144
Yeah, we are over just over the moon with the success

75
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,425
and the reception of Hades.

76
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,866
And it's one of those things where...

77
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:38,968
Uh, we, you know, we did not know to expect that, um, but it's, you know,

78
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:42,156
it's, it's been wonderful to see so many people, uh, love the game so much.

79
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,872
Yeah, the reactions and the documentary to you all, especially watching the Game Awards thing.

80
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:51,555
And now I can see why you like Jeff Keighley so much, just in general. It's just like a cool

81
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:56,779
situation. There's like this thread, you know, throughout. He's a very hard worker. Yeah. I mean,

82
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,665
the way he puts together a lot of that stuff, it just takes so much. So yeah, I've always been a

83
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:07,928
fan of the way he conducts himself and the way he puts those events together.

84
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:11,669
Yeah, but like watching the reaction of the team, you know, as they're like announcing

85
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:16,531
everyone's on Zoom, of course, because it's pandemic time and like, and also to like the

86
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:22,073
games you're up like nominated against was like legit. Yeah, I mean, not that Hades isn't a

87
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:26,675
legit game, but like, that was an impressive lineup to be up against as well too.

88
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:31,356
Yeah, we I mean, we're actually lucky. We're nominated for six awards in tonight's show

89
00:04:31,956 --> 00:04:36,018
for the Game Developers Choice Awards. So that'll be that'll be really exciting as well. We

90
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:44,771
I think we won a Game Developers Choice Award for best debut in 2012 for Bastion.

91
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:50,014
So you know, the whole group of people who worked on that game is still working together

92
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:51,475
at Supergiant Games today.

93
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:59,659
And so, you know, we just feel really lucky to have been able to keep doing the work through

94
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,181
everything through several games through the last year and all that kind of stuff.

95
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:05,590
Yeah, I mean, I think it's incredible.

96
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,956
And, you know, one of the things that I had realized with the documentary is like,

97
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:11,739
I didn't realize how early Jen was on the team.

98
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,425
Cause I feel like she's like a little bit enigmatic in the sense of like, you know,

99
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:18,750
I don't really like hang out, like see her at conferences and stuff, but like.

100
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:21,532
She was in pretty early, right?

101
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:24,495
Yeah, Jen is one who prefers to speak with her work,

102
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:25,836
and her work is incredible.

103
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:27,757
Her work speaks very loudly, so I think it's fine.

104
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:28,358
Yeah, yeah.

105
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,740
So Jen Z is the art director for Supergiant Games.

106
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,761
She came up with all the character designs

107
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:35,163
and obviously a lot of the art direction, art style,

108
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:38,066
a lot of the execution of specific assets in the game.

109
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:41,789
Just has her hands in everything related to the art that we do.

110
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,790
Yeah, Jen is incredible.

111
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,573
There's like, I think the shocking thing about

112
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:53,158
a talent like Jen. And, and this is true of almost, um,

113
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,940
I say almost, cause I don't want to include myself in such a statement, um,

114
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,722
but of everyone I work with, um, is, uh, you know, I sort of,

115
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:04,783
when you have a game like bastion come out and you have a lot of people love it

116
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:07,624
in your first game, um, I think, you know,

117
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:12,866
a lot of us would have been right in expecting that that was kind of as good as

118
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,047
it was going to get for us. Um, because, you know, we came out of nowhere,

119
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:18,068
people really liked it. Um,

120
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:26,735
It was our first effort and all that kind of stuff, but like the crazy thing about Jen and Greg

121
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:30,137
and Darren, all these people I work with, is like somehow they get better and better and better.

122
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:34,439
And I think that's the like sort of...

123
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:40,174
joy of working with them as individuals, but also the joy of our chemistry as a group is, you know,

124
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:44,016
we have these long relationships that have gone over several games. And then for Hades,

125
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:49,138
specifically, we like added all these new voices. So we were 12 people for a really long time,

126
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,739
for about five years before.

127
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,774
making Hades and over the course of Hades, we grew to around 20 people,

128
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:57,494
um, a little under 20.

129
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:02,757
And so, um, you know, we've added all these new voices who are integral to,

130
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,998
to the stuff we've been making.

131
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:08,940
And, um, we're just so important to, to making Hades, uh, the game it was.

132
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:13,507
Yeah, and that kind of answers a little bit of like one of my, I guess, first official questions,

133
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:17,169
which I was like live journaling my thoughts while I was watching this documentary.

134
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,211
It's like, why is Jen so amazing?

135
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:24,555
Like that, that scene where the concept art for chaos comes up, I was like,

136
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,696
like, oh my God, so good.

137
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:28,958
Yeah. And I'm like, why is she so great?

138
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:29,838
Like, how did that happen?

139
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:35,052
Yeah, it's just one of those things, you know, even when you work with her, you know, she's like

140
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:39,933
really, really amazing to talk to and collaborate with. And she's very articulate about what she's

141
00:07:39,953 --> 00:07:44,714
trying to do. But then there's this whole invisible process where the art is made,

142
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:50,195
or even sometimes it's happening, you know, a couple seats over and you still, you know, it's

143
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:55,476
just, it's always shocking and surprising to see what will be done with it. That's another, that's

144
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:59,517
another part of about working on a team that I feel really, really good about is.

145
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,061
there's a lot of like elevation of each other's work. So, um,

146
00:08:05,282 --> 00:08:05,542
you know,

147
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:08,804
you know that the various parts of the pieces that other people are working on

148
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:10,984
are going to, are going to kind of like raise what you do. Um,

149
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:14,986
so even if what you do is still kind of feeling like a work in progress and that

150
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:17,847
happens a lot on the design side, um, you know, like, Hey,

151
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,428
when this gets good feedback, when this gets,

152
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:22,929
when this gets like a theme, when it starts to make sense, when it,

153
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,571
when it gets narrative and voiceover and music and all these different pieces,

154
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:28,532
um, it's gonna, it's gonna,

155
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,792
be different than the experience you normally have,

156
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:34,173
which is, you know, early games are pretty rough,

157
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:35,674
even Hades was.

158
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:39,176
So, I think, you know,

159
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:42,458
you can only do this for a really long time

160
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:43,939
if you're constantly being surprised

161
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:46,780
by the work of your peers and learning from them.

162
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,182
And so we're lucky to be able to have both.

163
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,863
Yeah, and you know, I think that it seems like,

164
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:53,064
like you said, the kind of core team

165
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:54,825
of the folks who had worked on Bastion have been there.

166
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,801
for a while and like I said, you know, I've interacted with all of you over time as well

167
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:04,102
too and seeing the work that you're doing, but you know, seeing like Darren work on music and

168
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:09,703
all that it just is like, yeah, it's pretty, I don't want to say like mind-blowing, but it's

169
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:14,164
really fascinating on like how much and how detailed and how far in you can tell that he's

170
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:18,605
like really gone and thought about this stuff and I think, you know, for me too, like art and music

171
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:22,986
are things that I love but I'm not particularly talented at, so every time that I see people do

172
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:23,767
them I'm just like...

173
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,342
you know, like how on earth did that happen?

174
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:27,822
You know?

175
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:30,765
And I think that that, you know,

176
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:33,308
that growth and that change and, you know,

177
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:35,790
with the audio and with Darren's work is really cool.

178
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,352
But then also like how he's explaining

179
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:38,193
that he's working on it.

180
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,654
Like there was a quote where he was just like,

181
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:41,416
I want it to sound rad when you fight a Minotaur.

182
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,603
to go into writing a song, right?

183
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:45,423
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,545
No, it's getting on the same page.

185
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:50,147
I mean, so yeah, Darren, you know, it's still,

186
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:55,171
it's still shocking when you hear the work

187
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:55,771
for the first time,

188
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,113
because you don't know what to expect

189
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:58,354
and it's very exciting.

190
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:00,475
Him and Greg work really closely on the audio stuff.

191
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:03,458
And in fact, him and Greg are giving a talk right now.

192
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,621
So if you've made the mistake of coming to this Hades conversation, instead of the one

193
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:13,745
about how they did all the voiceover, don't despair because like they are, I think you

194
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:15,165
can still rewatch it later.

195
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,107
But they, they're talking about the process.

196
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:18,388
Or flip back and forth between the two talks.

197
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,769
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you can flip back and forth.

198
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,532
But you know, Greg and Darren collaborate really closely on the audio experience and

199
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:28,014
Darren of course executes so, so much of it.

200
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:29,075
And Darren also.

201
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:33,765
did all the voice direction and he was the voice of Zagreus in the game.

202
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,787
So, um, he, that was surreal.

203
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:36,788
That was very strange.

204
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:40,431
So I, I kind of always get a little weirded out when I see people actually doing

205
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,633
like voiceovers, like cartoon characters and stuff too.

206
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:43,674
I'm like, that's not what you look like.

207
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:44,215
Yeah.

208
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:44,575
Yeah.

209
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:46,057
It's pretty, it's pretty shocking there.

210
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:46,417
There.

211
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,719
Um, yeah, he's just an enormous talent.

212
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,401
So it's, it's been awesome to work with him.

213
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,863
And I've known him since I was like eight years old or something too.

214
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,945
So that, that luck too.

215
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:59,694
Yeah, which is I also really love that, that it was just like, you know, a friendship relationship

216
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:04,415
that kind of blossomed into this professional relationship as opposed to like somebody,

217
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:08,937
you know, coming in, you know, to someone outside of games and that kind of perspective

218
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:12,858
and stuff as well, too, I think is really interesting. But then you have someone like

219
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:16,679
Greg, who, you know, is like, been very deeply involved in games for a long time. And

220
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,377
you know, I think even though I feel like I'm just like gushing about everyone on your team,

221
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:26,639
you know, I think that what is like this, this thread to me is this really like very high level

222
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:33,441
of thoughtfulness and like contemplation and like research and the kind of like stewing of ideas

223
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:38,643
and concepts. And I felt like that really came out a lot, like through that, that side of it,

224
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:44,045
you know, like the music, the art and the, the narrative component of it, like the three of

225
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:47,126
them talking about their work, like you can really tell that this is like something that they're,

226
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,186
they're really like.

227
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,441
contemplating on a pretty like interesting level.

228
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:54,622
Yeah, I mean, they are very thoughtful about it.

229
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:57,784
They're very good at discussing it

230
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:59,525
and they're very good at executing on it.

231
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:05,088
So it's one of those things where,

232
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:06,428
there's plenty that goes into it.

233
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:07,889
So I don't wanna make it sound like it's easy,

234
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,730
but they're just very,

235
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:13,732
we have the advantage of working together for so long

236
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:14,132
that like,

237
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,696
you know, we've developed a lot of shared just things,

238
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,578
shared vocabulary, shared experiences,

239
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,660
you know, a shared sense of things.

240
00:12:23,781 --> 00:12:24,982
And when we were working on Hades,

241
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:29,966
we were sort of excited to build on all our best ideas

242
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:31,347
from our previous games,

243
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:34,169
which was like a really different mindset

244
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:36,491
than we used before, because, you know, when we...

245
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:42,118
When we went from Bastion to Transistor, we thought, you know, we need to make something new and original.

246
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:43,519
We want to make something new and original.

247
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:50,468
And so we're going to spend a bunch of time figuring out a new original world, which meant like a lot of the great ideas of Bastion, we felt were sort of off limits.

248
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,370
You know, like we shouldn't use those.

249
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,133
Those are Bastion's thing and Transistor needs its own thing.

250
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:56,034
And so, um.

251
00:12:57,213 --> 00:12:58,673
With Hades, it was a little less like that.

252
00:12:58,713 --> 00:12:59,553
We had made three games.

253
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:01,334
We were interested in doing something

254
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:02,854
in the roguelike genre,

255
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:04,375
and we wanted to do something more narrative.

256
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:08,716
And so we just, we sort of allowed ourself

257
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:12,697
the space to use stuff that had worked for us in the past

258
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:13,417
to build on them.

259
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,498
And also, you know, that just is enhanced by the chemistry,

260
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:20,159
the fact that it's the same people working on that stuff.

261
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,179
So we knew what the problems were

262
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,340
with our previous versions of those,

263
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,320
or we knew what was new about what we were trying to do.

264
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:33,217
Um, and, um, and so, yeah, so, so in a lot of ways, Hades is like an expression

265
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:41,340
of, of our strengths as a team and also our, um, I guess our strengths as, as

266
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,942
collaborators, you know, this is like the stuff we know we do well, actually

267
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:46,282
together, not just individually.

268
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:52,485
It's like, this is the stuff that we can really, really do, um, uh, at a level

269
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:54,206
that we can, we can feel satisfied with.

270
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:55,626
Um, so yeah, just.

271
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,372
lucky to work with them.

272
00:13:58,235 --> 00:13:59,679
Yeah, and I mean, I think that that

273
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:07,269
You know how you're saying that it's kind of like a progression of all of the different games and you all like working together.

274
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:10,111
Yeah, I think that that also, to me, ties in a bit, too.

275
00:14:10,171 --> 00:14:15,336
There's a point a point where you talked about how you all toil, like kind of toil on games for a long time.

276
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:20,661
And I want to get into talking a little bit about like the kind of all encompassing nature of doing a project like this.

277
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:26,406
But, you know, the time frames that you're talking about, you're like, OK, you know, we like toil on a game for like three or four years.

278
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,973
which is a long amount of time,

279
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,874
you know, like I guess just in general,

280
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:32,756
I mean, not relative to all of time and space,

281
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,717
you know, but it is like a long time,

282
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:35,958
but also in like game development,

283
00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:37,820
it's kind of not actually a long time.

284
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,982
And especially I think for smaller teams

285
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:40,882
and indie developers,

286
00:14:40,902 --> 00:14:43,004
like projects can go on way longer than you're imagining

287
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:45,546
just because of constraints and team size

288
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:46,247
and things like that.

289
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,168
And I do think that one of the things

290
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,269
that is very interesting

291
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:52,311
from other developers and studios standpoint

292
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:53,653
is that you are pretty consistent

293
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:54,793
with like every couple of years,

294
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:55,434
there is like...

295
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:59,934
a new game that has come out that is fully fleshed out and thought out and,

296
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:02,855
you know, and there's all these different components and stuff to it.

297
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:07,037
And so I actually kind of wanted to like, hear you talk a little bit, uh, you know,

298
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,799
about that, because I think even though it feels like a long time and maybe it

299
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:13,401
doesn't feel so consistent, I think out of a lot of studios, you actually are

300
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:17,983
fairly consistent and fairly like, kind of like quick in a way, um, process.

301
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:19,164
Yeah.

302
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:23,526
I, so, um, I, I feel like, um,

303
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:28,575
Part of the, so we're consistent, I think for two,

304
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:32,039
consistent in terms of like how our output for two reasons.

305
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:35,403
One is dispositionally as people who work together,

306
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:36,264
we like want to.

307
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:40,145
work on stuff, scope it down and finish it.

308
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:43,789
That is like sort of like the simple way of saying it.

309
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:45,851
Like we share this disposition.

310
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:51,195
It, we have, we are always refining the thing we're doing.

311
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:54,118
And the reason we do that in a way that works

312
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:56,640
across the board is we have this like,

313
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:00,284
value around basically embracing constraints.

314
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:03,487
So like as a small team, you have a ton of constraints,

315
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:03,947
right?

316
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:06,389
Even big teams have constraints.

317
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,010
And so for us though,

318
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:11,013
it's really wonderful to like work within them.

319
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:12,274
Like what are the things we can do?

320
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:13,315
What are the things we can do well?

321
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:16,737
How, you know, like when do we want to do it?

322
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:18,839
And, you know, stuff like packs, for example,

323
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:21,221
in the past where we used to bring a demo to packs

324
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,182
and then go back into the lab and then release the game.

325
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:26,165
And that was the only times you'd ever see it.

326
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,781
you know, until we tried early access on Hades, those,

327
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,902
the constraint of a deadline for PACS was actually useful

328
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:37,304
because, you know, going back to the failure talk

329
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:38,624
that I referenced at the top of this,

330
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:43,786
we cut gardening from Bastion four days

331
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:46,587
before driving up to Seattle from San Francisco

332
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:49,809
because we thought this doesn't make any sense

333
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:50,569
and it doesn't work.

334
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,490
And the constraint of that

335
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:59,011
was, you know, it was a hard decision and we had been working on that part of it for over a year.

336
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:04,978
But the upside is like almost the relief of like not having to think about it anymore. It's out.

337
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,845
So, so we are very like constraint driven in, you know, as a, as a team,

338
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:15,569
we're always mindful of that. And that comes down to everything we do, even.

339
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:20,769
Like, even when we're trying a new idea, we want to see some ideas show promise,

340
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:25,374
like as, you know, quickly, which, you know, uh, really does work for some

341
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:30,499
things, like it really works for certain design ideas or certain system ideas.

342
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,344
Um, and maybe work works less well for like really big problems.

343
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:35,805
Like, um.

344
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,241
like technical problems that might take months and months and months to solve.

345
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,182
Um, and so those are examples of the types of things, like our mindset is

346
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,363
usually around, like, what are the constraints we want to know the

347
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:50,044
constraints, um, we want to know the constraints, we want to know what the

348
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:51,144
problems are, we want to solve them.

349
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:55,306
And so, uh, yeah, we, we really value them.

350
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,466
Like constraints are, are, are wonderful.

351
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:59,207
We, we always want to know what the constraints are.

352
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:03,008
Um, and that's part of being realistic with ourselves and with each other, you

353
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:06,770
know, it's the only way we can make sensible decisions.

354
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:12,385
Yeah, and you know, I have heard that that deadline kind of like an like having an external

355
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:17,811
deadline or an external thing, you know, like, you don't you can't push packs back and you can't

356
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:21,414
stop people from coming and playing the game, you know, so you kind of just like have to get it done,

357
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:26,159
I think has been helpful for a lot of teams. But now this is also kind of like leading me

358
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,183
into another question that I had. And I'm kind of wondering as like, as part of the decision.

359
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,520
to move forward with doing a game in early access

360
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,241
is to just basically have another set

361
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:36,961
of like constraints in a way.

362
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,382
You know, I hadn't really thought about it

363
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:40,102
until you had said it this way,

364
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:42,503
but is that like partially one of the factors?

365
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:44,183
Yes, it's partially one of the factors.

366
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:47,884
So the, you know, Hades was an early access game

367
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,985
before it was a Greek mythology roguelike.

368
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:51,745
Coming off of Pyre.

369
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:55,168
having worked on three games in the model of,

370
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:58,609
we work on it in secret, we like announce it,

371
00:18:58,669 --> 00:18:59,510
and then we release it.

372
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,410
And, you know, maybe a couple hundred people

373
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,170
will play it at PAX,

374
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,991
and maybe some of our friends will play it along the way.

375
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,472
Having done that so many times,

376
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,312
we were just really interested in doing a process

377
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:12,253
that was more open, more transparent,

378
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:15,173
and got us to a game faster.

379
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:18,314
And the last time we'd actually done something like that

380
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:21,595
was Bastion, because Bastion went to PAX,

381
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:22,255
I think like...

382
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:26,707
a year after it started or something like that.

383
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:28,808
It was something like that.

384
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:32,790
So yeah, it started in 2009, it went to PAX in 2010.

385
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,550
It released a year later.

386
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:37,011
So it was one of those things where

387
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:39,492
we were interested in doing that,

388
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:41,373
but we were also interested in the changes.

389
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,801
we would have to make to do that, if that makes any sense.

390
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,761
So like we would have to learn, for example,

391
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,482
how to keep a game stable over a longer period of time.

392
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:54,583
We would have to learn how to take community feedback

393
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:56,003
and integrate it into our process.

394
00:19:56,523 --> 00:20:00,144
And we would have to learn what happens

395
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:03,405
when those are the constraints and not just kind of like,

396
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:05,865
you know, the deadline of packs

397
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,985
or when we hope the game would be done

398
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:09,406
or any of those types of things.

399
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:09,806
So.

400
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:14,759
We were really interested in seeing what we would learn from such a process.

401
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,063
And we were lucky that there were so many examples,

402
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:22,927
like so many amazing examples of games that had been created in early access

403
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,891
that were huge inspirations to us.

404
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,555
Like much of the Klay catalog fits into that.

405
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:32,097
Darkest Dungeon, Subnautica.

406
00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:38,481
Larian's games, there's just so many amazing early access successes, and of course Dead

407
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:42,243
Cells by Motion Twin, which was a roguelike that they had done in early access.

408
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:48,587
Just seeing how it could be done well was inspiring as a game developer.

409
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,271
And so we wanted to see if we could do that as well.

410
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:58,834
And so, you know, the Hades was born.

411
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:06,156
the idea for Hades came out of a desire to try something in that direction.

412
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:10,739
Yeah, I think it's really interesting to hear you talk about some of the other examples of

413
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:13,721
games that have gone through early access, because I think I was talking about this yesterday,

414
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:16,062
I was like, no games go through early access. And you're like, the thing is,

415
00:21:16,082 --> 00:21:19,304
like a lot of games actually go through early access, just nobody kind of remembers that.

416
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:20,905
Yeah, they were early access games.

417
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:26,588
But I remember when Early Access first like came out and it was it was kind of like met with some

418
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:31,371
trepidation I feel like because people were just like oh I don't I don't know um but even with like

419
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:35,853
going to events and things like that like games are kind of one of the few mediums where fans get

420
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:40,095
to interact with it a lot of times while it's in progress you know like nobody's kind of watching

421
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:44,758
like an undone version of a Marvel movie or something you know and then like giving community

422
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,520
feedback on it I mean I guess aside from like a trailer.

423
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:52,117
Yeah. Or something, but you know, I think it's, it's interesting how you're talking about using

424
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:57,624
it like as a learning experience and ways for the studio to like gain, gain new skills. And

425
00:21:57,644 --> 00:22:03,030
I think you had mentioned too about like kind of practicing some parts of it. Yeah, we,

426
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,694
we actually rehearsed it. So before our initial launch in 2018,

427
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:15,156
We shipped three one month updates to ourselves, basically.

428
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:18,798
So we didn't do like the marketing art necessarily and stuff,

429
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:21,039
but we tried to like do a lot of the parts.

430
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,520
Like let's like, what would we call this thing?

431
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,301
This update, this last thing, like what does it look,

432
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:28,482
what does the contour of a four week cycle look like

433
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:31,523
compared to, you know, a three year cycle,

434
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:33,164
which is what we're used to before.

435
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:33,244
And,

436
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:39,627
Rehearsing it was awesome because it gave us the sense

437
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,088
that we were ready for the real thing.

438
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:43,889
It's a very smart idea.

439
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,250
Yeah, and then the real thing happens.

440
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,152
And then, you know, like an example of a change

441
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:50,833
we made really early on in our early access,

442
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:53,734
we went from four week updates, you know,

443
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:56,456
update every four weeks to an update closer to every,

444
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:58,176
it was more like eight to 10.

445
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:00,385
And we tried different things.

446
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:01,766
We tried four, then we tried eight,

447
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:02,826
then we did five again,

448
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:04,647
and then we went back to eight to 10.

449
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:07,808
And, you know, one of the things you can learn

450
00:23:07,828 --> 00:23:10,989
in your early access is like how to do your early access.

451
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:14,851
You know, we learned a lot from those first two or three,

452
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:21,373
one month updates that got us realizing like,

453
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:23,894
hey, we could, what the game needs now

454
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:25,875
is like longer updates with more time.

455
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:29,406
our development director and the co-founder of Supergiant,

456
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:32,808
Gavin Simon, actually architected the rhythm

457
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:34,268
that we worked under.

458
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,090
And it was, you know, and we stuck to it.

459
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,051
You talk about constraints.

460
00:23:38,611 --> 00:23:42,213
We did features for two and a half weeks,

461
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,514
two and a half to three weeks,

462
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:45,115
if you include the time to plan the update.

463
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:46,215
Then.

464
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:49,218
If a feature wasn't done, it did not graduate.

465
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,740
Like if there was still work left on it to even stand it up,

466
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,100
then we couldn't move it forward.

467
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,801
Then we did content for several weeks.

468
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:58,402
And then the last couple of weeks were polish.

469
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:03,064
And in the polish phase, a small, a small group of people inside the

470
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:07,206
community got to play it and then it would go out, um, it would go out.

471
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:10,247
And, you know, we also had an internal QA resources and stuff.

472
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:13,008
So, um, that we're vetting the update as we were making it.

473
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:14,667
and we would play it.

474
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,948
So it was one of those things where, you know,

475
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:19,608
it gave a rhythm to the whole process

476
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:23,569
that we got quite comfortable with over time.

477
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,030
Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,111
And I think there was a part in the documentary

479
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:29,751
where Greg was talking about kind of the thought

480
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:32,232
and the rationale behind the way that you also approach

481
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:33,893
doing early access or kind of having like

482
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:37,434
multiple early accesses, I guess, you know,

483
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:40,134
and then leading into the Steam Launch, you know,

484
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:40,414
which is,

485
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:46,140
where there's a larger part of your fan base and things like that.

486
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,623
And I think I've mentioned to you this a few times before,

487
00:24:48,643 --> 00:24:52,226
but I feel like talking with you and hearing about how Supergiant runs is like when you

488
00:24:52,246 --> 00:24:55,009
talk to someone who's just in a really good functioning marriage and you're like,

489
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:56,511
oh yeah, of course, that's how you would do that.

490
00:24:57,352 --> 00:25:02,037
Of course you should practice a little bit of early access before you go and do early access.

491
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:06,461
Totally one and I think of that and honestly did not think of it, you know, I just I think it's

492
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:11,065
it's kind of a testament to the way that you all think about it and work together to really be like

493
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:16,631
kind of very like practical, but innovative at the same time around like how you're approaching

494
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:20,014
a change or a shift or something new with the studio.

495
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:26,471
Yeah, I mean, for us, it's the, you know, we, uh, the, the two things to say there is just,

496
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:31,414
we didn't, we didn't invent that process. Right. So we could see, we could see so many people do

497
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:36,417
it so well. So that was the first thing, you know, and we saw, you know, really specific things we

498
00:25:36,457 --> 00:25:42,860
did. We saw other people do like, for example, um, the countdown clock to the next update that

499
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,763
was inside the main menu is something that Clay had been doing for a long time. The, um,

500
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:52,232
marking inside your patch notes which pieces of it were inspired by community feedback,

501
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:55,993
something we saw dead cells do. And you know, it's one of those things where you see these

502
00:25:56,013 --> 00:26:01,695
specific practices and you go, I see what that does. It shows honestly and truthfully,

503
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:08,017
you know, which changes kind of came from people's experience with the game that you as developers

504
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:12,759
were not always having, because especially with a roguelike game, you can't experience all of it.

505
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:17,020
And as a developer, it's really hard to experience your game like a player might.

506
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,680
And so

507
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:25,408
All of these things kind of came together to make that like a functional process for us.

508
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:26,749
You know, we didn't have to make it up.

509
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:33,836
But I mean, I think the other thing about it is that, you know, if you have like a learning orientation,

510
00:26:34,517 --> 00:26:39,562
then you can, as a group, know that part of what you're doing it for is not.

511
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:46,550
for it to be perfect, but for, for you to learn something from the process of doing it.

512
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,753
And then the output can be the learning, even if it doesn't always go well, even if every update

513
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:57,716
isn't always like a slam dunk or whatever. And we can do that because we have the privilege

514
00:26:58,036 --> 00:27:02,899
and good fortune of self-funding our titles of owning our own IP and all this kind of stuff. So

515
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:03,840
you know, uh,

516
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:08,052
you know, like a question you did not ask is like,

517
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:09,333
why doesn't everyone just practice?

518
00:27:09,353 --> 00:27:10,634
It's because everyone has different constraints

519
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:11,815
than the ones we have, right?

520
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:15,878
And so we're really lucky that our first game enabled us

521
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:20,322
to essentially choose our own destiny

522
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,623
in a lot of these ways

523
00:27:23,364 --> 00:27:25,466
and to basically have the flexibility

524
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:27,487
to make these types of decisions

525
00:27:27,507 --> 00:27:28,348
that work well for our team.

526
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:29,469
Yeah, yeah.

527
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:30,830
And I think that that's really interesting

528
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,991
to point out too, as well too,

529
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:33,792
like going into these projects with like,

530
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:38,768
a curiosity and like beginner's mindset, you know, because then you're kind of less attached

531
00:27:38,788 --> 00:27:41,689
to it like, okay, it has to definitely look like this, or it has to come out on this day,

532
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:46,010
or it has to be this thing. And so it can be rewarding, even when it's not exactly the

533
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:51,171
way that you're imagining it would be. And another thing I'd like to kind of highlight

534
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:55,012
and there as well, too, is I think that this is not totally unique to the indie community,

535
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:59,433
but I do love this about it, that it's it's very kind of collaborative across studios

536
00:27:59,473 --> 00:28:00,113
and across

537
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:03,797
like leaders and developers and people and even something like GDC, you know,

538
00:28:03,837 --> 00:28:06,225
to come and share like the insights that you learn.

539
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:07,209
Cause it's this kind of like.

540
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:11,474
it's not so much a competition as it is like the rising tide floats all boats

541
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:16,018
um kind of situation and you know there's always people kind of paving the way and trying new

542
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:20,381
things and then when they're willing to share like what worked for them and what didn't what

543
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:24,604
didn't work um you know i think it can benefit everybody because like you said you know a lot

544
00:28:24,644 --> 00:28:28,887
of these things were not like the first time that they had ever been done but they have been done

545
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:32,149
the first time by someone yeah no for sure and you know we we

546
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:37,189
the people I mentioned, the studios I mentioned, we talked to all those people.

547
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:44,617
Like we didn't just get inspired by them, we like went to the primary source for a lot of that

548
00:28:44,677 --> 00:28:50,804
because you know another thing that we're fortunate to be able to do but it's one of those things where

549
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:57,478
I guess for whatever reason, you know, I think I feel like a lot of,

550
00:28:57,498 --> 00:29:00,701
a lot of development on small teams is like people racing against their own

551
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:03,983
best time. You're not really like trying to like destroy the other one or

552
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:08,246
whatever. So, um, it's, it's, it's, it's really, uh,

553
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:11,288
it's really like sort of fortunate that you can have those types of

554
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:15,771
conversations and, and, and ask, you know, like what, how,

555
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:17,892
how might I do this? Am I thinking about this? Right.

556
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:21,635
Are we thinking about this? Right. Um, like, um, that's, that's, uh,

557
00:29:21,835 --> 00:29:23,076
we have the good fortune to be able to do that.

558
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:26,114
Yeah. And then, you know, the amazing outcome or hopefully, you know,

559
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:27,834
the outcome of, of that kind,

560
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:30,996
those kinds of conversations and that kind of work is that like the games are

561
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:33,858
all cooler, right? Hopefully like, you know,

562
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,398
the fans are getting the best of this. It's like,

563
00:29:35,438 --> 00:29:36,979
everybody's mind sharing on like, how do we,

564
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,541
how do we make like this experience in these games?

565
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,822
Just like the coolest things that they can be possible.

566
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:44,863
So people enjoy them and play them and have fun, you know?

567
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:47,725
Yeah. Yeah. And you know, especially when it comes to something like a,

568
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:51,527
like a process, right? Like production process,

569
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:55,338
at the scale of smaller teams is like pretty different,

570
00:29:55,518 --> 00:30:00,142
right, than it is for like a much bigger team.

571
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:02,864
And so a lot of what...

572
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:07,509
a lot of what's interesting to talk about is like, what's your process?

573
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:09,689
Because I think sort of what you're actually asking is like,

574
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:13,570
how do your people work together in a functional way?

575
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,751
Like, what is the way in which your group does this?

576
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,092
Like, how are you thinking about this?

577
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:21,793
And so, you know, we're always thinking about that, too.

578
00:30:21,813 --> 00:30:22,733
How do we work together better?

579
00:30:23,893 --> 00:30:24,233
How do we

580
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:27,554
how do we make it make it?

581
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:31,755
Yeah. Make it work for each part of the process that we're in. Yeah.

582
00:30:32,578 --> 00:30:37,862
Yeah, and I think there's kind of like two sort of like branches of this part of the conversation that I'm interested in.

583
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,704
You know, one we talked a little bit about before is the kind of like.

584
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:46,768
I think the documentary did a good job of putting this forward is like how all encompassing

585
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:50,650
working on a project like this is, especially as a small team like like.

586
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:55,513
I mean, can you even imagine the number of times you said the word Hades in the last like four years?

587
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:59,456
You know, like how many times you've seen that logo or how many times you talked about.

588
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:26,250
something about Hades or thought about Hades and like, you know, it was one of the things when I was watching that I was, I was kind of missing a bit about working on my own projects is like, oh yeah, there's this thing where at some point it's not like it takes over your entire existence, you know, some people, some people have that it seems like you all have a good like work life balance, but it is this thing where it's just like it kind of gets into like your DNA or something at some point, you know, and I think that that was like a really interesting thing that came across in the documentary, just like the kind of

589
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,472
Yeah, the all encompassing nature of game development

590
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:30,793
and making a project like this.

591
00:31:31,393 --> 00:31:33,214
Yeah, well, you know, I think this is the part

592
00:31:33,294 --> 00:31:34,415
with an early access game,

593
00:31:35,096 --> 00:31:36,857
as a game developer can be especially,

594
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:39,699
I'll use the word compelling.

595
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:43,782
Because, you know, how often do you get people

596
00:31:44,143 --> 00:31:47,325
to play something of yours and give you like a response

597
00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:49,306
to the experience to produce so fast?

598
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,948
You know, there's nothing like that where.

599
00:31:51,807 --> 00:31:53,707
you know, you, someone is having a problem,

600
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:54,848
you read about it, you fix it.

601
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:57,148
You know, the way we conduct our early access

602
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,229
through our Discord, we had a feedback channel,

603
00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:01,630
an idea we got from the Rocket League Discord.

604
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,431
And we, you know, we read every piece of feedback

605
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:07,912
that came through and some of those,

606
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:10,953
some of those feedback got coalesced and became action,

607
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:11,953
became a task on the team.

608
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,358
and someone would do something about it,

609
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:15,659
and then you'd push it out.

610
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,399
And sometimes you could tell it would work

611
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:19,319
because someone in the community might say,

612
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,940
God, that's so much better.

613
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,380
Sometimes you could tell it could work

614
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,361
because they stopped talking about it as much.

615
00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:26,601
Like this is just not coming up as much anymore.

616
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:29,682
And so maybe that problem is actually like gone now

617
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:31,142
and we don't have to think about it for a little bit.

618
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:31,602
So.

619
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:37,304
So yeah, it's a very, it's like a very compelling process

620
00:32:37,364 --> 00:32:39,385
and it does get into every part of you.

621
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:40,846
But the truth is like these games we make,

622
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:43,787
they're like kind of, they're like kind of with us forever.

623
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:46,368
You know, we're still, you know,

624
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:49,010
Jen was just doing Bastion anniversary art, you know,

625
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,171
that we posted yesterday and stuff like that.

626
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:53,532
You know, still thinking about Rux and the Kid

627
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:54,873
and Zulfanzia and all that stuff.

628
00:32:54,893 --> 00:33:00,175
So we're like still, you know, they're a part of you.

629
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:11,837
And I think as people dispositionally, we do get just really creatively compelled by the projects we pick.

630
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:23,265
And we know in some way they're going to be with us, no matter what they're like or how they turn out or any of those types of things.

631
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:27,047
They're just always going to be with us. It would be impossible not to think and talk about them.

632
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:29,229
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:32,171
And then, you know, the other kind of side of that.

634
00:33:33,086 --> 00:33:38,710
Earlier thread was a bit about, you know, the process of like, how do you, how do you do this process or how does this happen?

635
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,572
And I think I texted you about this when I was watching it.

636
00:33:40,592 --> 00:33:49,940
It's like, I think my favorite piece of television that's ever been produced is the conversation where you're having like between a bunch of folks on the team about like, whether he should like float while he has a gun.

637
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,363
I live for that kind of stuff.

638
00:33:54,383 --> 00:34:01,730
You know, there is a lot of like, there's like this exciting, like, Ooh, like, look at the art and look at this, but like a lot of, a lot of projects are a lot of like.

639
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:09,096
let's talk about this thing in very big, very detail oriented, you know, and it just kind of

640
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:12,878
goes on and there's not like an exciting resolution in the meeting, you know, like sometimes these

641
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:17,621
things just like, they're just long meetings and conversations that go on for a while.

642
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:23,404
Yeah, it's a reference to a conversation about, you know, we have this weapon in the game that

643
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:27,106
is essentially like, it's a gun. It's called the adamant rail.

644
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:31,100
we knew we wanted to make it,

645
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,801
there was just a discussion over like,

646
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:33,562
well, how should it work?

647
00:34:33,602 --> 00:34:35,043
And one of the constraints actually is

648
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:36,925
the way we kind of do our characters,

649
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:38,306
it would have been pretty hard

650
00:34:38,406 --> 00:34:39,867
for the character to move and fire.

651
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:44,895
But every gun in every video game allows the character to move and fire, basically.

652
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:47,456
So how to get around such a constraint.

653
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:51,357
And so my brilliant idea was, you know, maybe the character could float and it would be fine,

654
00:34:51,638 --> 00:34:53,318
you know, and that wasn't fine.

655
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:53,878
We didn't do that.

656
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:56,579
Instead, he plants his feet in place.

657
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:57,279
It looks sensible.

658
00:34:57,319 --> 00:34:58,340
It feels good.

659
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,560
I'm happy to where we got with that.

660
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,502
But it's a good example of, you know, when you think about like functional collaborative teams,

661
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:07,923
some

662
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:12,501
sometimes I think about like, well, how much do you have to talk?

663
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:17,463
Because when you have a conversation, now we're going to be using our words.

664
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:20,744
And luckily we all practice communication well, and we,

665
00:35:20,924 --> 00:35:24,605
we practice trying to improve it and, and get, and, and get good at it.

666
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,879
But like a way easier way to do that is to demonstrate the work.

667
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:36,662
And so, you know, if someone can make a thing and show it to you,

668
00:35:38,343 --> 00:35:42,044
the conversation can be more focused around the thing that was made.

669
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:46,306
And is it getting us closer to our goals or is it pushing us further from our goals?

670
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:53,209
And so as a team, we've become very, like, sort of cognizant about

671
00:35:54,236 --> 00:36:02,019
conversations that are going along. It's like what's missing here? Like what is

672
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,881
is there is actually something that someone needs to kind of take back into their own

673
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:11,174
mental space or work on something and bring it back to the group.

674
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:14,014
Is there really something we can talk ourselves out of or around?

675
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:18,095
And I think that's like an example of, you know,

676
00:36:18,115 --> 00:36:21,756
a sensitivity to something that we we we've developed over time.

677
00:36:22,156 --> 00:36:25,977
I tell you, someone who's very good at this actually, our creative director, Greg,

678
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:30,798
you know, the the the you and I have actually talked about this before, but.

679
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:33,308
Hades used to be about a different character.

680
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:34,209
It used to be about-

681
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:35,189
Yeah, I'm gonna bring that up.

682
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:38,111
Yeah, it's the story of Theseus

683
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:43,054
going into the labyrinth to slay the Minotaur.

684
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:45,675
That was originally the game we were gonna make.

685
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:51,679
And when it came time to draw the main character,

686
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,301
there was aspects of it that weren't really coming together.

687
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:56,782
And we're talking about it.

688
00:36:58,003 --> 00:36:59,263
And Jen and Greg were talking about it.

689
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:00,264
And-

690
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:04,689
Greg felt like there was just something missing.

691
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:07,831
And so he came back from his Christmas break

692
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:11,454
and he had this idea,

693
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:13,496
which is like, what if, you know,

694
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:16,379
you play as the son of Hades,

695
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:17,980
you play as Zagreus, this character,

696
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,661
and it's a little known character from Greek mythology,

697
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:20,622
and you're trying to get out of hell.

698
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:23,665
And every time you try to, you fail, you know,

699
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:26,507
your dad pulls you back into your house.

700
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:27,548
And,

701
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:33,919
I think that's an example of an idea that like six or seven years earlier might have

702
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:36,160
taken us like a month or two or three to get used to.

703
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,842
But like in a week, a lot of the characters Greg had described in that idea were like

704
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:43,623
kind of in the game in some form.

705
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:49,135
And him and Jen were kind of off to the races on a revision.

706
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:51,336
And so much of what we had made to that point,

707
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,777
because Greg, of course, was internalizing the constraint

708
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:58,179
of how do we keep the Greek myth stuff that's working?

709
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:00,180
Like, how do we keep aspects of the gameplay

710
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,000
and stuff that's working?

711
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,101
How do we keep aspects of this?

712
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:04,082
Like we had this Olympian boon system

713
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,443
where the Olympians would empower you

714
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:07,783
and that was working too.

715
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:12,646
So like, what is the idea that keeps that,

716
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:13,966
but gets us around?

717
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,710
this issue we're having with drawing the main character.

718
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,892
And frankly, it didn't even appear as an issue at first.

719
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:23,494
It did to Greg and Jen when they were working on it,

720
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:24,534
but it didn't appear like as like a,

721
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:26,056
it wasn't like a stop the presses,

722
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:27,817
everyone let's get into a room and figure this out

723
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:28,578
and talk it out.

724
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,062
And so the dominoes fell really fast

725
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:36,003
when Greg came back with that.

726
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:39,006
And one after the other.

727
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:42,399
people contributed their piece to this new idea

728
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:44,539
and came together really fast.

729
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:48,821
And it was, you know,

730
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:51,101
we've had sort of main character changes

731
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,482
and big changes like that on other games.

732
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:54,062
They take a really long time this time of day.

733
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,063
So I don't know, just went way faster.

734
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:58,143
Just went way faster.

735
00:38:58,163 --> 00:38:59,924
And I mean, I was gonna ask too, like, okay,

736
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:02,565
well, how long did that kind of decision take to propagate?

737
00:39:03,147 --> 00:39:07,151
through because it seems like it would be a big thing but I think that you're right about there's

738
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:13,077
this kind of non-verbal like kind of component to things like that that when it was like slightly

739
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:17,041
off somehow in a way that wasn't really conscious with the team and then when the solution was

740
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:19,464
presented it was just kind of like oh yes like this is the right.

741
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:24,180
Yeah, it's like your mind opens up. It's like, you know, you see the humor in the idea he's

742
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,221
talking about, the characters he's contemplating, you see exactly how the stuff we've made

743
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:36,043
mostly fits with it, you know, at that point, and how it actually gets us closer to the stated

744
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:38,984
goals we had for the project in a lot of ways. And so...

745
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:42,588
you know, he tried the work, he put it in the game.

746
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,169
It's part of the reason, you know, Darren voiced Zagreus,

747
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:47,790
and we thought it was scratch.

748
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,431
Like we thought it was all a scratch for like

749
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,991
a bunch of months and months and months.

750
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:51,992
And you got stuck being the main character.

751
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:54,593
Yeah, because, you know, we have Logan Cunningham,

752
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:55,633
who's our principal voice actor,

753
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:57,434
who was the voice of the narrator in Bastion

754
00:39:57,474 --> 00:40:00,075
and the Arch-Justice Empire and the voice in Transistor.

755
00:40:00,675 --> 00:40:02,816
And, you know, so Logan is, you know,

756
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:03,937
playing all these parts of the game,

757
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:05,237
plays six or seven parts or something.

758
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:06,098
And, you know, he's,

759
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:09,787
And we're like, you know, well, Logan, of course, all of these are going to stay.

760
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,387
But this Darren one, you know, who knows?

761
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:14,949
And then, yeah, it's like frickin worked.

762
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:18,711
So, you know, after a while, it felt like it was the right thing.

763
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:22,433
So, yeah, I mean, even you talking about it now, I'm like, I, you know,

764
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,754
my mind goes from the like, oh, it'd be cool to go fight a minotaur.

765
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:28,916
So like, oh, yeah, like, you know, with the context of having Hades already out.

766
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:29,676
Yeah, yeah.

767
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:33,158
All my original ideas, you know, but like it does kind of like open up a like.

768
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:34,818
like, ooh, like that's a really cool,

769
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:36,839
like there's this and then there's this, you know?

770
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:39,300
And you know, the key thing there is it, it, it turned,

771
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:44,282
it, it, it added a more of a family story to the game.

772
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,203
And the family story is, I think one of, you know,

773
00:40:47,223 --> 00:40:49,043
the Olympians are one big dysfunctional family

774
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,344
in the way that Greg has been thinking about them.

775
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:54,105
And, and, you know, Zagreus and his dad

776
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,346
and his principal goal of trying to find his mother.

777
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:58,787
And so all of these types of things,

778
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:06,566
you know, you, you, as creators, you bring your own experience to it, but you just, you, but you

779
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:14,258
also see like, wow, the possibilities of this are really interesting. And, and what would happen if

780
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:16,742
we, if we did it? Yeah. Want to know.

781
00:41:19,095 --> 00:41:23,397
Yeah, and I mean, I think this is a good example of another question that I had actually heard

782
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:28,080
gotten from another developer around, you know, was there any kind of decision, you know, that

783
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,302
you guys made design-wise, business, whatever, that didn't like seem totally intuitive at the

784
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:34,723
time that now you look back at it and you're like, yeah, that was...

785
00:41:35,765 --> 00:41:39,207
that was clutch, you know, I mean, that was a big answer to that, you know, like,

786
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:41,268
oh, we changed the entire main character and story of the game.

787
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:45,149
Yeah, yeah, we did that. That was pretty, that, yeah, that's a good one.

788
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:49,731
Yeah, that worked out pretty well. You know, it's, it's, it's tough to say there's two or three

789
00:41:49,771 --> 00:41:56,474
things. I guess, um, there's at least a few things that we tried that I can say with certainty,

790
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:01,536
we didn't know if they would work. Um, you know, um, some of them were technical, like we,

791
00:42:01,716 --> 00:42:03,717
we converted our whole engine from C sharp.

792
00:42:04,904 --> 00:42:09,626
to a native C engine so that we could be on the switch at 1.0

793
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:15,529
and when we came out of early access in September 17th.

794
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,470
So there's probably two other things that come to mind.

795
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,092
So this isn't an unexpected design decision,

796
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:25,934
but it's like one of the most potent design mechanics

797
00:42:25,974 --> 00:42:29,556
in the game is actually inspired a lot by

798
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,594
by mechanics in other games, like the,

799
00:42:33,415 --> 00:42:34,896
if you remember in World of Warcraft,

800
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:37,858
they introduced the rest system,

801
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,799
which was like shocking at the time,

802
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,461
which is like, instead of penalizing you

803
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:42,642
over and over for dying,

804
00:42:44,703 --> 00:42:46,324
they were like, what if you had to like, sort of,

805
00:42:46,785 --> 00:42:48,806
if you like accumulated rest and you logged off,

806
00:42:49,387 --> 00:42:50,648
you would get this experience bonus.

807
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,570
They turned, you know, mechanics that were often

808
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,792
kind of really punitive into some sort of positive.

809
00:42:58,305 --> 00:42:59,226
sort of formatting.

810
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:01,567
And so there was, you know,

811
00:43:01,827 --> 00:43:04,268
we have examples or versions of mechanics

812
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:04,929
like that in the game.

813
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:07,170
So we have this dark thirst mechanic,

814
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:11,573
which incentivizes you to try and follow

815
00:43:11,653 --> 00:43:13,994
the bonus the weapon is applied to.

816
00:43:14,354 --> 00:43:17,696
And, you know, we see that that's pretty effective

817
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:19,617
at getting people to try different stuff,

818
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:21,258
even though they could just use the same thing

819
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:22,339
over and over and over again.

820
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,881
You know, there's other things like that,

821
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:26,121
that,

822
00:43:28,177 --> 00:43:31,378
that come to mind, but I'm...

823
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:33,579
Well, I was gonna say, so my other kind of

824
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:35,040
like tangential question to this,

825
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,060
cause there's a little bit of this

826
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,321
in the Noclip documentary about it,

827
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:39,882
like a kind of just really sort of like funny bug

828
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:43,083
that made it into like, got patched eventually.

829
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,384
But it kind of got me thinking,

830
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:47,005
there's like whole blogs dedicated to like the Sims

831
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:48,125
just going off the roof, you know,

832
00:43:48,145 --> 00:43:50,086
like somebody's like through the roof or whatever.

833
00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:52,067
Like, was there like a bug or just something that happened

834
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:52,867
when you guys were doing it?

835
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:53,568
Or it's just like...

836
00:43:54,308 --> 00:43:57,029
Obviously you can't keep it in, but just like the best bug.

837
00:43:57,049 --> 00:43:59,289
Yeah, you know what?

838
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:03,330
There was like a, I don't know if there was a best bug,

839
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,171
but one of my favorite bugs was the,

840
00:44:06,191 --> 00:44:10,532
I like to think about it as like,

841
00:44:12,732 --> 00:44:14,213
I don't know, it's something about it just like,

842
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:15,613
it's very heartwarming to me.

843
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,313
We had a bug.

844
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:17,193
Okay.

845
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:19,014
Someone realized when you throw the shield

846
00:44:19,774 --> 00:44:21,154
and you put the Aries boon on it,

847
00:44:21,194 --> 00:44:22,335
which is supposed to give it a curse,

848
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:23,741
It doesn't work.

849
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:26,002
So we're reading Discord and we're like,

850
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:27,382
geez, that's weird, did we miss that?

851
00:44:27,502 --> 00:44:30,103
So we go put the Ares curse on the shield

852
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:32,224
and sure enough, it doesn't work.

853
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:34,064
And so we're like, all right, you know what?

854
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,065
Let's fix that, we'll push it into Knight's Patch.

855
00:44:37,365 --> 00:44:38,666
Fix it, push it into Knight's Patch.

856
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:42,667
And then a bunch of people are killing themselves

857
00:44:42,707 --> 00:44:43,447
in the game and we're like,

858
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:44,588
well, you can't really kill yourself,

859
00:44:44,608 --> 00:44:45,428
there's no way to do that.

860
00:44:45,608 --> 00:44:46,348
Yeah, yeah.

861
00:44:46,648 --> 00:44:48,609
And we realized that

862
00:44:49,464 --> 00:44:52,487
because the shield comes back to you after you throw it,

863
00:44:52,627 --> 00:44:54,068
that when you threw the curse out,

864
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,371
it would stay attached to the shield to come back to you

865
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:57,432
and then apply the curse to you.

866
00:44:57,572 --> 00:44:59,314
And then if you had low enough health, you would just die.

867
00:45:00,435 --> 00:45:04,079
And so it was like, I like to think of it as heartwarming

868
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:05,420
because it's like everyone doing the right thing.

869
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,363
It's like, you know, a person found a bug, they reported it,

870
00:45:08,944 --> 00:45:10,566
you know, on our site, someone fixed it.

871
00:45:10,926 --> 00:45:11,326
Yeah.

872
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:12,127
And you know.

873
00:45:12,868 --> 00:45:16,451
we were like, this looks pretty good. We put it in. Um, and then it's like,

874
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:19,934
Oh, everyone's dying now. Um, and then, and then we fixed that, you know,

875
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:22,656
it was like, it was hot fixed. Um, and you know, we,

876
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:26,159
we improved our process and stuff, so stuff like that didn't happen as often.

877
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,343
Um, but yeah, I mean, there's, there's stuff like that where it's just, um,

878
00:45:32,985 --> 00:45:36,007
yeah, where it's, it's a little bit, it's one of those things where it's just really.

879
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:40,956
you, the surprises are really fun.

880
00:45:41,296 --> 00:45:42,918
There were probably lots of things like that

881
00:45:43,098 --> 00:45:46,382
that I just don't remember during our early access.

882
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,124
I mean, that's the thing that's kind of interesting

883
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:51,387
with games when you're troubleshooting,

884
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:53,589
like from before I was in the games industry, you know,

885
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:56,773
like I just kind of assumed that like whoever created

886
00:45:56,813 --> 00:45:57,533
the game had this like.

887
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,404
godlike ability to just make the game do whatever, which you kind of do.

888
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:04,787
But really what you're doing is you're like creating a bunch of systems

889
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:09,011
that you sort of have control over, but like act in very strange ways.

890
00:46:09,071 --> 00:46:12,455
Like there's a part in the documentary where you guys are putting the trailer

891
00:46:12,495 --> 00:46:13,316
together and you're like.

892
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:16,999
You know, the way a lot of those like videos and screen captures and stuff is like somebody

893
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:18,640
plays it until a thing happens.

894
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,722
It's really cool and you record it and they're like, oh, you know, can we have the blood

895
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:22,503
effect or something?

896
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:25,906
And I just like kind of dawned on me that it's like, you can't just like make the game

897
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:29,348
do the thing that you want to do to like record it, which is like a very strange.

898
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:34,453
thing to do where you're making something that you kind of don't really fully understand and

899
00:46:34,473 --> 00:46:38,055
then how you test that and how it all interacts with each other, which I think is why the Sims

900
00:46:38,115 --> 00:46:42,078
has bugs that just go off the rails because there's so many systems that are interacting

901
00:46:42,118 --> 00:46:47,521
with each other. But Hades had a lot of that, right? Like there's an insane amount of branches.

902
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:52,044
Yeah, interacting and overlapping systems. That's also the power of early access to help us

903
00:46:52,204 --> 00:46:58,208
understand it and a really good QA team. But yeah, I mean, there's so many permutations.

904
00:46:59,302 --> 00:47:02,604
and so many things that can happen in a game.

905
00:47:02,624 --> 00:47:06,505
You know, for us, I think the hard part actually at first

906
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:08,326
was to embrace the idea that we were now making,

907
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,807
because we had made these sort of,

908
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,007
Pyre was our first time where we made a game

909
00:47:12,368 --> 00:47:13,488
where there were so many choices

910
00:47:13,628 --> 00:47:15,389
that we knew that we weren't going to experience them all.

911
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:16,009
Yeah.

912
00:47:16,289 --> 00:47:17,970
And as developers.

913
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:18,410
And...

914
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:24,093
But it still went somewhere that was semi-controlled

915
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,253
until the end when there's all these different permutations

916
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:29,054
and the game puts together a ballad that reacts

917
00:47:29,074 --> 00:47:30,414
to all the decisions you've made in the game.

918
00:47:32,775 --> 00:47:37,056
In Hades, examples of things we had to become comfortable

919
00:47:37,076 --> 00:47:40,376
with as a team who worked the other way was,

920
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:42,197
we weren't gonna know.

921
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:46,218
We weren't even gonna have a chance to know, actually.

922
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:50,138
how the whole thing might feel or come together

923
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,000
in any given update cycle.

924
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,261
And even, you know, it's quite interesting.

925
00:47:55,341 --> 00:47:57,302
People are like, when you were playing Hades,

926
00:47:57,322 --> 00:47:58,902
when did you know it would be what it became?

927
00:47:58,922 --> 00:48:01,083
And it's like, what's very surprising is that

928
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:03,825
we didn't know that.

929
00:48:04,545 --> 00:48:06,366
Like Hades was in early access for a long time,

930
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,167
so we thought we kind of understood the kind of game it was.

931
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:13,881
And we, and, you know, we started doing our final playthroughs the summer before it came

932
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:15,923
out with the ending that we had always anticipated.

933
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:17,744
And we knew we were going to have a game that had an ending.

934
00:48:19,446 --> 00:48:24,230
Even if you could, if you could, well, we had, you know, it sort of has multiple phases

935
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,373
of that, but it's something that we, we knew we were going to put in the game, the narrative

936
00:48:27,413 --> 00:48:27,813
resolution.

937
00:48:28,194 --> 00:48:28,414
Yeah.

938
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:31,697
And even then it's like, you know.

939
00:48:33,732 --> 00:48:35,433
It's just one of those things where we, you know,

940
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:36,973
we experience stuff, we push it around,

941
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:39,014
we try to feel out what works,

942
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:41,554
but it's still hard to play your own game like a player.

943
00:48:41,995 --> 00:48:42,475
Yeah.

944
00:48:42,735 --> 00:48:44,335
It's like one of the play acting things

945
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:47,076
that I find really, really, really hard to do.

946
00:48:47,096 --> 00:48:47,856
Yeah.

947
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:50,097
And it's actually part of the thing with capture too.

948
00:48:51,317 --> 00:48:52,798
Capture is different than even that.

949
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:54,378
Capture is performative play.

950
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:55,838
It's like, how do you play so that it,

951
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:04,297
Like one of the worst things, Greg Kassabon, our creative director, and James, one of our people

952
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:10,660
who does QA, like they did a lot of the actual like stuff that gets captured. It's like if they

953
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,521
have to try to recapture something, mostly as is, but just a little bit different, like yes,

954
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:19,663
they can load the save and try and do it, but a lot of weird stuff happens when you're going

955
00:49:19,683 --> 00:49:22,684
through such a process. So yeah, anyway, I mean.

956
00:49:24,736 --> 00:49:27,738
I mean, I guess it's deeply dissatisfying answer of, I don't know.

957
00:49:27,758 --> 00:49:30,500
And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know.

958
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,461
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of it's interesting.

959
00:49:33,481 --> 00:49:36,283
And I'm you know, I'm sure there's a lot of other art that is like this where,

960
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,525
you know, to go back to the earlier thing of like, you know,

961
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:42,127
how much it kind of sinks in while you're working on a project like this,

962
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,308
but it stays with you forever.

963
00:49:43,408 --> 00:49:46,470
But it is also something that you kind of don't have control of,

964
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,571
especially after it goes out into the world.

965
00:49:48,631 --> 00:49:51,393
And now in a lot of ways, it is like the players.

966
00:49:52,228 --> 00:49:54,409
you know, the player's idea of it and the perception of it

967
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:56,550
and the changes that were made because of those decisions

968
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:57,250
and things like that.

969
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,591
So it's kind of like, I don't know,

970
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,651
I don't want to liken it so much to like having a child

971
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:04,532
cause I don't actually have that full experience, you know,

972
00:50:04,552 --> 00:50:05,732
but it kind of feels a little bit like,

973
00:50:05,772 --> 00:50:08,053
it's like you kind of have this thing that you're building

974
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,274
and creating and, you know, have some control over

975
00:50:10,314 --> 00:50:11,354
and it just, it kind of grows.

976
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:14,095
And at some point it is kind of no longer yours, but always.

977
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,456
always with you, you know, in a way.

978
00:50:16,476 --> 00:50:20,139
And it's kind of like, I think launching a game

979
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:22,441
and that creative process to me is like one of the most

980
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:24,342
kind of like vulnerable and intense

981
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,924
and kind of like strange experiences

982
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,146
that I think a creative person can go through.

983
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:30,828
And I've seen it with so many developers, you know,

984
00:50:30,868 --> 00:50:33,149
like putting something out like that out in the world,

985
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,452
I think is actually pretty like, I don't know,

986
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:37,733
like courageous or something in a way.

987
00:50:37,813 --> 00:50:38,734
It's pretty scary.

988
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:39,795
Yeah, yeah.

989
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:43,398
Well, we have each other, so we're not doing it alone.

990
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:48,307
you know, and we have our, we have our fans and the people who were there for us from the start,

991
00:50:48,387 --> 00:50:52,692
who really, um, who really voiced, you know, sort of bolster us and, and believe in us.

992
00:50:52,952 --> 00:50:59,479
And, and, um, so we have those things and so you obviously want to continue to earn their trust.

993
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:05,385
Um, so you, um, you need to, you need to stay vigilant, but yeah, I mean.

994
00:51:07,686 --> 00:51:11,068
The thing you said is very similar to something I've thought about a lot and sometimes we

995
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:14,951
talk about on the team, you know, it's like the part of the game that was ours was always

996
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:21,896
just the part we hadn't released because I really love this phrase that I hear Gavin

997
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:22,436
use a lot.

998
00:51:22,656 --> 00:51:25,398
It came out of one of his learnings on Hades, which is like,

999
00:51:26,307 --> 00:51:27,928
when we talk about the feature week,

1000
00:51:27,948 --> 00:51:31,029
we say the feature is done after two weeks, but it's not.

1001
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:32,650
The phrase he really likes to use

1002
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,171
is that it's like ready to begin.

1003
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:37,413
It's like ready to start because now it needs content.

1004
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:38,434
Now it needs iteration.

1005
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:39,274
Now it needs QA.

1006
00:51:39,354 --> 00:51:41,275
Now it needs audio.

1007
00:51:41,295 --> 00:51:43,977
Now then, when an update is done,

1008
00:51:44,177 --> 00:51:45,958
it's actually ready to begin again

1009
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:49,020
with the players in early access and their feedback

1010
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,461
and our patching process on that,

1011
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:52,322
and then wrapping that,

1012
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:53,763
and then bringing that into the next.

1013
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,201
update all the way until it's done.

1014
00:51:57,221 --> 00:52:00,443
So that's why I think also for developers,

1015
00:52:00,843 --> 00:52:03,184
the experience of finishing a game can be profoundly sad

1016
00:52:03,224 --> 00:52:03,964
because everything you're talking,

1017
00:52:03,984 --> 00:52:05,285
the upside of everything you're talking about,

1018
00:52:05,745 --> 00:52:09,307
of the creative, how compelling it is to work on something,

1019
00:52:09,347 --> 00:52:12,889
how much it seeps into your mind and your life,

1020
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:16,651
the sense of the rhythm

1021
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:19,512
and how many things are ready to begin.

1022
00:52:19,572 --> 00:52:20,933
And then you're actually at a point now,

1023
00:52:21,053 --> 00:52:23,494
actually we're out of ready to begin.

1024
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:25,212
you're like ready to be done.

1025
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:29,635
And that's like a different way of doing it.

1026
00:52:29,655 --> 00:52:33,658
And then, like you said, it's more than yours.

1027
00:52:33,979 --> 00:52:36,320
Something like Hades, which I'm very proud of,

1028
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:38,182
and I'm very proud of the team that made it,

1029
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:42,645
it gets this reaction partly because

1030
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:43,786
of what players bring to it.

1031
00:52:43,806 --> 00:52:45,468
Yeah.

1032
00:52:46,048 --> 00:52:49,551
And, you know, the experience is a collaboration

1033
00:52:49,591 --> 00:52:50,772
between us and them in some way.

1034
00:52:51,012 --> 00:52:52,753
And so, yeah, I mean,

1035
00:52:53,888 --> 00:52:56,109
I feel very fortunate, the whole team feels very fortunate

1036
00:52:56,189 --> 00:52:58,430
to have been able to do this work, to finish it,

1037
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:00,872
to have made something that so many people

1038
00:53:01,832 --> 00:53:02,693
have connected with,

1039
00:53:04,574 --> 00:53:05,955
but they brought their experiences to it.

1040
00:53:06,595 --> 00:53:08,756
So like they brought themselves to the game,

1041
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:10,197
they brought their imaginations

1042
00:53:12,238 --> 00:53:14,199
to fill in the parts of it that we as a small team

1043
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:16,141
can't always create, right?

1044
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:18,282
There's not lavish, giant lavish cut scenes

1045
00:53:18,302 --> 00:53:19,643
to describe every interaction, right?

1046
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:19,883
So,

1047
00:53:21,822 --> 00:53:24,064
the things they brought to it, I feel like very honored

1048
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:25,524
that we could be part of that process for them.

1049
00:53:26,145 --> 00:53:26,605
Yeah.

1050
00:53:26,705 --> 00:53:29,587
So that part feels quite good

1051
00:53:29,627 --> 00:53:30,727
for I think everyone on the team.

1052
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:33,369
Yeah, that's a really like kind of like wonderful way

1053
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:34,289
to think about it.

1054
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,431
Actually, while you're talking about that,

1055
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:38,572
it kind of reminds me of my art teacher in high school

1056
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:40,973
had said that like, basically a painting is never done,

1057
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:42,594
you just decide to stop working on it.

1058
00:53:43,455 --> 00:53:46,296
It's like, and there are, you know,

1059
00:53:46,336 --> 00:53:48,617
and I've seen it in a lot of creative fields

1060
00:53:48,678 --> 00:53:50,459
where people just will work on perpetually,

1061
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:51,359
work on something.

1062
00:53:51,837 --> 00:53:54,898
you know, and never like quote unquote finish it.

1063
00:53:54,978 --> 00:53:58,019
And I think, you know, there's so much and you can go so far down

1064
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,840
into the process that like kind of being done with something

1065
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:03,722
is just like deciding like I am done, you know.

1066
00:54:04,222 --> 00:54:06,243
And one of the other questions actually I had for you is like,

1067
00:54:06,263 --> 00:54:08,724
do you feel like Hades is like done, you know?

1068
00:54:09,322 --> 00:54:13,826
Yeah, so, so, you know, part of the way we, I've, I've asked and asked that question.

1069
00:54:13,846 --> 00:54:14,707
I find it really hard to answer.

1070
00:54:14,727 --> 00:54:15,447
How do you know when you're done?

1071
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:19,931
And, and, and I'll answer your question in a moment, but we often try to think about

1072
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:22,953
like completeness, completeness to us is different than perfection.

1073
00:54:22,973 --> 00:54:27,256
Completeness is like all the parts have a reason to be there and nothing is extraneous.

1074
00:54:27,578 --> 00:54:30,360
Yeah. So, yeah, I'm just going to have Amir kind of summarize.

1075
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,801
I'd ask him if it felt like

1076
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:34,223
the game was like done.

1077
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:37,346
Yeah. What they're what they're working on now with it.

1078
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:40,248
So, yeah, you know, we have the Xbox and PlayStation launches

1079
00:54:40,268 --> 00:54:42,449
coming up on August 13th, as I mentioned.

1080
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:47,053
And so, you know, we're you know, it's still an active part of our of our

1081
00:54:47,073 --> 00:54:47,493
of our.

1082
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:53,654
lives, you know, we just released a patch that added Japanese and all this kind of stuff. So,

1083
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:58,878
you know, while we were working on Hades, we patched Pyre. We just, we just, the games are

1084
00:54:58,898 --> 00:55:03,321
just a part of our studio, right? And, and so they're, they're.

1085
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:07,006
you know, it's always these little, little things for sure.

1086
00:55:07,026 --> 00:55:11,088
Yeah. Yeah. I think another one of my favorite parts of the Noclip documentary is like one of

1087
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:15,770
the very last things that Danny asked you is like, what are you working on next? And you're like,

1088
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:20,592
we're making, we're doing a patch. It's like literally what you've been doing for like the

1089
00:55:20,632 --> 00:55:26,554
whole like three year documentary, however long it was, was like, we're Danny, we're making a patch.

1090
00:55:27,014 --> 00:55:31,396
So Danny, Danny, Danny did a great job on the Noclip series. We're really like lucky to be

1091
00:55:31,436 --> 00:55:33,477
working with him. But, you know, I think.

1092
00:55:34,925 --> 00:55:37,486
the thing that working on it showed is just like,

1093
00:55:39,387 --> 00:55:39,947
Danny's amazing.

1094
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:43,889
It's just like he was just a part of the making of that game as far as I think a

1095
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:46,830
lot of us are concerned because he, he, you know,

1096
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:50,972
he added something which we might not have done ourselves,

1097
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:55,454
which is like an opportunity to reflect on it while it was happening. Um,

1098
00:55:55,694 --> 00:56:00,516
and so it's a wonderful gift. Um, and, and so, yeah,

1099
00:56:00,536 --> 00:56:02,617
we're really, we're really grateful to him for that. And

1100
00:56:03,762 --> 00:56:05,944
Yeah, you know, he knows as well as anyone.

1101
00:56:06,004 --> 00:56:07,765
It's like, wow, that stuff just,

1102
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,347
sometimes it just feels like it might not stop.

1103
00:56:10,907 --> 00:56:13,729
Yeah, you know, I think that that's really poignant

1104
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:15,530
to kind of say about the chance to have reflection,

1105
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:16,971
especially even while you're working on it,

1106
00:56:17,031 --> 00:56:18,652
or even now to be able to look back at it.

1107
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:20,133
You know, I remember,

1108
00:56:21,054 --> 00:56:23,937
I think it was Michelle Obama or something was talking about her book and she was like, you know,

1109
00:56:23,957 --> 00:56:28,081
we had this really interesting opportunity that a lot of people don't have is that I basically

1110
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:32,125
had the time and the space to sit down and write this book and reflect on like what happened to us

1111
00:56:32,365 --> 00:56:35,569
over the last eight years. You know, a lot of times you're just kind of going, going, going,

1112
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,831
and you don't really get to like kind of.

1113
00:56:38,703 --> 00:56:43,085
understand the progress that you're making or, you know, the kind of the true length of the journey

1114
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:46,967
because you're not documenting it in that way or you're not getting the time to reflect on it. So

1115
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:50,228
I actually think it's like incredibly cool that you guys are always going to have this like thing

1116
00:56:50,248 --> 00:56:54,210
that you can look at and see like the reactions of like, what was it going to feel like when we

1117
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,692
launched it? And what was it going to, you know, like watching to see what you're nominated for?

1118
00:56:57,752 --> 00:57:01,414
Like you get to like have that, you know, recorded for yourself, which is, which is amazing.

1119
00:57:01,434 --> 00:57:05,395
It's an amazing gift, you know, if you, if you

1120
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:15,004
if you have a learning orientation, as we do as a studio, it's really useful because you can keep

1121
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:19,727
kind of taking your experience and pushing it forward and all that kind of stuff. But you quite

1122
00:57:19,787 --> 00:57:23,169
easily forget, I think, even if you don't have that, if you do or don't have that, like what

1123
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:27,491
the experience of doing the thing was actually like at the time you did. And now inescapably,

1124
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:32,353
we will always know. You will always have that. You will always have that image of you watching

1125
00:57:32,373 --> 00:57:35,975
yourself on Nintendo Direct. Yes, I can see that. In your hoodie.

1126
00:57:37,218 --> 00:57:40,160
I can reprise that scene anytime. But yeah, that makes sense.

1127
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,281
Yeah. So we're coming up in the last few minutes here, which I'm kind of a little

1128
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:45,423
bummed about because I feel like I could talk to you about this stuff forever.

1129
00:57:45,443 --> 00:57:52,627
I did have one last one last question. You know, is there any like, is there any game

1130
00:57:52,687 --> 00:57:56,389
or piece of music or book or like thing or something that you're just like really

1131
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:59,851
into right now or thinking a lot about or anything that you kind of just want to like?

1132
00:58:01,266 --> 00:58:02,407
talk about or plug?

1133
00:58:02,427 --> 00:58:05,089
Yes, I want to talk about, so there's so many,

1134
00:58:05,169 --> 00:58:07,411
there's a lot of inspiring and amazing work being done

1135
00:58:07,431 --> 00:58:08,572
by a lot of developers out there.

1136
00:58:08,592 --> 00:58:12,675
I have personally been really inspired lately

1137
00:58:12,735 --> 00:58:17,119
by the work of YouthCat Studios

1138
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:18,340
who made Dice and Sphere Program,

1139
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:19,541
which is an early access game.

1140
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:21,682
That game does like everything.

1141
00:58:22,643 --> 00:58:24,524
that a sensible independent developer

1142
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:27,225
would tell another independent developer not to do, right?

1143
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:28,926
It's like massive scope.

1144
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,807
It's a game with a whole universe inside of it.

1145
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,648
And like all the universe is inside of it.

1146
00:58:33,868 --> 00:58:38,070
And it's just, it's an amazing,

1147
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:43,632
amazing, compelling game that has so many moments.

1148
00:58:44,533 --> 00:58:46,955
that open your mind a little bit more to what the game is

1149
00:58:46,995 --> 00:58:49,396
and what it could be and how expansive it could be.

1150
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:52,758
And it does it in a very smart way.

1151
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:54,319
I love it.

1152
00:58:54,419 --> 00:58:56,701
And I found out the game is made by a small number of people.

1153
00:58:57,141 --> 00:58:57,781
Interesting.

1154
00:58:58,322 --> 00:58:59,462
It's a really small team.

1155
00:58:59,863 --> 00:59:03,305
And I had the joy of tracking down their email

1156
00:59:03,345 --> 00:59:04,785
and sending them a note.

1157
00:59:04,805 --> 00:59:06,086
They sent something back, which was nice too.

1158
00:59:06,106 --> 00:59:07,467
I'm sure they were very excited about that.

1159
00:59:07,487 --> 00:59:08,428
Well, I was just excited.

1160
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:10,929
Yeah, I was just excited to tell them their game is so good.

1161
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:11,209
You know, when...

1162
00:59:14,294 --> 00:59:16,675
Uh, when people make something like that, that gives you like energy,

1163
00:59:16,895 --> 00:59:20,677
like creative energy to do stuff because you sit there and go, how did they do

1164
00:59:20,737 --> 00:59:24,860
this? Like, how did they do this as such a small team? How did they do this? Um,

1165
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,600
and, um,

1166
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:28,702
I just get a lot out of that.

1167
00:59:29,163 --> 00:59:31,385
So they've given me a tremendous gift.

1168
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:34,508
Yeah, I love when game developers geek out

1169
00:59:34,568 --> 00:59:36,530
on other developers' games.

1170
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:37,971
Like it's one of my favorite things.

1171
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:38,912
Yeah, I know.

1172
00:59:39,173 --> 00:59:40,093
The other game that did that for me

1173
00:59:40,113 --> 00:59:42,356
in the last couple of years was Stardew Valley for sure.

1174
00:59:42,376 --> 00:59:43,417
So there's, you know, I mean,

1175
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:44,558
think there's people on the team,

1176
00:59:44,598 --> 00:59:46,119
they can rattle off a list of them.

1177
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:47,601
These are just mine for sure.

1178
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:48,702
I feel quite lucky.

1179
00:59:49,203 --> 00:59:50,684
I don't even want to go down the rabbit hole of us.

1180
00:59:50,744 --> 00:59:51,385
No, no, it's okay.

1181
00:59:51,405 --> 00:59:53,026
We don't need to.

1182
00:59:53,146 --> 00:59:57,110
Anyways, so we're going to wrap up there and just as a kind of parting thing, Amir, if

1183
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:01,215
there's anything like, you know, where, where can people find Hades and like follow you

1184
01:00:01,335 --> 01:00:01,995
and all that stuff?

1185
01:00:02,316 --> 01:00:02,496
Yeah.

1186
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,399
Hades is out on, on PC and the Nintendo switch.

1187
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:08,662
And then on August 13th, it will be out on Xbox and PlayStation.

1188
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:12,393
of this year and thank you so much to all our players

1189
01:00:12,493 --> 01:00:15,354
and thank you to the Game Developers Conference

1190
01:00:15,374 --> 01:00:17,655
for nominating us for six awards in tonight's show.

1191
01:00:17,695 --> 01:00:19,076
We're really excited to see how that goes.

1192
01:00:19,576 --> 01:00:20,617
Yeah, great, awesome.

and for asking me to have this conversation with you.

1196
01:00:24,438 --> 01:00:25,679
I'm really excited about it.

1197
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:26,980
So I'm happy we made this happen.

1198
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,460
