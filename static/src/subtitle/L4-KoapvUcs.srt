1
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:08,409
One thing off the presentation, you don't am.

2
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,692
So I'm talking about video games,

3
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:12,354
and specifically art direction,

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:15,898
and things I wished I knew before becoming an art director.

5
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:18,742
And before I'm going into detail with that,

6
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:20,143
I'm gonna talk about where I'm coming from

7
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:22,106
so you can put everything into perspective.

8
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,607
So I started out as an indie dev.

9
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,634
I did, I co-founded a small studio

10
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:27,954
with a couple of friends of mine.

11
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:29,734
We did indie games, like we were super proud

12
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:31,195
because we got deaf kids and we got a Steam release

13
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:33,735
and it was like super awesome and everything was cool.

14
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:35,895
We peaked at about 10 people,

15
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:39,116
which was very scary at that time

16
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:42,297
because 10 people sounded for an indie dev like way too much

17
00:00:42,297 --> 00:00:45,697
and from there I, like about three and a half years later,

18
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:48,038
I decided to move on to the next project, next thing.

19
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:49,458
So I left Threex, they're still out and running

20
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,378
which makes me very proud

21
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:53,118
and I got hired by the company called Good Games.

22
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:57,635
And Good Games at that time was looking into making a AAA game.

23
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:00,938
They were looking into figuring a way out to do a brand new IP,

24
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:02,959
stamp out a studio out of nowhere.

25
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,882
So when I joined, it was about 10 people.

26
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:10,025
And over the course of that project, I became art director.

27
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,146
I hired a lot of people.

28
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:13,307
I helped building the studio to a 120-people team

29
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,548
with 30 artists.

30
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:17,310
And I also mentored other leads and hired other art directors

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,792
for other projects, helping out the studio in general.

32
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,094
So the majority of my experiences I'm going to talk

33
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:22,955
about come from here.

34
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:25,931
A year ago, I left Good Games.

35
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:28,172
I was lucky enough to get my dream job.

36
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,053
Like half a year ago, they hired me.

37
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:31,993
And now I'm back to doing actual 3D art.

38
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:34,354
So my current position is in a AAA studio,

39
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:35,454
but I'm not leading there.

40
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,575
So they were really, really kind enough

41
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,155
to allow me to do this talk,

42
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:41,136
but I'm not gonna mention where I'm working right now.

43
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:44,717
So thank you, anonymous developer

44
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:46,677
who's allowed me to do this.

45
00:01:46,677 --> 00:01:46,937
What?

46
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,421
So, oh yeah, back.

47
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:53,342
Let's start with this one.

48
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:56,183
So, as I mentioned, I started as a lead.

49
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,263
And at that time, the team was super small.

50
00:01:58,263 --> 00:01:59,324
So we had like three artists,

51
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:00,884
and it was in total like 10 people.

52
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:03,405
And my art director, my head of studio at that time,

53
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:04,105
at some point went like,

54
00:02:04,105 --> 00:02:05,366
you're gonna be the art director.

55
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,366
And as every sane person,

56
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:09,407
I reacted like a sane person said like, hell no.

57
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:11,790
Like, I'm not gonna direct that.

58
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,273
That's like way out of my league.

59
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:16,897
And so we agreed on I'm gonna prepare.

60
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:18,099
So I started preparing.

61
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,221
And as every sane person,

62
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,963
I went to like these boot camps several times,

63
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:22,145
which was very helpful.

64
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:25,330
And over time I kind of felt ready-ish.

65
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:30,095
and you you kind of look into argue you study like all the blogs and all the

66
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:33,398
stuff that comes up right and trying to figure out all of these things

67
00:02:33,398 --> 00:02:36,020
you never feel quite comfortable with it

68
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,526
the nature of that is because there's so much to learn you can't know everything

69
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:44,729
it's close to impossible to know all the things you want to know about video

70
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:45,649
games

71
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:46,330
just not possible

72
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,933
what happens is basically because

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,961
I talked to so many directors and artists and leads,

74
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,402
it's always the same thing, you never will feel ready.

75
00:02:57,402 --> 00:02:58,803
You always feel like an imposter.

76
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,084
Like you're waiting for the moment where people go,

77
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:02,885
Rogic, oh I thought you're Rogers, get out of here.

78
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:06,006
And it never goes away.

79
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,427
Actually, it gets worse because the more I started

80
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:09,868
figuring out what I need to know,

81
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:11,548
the more I realized I'll never be able

82
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:12,929
to figure everything out I need to know.

83
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:16,424
And so over time, that got worse.

84
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:19,746
And the thing with imposter syndrome is

85
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:21,246
you feel completely out of place.

86
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:23,368
You feel like you don't belong where you,

87
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:25,249
and unable to what you're supposed to do.

88
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:26,529
So this is pretty much how I felt.

89
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:29,491
And I panicked constantly.

90
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:31,052
I got anxious, I was nervous.

91
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,313
I wasn't very fond of the whole situation

92
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,375
because the whole thing just got worse over time

93
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,496
because when you start out with a small team,

94
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:39,737
you can still go like, okay, well,

95
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,017
it's just a couple of people, I can handle that.

96
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:44,139
But the team grows because that's what you got hired to.

97
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,861
So over time, the team went to about 50 people

98
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:49,382
and team meetings became a monster

99
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:51,804
because you're standing in front of 50 people,

100
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:53,485
they're waiting you and expecting you

101
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:54,305
to know what you're doing,

102
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:55,626
but you have no clue what's going on.

103
00:03:56,926 --> 00:04:01,247
And so your R team, like I remember the first time my R team hit like 15 people,

104
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:04,968
we do like the first team meeting, and I'm scared as hell because

105
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,708
they expect me to know what's going on and I'm like, hi.

106
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:11,509
And that's pretty much the monster that's chasing you. So like your imposter

107
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:15,030
syndrome gets worse because there's this thing that you're

108
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,510
running away from because you don't want to make them know that you're an

109
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,511
imposter. And then things get worse because...

110
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:25,015
now that you move into direction,

111
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,956
you get information that is exclusive to you.

112
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:29,877
So you know schedules, you know all the problems,

113
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:31,458
you know like politics way more

114
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,239
that are usually being kept away from you.

115
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,699
You get to know like all the details

116
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,901
that make the problems seem even more impossible.

117
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:41,802
And so that small foundation that you work so hard on,

118
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:43,882
that you feel like, oh, I'm the artist, I can handle this.

119
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:49,103
It's crumbling because all that stuff that you have

120
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,724
is not, wait, no way that's gonna work out, like ever.

121
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,064
Because it just makes everything crumble at that point.

122
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:56,004
So I got nervous, I was super nervous.

123
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,025
I couldn't talk to people, I got anxious.

124
00:04:58,025 --> 00:04:59,725
I'm a weird personality in general,

125
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:01,706
but oh boy, I can get weird.

126
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,606
Like, it gets way worse.

127
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,764
So when I'm nervous and I'm anxious, I get fully weird.

128
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,547
And that was the point where I kind of realized for myself,

129
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:12,449
I need to change something because I can't be that nervous,

130
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,891
insecure person in front of my team.

131
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:16,033
It will just, won't work.

132
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:19,576
So my solution for the whole thing is this word.

133
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:20,817
I'm not saying you should do that,

134
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:24,661
but like pantalones means pants in Spanish and that's it.

135
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:27,343
It has no other meaning.

136
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:29,543
When we were doing board game nights,

137
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:30,284
at some point I caught it up.

138
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:32,345
Like I went through iteration like a proper game developer.

139
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:33,126
I thought that one's good.

140
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,967
And I turned into the Pentelonus Pokemon.

141
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,829
That means I greeted people with Pentelonus.

142
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:40,331
I said goodbye with the word Pentelonus.

143
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,592
I signed emails with Pentelonus.

144
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,713
I critiqued art Pentelonus.

145
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,794
Every time I was nervous, I used that word.

146
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:47,156
And I turned into a Pokemon.

147
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:48,417
It turned into a running gag.

148
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:50,178
Like people just, like it was a thing.

149
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:53,661
And the weird thing about it is it actually worked

150
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:54,901
because I calmed down.

151
00:05:55,372 --> 00:06:02,057
And the moment I remember where I realized that was I come in in the morning, there's a designer and a coder, not even related to my team.

152
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:04,959
They're like half dead because in the morning nobody's awake in the morning.

153
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,882
They're like slurping a coffee and they don't even think and just say pantalones.

154
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:10,323
As you know, okay, I got it.

155
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:13,063
Like, if I can get a group of people

156
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:15,144
randomly saying a completely random word

157
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:17,905
to me in the morning without thinking,

158
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:19,245
I'm actually directing.

159
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,546
Like, this is, in essence, this is direction.

160
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,587
So it worked out in that sense.

161
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:27,427
And the funny thing about it is as well,

162
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:29,368
like, it calmed me down, which was essential.

163
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:31,069
Because I wasn't anxious anymore

164
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:33,449
because I realized I'm here for the fun.

165
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:34,409
I'm here to enjoy myself.

166
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,770
I'm here to enjoy all of this with like,

167
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,253
all the people that are in my team and it helped me to kind of accept the fact that

168
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:48,055
it doesn't matter like it's just it's just there for the shits and the giggles right

169
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:53,377
and so I got happy I calmed down I was like yeah this is it like this is what I want to do this is

170
00:06:53,377 --> 00:07:00,161
this is where I'm going right now and it was really interesting because as I calmed down my team

171
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:00,601
calmed down

172
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:07,891
So I realized something that my personal motivation actually is also the team's motivation.

173
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:14,216
So it was like my first big lesson I had was I'm here to motivate people.

174
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:18,719
And again, like when you're expecting to be art director, you go like, oh, I'm going to do art direction.

175
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,460
I'm going to show everybody what kind of art we're going to do.

176
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:24,095
But actually, what my first big thing was is,

177
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,315
I'm here to motivate people.

178
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,095
I just have to get people excited

179
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,156
about the stuff we're working on.

180
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,596
And I mean, it makes sense in a way.

181
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:31,316
Imagine you're going into a meeting,

182
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,917
the art director is sitting there

183
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,357
and he's anxious and nervous and like,

184
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:37,958
and the lead goes like,

185
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,838
holy shit, what's going on?

186
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:39,398
He's nervous.

187
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:42,538
And so he gets nervous because obviously,

188
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:44,779
if he knows probably things I don't know,

189
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:45,859
where in my head it's like,

190
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm not ready, I'm not ready, I'm not ready.

191
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,480
And.

192
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,152
he goes down to the artists and he's nervous because he thinks I know something he doesn't know

193
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:58,852
and therefore he's nervous and the artist goes like oh my god my lead is nervous

194
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:02,813
something's going on and the lead goes like I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know

195
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:07,134
and the artist gets nervous so like it kind of mitigates down to the team it's fascinating

196
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:14,096
because you don't think you have that power over people but you do and so what happens is

197
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,136
when you relax the opposite happens

198
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:17,993
people calm down.

199
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:19,855
Like, oh, my art director's chill, everything's fine,

200
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:20,917
okay, we'll be good.

201
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,699
If your art director is actually super excited

202
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,782
at what you did today, you'll get excited

203
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:26,664
because you're an artist, you want to get people excited,

204
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:29,548
that's the nature of your job.

205
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:32,371
So, in a way, you being happy and motivated

206
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:33,793
actually pushes the entire team.

207
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:37,006
And I'm mentioning this because it's so important

208
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:38,987
to find a way to do it in a positive way

209
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:41,008
because some people have imposter syndrome

210
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:41,869
or something similar.

211
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,069
It's for every person, it's different.

212
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:46,892
But if you use something that's negative to kind of cover it,

213
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,573
it will hit down to your team

214
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:50,114
and it will create an atmosphere

215
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,495
that is not positive and not productive.

216
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:54,236
So it's very important, whatever your pentalonus is,

217
00:08:54,236 --> 00:08:57,298
it has to be something that enforces positivity

218
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,640
because it will hit your team really, really hard.

219
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:03,178
And so that's how I felt.

220
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:04,719
I had still my imposter syndrome.

221
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:07,401
I felt totally out of place, but I was happy.

222
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,002
And everyone else behind me was happy too

223
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:11,043
because, well, we're dealing with the shit together.

224
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:14,385
So I thought I figured it out.

225
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:15,446
I know how to do art direction.

226
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:16,127
I need to be happy,

227
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:19,489
and I don't care that I don't know anything.

228
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:22,131
And so what happened next was,

229
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:24,572
okay, so art directors are supposed to know things, right?

230
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:27,694
Like they're supposed to have an overview over things.

231
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:28,875
So you take a step back.

232
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,635
and you take an overview.

233
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,557
And that's your job, right?

234
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:34,179
Like, you're enjoying that because it's kind of cool.

235
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,060
You get all the information, you know what's design doing,

236
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,001
you know what's code doing.

237
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:38,423
Like, you're talking to the head of studio

238
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:39,784
and every now and then you meet the CEO

239
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:40,865
and like, that's kind of fun.

240
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:45,309
And you see way further than anyone else in your team

241
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:46,270
and that's your job.

242
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,093
And then, especially when you used to be an artist,

243
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:49,953
a problem pops up.

244
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:52,900
And you go like, whoa, problem, that's my thing,

245
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,422
I'm an artist, I'm solving problems,

246
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:55,784
that's what I did the last 10 years,

247
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:57,746
so there we go, I'm solving the problem.

248
00:09:57,746 --> 00:10:00,309
And while you're solving that problem,

249
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,174
the dude who's supposed to keep the overview is not there.

250
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:05,155
And things get worse.

251
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:07,718
And you go back, and there we go, imposter syndrome.

252
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:08,459
I have no idea what I'm doing.

253
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:13,538
And this is so simple, but it's so straightforward.

254
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:15,520
It's micromanagement and delegation.

255
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,983
Like I guarantee everybody of you have like cursed their lead

256
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,745
or their director or like whoever is superior

257
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,147
that like he doesn't know what he's doing

258
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:23,188
and he's not in control of that

259
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:25,750
and why is he micromanaging me?

260
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,732
But it's so difficult in nature

261
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:30,035
because when you move into leadership.

262
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,156
The thing you've been doing till then is the exact opposite.

263
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:36,257
So it's in your human nature to act like this.

264
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:37,979
And making sure you're not doing this

265
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,620
is something that has to run constantly

266
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,901
in the back of your mind.

267
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,683
And it's sneaky, because you never realize

268
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:44,623
you're actually doing it.

269
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,825
Because it is something that is nature to you,

270
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,406
so you have to kind of get rid of it.

271
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:50,568
And at the same time, you can't get rid of something

272
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,709
that you have nurtured for decades.

273
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,754
So the thing that you realize at that point is I have leads, I have artists.

274
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:04,218
Those guys are the people who will take care of that, like who won't like.

275
00:11:04,218 --> 00:11:04,998
It's their job now.

276
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,020
Like you're the guy who has the overview

277
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,002
and your leads will make sure that whatever is going on there.

278
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,740
will be handled.

279
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,042
And the beauty of it, and that's a big realization for me,

280
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:18,724
was your leads don't, like you're hiring to your weaknesses.

281
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:20,806
You're getting the people who are way better

282
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:21,906
at stuff you have no clue about.

283
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:24,588
So one person sitting back there,

284
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:27,230
she got precisely hired for the fact that I'm chaotic

285
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,512
and I'm nervous, and she's calm and very organized.

286
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:32,073
And my boss was smart enough to do that.

287
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:34,294
And once I realized that, a whole world opened up

288
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,936
because I realized, well, I have no clue about animation.

289
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:38,877
Maybe we should hire someone who's really good at that.

290
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,444
And we did that, and he took care of the pipeline,

291
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:42,925
and we met every now and then, and he told me,

292
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:43,865
this is what we're doing.

293
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:45,826
And I'm like, yeah, that works with what we're having

294
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:47,007
in plan, keep going.

295
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,129
And that's amazing, because then you have a group of people

296
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,331
who are totally specialized in what they're doing,

297
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:54,472
they're way better at what you do, and guess what?

298
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:56,473
The imposter syndrome just slightly gets away

299
00:11:56,473 --> 00:11:58,395
because you figured out, I don't have to know

300
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:00,976
all that crazy stuff I have no clue about.

301
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:02,497
And so over time, you're calming down,

302
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:06,000
and you realize giving ownership to people is a big deal.

303
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,726
because it makes people motivated.

304
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:12,467
It's that one thing that people make them stay longer,

305
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,327
which I'm German, we're all about efficiency

306
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:15,808
and time efficiency and all that kind of stuff.

307
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,448
So it sounds nice, but it's kind of evil

308
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:21,129
where you go like, you own this, this is yours,

309
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,670
but you have to take care of this, right?

310
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,950
And because you own it and you take pride in that.

311
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:29,724
you take care of it. You stay longer. You might come in a weekend or two. I don't know about it.

312
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:33,705
I don't care. It's good. So it's a nasty thing, but at the same time, it's a great thing because

313
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:38,746
people actually enjoy doing it. And it doesn't matter at that point because you're having fun.

314
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:45,647
Like you're owning that. And so with that in mind, you're realizing, okay, I have to give people

315
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:49,668
ownership over the stuff they're working on, but I still need to direct them because I have the

316
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,348
overview. I need to figure out.

317
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,683
how to make them build the things I need

318
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:58,465
without taking and stifling their creativity, right?

319
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:01,186
So you're standing there and you're starting to figure out,

320
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:02,007
like, how can I do that?

321
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:04,128
How can I give them very clear direction?

322
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,569
Because this is what it boils down to.

323
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:09,912
And I've seen it go south both ways,

324
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:11,893
where one way is where people hone in

325
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:13,754
and give like very, very detailed feedback.

326
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:15,875
And then the other one is where they get

327
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,296
like very abstract feedback.

328
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,578
And we call it the fazoozle.

329
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,855
And there's tons of versions where you go like,

330
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:24,455
okay, this doesn't have enough punch.

331
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,096
There isn't enough jazz in it.

332
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,816
Or like, there are terms you can't believe.

333
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:28,836
Like, it's crazy.

334
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:31,457
And the thing is, it's really bad

335
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:33,837
because people don't know what you're asking them.

336
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:35,598
Like, they don't understand what you want to go for,

337
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:36,838
but you're not doing it on purpose

338
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:38,078
because you just want to make sure

339
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,798
that they can do what they want.

340
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:43,259
So it's almost like an art form to figure out

341
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:46,500
how can I get someone to do what we need

342
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,300
without taking away all the creativity

343
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,640
and like ownership out of them.

344
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,702
And in my experience, the best metaphor I have for that

345
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:56,923
is this, where you go like, it's somewhere in this location,

346
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,984
which could be the briefing you have from creative.

347
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:02,065
It's somehow something like that, in that case,

348
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:05,526
like we need a ship to get here, but figure it out yourself.

349
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:08,887
And I just talked to an art director a couple of weeks ago,

350
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:10,328
and he said something really smart to me.

351
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:12,829
It's like directors give direction, never solutions.

352
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:15,130
And I think that's the nature of it.

353
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,110
So, and that comes with it.

354
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,771
What makes it hard again is,

355
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,474
whatever you had in mind won't be the thing they're going to build.

356
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,435
The thing they're going to build will be something else.

357
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:31,397
It will fit the criteria, but it won't be what you imagine it's supposed to be.

358
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:34,318
But the beauty of that is the only person who knows that is you.

359
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,811
when the player is going to play the game,

360
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:39,014
the consumers see it and it fits, it fits.

361
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:41,316
Like the only person who has to be cool with it is yourself.

362
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,539
But obviously, because you used to be an artist

363
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:46,202
and you had like a very small thing in mind

364
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:47,844
and you always had 100% control,

365
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:49,806
it's very, very, very hard to let go of that

366
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,110
because it is not in your nature.

367
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:57,732
And so having this team, having this group working on stuff

368
00:14:57,732 --> 00:15:00,915
that you have no control on, and at the same time

369
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:03,458
trying making that navigate, you will suffer with that.

370
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,101
You will try so many things and it won't work out

371
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:07,543
in the beginning, and it's totally fine

372
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:08,904
because you're learning that.

373
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,706
Like this is actual art direction.

374
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:12,969
Like this part to me was the most.

375
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:19,932
That's the nature of making art direction, because you're directing people to a point without telling them what to do.

376
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,994
And the only way to learn that is try and error.

377
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:24,635
There is no magic bullet for that.

378
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:28,296
And you will suffer, I promise.

379
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:35,060
So, with that in mind, you realize you need to know your team, you need to know the group you're working with.

380
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,503
because that sort of feedback is very, very personal.

381
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:42,727
So one person would need a specific set of words

382
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:44,810
and sentences that triggers them to do that.

383
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,373
Some people would very badly react to that.

384
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:51,297
So you have to figure out who reacts to what, what way.

385
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:52,579
So you start getting to know your team

386
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:54,561
and that's something which is.

387
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:57,802
super difficult because as I mentioned you're the guy who has the overview.

388
00:15:57,802 --> 00:16:02,844
Like you're the person who actually deliberately tries to stay back to keep everything working.

389
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:06,606
And it's very easy because you spend a lot of time in meetings, Jesus Christ,

390
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:12,688
a lot of time in meetings. And you'll have like these small intermingling five minutes in between

391
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:16,590
meetings where you meet people. And if you don't maintain the relationship to the artists you work

392
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,092
with and when your director, the leads you work with, and you don't understand them on a personal level

393
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:22,732
it will make things worse.

394
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:27,114
And so it is super important that you understand your team dynamics,

395
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:29,816
you understand how your team is built up, how it works,

396
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:32,437
how they kind of communicate with each other.

397
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:35,899
And so when that happens,

398
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:40,501
you look into that moment where, how do you say,

399
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,763
you understand the person, you pinpoint them.

400
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:49,189
I messed up my presentation, sorry.

401
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:52,511
Imposter syndrome, there we go.

402
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,733
So you work with that, you work with people,

403
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:58,135
you figure that out, and you have that team

404
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,656
almost like running a ship, and it's autonomous,

405
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:02,137
and you need to know it, so what happens,

406
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:04,678
and that's the part where I should have been, this one,

407
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:07,160
you start introducing other people into your team,

408
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,742
and this can be in very different ways.

409
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:12,883
Sometimes you inherit people, sometimes you put people

410
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:14,424
in your team that you don't know.

411
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:19,748
And it's always a risk because that happens on every team I've known so far.

412
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:24,212
Like it is in the nature of the thing where you if you even if you know your

413
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:27,555
team dynamic, figuring out the right people, getting to know the right people

414
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:30,257
and putting them in the right spot is insanely difficult.

415
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,480
And this will happen, I guarantee, at least in one of your teams.

416
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,683
But the important thing is, you know, that's there.

417
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,966
And then you know that it's it's it's a thing that can happen.

418
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:42,808
And the way.

419
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:49,909
I would encourage you is try to counteract it by making sure that the person you're introducing

420
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:51,890
is definitely a team fit what you feel like.

421
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,871
What we did is we had like an interview where I just made sure, okay, he fits, it's kind

422
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:56,591
of okay.

423
00:17:56,591 --> 00:18:02,353
But then on top, we had people coming in and I made them go out with the team and I was

424
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:02,553
like.

425
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:05,614
really weird dude who was just around the corner

426
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:08,095
like looking what they're doing, like is it working?

427
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:08,855
Do they talk?

428
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:09,935
Is there something going on?

429
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,556
And sometimes you could see like nothing's happening

430
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,576
and you go like, oh, I don't think that fits.

431
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:16,217
Sometimes the team opened up and started talking.

432
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:18,617
We just hired one dude who literally just made the team talk

433
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:21,138
that was like his major attribute and we're like,

434
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:22,838
they're talking, why are they talking?

435
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:23,598
They never talk.

436
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:27,199
I think we should hire this guy.

437
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,099
So you'll figure this out.

438
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:32,120
And the interesting thing is another thing you can run into

439
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,500
is.

440
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:37,045
you'll hire people that you like, which you should,

441
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:39,667
but at the same time, what happens is sometimes

442
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,449
you hire people who like the same soccer team

443
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:42,550
or like the same drinks you do,

444
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:47,175
and it becomes too much narrowed down to one specific thing.

445
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:49,417
So what you wanna do is, and that's why this happens,

446
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,518
is you want to have diversity.

447
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:53,121
You want to make sure that the group of people

448
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:56,324
you're hiring is as far spread as possible.

449
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,969
I had like one really weird example that someone on our last team told me on his previous project

450
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:07,492
where they had no female concept artists or no female in an entire character pipeline.

451
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:13,458
What happened was during the production they were like done with like a big set of characters,

452
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,099
someone further down the line was like

453
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:16,819
they look like prostitutes.

454
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:18,800
I was like, oh shit, you're right.

455
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,003
And you have this entire pipeline.

456
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:24,505
You spend so much time and money to do this,

457
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:26,627
and you just realize, oh, crap.

458
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:29,389
So the more diverse your team is,

459
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:31,451
and the more different kind of mentalities

460
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,733
you have your team, the more you can counteract these things.

461
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,154
And obviously, we're creating games

462
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:37,556
to be pleasurable to as many people as possible.

463
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:40,178
And the more AAA, you get the worse this gets, actually.

464
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,819
So handling that diversity.

465
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:45,981
with that kind of mentality that you want them to work together,

466
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:48,902
but you need them not to be the same, leads to this.

467
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:51,283
Anyways, like it always will lead to these problems.

468
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:52,444
So you'll have it.

469
00:19:52,444 --> 00:19:55,205
Know your team so you can fix it really fast,

470
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:59,027
because it can cost time and money big time.

471
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:02,308
And coming to my last point, this one

472
00:20:02,308 --> 00:20:04,209
is kind of summarizing all of it.

473
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:04,949
I truly believe that.

474
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:11,783
all of the points before boiled down to

475
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:12,764
please leave your ego at home.

476
00:20:12,764 --> 00:20:15,525
And this is easier said than done

477
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:17,206
because we're all human beings

478
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:20,027
and you feel pimp if you're leading a lot of people

479
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:22,288
because the bigger the team got,

480
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,189
the more responsibility you have,

481
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,011
the further you float, the more detached you are,

482
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:28,351
the prouder you get, right?

483
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:30,492
Like, oh, look what I'm leading there.

484
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:31,253
And.

485
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:36,155
you're like proud about this, you're engaged about it, but you're vain about it as well.

486
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:40,317
And some people, as I mentioned, have the imposter syndrome and they cover it by just

487
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:45,258
adding more people into the pool and doing weird things with that. And so what happens at that

488
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:51,080
point, it's the negative effect I mentioned before where it backfires heavily. So...

489
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,912
The thing is, when you have your ego, and that's the worst part about my presentation,

490
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:04,553
all of the rules I just stated and things I mentioned, you have to break them constantly

491
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:06,633
without you wanting to break them.

492
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:11,074
But sometimes there's a situation that comes up and you realize, oh shit, I need to micromanage

493
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:12,174
this because it doesn't work.

494
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:16,175
You don't want to, but sometimes, for example, you have a team that you give them ownership

495
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,736
but they just can't handle it at that point because they're not ready for it.

496
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:22,038
So you have to go down and just help them to get into this.

497
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:23,938
If you do this for the wrong reasons

498
00:21:23,938 --> 00:21:26,660
because you want control, you're ruining that team.

499
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,120
If you do it for the right reason

500
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,301
because you see they're struggling

501
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:30,842
and you're helping them out with that

502
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:33,403
and making sure that they get a smooth run

503
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:35,144
into that ownership, you win.

504
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:36,244
So you're breaking that rule.

505
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:39,426
If this is coming from the wrong place, it's dangerous.

506
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:41,967
And it happens easy because, again, it's sneaky.

507
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,228
It's like something you're constantly running in your mind

508
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:46,349
making sure I'm doing it for the right reasons.

509
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,094
And I've seen teams falling apart because someone in a higher position was afraid to ask for help.

510
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:53,715
Which again, is a vanity and ego thing.

511
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:58,700
It never hurt anyone, ever, no matter what position, to ask for help.

512
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,922
I constantly merendered to my head of studio and asked for help.

513
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:03,263
And it never backfired.

514
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:06,346
When I screwed up, the first person to know was my boss.

515
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:09,609
Like, dude, I screwed up. This happened, I think I'm gonna fix it like this.

516
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:11,490
If you're screwing up every day...

517
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:13,832
and you're afraid to go to your boss,

518
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,813
you should reconsider if you're ready for this

519
00:22:15,813 --> 00:22:18,915
because then again, it's your ego that prohibits you

520
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:20,976
to realize you're jeopardizing the entire team,

521
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:22,697
which means you're jeopardizing a lot of people

522
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:24,458
because you're responsible for that.

523
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,739
If you screw up, the project might get canceled,

524
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:28,400
so you're not just ruining your career,

525
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,580
you're ruining a lot of careers.

526
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,722
So it's really hard and really tough

527
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:36,084
to make sure and maintain that mental state.

528
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:38,045
And apparently I wanted to stretch,

529
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:39,486
but I was nervous so I was really fast.

530
00:22:41,004 --> 00:22:42,939
And there we are, I'm done.
