1
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:04,905
Eh.

2
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:09,128
Sorry that you guys couldn't get into the indie soapbox, I guess.

3
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:11,830
But thanks for coming.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,631
We appreciate it.

5
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:14,312
My name's Danny.

6
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:15,173
And I'm Mark.

7
00:00:16,354 --> 00:00:18,275
And we're from South Africa, literally

8
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:19,256
the other side of the world.

9
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:24,100
There we're involved in growing a local games industry

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,981
and running QCF design, where we made

11
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,302
a game called Desktop Dungeons.

12
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:31,125
Desktop Dungeons is a quick play puzzle roguelike

13
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:32,386
from the mind of Rodin Hubert.

14
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:37,214
Didi challenges you to complete single screen dungeons

15
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:39,055
with weird heroes by defeating enemies in order

16
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:40,616
to become powerful enough to take on a boss

17
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:42,317
and sell their mounted head to upgrade your kingdom,

18
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:44,177
unlock more heroes, dungeons, and loot along the way.

19
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:45,158
Phew.

20
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,979
The kicker is that exploration is a resource.

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,041
You regenerate health and mana when you uncover new terrain.

22
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:55,522
People love arguing that it's not a roguelike.

23
00:00:58,363 --> 00:01:00,064
So Desktop Dungeons first released

24
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:00,984
on the 7th of January, 2010.

25
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:04,326
And it looked like that.

26
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:07,939
Then it released again two days later, twice more

27
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,500
the following week, five times over the next month,

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,581
and 16 more times up until the end of 2010.

29
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:17,024
In 2011, the game took a brief break

30
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:19,346
from being continuously released to win an IGF

31
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:20,586
award for excellence in design.

32
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:21,327
So that was fun.

33
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:24,469
And then it started right up again in June,

34
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:25,649
releasing another 134 times, once a week,

35
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,170
for 2 and 1⁄2 years.

36
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,523
Since releasing on Steam on November 7th in 2013,

37
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:35,544
the releases have slowed down a little.

38
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:37,045
But we're planning another one next week,

39
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:39,547
and then two more for your favorite mobile devices

40
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:40,168
come April.

41
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:43,790
We often get asked if the game is out yet.

42
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:48,414
You see, Desktop Dungeons was in open development.

43
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:50,775
And at first, this was quite by accident.

44
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:53,877
But once we saw what we'd done, we doubled down and just

45
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,419
stuck with it, because open development is actually

46
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,780
a really powerful way to make games.

47
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,865
And it's a really, really interesting and useful mindset

48
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:02,206
that we wish more indies would use.

49
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,308
So time for some definitions and controversial statements, too.

50
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:15,890
Open development is putting the latest version of your game

51
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,330
out there for people to play and constantly collecting

52
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,870
their feedback.

53
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,611
Open development is not designed by committee,

54
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:24,952
the wisdom of crowds, or abandoning your design

55
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:25,472
to metrics.

56
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:27,333
It needs engaged game designers.

57
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:29,302
to make it work.

58
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:31,343
It's not about giving people what they want.

59
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,845
It's about getting them to react the way you want them to.

60
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:36,987
Open development is a methodology

61
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,068
that helps you focus on the real problems experienced

62
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:42,470
by your players and constantly iterate on those solutions

63
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,292
instead of doing weird things like optimizing your renderer

64
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:45,972
for the fifth time.

65
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:49,235
And open development is not Kickstarter,

66
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:50,395
surprisingly enough.

67
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:53,536
Kickstarter needs you to tell potential backers exactly what

68
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,397
you're going to deliver up front or else.

69
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:58,097
Open development is about exploring your game design

70
00:02:58,197 --> 00:02:59,918
with your players as you're building the game.

71
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:04,279
Open development is a great way to green light projects.

72
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,620
And make sure you spend most of your time working

73
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,760
on games with potential.

74
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,840
Opening prototypes from the start

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,981
lets you kill the ones that suck earlier.

76
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:15,776
Open development is not early access.

77
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:18,298
Steam's early access is a great platform

78
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,040
for open development, but you can't put prototypes on there,

79
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,721
so it's probably not a great place to start.

80
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,724
And open development is easier on PC.

81
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:29,906
While maybe you might be able to develop open

82
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:32,408
on mobile or consoles, it's really, really hard

83
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:34,169
to keep your game up to date on those platforms.

84
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,352
And on PC, you can literally just make a prototype,

85
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:38,653
shove it out there, and see what people think.

86
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:43,364
And open development is not asking to be cloned.

87
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:46,985
Yeah, OK, Desktop Dungeons was cloned,

88
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:49,286
as was nearly every Flambier game.

89
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:50,906
But the reason you know about this

90
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,467
is because of open development.

91
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:54,507
Open development and being open is actually

92
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,848
a really great way to defend against cloning,

93
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:58,508
because people know about your game.

94
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,409
It's out there.

95
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,049
It's visible.

96
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:02,470
Cloners can't say they didn't see it.

97
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,390
They can't lie.

98
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,370
And your community is going to back you up

99
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,351
if push comes to shove.

100
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:13,284
Now that you disagree with a few of our statements,

101
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,106
why should anyone try to be an open developer?

102
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,749
Being open helps you design better games.

103
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,031
There's no denying the value of playtesting.

104
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:26,312
Knowing how your players are interacting with your game

105
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:26,933
is a must.

106
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:28,894
And taking your game open, well, that's

107
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:30,575
just playtesting on a massive scale.

108
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:33,397
You may not always be in the room to watch every player,

109
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,198
but the amount of information you receive

110
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,439
will more than make up for it.

111
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:40,845
The cycle of a release, playtest, release

112
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,346
does a strange thing to your design.

113
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:44,067
It gives you the luxury of knowing.

114
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:46,748
You can eventually know if your UI is clear,

115
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,308
know if your game is balanced,

116
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:49,849
or know if your progression is engaging.

117
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,070
You just have to keep releasing the game

118
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,190
and asking questions.

119
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:57,732
You can ask players about something specific, sure,

120
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:01,094
but you can also let the gameplay ask questions for you.

121
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,015
We first learned this completely by accident

122
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:04,975
when we stumbled upon a way

123
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:06,556
to weed out controversial strategies.

124
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,301
No, sorry, we'd out overpowered strategies.

125
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:12,043
We were trying to slow down our most hardcore players

126
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:13,844
because they were destroying new content

127
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:15,065
the moment we put it out there.

128
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,327
So we added a new boss, the Indomitable,

129
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,288
who had to be killed 100 times.

130
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,891
We literally thought this guy would be impossible to beat,

131
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:24,152
so they beat it in a week.

132
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,495
All sorts of crazy edge case strategies were being used

133
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,477
and we could easily see the ones that were overpowered

134
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:31,337
and nerf them.

135
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,100
After that, we started releasing all of our content

136
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,602
at a ridiculous difficulty level.

137
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:39,243
This made something else interesting happen.

138
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:41,985
Because new stuff came out crazy difficult,

139
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,706
our hardcore players would beeline straight for it

140
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:46,527
with new strats ready to go.

141
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,128
And they'd try to be the first to beat the new challenge.

142
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:52,849
So it focused our players, but it also gated

143
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:54,490
many of them at the same time.

144
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,331
We could slowly lower the difficulty

145
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,311
of that piece of content,

146
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:59,492
and so it fit naturally into our progression

147
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:01,593
with players who could defeat it.

148
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,014
Eh, sorry.

149
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:08,317
Ah.

150
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:17,942
Well, all right.

151
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:22,764
Well, gated players and stuff like that.

152
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:23,585
Way too much.

153
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:27,526
So having a ton of players is really useful,

154
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:29,187
but you still need to be a designer.

155
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,748
Your community doesn't know everything about your game.

156
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,610
Being open lets you refine how you communicate

157
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,610
with them inside of the game.

158
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:41,719
We have a playable hero class called the Monk, which, for the longest time, we considered underpowered.

159
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,682
Which, for the longest time, was considered by our player base underpowered.

160
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:51,004
We knew the Monk was a good class, but we couldn't convince our players.

161
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:52,905
So we made a lot of little changes...

162
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:59,909
Gangar, ignore me. It's fine. I don't exist. I'm a lie.

163
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,450
Just... get away.

164
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:06,924
So we knew the monk was a good class, but our players didn't.

165
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:09,566
We made a lot of little changes, and eventually someone

166
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:10,886
picked up on how to play this class.

167
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:13,608
And they just stomped everything.

168
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,529
They were just destroying everything in their path.

169
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,870
But what we did is then we balanced the monk back down.

170
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,892
But the way that our players had been talking to each other

171
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:22,513
about how to play the monk effectively,

172
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:24,914
that's now part of the description for the class.

173
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:29,776
So, maximizing open design.

174
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:31,938
To get the most out of designing in the open,

175
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:33,659
you need to be okay with players being upset.

176
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,361
Players telling you everything is perfect

177
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:36,582
won't help you solve problems.

178
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:38,644
When players give you suggestions,

179
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:40,245
don't just blindly implement them.

180
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:43,328
Look deeper into the root of their problem.

181
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:46,771
Players will ask for things that you know aren't a good idea.

182
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:49,013
Learn to say no, but be ready to explain.

183
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:52,937
If your game plays well, but looks terrible, that's okay.

184
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:54,678
You can always make it look better later.

185
00:07:57,432 --> 00:08:00,013
So being open also helps your marketing efforts.

186
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:01,794
And it's probably everybody's favorite thing.

187
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,196
But discoverability is one of the biggest problems

188
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:05,136
you'll face as an indie.

189
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:07,318
And the overcrowding in the marketplace

190
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:10,240
is not going to go away anytime soon.

191
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,021
So we all know that releasing a game

192
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,442
and then only trying to figure out

193
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:16,784
how you're going to market it to people is suicide.

194
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,765
And if you're going to be competing

195
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:20,126
with all these other games anyway,

196
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:21,867
why not start sooner rather than later?

197
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:24,829
Enter the super fan.

198
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,533
These people are going to email press about your game.

199
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,815
They will unapologetically badger their friends

200
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,576
to play this cool new thing they found,

201
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:34,179
and they'll post about it anywhere they have a voice.

202
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,282
They are fucking great, and you want to have as many of them

203
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:38,803
as possible.

204
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:43,167
We can actually trace Desktop Dungeons' early press success

205
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:46,530
back to one specific person, this guy, Duke of Prunes.

206
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,607
He reached out to IndieGames.com, Rock Paper Shotgun,

207
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:54,632
TIGSource, and generally made a nuisance of himself

208
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:55,694
to anyone that would listen.

209
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:56,476
We love him.

210
00:08:57,878 --> 00:08:59,741
IndieGames.com covered us continuously,

211
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:01,785
and that dev-centric attention probably

212
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:02,867
helped us do well in the IGF.

213
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:06,919
Rock Paper Shotgun has written literally the nicest things

214
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,020
about desktop dungeons.

215
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,841
And they've been the one outlet that

216
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,784
has picked up on every late or badly written press

217
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:13,725
release that we've put out.

218
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:16,728
Derek Yu drew some pixel art for this weird prototype

219
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:17,608
that he saw on Tixos.

220
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:20,811
He also helped us define the look of the game

221
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:22,573
later on by helping us find the artist that

222
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:23,474
worked on the beta for us.

223
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:26,897
So you want super fans.

224
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:29,754
open development is a great way to find them.

225
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:32,055
They love unearthing neat concepts,

226
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,735
and they want to be the ones to tell the world

227
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:34,616
about this thing they found.

228
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:38,118
They're attracted to concepts like prototype stage.

229
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:41,139
And if the current version looks bad, they don't really care.

230
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:43,320
As long as something in that prototype tickles them,

231
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,040
they will love it.

232
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,081
And they're in it for the long haul.

233
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:48,823
They want to be there while a game is

234
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:51,164
sort of growing and becoming something much bigger than when

235
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:51,624
it started.

236
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:55,975
So they basically want access to you and your game

237
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:56,856
as soon as possible.

238
00:09:57,356 --> 00:10:00,219
And you're not going to be in control of when or how

239
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,400
your game attracts super fans.

240
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,342
But you're never going to attract any

241
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,483
if your game isn't out there.

242
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:09,667
And if you do open up your game and absolutely nobody likes it,

243
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:10,427
cool.

244
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:11,748
Work on something else.

245
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,592
If people do pick it up, then your marketing practically

246
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:16,192
writes itself.

247
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:20,050
as your players and fans tell each other exactly what they liked about your game.

248
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,953
Desktop Dungeons is only a quick play puzzle roguelike

249
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:25,176
because that's what people told each other it was.

250
00:10:27,703 --> 00:10:29,484
So in order to maximize open marketing,

251
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:31,485
you want to do things like support the people that

252
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,486
want to make things to do with your game, which

253
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,827
means hosting wikis, retweeting videos,

254
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,087
holding fan art contests.

255
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:40,909
We even had a Didi fan try to make an HTML5 version

256
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:41,289
of the game.

257
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,710
And it was a bit bad, so we sent him the source,

258
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,811
and then we hosted the game for him,

259
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:45,891
and it got continuously better.

260
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,672
And now it's a great way for people to play the game.

261
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,613
Please make it easy to be reached.

262
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:55,257
Have a visible email address on the page that your game is played on or wherever people

263
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:59,801
download it that people can send to each other. So when somebody new finds your game, they

264
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:04,426
know who to talk to. Desktop Dungeons is often attributed to Derek Yu because on the game

265
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:08,470
itself it says tile set by Derek Yu and that's in a color that draws people's attention.

266
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,951
They ignore the rest of it.

267
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:14,278
have a press kit, and use alerts.

268
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:16,519
Like Google alerts, and your Twitter searches,

269
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,180
and everything else, they really, really help

270
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,221
you find people talking about your game right now.

271
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,362
And that's a good way to learn things.

272
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,564
Plus, people will always enjoy having a developer interact

273
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,185
with them on this game they're playing.

274
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,866
Usually, whenever we talk to people

275
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:28,706
who are playing the free version,

276
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:30,927
that turns into like five or 10 sales pretty much immediately.

277
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,668
That snowballs from there.

278
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:39,204
BigOpen helps you test your game to the breaking point.

279
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,066
So how many machines do you have to test on?

280
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:43,327
You're a dev.

281
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:44,548
You know computars, right?

282
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:47,329
I bet you can manage 10, maybe 20.

283
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,831
How much time would it take you to set up all those machines?

284
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,833
How often would you actually test on all those rigs?

285
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:54,775
I'm sure you know where I'm going with this.

286
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,391
Being an open development means that every release

287
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:00,372
is tested by your entire community.

288
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,593
And they will do that on more machines

289
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:04,033
than you could ever hope to manage.

290
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:06,875
They will also try all of the crazy shit

291
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:09,176
that you are never gonna think about trying.

292
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,958
Desktop Dungeons had 15,000 pre-order players

293
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:16,119
during the beta and they found a lot of bugs.

294
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:18,740
For instance, our assumption about reasonable

295
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,481
save game sizes proved slightly inaccurate.

296
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:24,282
DD saves are regenerative.

297
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:28,660
We didn't want to reset anyone's progress if we took things out or changed the game during beta.

298
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:32,429
Saves were also stored in our server because the game ran in Unity's web player.

299
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:40,193
And it wasn't like the saves were inefficient.

300
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,174
Our tests with thousands of games

301
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:43,456
were stored in two to three megs,

302
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,918
but some players were downloading orders of magnitude

303
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,980
more than that every time, causing memory issues

304
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,981
and timeouts and stuff.

305
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,283
It turns out that if we hadn't been open,

306
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:55,125
we'd only have seen similar symptoms months after release,

307
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:57,847
when people were at the 200 plus hours of playtime.

308
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:59,068
And that would have been pretty terrible.

309
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,092
That fix is now one of just 900 bugs

310
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,654
that's in our bug tracker that we closed before release.

311
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:10,334
That much testing meant that the eventual Steam release

312
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,675
was much smoother than expected.

313
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,417
The contrast that we have is our Linux build,

314
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:16,238
which we released after PC and Mac,

315
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:18,159
and we couldn't test it on the web player.

316
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,062
Despite being less than 1% of our total sales,

317
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:26,385
more people posted post-release bugs on Linux

318
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:27,886
than for PC and Mac combined.

319
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:32,969
Here are some ways to get the most out of your testing.

320
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,800
Make sure everyone is playing the latest version.

321
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,142
There is no value in getting reports of bugs

322
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:38,982
that have already been fixed.

323
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:41,644
Make sure your game reports crashes back to you.

324
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:43,124
Tons of players are going to play,

325
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:45,026
and just assume that bugs are going to get fixed.

326
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,267
So you can't rely on everyone to report their bugs.

327
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:50,169
And have a single thread or reporter for your bugs.

328
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,690
You don't want to go trawling through your forums

329
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,151
to find every bug that's out there.

330
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:59,394
So being open often can help you get paid, too.

331
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:01,335
So I guess this sounds pretty awesome.

332
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:02,376
But.

333
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:05,536
If you think about it, that might be a little bit counterintuitive.

334
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,777
Why would giving something away for free for a pretty long time

335
00:14:09,258 --> 00:14:10,118
help you earn money?

336
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:11,178
Two reasons.

337
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:14,039
Obscurity kills, and there are a lot more ways

338
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,000
to get paid than you think.

339
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,861
If you jealously guard what you're working on

340
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:21,302
until it's done and release it, you're

341
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:23,483
going to have to spend a ton marketing your game to people.

342
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,044
And if you do, there's no guarantee

343
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,445
they're going to like the thing after they see it and buy it.

344
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,339
To us, that feels pretty risky.

345
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:32,461
So we'd rather do that green lighting thing

346
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,843
and find out early if people like the seed of our game

347
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,085
and let them spread that seed to other people.

348
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,986
If we see how many people they spread it to,

349
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:40,267
we know how well it might do in the future.

350
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:43,229
The free version of Desktop Dungeons

351
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,770
is still downloaded today.

352
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,792
Players often recommend it to other players

353
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:47,432
that are on the fence.

354
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:49,694
So that tends to happen quite a bit.

355
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:53,377
And yes, people will get annoyed that you're

356
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:55,118
charging for something that used to be free

357
00:14:55,238 --> 00:14:57,580
or saying that what you're doing now is not that wonderful.

358
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,211
But your players tend to make your day in the strangest ways.

359
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:09,034
And selling your game means that you

360
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:10,835
need to understand the value that players see in it.

361
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:12,936
Confusion over value is at the heart

362
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:15,717
of why games are marketed with these weird ancient technical

363
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:18,098
bullet points and weird bargains about the price of cups

364
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:18,999
of coffee or movies.

365
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,380
If you don't know what makes your game valuable,

366
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,820
you're going to have a hard time selling the thing.

367
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:26,455
So the right time to monetize your game

368
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,817
is when people enjoy it enough to ask you for money,

369
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,018
or to ask you how they can give you money for it.

370
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:32,518
Sorry.

371
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,439
If they ask you for money, you've done something wrong.

372
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,501
But every game and team is different,

373
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:40,622
with different needs and different player communities

374
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:41,862
and different people that enjoy the game.

375
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:44,324
So there's no one size fits all approach to getting

376
00:15:44,364 --> 00:15:45,204
paid for an open game.

377
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:51,807
Exactly how you start monetizing your game is going to depend on your own development situation and what you're trying to make.

378
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:58,674
And that's why so much innovation in getting paid for games comes out of games that are currently in open development or have been in open development.

379
00:16:00,015 --> 00:16:03,398
Maybe increasing your price as you add content is going to work for you.

380
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:06,080
Or rolling your own Kickstarter tier-driven thing.

381
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,264
Or maybe a pre-order beater or early access system would have hordes of players replaying your game.

382
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:11,305
Who knows?

383
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,588
Maybe you've got a great idea for some other way

384
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:15,688
to fund your development via Patreon or itch.io

385
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:17,529
or some system that we've never heard of yet,

386
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:18,729
because it doesn't exist.

387
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,130
Whatever it is, I suggest treating it

388
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,570
like everything else in open development.

389
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:25,891
Build a prototype, test it, and see where it goes from there.

390
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:29,092
And trying to get paid is actually

391
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:31,433
what took Desktop Dungeons back to open development,

392
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:32,773
because we stopped.

393
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:36,595
Just sort of before the IGF award around that time.

394
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:39,804
After a year or so of releasing the game for free,

395
00:16:40,184 --> 00:16:41,765
we felt we understood where we wanted to take it.

396
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:44,827
And we were pretty sure that if we closed this thing

397
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:46,448
and worked on it furiously, we'd finish it

398
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:47,129
in a couple of months.

399
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,431
Except by the middle of 2011, we were dead broke

400
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:51,692
and the game wasn't done yet.

401
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:53,534
But it was still earning accolades.

402
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:55,335
Desktop Dungeons was invited to E3

403
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:56,756
as part of the IndieCade showcase.

404
00:16:57,777 --> 00:16:59,458
And we had no way to get there.

405
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,201
So in desperation, and because PayPal had literally

406
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:04,402
just launched in South Africa.

407
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,901
We started offering pre-orders just as I climbed onto a plane

408
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:08,681
heading to E3.

409
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:11,661
By the time I got to LA, we could afford not only the trip,

410
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:13,622
but also the next year of development time.

411
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:15,462
So that was a pretty good flight.

412
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,723
Giving our fans a way to pay us only

413
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:21,043
worked because we'd been open.

414
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:23,864
I mean, if we hadn't, we wouldn't even have fans.

415
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:28,364
So we figured that out, took the game back open again,

416
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:30,505
and we didn't look back after that point.

417
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,905
So maximizing your chances of not starving.

418
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,433
revolve mainly around waiting.

419
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:40,554
So wait as long as you can before you start taking money.

420
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,875
That way, you're more likely to know what people find

421
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:43,815
valuable in your game.

422
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:46,796
And try and let people pay you more.

423
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:50,117
The Didi pre-orders had a support the devs tier

424
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:52,058
that was twice the pre-order price.

425
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:53,218
So instead of $10, it was $20.

426
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:55,899
And more than 50% of the pre-order players

427
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:57,039
bought that game.

428
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,600
And because they liked us, they liked the game.

429
00:17:59,620 --> 00:17:59,680
And

430
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:04,934
As much as it feels like you should

431
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:08,196
be trying to discount your game up front, resist the urge.

432
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,458
Discounts are for when you can no longer change your game

433
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:13,560
to make it better or to make that value more visible.

434
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,302
So don't do weird things like releasing your game

435
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:18,303
or releasing your pre-orders with a bundle deal

436
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:18,984
or something like that.

437
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,065
That will literally kill you.

438
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:22,506
Rather focus on producing the best game you can.

439
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:24,348
If you need to charge more for it, charge more for it.

440
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:25,849
You will get more interested players.

441
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:27,770
Maybe not as many, but they'll be more interested.

442
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,853
Hopefully we've convinced you to try out this open thing.

443
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,754
So what do you need for open development?

444
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:37,994
Well, you need something playable.

445
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:39,955
You need to put your prototypes out there

446
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,695
and see the ones that are getting the most attention

447
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:42,355
and being shared.

448
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:43,516
Take those ones further.

449
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,657
You need to control your communication channels.

450
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:48,357
No, you don't control the Steam forums.

451
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:51,758
What you want is players coming to your site,

452
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:53,559
talking to you on your forum.

453
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,240
You probably also want the game itself

454
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,340
to be sending you information.

455
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:00,721
You need a release schedule.

456
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,072
Having a schedule keeps you on track

457
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,793
and gives your players something to look forward to.

458
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:09,396
You need someone that loves people for playing your game.

459
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:11,818
They've got to help your community grow.

460
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,740
They have to be a gardener, not like a PR drone.

461
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:17,202
If this isn't you, hire someone.

462
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,025
You need to be flexible and capable of change.

463
00:19:22,086 --> 00:19:23,407
Responding to your community is going

464
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,349
to take your game to places you never imagined.

465
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:27,470
You have to be open to opportunities.

466
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:30,753
And you need to get very, very zen.

467
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,040
If someone is angry about a bug, and it's going to happen,

468
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,880
or a payment problem, or anything like that,

469
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,762
just take a step back, breathe, and formulate a calm response.

470
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:44,243
Love and tolerate the shit out of everyone.

471
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:50,544
So open development may not be a panacea for every problem

472
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:51,224
Indies face.

473
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:54,085
But what it does offer are ways to be

474
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,426
more efficient with the resources

475
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:56,286
that you have available.

476
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,929
mainly by allowing a community to help you solve problems.

477
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,331
Indie development is risky enough as it is,

478
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,372
so anything that makes life a little bit easier

479
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,993
is probably something that should be explored.

480
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:08,915
Interestingly enough, you don't have

481
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,738
to be 100% open or streaming every second of your day

482
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,920
to the interwebs just in order to make this work.

483
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,422
It's possible to be as open as you're comfortable with

484
00:20:19,742 --> 00:20:21,403
for as long as you're comfortable

485
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:22,564
with on your current project.

486
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:24,245
As long as you're getting things out

487
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,366
of the relationship with your players, everything's good.

488
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,502
And we suspect that open development is actually

489
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:31,785
going to be a large part of any development in the future,

490
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:33,847
especially for new developers who don't necessarily

491
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:34,608
have reputations.

492
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,551
And we hope you're as keen to try it

493
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,273
after some of these things and questions

494
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:41,696
that you guys might have as we are to keep doing it

495
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:42,537
on our next projects.

496
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,935
we're actually so used to being open

497
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:48,197
that we gave a version of this talk last week.

498
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:51,982
So thanks for enjoying the currently in progress version,

499
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:56,186
and please leave feedback on the evaluations

500
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:57,508
and come chat to us in the wrap-up room

501
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,429
or ask us questions now.

502
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:00,972
And we'll be sure to use that in next week's release

503
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:01,733
of this same talk.

504
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:04,936
So questions if anyone has them.

505
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:19,664
Yeah, my apologies for not getting the timeline right or if I missed something with the talk,

506
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,367
but it sounds like you started the game as open, you prototyped it, then you went closed

507
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:28,749
for a little bit, then you're like, oh, we need money, so then you made it open again.

508
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:35,013
But when you went open again, you made a gate, so a pay gate, so it's like you're open development

509
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,934
but yet you have to pay to be the open development.

510
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:39,676
It's not like you guys had the game free out there the whole time.

511
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,117
you know, anybody could get it.

512
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:44,018
You had to pay for early access.

513
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:44,979
And you also said in the beginning

514
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:46,440
that it's not early access.

515
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,363
So do you, excuse me, did you use early access

516
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:52,185
and had your own pay gate as well?

517
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:53,706
Could you just clarify that a little bit?

518
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:54,186
Oh, OK.

519
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:58,890
So is the question, why did we say

520
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,772
open development isn't STEAM early access,

521
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,313
but we still had our own pay gate?

522
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:03,734
OK, cool.

523
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:06,437
So the reason we say it's not early access

524
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:08,518
is because people tend to release on early access way

525
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:09,079
too early.

526
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,819
It's often a thing, I mean like Steam is a firehose of users.

527
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:17,503
You do not want to send that at like a prototype that

528
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:19,504
is not going to catch a bunch of people up front.

529
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:21,326
Like maybe it's a good prototype,

530
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:26,149
and two out of every 50 people are going to really love it.

531
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:27,971
And that's like a good rate for a prototype.

532
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:30,052
Most people hate everything, so that's cool.

533
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:34,696
But that prototype could be made better and better and better

534
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:37,238
until it's going to catch like say two out of every 10 people.

535
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:40,419
that's the stage you want to put it on early access,

536
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,321
because it's this firehose of users.

537
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:45,483
So do early access once you've been doing

538
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:46,944
kind of like some sort of open development,

539
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:49,106
even if it's a gated pay system on your own site,

540
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:51,767
for a while, until you understand your game.

541
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:53,629
That's kind of the reason we were talking about that.

542
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:54,669
Does that answer the question?

543
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,311
Yeah, I think so.

544
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:01,654
OK.

545
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:01,854
Cool.

546
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:02,755
Is that it?

547
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:03,235
No one else?

548
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:04,877
All right.

549
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:08,386
Just to preempt one question that's probably going to bounce

550
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:09,227
around a bunch of people's heads,

551
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,747
you can make a narrative-heavy game open.

552
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:12,688
Oh.

553
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:14,428
Controversial.

554
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:15,288
You totally can.

555
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,949
It's just maybe you don't open it to game players.

556
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:21,690
Maybe you open it to people who are on a writing forum.

557
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,371
Or maybe you open it to other people

558
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:24,611
who are focusing on narrative.

559
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,231
There are communities that you can use.

560
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,752
There are places that you can test things on.

561
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:29,652
In fact, these days I would say it's probably

562
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:32,713
a really good idea to make a narrative game open because.

563
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,509
With inclusivity and diversity and everything else

564
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:39,172
being such a big focus, as a single writer,

565
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:40,453
you're not going to be very good at that.

566
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,275
And it's best to get more voices and more people playing

567
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:45,376
and looking into your story and everything else

568
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:46,057
you're focusing on.

569
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,620
So try and make narrative stuff open.

570
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,680
I think it would be interesting.

571
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,122
It's cool.

572
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,804
And yeah, thanks for coming to our talk instead of the soapbox.
