1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,963
But the micro talks are really, I think it's a really exciting

2
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:12,287
thing that earlier, later last year, Mike and Tim emailed me

3
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:14,730
and they said we want to do something fun and exciting and

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,252
super high energy because even though it's an incredible day,

5
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:21,055
it is a long day in a room. So we up the stakes a bit with some

6
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:22,917
micro talks. And they're short talks.

7
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:27,319
but not just short, they're very, very specifically timed.

8
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:30,701
We have 10 speakers, each speaker got 20 slides,

9
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,722
and each slide plays at precisely 16 seconds.

10
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:36,364
There's no longer, it is no shorter,

11
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,044
the talks have to fit like that.

12
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,971
we could all fuck it up and it can go horribly wrong and we will

13
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:45,794
you'll just have an adventure with us stumbling over our own words

14
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:49,197
uh... so you guys ready for some fast-paced

15
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,039
ranting, raving

16
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:55,782
crazy, not necessarily about making animation but definitely about making

17
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:56,723
animation in video games

18
00:00:56,743 --> 00:01:01,287
I won't yell on the mic, I promise

19
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:06,530
And our theme for this year, I don't know if we'll do them in

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,551
the future. If you fill out evaluations and you like it,

21
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:12,531
maybe we will. But our theme for this year was one of perception.

22
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:17,112
So with all that being said, I'm going to read off my phone

23
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:20,213
because it's the only way I practice this. And here we go.

24
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:29,335
Hi. I'm Lana Byszynski and I am an animator with Lizard

25
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,375
Entertainment currently working on Heroes of the Storm.

26
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:35,567
I'm here realistically because I'm new and therefore I don't know very much.

27
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:40,068
This is my first big girl job and thus the following are all mistakes I made or somehow

28
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:44,289
stumbled my way into. This micro talk will largely be informative for those of you who

29
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:49,010
are still students or in your first year or two in the industry. To those of you who may

30
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,651
have had to manage a wide-eyed newbie like myself, I would hope that this serves as a

31
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:55,811
reminder or if nothing else has you wax a little nostalgic.

32
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:00,294
My first year in the industry was a robust lesson in balance.

33
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,737
It's exceedingly difficult to sum up the incredible levels

34
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:06,100
of change my life went through in the first year on the job,

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,023
but you can feel free to ask me about more specific anecdotes

36
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:09,684
after the fact.

37
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:12,286
My first and most important lesson

38
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:14,208
was probably that no one really cares about you.

39
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,883
When I began I had the mindset that if I sat down, worked as hard as I could muster with a smile on my face,

40
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:22,786
my employers would see my hard work and positivity,

41
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:26,148
and my career would simply progress onward unimpeded into eternity.

42
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:28,610
Needless to say, it was an incredible error.

43
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:32,333
There's a palpable disconnect between what a manager sees as important,

44
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:34,836
and what a new employee thinks is important.

45
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:39,019
It's so easy to feel neglected, but it's a business, not a summer camp.

46
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,801
Turns out there's no gold stars for simply doing your job.

47
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:45,547
They hire you expecting a high quality delivery.

48
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:47,608
The reality is that no one will manage

49
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:48,589
your career better than you.

50
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:49,930
You want to progress?

51
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,870
Tell somebody.

52
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:53,492
Set tangible milestones with your managers

53
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:55,133
so you have a gauge you can both read

54
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:56,594
to measure how you're improving over time.

55
00:02:57,215 --> 00:02:58,375
Be proactive with your career

56
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,036
because no one will love it more than you.

57
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:03,793
Learn your tools and then refocus on the craft.

58
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:06,635
Stop trying to make the best work right out of the gate.

59
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:08,356
Don't act like you know what's up

60
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,517
because chances are you're working

61
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,398
with some kind of proprietary something.

62
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:13,320
Learn your pipeline and tools first.

63
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,101
Ask a ton of questions so you've got

64
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:16,882
at least one foot underneath you going forward.

65
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:19,507
If you think you're communicating enough, you aren't.

66
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,688
You should be talking to anyone you're directly

67
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:24,369
or even indirectly working with a staggering amount more

68
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:25,329
than you think you should be.

69
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:28,150
There have been too many times I disregarded my own opinion

70
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,150
just because I was new.

71
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,391
I actually still find myself doing this.

72
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:33,812
Realistically, if you see something,

73
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:34,932
you should say something.

74
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:36,993
Just because you're new doesn't mean

75
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:38,153
your opinion isn't worthwhile.

76
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:40,774
It is so much better to make a commotion over something

77
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:43,415
that's potentially nothing than to not make a commotion

78
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,215
over something that's potentially disastrous.

79
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,962
As it turns out, almost nobody wants uninvited critique.

80
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,964
Every point could probably start with this sentence,

81
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:54,626
but this isn't university anymore.

82
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:56,347
Many people aren't looking to get better

83
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:57,909
in any sort of hardcore critical way.

84
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,631
Establish a safe space for such things.

85
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:02,073
Get to know your colleagues,

86
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:04,315
but even so, I advise proceeding with caution.

87
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:08,543
Progressing smoothly in the workplace is such an insane Goldilocks situation.

88
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:11,588
Communicate, but not too much or you obviously need supervision.

89
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:15,133
Brainstorm, but not too much because you obviously can't work independently.

90
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:18,798
Learn to say no, but don't really say no because you're not being a team player.

91
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:23,799
Your colleagues, managers and producers are generally going to be drastically different.

92
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,943
Do what you can to find and install their various language packs so you can turn feedback

93
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:30,105
into items you can understand and act upon.

94
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:34,289
If you can find the root of someone's desires, you can deliver what they're looking for,

95
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,032
even if it's not explicitly what they're asking for.

96
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:39,558
Don't make work your only passion.

97
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,081
Despite everything, you should be open to critique

98
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:43,502
because work is not about you.

99
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:45,704
Over-investing will leave you devastated

100
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,006
when something is inevitably cut.

101
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:48,727
You're being paid to do this.

102
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,490
Make it great, but don't make it a personal outlet.

103
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,531
Find a hobby.

104
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:57,875
Yes, maybe you are lucky and have an incredibly robust and well-rounded workplace that fills

105
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:01,737
each and every one of your creative nooks and crannies, leaving you to feel entirely fulfilled

106
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:07,982
in your life by your job, but A, probably not, and B, job security is truly the gateway drug

107
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:13,806
to stagnating creatively. RSIs are no joke. I distinctly remember laughing inwardly at a

108
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,908
teacher who tried to tell her class how dangerous working at a computer could be.

109
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:21,487
Joke's on me, I sleep with wrist braces now because otherwise I wake up with no feeling

110
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:23,369
in my poor, pathetic, curled up little paws.

111
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,010
Take care of your body.

112
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:27,613
Work gets hard if life gets hard.

113
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:32,257
Beyond finding creative extracurricular activities, you should have an extracurricular life.

114
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:36,121
You know I'm still school-brained because I still think of anything outside my routine

115
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:39,865
obligation as extracurricular, but what I mean is it's important to have a life away

116
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:40,485
from the office.

117
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:42,967
Establish a work-life balance early.

118
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:46,148
Make sure you have personal outlets who aren't your colleagues,

119
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:48,468
so if something in your life does become difficult,

120
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:50,669
you have a safe space to leave that emotional baggage,

121
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:52,029
namely at home.

122
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,351
Please, everyone, I beg you to stop looking for your spouse in the workplace.

123
00:05:58,018 --> 00:06:00,699
You're there for a reason. You were hired because someone

124
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:03,480
believes that you're capable. No one is doing you a favor

125
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,301
through the act of employing you. Surprise, surprise, no one

126
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:09,162
really cares about your self-esteem. You join a team

127
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,203
because they see something that you can do that will make the

128
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:15,744
project better. And so, believe you can make it better. Don't

129
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:18,065
sell yourself short. It is just as important as not being an

130
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,866
egotistical asshole. Don't talk yourself or your work down. Do

131
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,187
the best you're able to do and be proud of what you accomplish.

132
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:27,208
Remember, not everyone gets to make games for a living.

133
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,342
Finally, make sure that you stay connected.

134
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:33,444
Be nice, make friends, and then make friends

135
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:34,866
you can direct every single one

136
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:37,008
of your embarrassing questions to, like me.

137
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:39,350
Hopefully before anything manages to happen.

138
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,672
You can find me pretty much anywhere on the internet

139
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:44,734
at LataiandI or email me at lbyszynski at blizzard.com.

140
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:45,755
Thank you for your time.

141
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:09,025
So I've got to follow that. Here we are. All right. So you guys

142
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:12,346
have seen me a bunch now today, right? I'm Mike Jungbluth. I'm

143
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:16,307
lead animator at Volition and I'm one of the co-organizers of

144
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,908
the boot camp here. So let's go.

145
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:23,215
I stand upon this soap box to give my perception of some

146
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:27,099
animators outdated perception of game animation. Which is my

147
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:29,922
long winded way of saying some animators have got their heads

148
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:33,587
up their asses. Now what allows me to make such a sensational

149
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:35,208
accusation? Well, I have a very good sense of humor. I have a

150
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:39,633
Beyond the animator cred I hope this picture provides, after

151
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:42,116
interviewing some animators this year at Volition and reviewing

152
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:45,020
some recurring feedback we get about the boot camp, I've had

153
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,623
the chance to step back and look at the game animation landscape.

154
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:50,746
And a few alarming tendencies keep popping up.

155
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,757
First, some believe animation should be purely about asset

156
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:57,801
creation and the implementation isn't real animation work.

157
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,845
Second, they want to focus on facial animation as a primary

158
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:03,688
responsibility. And third, they're influenced primarily by

159
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:06,251
movies, games and comics. And this makes me sad because

160
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:09,744
You see, these are people that aren't cementing their futures

161
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:12,486
but cementing their feet to the bottom of an increasingly

162
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,589
growing pool of animators. Even worse, it's limiting the

163
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,532
performances of the characters they are creating, the design

164
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:21,595
they could be communicating and stagnating what the medium is

165
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:22,636
even capable of.

166
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:27,617
Now, I'm not here to undervalue the need to focus on traditional skills,

167
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:31,503
but the slave-like devotion to the craft is becoming a crutch,

168
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:33,526
not a valuable source of inspiration.

169
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:36,810
The process and reasons behind the 12 principles

170
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,336
is being ignored while bowing at the altar of the nine old men.

171
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:43,418
Now, before you lynch me with your Pixar pointed pitchforks,

172
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:46,661
let me explain why this is so damaging. See, believing it's

173
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:49,363
about asset creation is like trying to tell a joke by

174
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,644
crafting only the words than having someone with a different

175
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:55,708
sense of humor or timing tell the punch line. Implementation,

176
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:59,170
not the individual assets, is where a fully realized character

177
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,413
comes to life. A performance is about how all of a character's

178
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:05,315
thoughts and actions come together, not the individual

179
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,176
motions or even individual words.

180
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:09,881
When was the last time you watched Empire Strikes Back and said,

181
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:13,768
Damn, I just love the way Darth Vader said the word, Father.

182
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,851
but I can hear some of you thinking, well, if he didn't

183
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:19,971
have a mask on and you could see the emotion on his face when he

184
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:22,772
said the word father, you might have cared about the word or

185
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:26,673
specific expression. This is why facial animation should be such

186
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:30,473
a big focus. Maybe. Except most cameras look like this, this or

187
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:34,394
this. Right? Focusing on facial makes for some nice showcase

188
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:37,615
moments, but it's a secondary form of communication in most

189
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:40,735
games with little chance of subtle range thanks not only to

190
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:43,136
these cameras, but to the subjects we tackle.

191
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:48,244
with most games being focused on power fantasies, the primary

192
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,505
expressions and emotions you're going to see are anger,

193
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:53,827
disgust and contempt. Certainly not something we need a team of

194
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:57,669
animators focused on. Which leads to the big problem at the

195
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,512
root of these issues as I see it. When asked what inspires,

196
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:04,814
the common answer is movies, games, comics. When what you

197
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:07,795
spend most of your time doing, thinking and talking about are

198
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:10,557
finished forms of popular media, it will primarily shape your

199
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:10,737
work.

200
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:15,882
animation is about creating the illusion of life. And you can't

201
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:19,485
create it if you don't have one. I'd go a step further. You can't

202
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:22,067
create interesting life if you have the same one as everyone

203
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:24,869
else. Because if your life is consumed by all of the same

204
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:27,972
experiences delivered by mainstream pop culture, how can

205
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:30,554
you truly create performances that aren't just incestual

206
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:31,375
regurgitations?

207
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:34,803
The most influential and successful characters came from

208
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,384
outside of the media loop. Pokemon from an interest in

209
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,665
collecting bugs. Star Wars from the hero's journey. Nate Meyer on

210
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:42,966
Elm Street from a newspaper article about Asian death

211
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:45,907
syndrome. What's sad is we all know this but we still live

212
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:49,208
happily within the echo chamber. And what's just as sad is

213
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,969
betrayed by my slides and references is I'm just as guilty

214
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:55,031
of having these same tendencies. I'm always catching myself being

215
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,552
a big old dummy about what makes me a real animator.

216
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:01,961
But it's my hope and intention that we can actually change the

217
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:05,723
perception of what it means to be a game animator. We're more

218
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:08,884
than a singular fluid animation. We're more than a silly

219
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:12,386
expression. And we're more than the toys on our shelves. We are

220
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,428
the communicators of the game's characters and mechanics. And we

221
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,289
give voice to the personality of the player.

222
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:22,849
We're capable of communicating characters and experiences that

223
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,914
haven't been seen a million times before. And it's our

224
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:29,659
responsibility to do so with an authenticity and honesty that

225
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,303
made all of the classic characters feel so real. Because

226
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,886
that's how you create a lasting legacy and that's how you

227
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:36,649
inspire the next generation of creatives.

228
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,072
And while I know for many of us games, comics and film were a

229
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,155
form of escapism that defined our personality and allowed us

230
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:46,559
to embrace the role of a social outsider, it should simply be

231
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:49,242
our doorway to finding ourselves, not the place we hang

232
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:52,225
our hat for the rest of our lives. So what's my approach?

233
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:55,468
How about instead of another stitch pop vinyl maybe a jade

234
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,812
plant. Instead of this year's big comic event look at the

235
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:01,575
Pulitzer prize for general non-fiction. And instead of

236
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,478
seeing that big blockbuster five times in theaters find your

237
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:06,861
closest state or national park and allow yourself to be

238
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,704
immersed in the world around you. Because you never know what

239
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:12,607
might become a new passion or inspiration for both yourself

240
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,249
and the next generation of creatives.

241
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,891
here are a few of the different things that have delightfully

242
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,474
surprised me in their inspiration. But I'd love to

243
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:24,718
hear what motivates and inspires all of you. So look me up. Drop

244
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:26,981
me a line at any of these places. And let's go about

245
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,703
sharing and inspiring one another with all sorts of new

246
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:32,506
experiences and references. And I can't wait to see what

247
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,489
characters, performances and experiences you'll all create

248
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,470
next. Thank you.

249
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:16,065
All right.

250
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,852
Hey everyone, my name is Jeet Shroff.

251
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:25,554
A vast majority of my time in the industry

252
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,716
has been spent working on the design and development

253
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:30,619
of character gameplay features on games like FIFA,

254
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,541
Far Cry 3, and Just Cause 3.

255
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:35,744
Currently, I'm the gameplay engineering lead

256
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:36,745
at Sony Santa Monica.

257
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,824
Now crafting game characters that move and feel well realized

258
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,567
is a complex set of ingredients coming together.

259
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:46,470
And hitting the right balance of emotion, intent,

260
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:49,614
responsiveness, and fidelity is a tricky problem.

261
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:52,116
But when your characters finally come to life

262
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,358
with their gameplay, it feels amazing.

263
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,400
So what's the magic formula, right?

264
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,301
How do we go from good to great gameplay?

265
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:00,443
An often overlooked ingredient here

266
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:02,785
is the relationship that exists between the animator

267
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:04,626
and the programmer or designer.

268
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:06,387
And I'll use the last two interchangeably.

269
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:08,789
So here are a few small things we

270
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,530
can do to build stronger partnerships.

271
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,952
First, remove the middleman.

272
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,113
I'm hoping this is a thing of the past,

273
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,475
but I still hear of teams that work in their own departments

274
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,757
providing each other lists of requirements

275
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:22,059
with work being passed down from team to team

276
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,580
vetted by layers of management.

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,181
And this drives me insane.

278
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,364
Gameplay realization is all about rapid iteration.

279
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:29,024
We know this.

280
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:31,146
Nothing slows down iteration more

281
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,548
than having to work separately on a feature in a silo,

282
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:36,010
hoping that the work you do will magically work

283
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,451
for the next person down the chain.

284
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:40,013
If you take one thing from this talk, it's this.

285
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:43,164
Next, try and sit together.

286
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,485
There's the reason long distance relationships

287
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,966
are really hard and often fail.

288
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,667
I wish I could go back in time

289
00:14:48,707 --> 00:14:50,448
and make up for all those wasted college years,

290
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,969
but I promise you, when it comes to the type of work we do,

291
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:55,410
proximity really matters.

292
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:58,351
I've seen jumps in quality

293
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:00,392
simply because programmers and animators

294
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:03,414
working on a feature were rearranged to sit together.

295
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:05,955
If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense.

296
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:09,516
If you need to work closely, communicate often and iterate,

297
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,801
You're going to do a better job if that person is sitting close to you.

298
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,163
Proximity inherently means trust.

299
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:17,565
Next, establish a vocabulary.

300
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,968
People are all different, particularly in the case of programmers and animators.

301
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,911
I'm sure you know we can argue semantics to death.

302
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:28,875
You will save a lot of time and energy if you simply agree on a vocabulary and then stick to it.

303
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:35,107
This can and should apply to everything from game features to technology and even animation sets and naming.

304
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:39,689
It's important to know what everyone means when they say warping or interactables or reactions

305
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:44,031
and what components of that, you know, of the game fall under those buckets,

306
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,632
which leads us to finding ways to communicate.

307
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,874
Communication isn't just about sending emails and doing stand-ups, those things help,

308
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:54,435
but it's also all the additional things to get the information across.

309
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,216
The first thing to start doing...

310
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,206
is communicating via actions.

311
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:03,089
When you get up, act out, and show someone what you mean,

312
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:05,110
things become so much more clear,

313
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,072
even if that makes you look a little silly.

314
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:09,674
And in cases where you can't act something out,

315
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:11,475
communicate using reference.

316
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:13,236
This really helps when you're trying

317
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:14,658
to understand the subjectives,

318
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:16,679
like when something isn't smooth enough

319
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:17,860
or needs to feel snappy.

320
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:20,162
I guarantee you, if you did a bit of homework,

321
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:21,643
you'd find some form of reference,

322
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:24,025
or better yet, another game that you can use

323
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,006
to get your point across.

324
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:27,890
Using reference really clarifies the deltas

325
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,793
of what we want more of or less of,

326
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:31,495
and those are hard things to communicate.

327
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:33,598
There's so much more reference available now,

328
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,320
so please use it.

329
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:37,416
Next, care about each other's craft.

330
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:40,599
We're not primarily here to talk about animated movies

331
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,419
or TV, right?

332
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,120
Sorry, JD.

333
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,802
But we've chosen to be part of game development.

334
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:46,904
Games are highly technical in nature.

335
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,526
Not caring about implementation is like finally

336
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,567
building that Ferrari for someone else to drive.

337
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:54,149
Having a genuine interest about the how

338
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:55,811
will make you a better game animator.

339
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:57,912
And for the programmers, it's our job

340
00:16:57,952 --> 00:17:00,575
to educate our counterparts on how the tools

341
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,896
and systems work and what that means for content.

342
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,360
Take time to understand what good looks like

343
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,121
for the animator.

344
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:08,545
Do this for however long it takes

345
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:10,088
and as often as necessary.

346
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,838
understand that this kind of development

347
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:15,398
is a symbiotic relationship.

348
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:18,380
Now I know making games is like a never-ending race

349
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,521
against the clock, much like this presentation.

350
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:23,402
But we spend a lot of time doing things

351
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:24,362
that are just bullshit.

352
00:17:24,822 --> 00:17:27,103
Meetings that we choose to go to so we feel important

353
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:28,444
even though we don't need to be there,

354
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:30,705
or hours of philosophical discussions

355
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,726
about how to do something instead of just doing it.

356
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:34,046
Do this instead.

357
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:35,807
Spend time getting to know each other

358
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:37,308
and each other's craft.

359
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,780
Once you've got something working,

360
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,221
play it together in the build.

361
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,823
What's nice about this is you'll share your successes

362
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,084
together when things work out.

363
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,366
But when they don't, you'll get to see the problems

364
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:49,527
and talk about them in the context of the game.

365
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:51,929
You'll identify which areas truly matter

366
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:53,991
and use it as a tool to generate meaningful work.

367
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,114
Don't get caught up on titles.

368
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:58,156
Look, titles matter, it's true.

369
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,098
But don't let that get in the way

370
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,659
of making the best game possible.

371
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:04,362
Don't bias or pass over valuable feedback

372
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:05,863
because the person talking to you

373
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:07,424
isn't an animator or a programmer.

374
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,226
Focus on a person's ability

375
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:12,869
and then use your best judgment to decide what to do.

376
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,412
Finally, a sure way of developing trust

377
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,713
is simply doing your job.

378
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,709
even though you might not get a gold star.

379
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,270
But when you get things done,

380
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,111
people begin to pay attention.

381
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,871
And when you do your job well,

382
00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:25,512
people will begin to trust you.

383
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:26,052
Thank you.

384
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:26,393
Thank you.

385
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:41,420
Thank you.

386
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,821
This is when everything is going to go wrong,

387
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,862
just to manage expectations.

388
00:18:48,724 --> 00:19:00,752
All right. Okay, does it automatically show up? Do I have

389
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:05,214
to hit something else? Huh? F5, see? Guys, this is going to be

390
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:13,700
great. All right. I want to move this, please. Hello, everybody.

391
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:17,316
My name is Billy Harper, I'm the animation lead at Sucker Punch,

392
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:19,738
and now for something completely different.

393
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:24,621
How many times have important discussions been held

394
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:30,245
where really original and creative ideas were desperately needed,

395
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:36,729
but where humor was taboo because the subject being discussed was so serious?

396
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:41,375
It's not automatically advancing, so that's great.

397
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:44,118
OK, no, why is it so serious?

398
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:47,702
What John Cleese says here is unfortunately true.

399
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:51,707
But I think that we, if we take ourselves

400
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,510
less serious at the workplace, we can actually

401
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,712
cultivate creativity.

402
00:19:58,034 --> 00:19:59,916
It's not advancing automatically.

403
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:03,069
All right, I'm just going to, okay,

404
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,570
so this is my cube at work.

405
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,591
There's a quote down there that is the inspiration

406
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:10,591
for this talk itself.

407
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,712
It's too long to read and it's not going to,

408
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:14,673
I can't say the entire thing,

409
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,634
but basically it means we have to have fun at work.

410
00:20:19,194 --> 00:20:21,635
The moment that you don't give a shit

411
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,996
is when all of a sudden you have nothing to lose.

412
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:27,117
And once you have nothing to lose,

413
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:29,697
it's going to be even more creative.

414
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:31,058
I found this to be true.

415
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:37,180
And that one's not playing. Awesome.

416
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:44,846
The most creative has simply acquired a facility for getting themselves into a particular mood.

417
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:46,608
A way of operating.

418
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:50,692
Which allowed their natural creativity to function.

419
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:52,453
An ability to play.

420
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:54,464
Play.

421
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:56,266
We keep on talking about this.

422
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,008
Create a safe place.

423
00:20:58,188 --> 00:20:59,289
It's OK to play.

424
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,253
Get into the open mode where you are more receptive.

425
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,395
It's OK to fail.

426
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:06,958
This is a message that's repeated over and over.

427
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,780
Even in this documentary, six days

428
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,405
to air about the production of one South Park episode.

429
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:19,062
Writer's room is off limits.

430
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:25,605
I will only bother the writer's room if there's something that has got to be dealt with or answered right on the spot.

431
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,107
We never had cameras in the writers room.

432
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,048
I mean, it's a really, it's kind of a safe place.

433
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:36,851
Again, safe place. It's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to fail.

434
00:21:40,803 --> 00:21:43,344
like now. I don't take any offense. You didn't like my idea.

435
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:46,245
And you got to feel like it is kind of it's weirdly vulnerable.

436
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:47,686
I've had friends that worked at other shows.

437
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:50,667
And if you say something that doesn't work, they're like, it sucks.

438
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:51,748
You suck. You're not funny.

439
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:53,949
And these guys, it's actually a very kind room.

440
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:55,209
And I think like the worst you get is.

441
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,770
OK, she said, OK.

442
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,232
All right. For me, a big part of this is.

443
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:04,593
I don't take any offense.

444
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:06,634
You didn't like my idea and you got to. There we go.

445
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:08,366
It's about perspective.

446
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,567
And my perspective comes where I'm from.

447
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:14,708
I'm from southern West Virginia, go ears, a coal town,

448
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:17,289
where it's physically tough.

449
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:18,470
It's long hours.

450
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,410
It's dangerous.

451
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,551
There's actually a term called the hootow,

452
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,113
which is the shift, where you work all night underground.

453
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:28,974
It's thankless.

454
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:30,115
There's no legacy.

455
00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:32,115
You never had a child that come up to somebody

456
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:34,536
with a lump of coal and say, thank you for changing my life.

457
00:22:35,762 --> 00:22:36,863
It's also dangerous.

458
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:45,028
When I was in grade school, I had three different friends that lost their fathers in the coal mines.

459
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,272
We don't make decisions that are life and death.

460
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:58,250
However, we actually make decisions that allow other people to escape whatever may be depressing for them.

461
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,952
That's huge. That's something that's aspirational.

462
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:08,214
But how can we expect other people to escape if we don't have the facility to be able to escape ourselves?

463
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:11,956
To be able to come out of the day-to-day and just have fun?

464
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:14,993
Here's some of the methods.

465
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:17,497
One of my favorite, this is why I'm starting with it,

466
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:20,681
get together, go to a bar, get drunk.

467
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,764
There's no hierarchy there.

468
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:24,026
And you talk about stuff,

469
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,449
and then awesome games happen, guys.

470
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:30,135
There's no way alcohol didn't have anything

471
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:30,936
to do with this stuff.

472
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:35,912
Another thing at Sucker Punch, we have hip chat,

473
00:23:35,952 --> 00:23:38,436
we have chat rooms that are dedicated just for people

474
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:39,177
to go and have fun.

475
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:42,742
We have one called the Mark Wahlberg experience,

476
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:44,885
where we post pics of Marky Mark,

477
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:46,768
and then we actually have a theory about whether

478
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:48,350
him and Matt Damon are the same person.

479
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,201
We also have the ideal wall.

480
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:54,342
This is an open wall in the hallway

481
00:23:54,362 --> 00:23:56,504
that you can just walk by and you can take a card

482
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:58,606
and a little magnet and put it up and you have an idea.

483
00:23:58,806 --> 00:23:59,927
And other people can go by and they

484
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:02,469
can put a little thumbs up beside it and they can like it.

485
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,092
And it's OK if the idea isn't accepted.

486
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,953
And it's a lot more open.

487
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:11,836
Now here, though, is why I'm wearing my suit

488
00:24:12,237 --> 00:24:13,578
that everybody sees.

489
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,000
My favorite method to do this at work

490
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,042
and to get into a state of play is on the mocap volume.

491
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,880
Is it playing?

492
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,540
It's not playing.

493
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:28,962
It's an area we have at Sucker Punch

494
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:32,403
that we don't have to worry about how much time we're

495
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:34,964
spending there because it's free.

496
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:37,545
And we get to play with others.

497
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:41,407
As Principal McGee says, it's better to play with a group

498
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:42,447
than with yourself.

499
00:24:44,142 --> 00:24:49,727
So let's go back to the original quote that was too small for you guys to see from Bruce Lee.

500
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:52,870
Art reaches its greatest peak when devoid of self-consciousness.

501
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,113
Freedom discovers man the moment he loses concern

502
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,156
over what impression he's making or about to make.

503
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:03,680
That is truly the art of not giving a shit.

504
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:15,415
Let's see, so basically what you want to do is you want to help others create a safe spot at work.

505
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:21,661
Play with others at work. Don't play with yourself at work.

506
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:28,127
HR smile, they frown on that guys. It's happened twice now.

507
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:35,471
So have fun, get drunk with people, meet up with your friends,

508
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:39,214
and just get inspired and come away and help other people get inspired.

509
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:04,554
I just want to leave that up there.

510
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:06,836
That's, oh now he's sad.

511
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:11,840
Oh yeah?

512
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:21,467
I feel like this didn't need to be as complicated as we made it.

513
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,193
Can everybody, no one can see it?

514
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,474
Drag it over?

515
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:41,334
I couldn't figure out PowerPoint. Oh shit!

516
00:26:44,456 --> 00:26:52,001
We're skipping ahead. Oh my God, this is really hard.

517
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:57,425
It's probably not hard. I'm just not bright. Okay.

518
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:10,227
Hi, my name is Gwen. My name is Gwen Frey and I'm a technical animator.

519
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:12,308
I've been in the industry for eight years now.

520
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:16,590
About two years ago I went indie and I just shipped my very first indie title,

521
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,252
The Flame in the Flood. But my talk is not about that.

522
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:23,753
My talk is not about animation. It's about animators.

523
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:26,115
I want to ask you a very important question.

524
00:27:26,735 --> 00:27:28,756
Why are animators so damn weird?

525
00:27:31,137 --> 00:27:31,757
Because...

526
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:37,789
Being an animator is not a job like working in a bank or something like that.

527
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,153
Being an animator comes with identity. It's like how when you see a used car salesman

528
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:44,394
and someone tells you they're a used car salesman, you go,

529
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:48,338
oh, I'm never going to trust you. When someone says they're an animator,

530
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:51,340
you know they're going to be weird. And I was trying to figure out why.

531
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,743
Like, maybe only weird people want to become animators.

532
00:27:55,803 --> 00:27:59,206
Like, maybe this is a field that attracts weird people, but that's not the case.

533
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:00,507
People start normal.

534
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:04,171
and then they start animating, and then they lose their minds.

535
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:06,874
And I have some theories as to why.

536
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:08,896
My first theory is this.

537
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:13,200
I believe that watching the same thing on loop all day

538
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:14,702
is literally torture.

539
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:19,400
and i'm going to give you an example now of what it is like

540
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,481
who can be better than this?

541
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:22,623
that was 16 seconds

542
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:48,660
What could be better than this?

543
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,160
What?

544
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,082
What could be better than this?

545
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:54,023
That was 30 seconds total.

546
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:57,245
If you work an 8 hour day,

547
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,647
you would see the equivalent of that clip

548
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:02,028
28,800 times.

549
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,410
You'll dream about that at night.

550
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:08,132
That'll stay with you.

551
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:10,914
But it's not just actually watching the animations.

552
00:29:10,954 --> 00:29:12,595
When you animate, you make the face

553
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:13,976
of the characters you're animating.

554
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:18,094
Like, you get into character. You have to. You can't help it.

555
00:29:18,454 --> 00:29:22,375
So you'll be sitting at your desk making random-ass faces as you work.

556
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:23,916
And this can be good.

557
00:29:24,336 --> 00:29:27,597
Like, if you're working on something that's cute and adorable,

558
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,937
or if you're working on a character that's happy, you'll be smiling all day.

559
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:34,578
You'll be smiling all day and you'll be like, almost a little bit stupid,

560
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:37,219
because you're just cheerful for no reason and you're skipping.

561
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:40,680
Because that's what happens when you smile all day.

562
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,560
But most games aren't like that. Most games are dark.

563
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,824
So you'll find yourself making angry faces or sad faces or whatever your character is going through

564
00:29:50,864 --> 00:29:53,626
and then you'll go home and you'll pick a fight with your boyfriend for like no reason.

565
00:29:55,127 --> 00:30:00,351
And that's not okay. But it's even worse than that because before you animate, you've heard

566
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:06,996
everyone talking about it, you actually act out these scenes. So you get to act out dying slowly.

567
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:13,941
You get to act out crawling to your inevitable demise. You get to act out whatever the fuck this is.

568
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:22,129
And you're probably not very fit because you sit at a desk all

569
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:26,014
day. So you're not going to look cool while you do it. You're

570
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:30,100
going to look ridiculous. This is especially true when you work

571
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,700
on an animal.

572
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:36,916
because I guarantee you when you're working on that dog you're going to be like looking around

573
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:42,042
like a dog would or you might get down on all fours and act out the scene as if you

574
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:47,068
were the dog in order to pace it and your co-workers will judge you for this.

575
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:50,066
This is not normal behavior.

576
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:53,187
Imagine that you're at a bar hanging out with your,

577
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:57,348
like having beers after, to a bond with your coworkers,

578
00:30:57,528 --> 00:30:59,549
and they've seen you acting like a dog,

579
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:02,510
and you're unhinged because you've been watching

580
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,790
the same thing on Loot Ball Day.

581
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:04,871
What are you gonna say to them?

582
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:07,152
You're a subject matter expert

583
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,532
in the most random shit imaginable.

584
00:31:09,552 --> 00:31:12,213
Like, I can't tell you what's going on in the world,

585
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,194
but I know this shit about bats.

586
00:31:16,656 --> 00:31:19,237
I made that slide from memory, this one too.

587
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:23,198
And that's even worse because once you study the human body,

588
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:26,178
you lose the ability to do things unconsciously.

589
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,459
I can't blink anymore.

590
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,580
I just close and open my eyes at intervals

591
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,080
so that they don't dry out.

592
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,381
So if you wanna know why animators are weird, this is why.

593
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:41,642
We've been watching the same thing on loop all day,

594
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:45,343
listening to the same audio over and over and over again.

595
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:51,286
We have random injuries because we probably sprained something. I sprained my ankle

596
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:59,410
standing up from a desk too fast one time. We are subject matter experts in the most random

597
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,392
things, depending on whatever it is you are working on. And we are hyper aware of our own

598
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:08,395
motions. Like I don't know where to put my hands right now. That's my talk.

599
00:32:12,637 --> 00:32:14,918
I have ten more seconds.

600
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:21,879
I am giving a talk Wednesday, like a real talk, Wednesday at 11. Come check it out.

601
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:37,804
I feel like I'm going to be a real fucking downer after that. So I apologize in advance.

602
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:42,365
Okay. Try this again. Thank you.

603
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:50,634
All right, all right. Computers. I'm here to talk about using computers. Just kidding. Hi, my name's

604
00:32:50,674 --> 00:32:54,618
Ryan. I make animation for video games. I believe in tough love and I'm going to say things fast

605
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:58,642
and harsh but know that I mean it all playfully. Despite the title, this is not a talk about

606
00:32:58,682 --> 00:33:02,286
bullshitting a company into hiring you even though you suck. But I know about that too.

607
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:05,569
This is a talk about bullshitting your audience into believing you know what the hell you were

608
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,890
doing. Like I'm doing right now.

609
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:12,353
Most recently I've been animating guns on the battlefield games. Some people think this means

610
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:16,575
I'm a republican but I just like mechanical stuff. It's satisfying for me to animate something that

611
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:19,896
has a right way and it appeals to my inner contrarian to do something that at a glance

612
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:24,578
looks wrong but the experts recognize is correct. So last year when this micro talk idea started to

613
00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:28,659
collate I wanted to rant about everything that devs get wrong about guns. Guns have been around

614
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:32,420
for centuries and don't work in mysterious ways but we still see them used wrong all the time.

615
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:36,022
Then I realized with the help of my boot camp colleagues for many reasons what a totally

616
00:33:36,462 --> 00:33:37,302
stupid idea that is.

617
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:44,134
Because judgments about politics and the violent tone of AAA video games aside,

618
00:33:44,615 --> 00:33:46,756
the problem I wanted to rant about is a lot simpler than that.

619
00:33:47,117 --> 00:33:49,658
When we animate a real world thing but it works like bullshit,

620
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:50,899
it's for one of two reasons.

621
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,862
One, designers, for reasons that can be for good or evil,

622
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:56,043
have invoked the sacred words, for gameplay.

623
00:33:56,343 --> 00:34:00,406
Or two, the animator responsible is willfully ignorant to the relevant facts.

624
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,448
One of these things is a reality of game development,

625
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:06,631
and the other is a much bigger problem in animation than people holding guns in a stupid way.

626
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:07,892
Who are you going to shoot there, Will?

627
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:10,687
So instead of guns, I'm going to talk about reference.

628
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:19,133
This is not a rant about bad cliches like one handed shotgun pumps, three point landings or excessive down shifting, but those really chaff my ass too.

629
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:24,197
Those are stylistic choices made by the kind of people who still think the Wilhelm scream is a funny Easter egg.

630
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:27,079
No, I'm here to rant about truth, facts and reference.

631
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:30,301
From how mechanical objects work to broader areas like basic physics.

632
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:34,664
We all know we can go out and learn something when faced with a new animation challenge, but too often we don't.

633
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:37,686
We know we're supposed to collect reference, but when was the last time you did?

634
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:40,948
Beyond maybe getting up and videotaping yourself something you're not actually very good at.

635
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,613
I say ignorance because it's fine to bend reality when we can explain our decision.

636
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,875
But you've got to know the rules to break the rules.

637
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:50,657
And because it's cool isn't always enough.

638
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:54,500
And let's be honest, game developers might not always be the best arbiters of what is

639
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:55,481
cool to the mainstream.

640
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:58,124
I mean, probably half of us are wearing a t-shirt that we got for free.

641
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:02,652
We all want our performance to be cool. We want people to see how great it is because we

642
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:06,033
wouldn't have gotten into the arts if we didn't need the constant validation of our peers.

643
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:10,554
But it's not just smooth curves and strong poses. It's the illusion of life. And too often we

644
00:35:10,594 --> 00:35:15,396
forget that some viewers are more familiar with our subject matter than we are. This is why we

645
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:20,157
collect reference. Did you know that in 1936 Disney had a zoo on the lot? Of course you do. You

646
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:23,758
read Disney's animation bible just like the rest of us. You can name all nine old men and all 12

647
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,719
principals, but when was the last time you really dug into your subject matter before you started

648
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:28,260
setting keys?

649
00:35:30,663 --> 00:35:35,007
talking fast. Because of that zoo 80 years later Bambi is still a pretty damn good representation

650
00:35:35,027 --> 00:35:39,111
of a deer. The anatomy, the personality, the movement. The rest of the animation industry

651
00:35:39,131 --> 00:35:42,934
was barely past rubber hose arms when they made this beautiful bastard. Not because of

652
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:45,997
talent but because of reference. You have to know what you don't know.

653
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,926
because when animating some sports shit, a fight, or whatever,

654
00:35:49,986 --> 00:35:52,569
count on the fact that someone in the audience, and maybe a lot of someone's,

655
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,970
know the subject matter better than you.

656
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,813
So when your taekwondo dude does a cool move exclusive to karate that you found on YouTube,

657
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,354
and your fiction hasn't explained why,

658
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:02,156
you've just potentially pulled someone out of a magical moment.

659
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:07,280
For some small but not insignificant portion of your audience,

660
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:10,683
your lack of diligent research has broken the illusion you were hired to create.

661
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:12,264
No, you're not ruining the game,

662
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:14,606
but that moment of disappointment that someone just felt,

663
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:15,567
you did that.

664
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:21,800
Shame on you. Let's do a quick case study. Archery is not an

665
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,562
obscure sport. Nearly 20 million Americans participated in

666
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,664
archery events in 2012. Nearly 10% of this country can shoot a

667
00:36:27,724 --> 00:36:30,345
bow to some degree. But when Katniss, Merida and Hawkeye hit

668
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:32,507
the big screens, we saw the proficiency spectrum range from

669
00:36:32,547 --> 00:36:36,669
mastery to complete bullshit. The director of Brave has been an

670
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:39,311
archer since age 12. Jennifer Lawrence trained with an Olympic

671
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,512
archer for the Hunger Games. Jeremy Renner trained with...

672
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:46,774
somebody else. I'm pretty sure the Avengers had the biggest budget of any of them. So

673
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:51,635
how does this happen? Simple. It happens by not doing your fucking homework. Animating

674
00:36:51,655 --> 00:36:55,117
something wrong won't ruin the game but it's not harmless either. You break the illusion

675
00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:59,298
not only for the nitpickers but for the passionate people like you who can't not notice the way

676
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:03,240
you can't not notice when a limb pops or a foot slides. When you don't do your homework

677
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,280
you tell the audience, I underestimate you.

678
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:10,744
Never forget that the level to which you and your team care is not the limit to how much

679
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,945
your audience is allowed to.

680
00:37:12,386 --> 00:37:15,149
It's easy when you're sitting at your desk to forget just how far your reach is.

681
00:37:15,509 --> 00:37:16,730
Empathize with your audience.

682
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:18,452
Care about how much they care.

683
00:37:23,943 --> 00:37:28,485
Sometimes animators think reference just means recording themselves, but if you don't know what you're doing, is that quality reference?

684
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:31,267
Acting isn't the skill of turning on a camera from the front.

685
00:37:31,747 --> 00:37:33,648
Find or shoot reference that is actually useful.

686
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:36,829
If you don't know, learn. A picture is worth a thousand words.

687
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:38,030
So what's a feeling worth?

688
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,171
Obviously, you don't need to fight in the UFC before animating combat,

689
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:46,033
but you might be amazed at how much you can learn about punching in a couple of hours of boxing class.

690
00:37:46,393 --> 00:37:48,954
And you don't need to be Eddie Van Halen before animating for Rock Band,

691
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:52,156
but I promise, the musicians in the audience are looking at your chord shapes.

692
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:57,345
And of course, I know what some of you are thinking.

693
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:58,947
Yes, of course, there will always be cases

694
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:00,648
where you have a perfectly valid creative reason

695
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:01,909
to deviate from the source,

696
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,891
and sometimes the real thing does look stupid as hell.

697
00:38:04,191 --> 00:38:06,113
I am not saying you should be a stickler for realism

698
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:06,973
in everything you animate.

699
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:09,215
I'm only saying your animation will always be better

700
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:11,477
for having gathered good reference than if you hadn't.

701
00:38:11,897 --> 00:38:13,038
Thank you, be awesome.

702
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:51,535
Okay. Awesome. Hi everybody. I'm Danielle Riendo. I'm the reviews editor at Xam. I used to be at

703
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:56,256
Polygon. That might be where you might know me from. And I am here to talk about

704
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:04,121
not being an animator at all whatsoever. I'm a boxer, I'm an EMT, I'm a game critic. And this

705
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:10,630
is about as advanced as my animation gets, this nice two frame walk cycle here. I do a little

706
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,956
bit of hobbyist stuff sort of for fun on this level. But I

707
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:19,419
can tell you and what I'm here to talk about today is sort of what animations

708
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:23,082
mean something to players to somebody who does not know what they're talking

709
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:27,406
about when it comes to animation that's me here we are I can tell you what

710
00:39:27,426 --> 00:39:31,088
really struck me and I want to sort of let you know that these things are

711
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:34,931
incredibly important to players so I know you probably fight for them keep

712
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:37,233
fighting for them so the first one is drop C's hugs

713
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:42,936
Dropsy is a game from last year, my favorite game from last year. It's about an evil looking clown

714
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:48,638
who likes to give people hugs and solve their problems. Which is pretty cool and really nice

715
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:53,720
and really special. And the game is a point and click adventure game, a traditional adventure

716
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,142
game but it really sort of shows the sweetness and the wonderfully, you know, nice and happy

717
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:03,243
warm feelings. And it goes a long way, this animation goes a long way in sort of showing

718
00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:06,205
the world view of the developer and of that particular game.

719
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:10,146
It's a good example of pixel art which in my opinion allows you to make these really

720
00:40:10,286 --> 00:40:12,607
big statements with just these tiny little elements.

721
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:16,108
A few lines, a bunch of color and it just shows so much more.

722
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:18,969
It evokes more than it actually shows something more realistic.

723
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,551
Next one is Lara Croft's ponytail squeeze.

724
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:26,112
Every time she gets out of the water in Rise of the Tomb Raider she actually

725
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:31,375
brings out her hair, which is a thing that almost every woman I know who has long hair does,

726
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:36,938
if she works out or swims or any of these cool things. And this was something- whoa, we have

727
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:41,200
volume. This was something that I noticed every time she got out of the water, and you know,

728
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,383
Lara Croft is this super heroic woman. She fights bears, she fights fighting men, she takes on

729
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:51,585
special forces, but she still takes a minute to, you know, get that water out of her hair every

730
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:55,668
time, uh, you know, she's gotta be at her best. She's gotta be focused, she's gotta be in it.

731
00:40:56,488 --> 00:41:00,331
More than anything, any dialogue or any gesture in the game, this really endeared me to Lara.

732
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:03,674
This made me feel like, hey, she's human too, even though she fights bears,

733
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:08,397
and is good at archery and other cool things that I will never be good at.

734
00:41:09,652 --> 00:41:15,014
The next one here is Henry's little stair tap. Every time he in fire watch, every time he walks

735
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:20,918
out of his tower, he sort of touches the top of the stairs. He's the protagonist in fire watch.

736
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:25,700
He's a middle aged dude who is sort of escaping his normal world and this is sort of a foreign

737
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,543
world for him. This is a rustic, different kind of place for him to be in. That moment just says

738
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:35,725
so much about him. He's a tall guy. He's a dude who likes to make little connections and he's

739
00:41:35,845 --> 00:41:37,746
literally feeling out his space in this.

740
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:42,249
It's the sort of thing I've known taller folks to do. I'm tiny and short so I don't do it.

741
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:46,151
But it's something I've known a lot of people to do. And it kind of adds a little bit of his

742
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:51,373
character right there. Even though it's such a tiny little touch, it made me feel a little

743
00:41:51,513 --> 00:42:03,440
closer to Henry. I think this presentation might have stuck. In which case, I'm going to

744
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:29,830
Yep. He didn't want to sleep. I'm going to hit space bar again. And again. Oh! Oh! Do we ‑‑

745
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:36,795
oh, my goodness. Now I want to go back. It's okay, everybody. Everything is great. No need

746
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:37,216
to panic.

747
00:42:41,352 --> 00:42:50,524
maybe start panicking. I'll just go from here. We might have missed a moment.

748
00:42:52,784 --> 00:42:57,468
Here we go. Okay. So I was just going to talk very briefly about the fact that you see Henry's

749
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:02,772
hands all the time. Outside of that sort of tapping animation, you also see his hands

750
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:09,338
literally everything you do. It's a first person game. So it's basically seeing hands in every

751
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:17,065
action. And you see his wedding ring on his left hand every time you see his hands. I'm just

752
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:20,628
going to go forward. I think this slide made this computer very angry.

753
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:27,077
Okay, the next animation is the only non-human, non-character animation in this entire presentation.

754
00:43:27,477 --> 00:43:29,998
And it's from The Witness, a game that made me very angry.

755
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:35,379
A puzzle game that's about an island that doesn't move or really change with your interactions very much.

756
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:39,361
But when you do finish an area in this game, you get this slow...

757
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:43,442
deliberate little animation, this wonderful,

758
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:46,404
almost like a victory lap, like enjoy it,

759
00:43:46,464 --> 00:43:49,125
something happened, something happened on this island.

760
00:43:49,905 --> 00:43:52,626
It's slow, it's subtle, it's really, really,

761
00:43:53,306 --> 00:43:57,168
God, just like, oh man, this laser meant everything to me.

762
00:43:57,228 --> 00:43:59,849
I did a dance every time I finished an area.

763
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:02,470
I literally did a whole, I can't dance,

764
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,191
so I won't try it, but I did a whole thing.

765
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:07,512
And it reinforces these heady philosophical ideas

766
00:44:07,572 --> 00:44:08,893
and the witness about, you know.

767
00:44:09,453 --> 00:44:16,037
being rational and so on and so forth, but it made me dance. Last one is Chloe's face after that

768
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:22,861
kiss in Life is Strange. So this kiss and Chloe's reaction to it is just one of the moments that

769
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:28,825
best exemplifies Life is Strange as a whole. It's a game about being an awkward teenager, still

770
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:34,048
figuring things out, still working out their identity, all that sort of stuff. And Chloe in

771
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:38,671
this case, the girl with the blue hair, is this prototypical bad girl. She dares Max to kiss her.

772
00:44:39,032 --> 00:44:42,354
And if Max makes that bold move, it just surprises the hell out of Chloe.

773
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,816
Showing again, this is an awkward teen.

774
00:44:45,497 --> 00:44:46,998
She's just sort of figuring things out.

775
00:44:47,038 --> 00:44:48,619
She's not really such a bad girl.

776
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:50,140
She's just like, whoa, oh my God.

777
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:53,663
And it's just this incredible, incredible moment in a game

778
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:56,485
that is really about sort of very raw feelings.

779
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:59,587
You know, some of the dialogue in Life is Strange turned people off.

780
00:45:00,008 --> 00:45:02,330
But I think the pure emotional content framing,

781
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:07,293
I just overall, yeah, of that moment is something really special.

782
00:45:07,908 --> 00:45:13,890
So that's pretty much my talk. And I wanted to tell you all that we notice these things as

783
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,931
players. You know, somebody who doesn't know a damn thing about key framing and making

784
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:23,273
things work, I notice these things. So keep fighting the good fight. Keep making sure those

785
00:45:23,313 --> 00:45:26,474
really special moments get in the games. And thank you very much.

786
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:11,474
Alright. I have a video like Gwen.

787
00:46:20,102 --> 00:46:23,184
No? How do I make it control off? Hold on.

788
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:25,446
How do you make it full screen?

789
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:43,510
One second. Hello again. Hopefully this works.

790
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:51,547
everybody. I'm Simon. So right now you're wondering two things. First, what's this confusing

791
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:58,351
feeling I'm having right now? And second, holy shit, E3 is right around the corner. What are

792
00:46:58,391 --> 00:47:03,333
these nine things I need to stop doing right now to get BeachBot ready? Well, I'm glad you

793
00:47:03,393 --> 00:47:08,376
asked. These are things we've all done in our career at one point or another. And I'm sharing

794
00:47:08,396 --> 00:47:13,558
them today so hopefully we can learn from them and never do them again. So number one.

795
00:47:16,032 --> 00:47:20,453
as we wait for it. Stop using handheld cameras when the shot

796
00:47:20,473 --> 00:47:23,554
doesn't call for it. POV cameras are almost always the wrong

797
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:26,154
decision. When you use a camera in this way, you're implying

798
00:47:26,174 --> 00:47:28,895
that the viewer is an active participant in the scene. If

799
00:47:28,935 --> 00:47:32,455
they aren't, the result just feels creepy and completely

800
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:35,216
undermines the purpose of the shot. Ask yourself what the

801
00:47:35,276 --> 00:47:37,256
intent of the scene is and choose the camera and

802
00:47:37,276 --> 00:47:40,057
composition to support it. Sometimes this calls for POV,

803
00:47:40,117 --> 00:47:43,037
but more often than not, it doesn't. Stop being a creeper

804
00:47:43,057 --> 00:47:44,338
and come on.

805
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:49,382
Come on, everybody. We're better than that. Number two, stop

806
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:51,523
thinking that just because you're using mocap means you

807
00:47:51,543 --> 00:47:54,545
get to throw out all the shit you learned in school. And if

808
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:57,146
they taught you to use raw mocap, go back and get a refund.

809
00:47:57,526 --> 00:47:59,768
Because humans don't always move in the most appealing way.

810
00:47:59,848 --> 00:48:02,609
Timing, staging, silhouettes, arcs, these all need your

811
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,191
attention regardless of the source. At the end of the day,

812
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:08,152
you as the animator are responsible for what ends up on

813
00:48:08,212 --> 00:48:08,472
screen.

814
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,212
As much as Gollum might disagree, even the best

815
00:48:12,272 --> 00:48:15,134
performances by the best actors need some digital make up.

816
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:18,977
Because at the end of the day, we're better than that.

817
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:20,859
Oh, no, I lost my note.

818
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:23,721
Number four, stop using out of context.

819
00:48:23,821 --> 00:48:24,701
Oh, whoops, I skipped one.

820
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:29,320
Stop animating anything before planning at first. There's no way in hell you know from memory how

821
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,322
everything moves. Not even, the time you spend planning a shot will almost always be less than

822
00:48:34,362 --> 00:48:39,624
the time you spend doing revisions if you hadn't. Shoot reference. Nervous acting in front of your

823
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:44,506
co-workers? Get over it. They hired an animator. They expect you to be eccentric. Don't let them

824
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:51,388
down. Because everybody, we're better than that.

825
00:48:52,382 --> 00:48:54,924
Number four, stop using out of context idols.

826
00:48:55,064 --> 00:48:56,626
Did your hero forget to go to the potty

827
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:57,546
before he left the house?

828
00:48:58,047 --> 00:48:59,868
If not, why is he doing the pee pee dance?

829
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:02,190
And also, why the fuck are game characters

830
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,291
so out of breath all the time?

831
00:49:04,372 --> 00:49:06,634
Try to do something more subtle, more contextual.

832
00:49:06,674 --> 00:49:08,255
Maybe react to their surroundings.

833
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:09,396
Maybe they're scared or injured.

834
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:11,618
Try using a hierarchy of needs

835
00:49:11,718 --> 00:49:13,900
if you need to find out what their immediate want is.

836
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,781
Conveying these things in your characters

837
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:17,783
will make them much more believable and engaging.

838
00:49:18,503 --> 00:49:19,584
But no more pee pee dances,

839
00:49:19,644 --> 00:49:21,346
especially if you don't shoot reference first.

840
00:49:22,016 --> 00:49:26,718
We're better than that. Number five, stop acting like your job

841
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:29,880
ends when you hit export. If you want to just be handed shots

842
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,121
all day and sit at your desk with your headphones on, I

843
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:36,363
suggest slumming it in TV or film. Your responsibility for a

844
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:39,505
character's movement doesn't end until the game is in a player's

845
00:49:39,545 --> 00:49:41,946
hands. This means getting your hands dirty in the engine,

846
00:49:42,266 --> 00:49:44,647
working with designers during every stage of development and

847
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:47,249
championing that quality of movement. Keep pushing that

848
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:49,550
quality until they have to pry your hands from the perforce

849
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,411
submit button. Because

850
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,783
Almost made it. Number six, stop waiting to finish an animation

851
00:49:58,823 --> 00:50:01,284
before testing it in game. I have a spoiler alert, your

852
00:50:01,384 --> 00:50:03,725
animation is going to suck the first time you put it in the

853
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:07,747
game. Want someone to tell you that after one hour or ten. The

854
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:10,068
shorter the intervals between iterations, the higher the

855
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:13,090
quality of your work. Establish timing, staging, silhouettes

856
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,911
first. Non-animators might have trouble seeing blocking at

857
00:50:15,951 --> 00:50:18,473
first, but be patient. Help them to understand what they're

858
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:20,974
looking at and how to provide the right kind of feedback. And

859
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:23,215
don't whine when folks give you major changes.

860
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:24,697
because

861
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:31,694
Number seven, stop only worrying about fodder for your demo reel.

862
00:50:31,774 --> 00:50:34,856
You were hired to collaborate on a product, not work on your

863
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:38,199
portfolio. When you're asked to make an animation you think is

864
00:50:38,279 --> 00:50:42,282
beneath you, check your ego at the door. Make that stand to run

865
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:45,184
transition the best fucking stand to run transition the

866
00:50:45,224 --> 00:50:48,687
world has ever seen. Making video games is a team sport, not

867
00:50:48,727 --> 00:50:51,689
a guitar solo. If you're focused only on your reel, you're going

868
00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:54,151
to find yourself needing to use that reel sooner than you think.

869
00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:56,072
Don't be like that because

870
00:50:59,386 --> 00:50:59,841
We'll get there.

871
00:51:01,352 --> 00:51:05,275
Number eight, stop resisting feedback. The best animators on

872
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:08,778
the planet know that there's room for improvement. What makes

873
00:51:08,878 --> 00:51:12,701
you so fucking special? You may say you like feedback. I know

874
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:15,944
you. You don't. If someone takes the time to offer an opinion on

875
00:51:15,964 --> 00:51:19,227
your work, embrace it. Everyone wants the same thing, to make

876
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:22,049
the best damn game possible. Your job isn't to tell them

877
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:25,171
they're wrong. It's to find out why they feel that way. It might

878
00:51:25,192 --> 00:51:27,934
not be what you want to hear. In fact, I hope it isn't. You don't

879
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:30,276
get to be better by having your belly rubbed all day.

880
00:51:32,618 --> 00:51:37,102
Number nine, stop undervaluing yourself. On so many dev teams,

881
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:40,304
animators still aren't given much of a voice. But when you

882
00:51:40,605 --> 00:51:43,607
act like you don't have a voice, you're going to be looked at as

883
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:47,070
a service provider. You bring value to the team. Your

884
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:50,873
perspective as a storyteller, actor, designer are all assets

885
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:53,195
for the game team. And for fuck's sake, stop working for

886
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:56,758
free because we're not cheap hookers. We're high price

887
00:51:56,838 --> 00:51:59,881
escorts, dammit. And remember...

888
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:03,270
Thanks.

889
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,143
I don't know how to make it go away.

890
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:18,705
I'm not better than that.

891
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:25,993
I'm going to be representing Steve Jobs here at this talk.

892
00:52:31,272 --> 00:52:38,158
Don't be jealous. All right. Who's water do you think this is? Do you think it's gross if I

893
00:52:38,218 --> 00:52:46,625
drink it? I'm going to try this one.

894
00:53:02,605 --> 00:53:06,248
Oh, yeah. That one had a slime to it.

895
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:12,273
All right. My name is Mark Pulley Blank, and I'm an animator and a visual effects artist,

896
00:53:12,393 --> 00:53:16,177
and I'm embarrassed to say that I've mostly worked in film. Sorry.

897
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:20,721
At such slumholes like Weta Digital and

898
00:53:21,806 --> 00:53:25,792
Sony animation. I'm also the CEO of the interactive, the animation director at cg

899
00:53:25,812 --> 00:53:30,840
spectrum.com, a lecturer at California State University, a musician, a composer, a

900
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,868
father of four, a mediocre husband, but a really kick ass braggart. All right.

901
00:53:36,697 --> 00:53:41,120
With that said, one of the more frequent questions I get asked is how do you stay motivated?

902
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:49,547
It's a great question. And the answer is I don't. Not always. But I do have strategies. Because it

903
00:53:49,647 --> 00:53:54,450
sucks to suck, we all like to do things we're good at. For example, because I haven't made many

904
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:58,273
slides, I'm not good at making slides. I don't like making slides.

905
00:53:59,294 --> 00:54:02,117
But I do like this, talking in front of people and feeling

906
00:54:02,137 --> 00:54:04,599
important. So I know I need to sort it out. And the most

907
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:08,002
important and most difficult part of the process is to just

908
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:12,425
simply get started. Bam! Here we go. A pretty blue gradient.

909
00:54:12,545 --> 00:54:15,968
Blue is good. Word for Facebook. A playful new font. That's not

910
00:54:16,028 --> 00:54:17,650
Comic Sans. I think it's Brady Bunch.

911
00:54:18,677 --> 00:54:22,579
It doesn't have to be amazing. It's not going to be amazing. But at this stage of the game,

912
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:27,961
I'm just trying to focus on the process, not the result. We live in a results-based world,

913
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:32,884
and this idea that what we're about to create has to be amazing before we even get started

914
00:54:33,224 --> 00:54:35,205
is one of the biggest obstacles to our creativity.

915
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,943
The way we get better is doing and it's extremely difficult to

916
00:54:39,003 --> 00:54:42,025
keep doing when our fulfillment is married to our results.

917
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:46,047
Recently I asked a class of university students that if they

918
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:48,408
could take a magical pill that would instantly make them great

919
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:51,570
at what they do, would they take it? And of course they all said

920
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:52,590
yeah.

921
00:54:53,575 --> 00:54:59,160
Every one of them. And I get it. Being a student is scary, loads of pressure, but this thinking is backwards.

922
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,163
Process, on the other hand, is the doing, the act of creating.

923
00:55:02,683 --> 00:55:06,607
As kids, we have this figured out. My six-year-old daughter cuts paper, she leaves it scattered all over my house.

924
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:11,091
She has endless motivation for the process and doesn't care one bit about the result

925
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:13,493
until I ask her to clean it up and then suddenly I'm an asshole.

926
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:17,207
Someone once said that the secret to success is doing the

927
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:18,449
stuff that nobody wants to do.

928
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:20,552
And in animation, luckily, that's pretty much all of it.

929
00:55:20,632 --> 00:55:20,832
Right?

930
00:55:21,312 --> 00:55:22,914
So you're not always going to love it.

931
00:55:23,055 --> 00:55:23,816
And that's okay.

932
00:55:23,856 --> 00:55:24,476
Just relax.

933
00:55:24,516 --> 00:55:27,220
And remember that when somebody challenges your ideas, it's an

934
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,903
invitation to grow, not to fight, which brings me to this

935
00:55:29,983 --> 00:55:31,265
handy, but difficult tip.

936
00:55:31,805 --> 00:55:32,807
Own up to your fear.

937
00:55:33,407 --> 00:55:36,130
This stuff is personal and having our ideas rejected over

938
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,932
and over again is not only frustrating, but it breeds

939
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:41,874
insecurity which is creative kryptonite. So in navigating

940
00:55:41,914 --> 00:55:45,377
these waters, I like to ask myself this simple question, do

941
00:55:45,437 --> 00:55:48,139
I have the best interest of the project at heart?

942
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:53,071
This is completely liberating and frees me up emotionally to collaborate.

943
00:55:53,652 --> 00:55:58,034
The more that people trust your motives, the more likely they'll be to seek out your opinion.

944
00:55:58,494 --> 00:56:00,495
I'm going to talk about Brad Bird again. He once said,

945
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:03,616
Make it okay for people to challenge your ideas.

946
00:56:03,656 --> 00:56:07,678
The good ones can withstand it, and the bad ones fall away to reveal something better.

947
00:56:08,418 --> 00:56:13,060
And to me, that's one of the purest explanations of creative collaboration I've ever heard.

948
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,524
Now, I'm going to sound like an old man, but my next tip is about distractions, because this shit

949
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:22,929
makes me crazy. We live in a time of unprecedented distraction. We are literally two clicks away

950
00:56:22,969 --> 00:56:27,453
from millions of bits of entertainment, and if you really believe that you do your best work

951
00:56:27,493 --> 00:56:31,477
while streaming internet content, then imagine you're an astronaut strapped to a rocket on a

952
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:35,221
launch pad waiting to be launched into outer space, and this is mission control.

953
00:56:37,046 --> 00:56:40,569
right? Now I know we're not astronauts, but the truth is if

954
00:56:40,589 --> 00:56:42,951
you're really engaged and passionate about what you're

955
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:46,534
doing, you can't be distracted. And one of the best ways that I

956
00:56:46,574 --> 00:56:50,037
know to remain engaged is to always quit when I'm ahead.

957
00:56:51,238 --> 00:56:58,824
Walking away from your work when you're frustrated lessens the chance that you're ever going to come back to it and increases your vulnerability for distractions.

958
00:56:59,485 --> 00:57:02,847
Instead, solve whatever it is that's troubling you and shut it down.

959
00:57:03,368 --> 00:57:05,069
That way you'll be encouraged to get back to it.

960
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:05,970
That's a big one.

961
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:11,234
In the meantime, we said it already tonight, live your life, do something else, anything else, guilt free.

962
00:57:12,108 --> 00:57:15,050
Much of what I know about drawing was learned while taking

963
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:19,014
breaks from playing music. And today I'm a far better musician

964
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:22,837
due to the breaks that I take from animation. The process is

965
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,439
all pretty much the same upstairs. It's like this

966
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:28,702
problem solving activity that connects, I don't know, I'm not

967
00:57:28,742 --> 00:57:32,485
a doctor. I just know that when I'm drawing or sculpting or

968
00:57:32,505 --> 00:57:34,827
writing or any of this kind of stuff, it all feels the same

969
00:57:34,907 --> 00:57:37,309
upstairs. It's sort of this organic brain food.

970
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:50,702
Next, this is a big one. I think we touched on it already. Raise your heart rate for 15 minutes or so per day and I can almost guarantee that after you finish vomiting and the burning sensation,

971
00:57:51,856 --> 00:57:55,298
it fades from your muscles, your creative juices actually flow.

972
00:57:55,798 --> 00:57:58,999
The heaps and heaps of medication created by science to battle anxiety and

973
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:03,761
depression pales in comparison sometimes to common exercise.

974
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:06,903
That's not to say we don't need medication. Again, I'm not a doctor.

975
00:58:07,043 --> 00:58:09,784
Some of us do. But exercise is sort of a quick and easy fix.

976
00:58:10,804 --> 00:58:15,787
Lastly, a lesson from my brother, a ball bearing salesman in a small farming

977
00:58:15,827 --> 00:58:17,167
town in northern Canada, that was their...

978
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:24,413
Anyway. Best ball bearing salesman in the world. No joke. He loved his job and he once asked me

979
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:28,094
how I liked mine and I told him I didn't. And I'll never forget what he said. He told me it's not

980
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:35,757
the responsibility of your job to show you a good time, you idiot. It's actually the opposite,

981
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:36,777
dummy.

982
00:58:37,954 --> 00:58:42,079
And to this day, when I get to work, I put my hand on the door

983
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:45,443
and I make a conscious decision to either do good work or go

984
00:58:45,503 --> 00:58:49,046
home. And honestly, some days I go home and that's okay. But if

985
00:58:49,127 --> 00:58:53,071
I go in, I go in hard. For the work, for the job and for me.

986
00:58:53,251 --> 00:58:58,557
And those are just a few ways that I stay motivated. Thank

987
00:58:58,577 --> 00:58:58,657
you.

988
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:34,653
keep it in the water. The slimy one. Just a moment here. The

989
00:59:35,093 --> 00:59:39,616
screen is black. I'm not sure if you can see me. Just a moment.

990
00:59:41,395 --> 00:59:43,957
Steve! Revenge from the grave.

991
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,599
there we go. Sweet.

992
01:01:04,033 --> 01:01:08,358
There we go. All right. So my name is Jake. I'm a concept

993
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:12,703
artist, designer and animator on cuff head. Which is coming out

994
01:01:12,763 --> 01:01:15,846
someday. It's going to happen. 2016. All right.

995
01:01:20,754 --> 01:01:22,594
So this talk is aimed at those of you that aren't fully

996
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:24,855
satisfied with your jobs. Whether you'd rather be in a

997
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:27,276
different position in the game industry or doing something else

998
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:30,137
entirely. If you're totally happy with what you've got going

999
01:01:30,217 --> 01:01:34,899
on, just space out for a bit or take a nap or, you know, just

1000
01:01:34,939 --> 01:01:38,700
fill the time. So we all get into this industry because we

1001
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,101
love games and animation and we want to help make them for a

1002
01:01:41,141 --> 01:01:45,062
living. But upon entry, many of us become a small part of a

1003
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:48,464
large pipeline. Often with brutal hours, tight quotas and

1004
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,504
not much creative influence.

1005
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:53,150
let alone any choice in what you work on each day.

1006
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:55,251
This is a fine position to start in,

1007
01:01:55,531 --> 01:01:56,812
and depending on you and the studio,

1008
01:01:56,872 --> 01:01:58,233
it might even be a good place to stay.

1009
01:01:58,533 --> 01:01:59,853
Every person and job is different.

1010
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:02,575
And at the end of the day, we're all making games.

1011
01:02:03,075 --> 01:02:04,456
But ultimately for me, I want a job

1012
01:02:04,476 --> 01:02:06,217
where I have heavy creative input and freedom.

1013
01:02:06,677 --> 01:02:08,318
I'm extremely lucky to have that with Cuphead.

1014
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,399
This is an amazing industry,

1015
01:02:10,879 --> 01:02:12,900
and those of us working in it now should be very grateful.

1016
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,981
Work hard and appreciate your job,

1017
01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:16,882
but don't settle in and get too comfortable,

1018
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:19,103
if it's not what you'd like to be doing five years from now.

1019
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,281
If you're going to spend 40% of your days doing something, it

1020
01:02:22,301 --> 01:02:25,463
might as well be something you love. So what would you love to

1021
01:02:25,503 --> 01:02:28,345
do for a living? I'm sure many of you know and some of you

1022
01:02:28,385 --> 01:02:32,447
don't. Some of you are afraid to pursue it. And some of you are

1023
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:35,349
working your asses off to get it. Some of you are hoping you

1024
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:37,951
just somehow end up there and some of you think what you want

1025
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:39,271
isn't even possible.

1026
01:02:40,581 --> 01:02:43,965
which is bullshit. You really can do anything as long as it

1027
01:02:44,006 --> 01:02:46,469
doesn't break the laws of physics. Anybody that may have

1028
01:02:46,489 --> 01:02:49,713
told you otherwise is full of shit. How could anyone possibly

1029
01:02:49,753 --> 01:02:53,979
know your potential? If somebody else can do it, why not you? You

1030
01:02:53,999 --> 01:02:57,603
can do anything that others can enjoy for a living. You just

1031
01:02:57,623 --> 01:02:58,505
have to do something about it.

1032
01:03:01,368 --> 01:03:03,369
You can't expect where you are now to magically lead to the

1033
01:03:03,389 --> 01:03:05,971
place you want to be. Even if all you want is a higher

1034
01:03:06,011 --> 01:03:08,832
position at your studio, there's no guarantee you'll ever be

1035
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:14,636
promoted if you only do the requirements of your job. Unless

1036
01:03:14,656 --> 01:03:18,518
the head of the company you work for is your grandma. Don't put

1037
01:03:18,538 --> 01:03:20,760
your future in anyone else's hands because nobody else is

1038
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,221
plotting to get you what you want. The only way to get what

1039
01:03:23,241 --> 01:03:26,083
you want is to work for it or get very lucky but you cannot

1040
01:03:26,123 --> 01:03:29,505
count on that. That's up to you and nobody else. This is a

1041
01:03:29,545 --> 01:03:30,025
trigger warning.

1042
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:33,969
So if you know what you want, and you have the time, you only

1043
01:03:34,009 --> 01:03:38,393
have two options. One, try to get where you want to be. Or

1044
01:03:38,453 --> 01:03:42,516
two, die having never really tried to get there. You only

1045
01:03:42,536 --> 01:03:45,598
have one life. You either try or you don't and tomorrow is not

1046
01:03:45,618 --> 01:03:49,081
guaranteed. Sorry about that. Let's talk about flowers.

1047
01:03:50,642 --> 01:03:52,884
Imagine somebody that makes flower hats. Do you think they

1048
01:03:52,904 --> 01:03:56,267
could make a living ten years ago? Maybe, but probably not.

1049
01:03:57,082 --> 01:04:00,786
Back then you were limited by your location. Is there a gallery nearby willing to sell them?

1050
01:04:01,326 --> 01:04:05,491
Are there enough people around that want them? Well now the world's completely opened up.

1051
01:04:06,432 --> 01:04:10,016
Over 3 billion people have the internet and each one of them is a potential customer or

1052
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:14,061
supporter if you can get your work in front of them. I submit that in today's world if you work

1053
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:17,965
hard enough making flower hats you could make a living. If you can make a living with flower

1054
01:04:17,985 --> 01:04:19,366
hats you can make a living with anything.

1055
01:04:20,335 --> 01:04:22,956
So don't rule anything out. You have something unique to give to

1056
01:04:22,976 --> 01:04:24,716
the world. You've all had completely different

1057
01:04:24,756 --> 01:04:27,357
experiences. You've been influenced by different people.

1058
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:29,978
And you've worked through different hardships. Because of

1059
01:04:30,018 --> 01:04:33,838
that, nobody can make what you can. You just have to get good

1060
01:04:33,878 --> 01:04:36,419
at it. And it's never been easier to get your work out

1061
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:39,620
there, either. If you both consistently post quality work

1062
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,800
and reach out and connect with others, you will slowly but

1063
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,841
surely, at the very worst, build up an audience and network of

1064
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:48,722
people that want only what you have to offer. There's never

1065
01:04:48,742 --> 01:04:49,962
been a better time to be an artist.

1066
01:04:50,822 --> 01:04:52,944
So if you know what you want, if you're not working toward it,

1067
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:53,585
why not?

1068
01:04:54,566 --> 01:04:55,847
Something that many of us struggle with

1069
01:04:55,927 --> 01:04:56,888
is a lack of motivation.

1070
01:04:57,709 --> 01:04:59,730
I believe there is internal and external motivation.

1071
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:01,692
External motivation comes from things

1072
01:05:01,752 --> 01:05:03,494
like seeing others work hard and achieve,

1073
01:05:04,174 --> 01:05:05,556
experiencing others' great works,

1074
01:05:07,718 --> 01:05:09,099
getting positive feedback on what you're doing,

1075
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,639
going to talks.

1076
01:05:10,738 --> 01:05:12,700
External motivation is enough to push you to action but it

1077
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:15,042
won't keep you going. It waivers. Some days you're so

1078
01:05:15,122 --> 01:05:17,684
motivated and inspired you'll burst if you don't pour it into

1079
01:05:17,724 --> 01:05:20,867
something. And some days you've got nothing. You can't rely on

1080
01:05:20,907 --> 01:05:24,270
it. It's like somebody giving you jumper cables. What you need

1081
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:26,792
is internal motivation. It's a battery that will always keep

1082
01:05:26,812 --> 01:05:29,875
you going. If you keep it full. It's something that will get you

1083
01:05:29,895 --> 01:05:31,897
out of bed to work on your project instead of sleeping in.

1084
01:05:32,777 --> 01:05:34,939
Something that will cause you to choose to work because you want

1085
01:05:34,979 --> 01:05:37,281
to instead of doing something you know is less important.

1086
01:05:38,247 --> 01:05:40,549
One way to build it up is to imagine that you've achieved your goal.

1087
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:44,091
Imagine yourself being an animation director at a studio, or whatever it is.

1088
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:44,871
It's a good feeling.

1089
01:05:45,672 --> 01:05:48,373
Sometimes we only think about the giant mountain of work and sweat,

1090
01:05:48,514 --> 01:05:50,295
and not about what's at the top of that mountain.

1091
01:05:50,915 --> 01:05:53,296
You need to think about why you would actually put in all those hours.

1092
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:58,380
Just as important is setting smaller goals that aren't some hazy mirage way in the distance.

1093
01:05:59,818 --> 01:06:01,739
These give you something you can get done in a week or two.

1094
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:04,120
These give you something very tangible to work toward,

1095
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,120
and those accomplishments empower you,

1096
01:06:06,541 --> 01:06:09,202
and they prove to yourself that you are making progress.

1097
01:06:09,662 --> 01:06:11,203
Therefore, you can keep making progress.

1098
01:06:13,043 --> 01:06:14,804
But it's not easy, we all know that.

1099
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,665
Improving at something is frustrating,

1100
01:06:16,725 --> 01:06:18,226
because to improve you must fail,

1101
01:06:19,106 --> 01:06:21,207
and failing at something you'd love to be good at isn't fun.

1102
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:24,228
Look for satisfaction not in doing something well,

1103
01:06:24,588 --> 01:06:25,669
but in your own improvement.

1104
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:27,570
Never sell yourself short.

1105
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:32,511
you deserve to achieve your dreams. If there's something you

1106
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:36,753
want in this life, go get it. Because you can. It may take a

1107
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:39,254
long time, but all you have to do is show up each day and try.

1108
01:06:39,274 --> 01:06:42,996
And eventually you'll get there. And when you do, you'll be able

1109
01:06:43,016 --> 01:06:46,078
to do what you love in a way that nobody else can. Thank you.
