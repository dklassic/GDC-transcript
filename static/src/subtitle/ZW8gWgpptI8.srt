1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:10,470
My name is Adam Robinson Yu, and I made this little game called A Short Hike.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,093
I also want to quickly thank people who helped me work on the game.

3
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:19,759
Thank you to Don, Andrew, Mark, and David, and also everyone who tested it.

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,780
Just thanks a lot for your contributions.

5
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:28,006
So I guess for those of you who aren't familiar with the game, I'm going to show the trailer

6
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:28,426
right now.

7
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:29,287
So...

8
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:29,387
Whoa.

9
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:30,488
Oh.

10
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:31,069
There's the sound.

11
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:31,129
Ha.

12
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:31,209
Oh.

13
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:31,889
There's the sound.

14
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:31,950
Ha.

15
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,010
Oh.

16
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,730
There's the sound.

17
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:39,251
Um, so a short hike is a little video game about hiking.

18
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:44,577
You'll play as Claire, this bird who's visiting this island from the city,

19
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:47,320
and she can't find any cell phone reception on the island.

20
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,984
So she hears that the only place to find it is all the way at the very top.

21
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:57,586
So as you go along this journey to get to the top of the mountain, you're going to explore the island,

22
00:00:57,686 --> 00:01:04,588
collect items, and befriend other hikers, and kind of just get lost in the wilderness a bit.

23
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:13,591
So here's a quick look at what the island looks like if you zoom out a bit. So it's like an open

24
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:19,712
world, but it's also not too large. It's quite small, I guess. So a short hike.

25
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:26,254
For this post-mortem, I'm going to go generally over the development of the game.

26
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:33,156
I'm going to talk a bit about how it got started, a bit about the art style, a bit about my

27
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:38,537
timeline and development practices with regards to meeting my deadline, some lessons that

28
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:42,698
I learned in level design, a bit about the writing, and then the marketing and release.

29
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:45,199
So kind of just going to go over the whole thing.

30
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:48,186
So all right.

31
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:52,369
I guess for a bit of context, I want

32
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,791
to talk a little bit where I was leading up

33
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:55,871
to the development of the game.

34
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:58,353
So when I think back on things, I

35
00:01:58,393 --> 00:02:00,515
feel like one of the hardest decisions I

36
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:02,396
had to make on the game was whether or not

37
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:03,417
I was going to make it at all.

38
00:02:04,097 --> 00:02:06,519
So this is me in 2017.

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,881
I had just made the questionable decision

40
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,703
to leave my software engineering job and move back to Toronto.

41
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:14,385
And I wanted to take a shot at making indie games full time.

42
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:17,892
So until then, most of the games that I had released

43
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:20,534
had been kind of small, free itch.io titles.

44
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:23,455
And I kind of thought that this would be my one chance

45
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:25,036
to make a big game on my own.

46
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:29,118
So about one year later, I was knees deep

47
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:30,639
in an ambitious project.

48
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,720
It was going to be a large RPG with lots of characters,

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,261
locations, and battle mechanics.

50
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:40,544
However, I didn't really have a clear vision for the game.

51
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:43,205
And after a year, there were still a lot of elements

52
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,286
that I wasn't certain about.

53
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:49,840
It felt like the project would take a few more years to finish and I was starting to

54
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,385
get kind of stressed and anxious about it and I never felt like I was getting enough

55
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:57,952
done and it felt like I had to finish this project and I had to do well because it felt

56
00:02:57,992 --> 00:02:59,234
like my kind of one shot.

57
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:03,634
But in December 2018, I decided to give myself a little break.

58
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:06,075
As sort of like a Christmas present to myself,

59
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:08,296
I decided to put aside my main project

60
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:09,977
and just work on this tiny little project.

61
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,599
So I started just throwing some assets together in Unity

62
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,941
and building this tiny little world that I could escape to.

63
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:17,542
And I was just kind of putting in whatever

64
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:18,562
I felt like would be fun.

65
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:22,204
And after I shared a bit of this work on Twitter,

66
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:24,946
I got the opportunity to fund a tiny project based

67
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:26,226
on this prototype.

68
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:30,737
At this time, this kind of felt like a really difficult decision for me.

69
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,625
Due to the sunk cost fallacy, I was feeling really locked into my RPG.

70
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:40,967
I had already spent a year plus working on it,

71
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:43,209
and I had started gaining a bit of a following for it.

72
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,772
And I felt like it had opened up a lot of doors for me.

73
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:51,476
So I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to put aside all that momentum for this short,

74
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:56,579
undefined game about hiking. And video game development is full of uncertainty,

75
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,141
and it can be hard to tell if a project is really off track or if I just needed to really

76
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:03,243
work through this rut and my RPG would come together.

77
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,159
But in 2018, I also played two other amazing short video

78
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:08,479
games.

79
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:11,621
And it was inspiring to me that such short and sweet games

80
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,622
could still be successful.

81
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:15,805
So I decided to take the plunge into a short hike.

82
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:18,467
And in hindsight, this was a pretty good choice for me.

83
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:20,088
I think there's a lot of benefits

84
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:23,051
to working on small projects, especially when you're just

85
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:23,531
starting out.

86
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,774
I think they're less risk if they don't pan out.

87
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:28,495
It doesn't have to be a huge success

88
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,836
to be worth the time you put into it.

89
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,518
The smaller goals feel a lot more achievable.

90
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,064
And also, you can release games faster, which can teach you a lot

91
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,228
and possibly get some revenue coming in.

92
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:42,295
So one of the very first things I did in a short hike

93
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:43,817
was develop the look and feel of the game.

94
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:49,254
As a mostly unknown indie developer, I really relied on social media like Twitter to get

95
00:04:49,294 --> 00:04:50,195
people looking at my work.

96
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:55,197
So I think the aesthetic of the game becomes pretty important because you only have a small

97
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:56,638
moment to capture people's attention.

98
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:01,120
And for small developers, or small teams, or solo developers, I think getting a look

99
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,901
like this can be difficult or time consuming.

100
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:07,804
So I consider myself limited in my technical skills in art, like I can't do really great

101
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:11,226
drawings and I haven't done a lot of modeling, so I have to try and find ways to make the

102
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:13,026
game look interesting with the skills that I do have.

103
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,901
So I have more of a background in programming,

104
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,384
and I have more experience with VFX and post-processing.

105
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:21,265
So when I started working on this project,

106
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,107
I kind of wanted to experiment with rendering a tiny world

107
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,408
through these big, crunchy pixels.

108
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:28,270
Other than the fact that I think this look is cool,

109
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:31,553
it also allowed me really to increase the scope of the game.

110
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:34,095
I was able to get away with making simpler models,

111
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:35,816
and I could make more of them much faster.

112
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:38,278
And while this isn't perfect, I think

113
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:40,279
it allows the player to fill in a lot of the details

114
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,781
with their imagination while still kind of giving

115
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,962
the impression that I'm trying to make.

116
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:49,074
And to achieve this effect in Unity, the world is rendered to this tiny render

117
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:49,475
texture.

118
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,456
And then another camera in Unity will look at that texture

119
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,057
and then blow it up with point filtering.

120
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:59,398
I learned this technique by using a plug-in called GB Camera for Unity.

121
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,239
And you can look it up if you're interested in playing around with this

122
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,420
too.

123
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,983
So early on, I was having trouble trying to pick colors

124
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:10,225
that I wanted to use for the game and convey the atmosphere

125
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:10,745
that I wanted.

126
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:14,127
I ended up searching for fall nature photos

127
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:16,668
of the Canadian Shield and sampling colors directly

128
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,049
from them.

129
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,830
These references really helped me establish

130
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,972
the palette for the game and kind of pick

131
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:24,793
that mood and color palette.

132
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,338
But to render these colors true in the game,

133
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,280
they can sometimes be distorted under different lighting

134
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,442
conditions, so I ended up writing a custom mostly unlit

135
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,004
shader that kind of gave me precise control over how

136
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,165
all the shadows would look on every single object.

137
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:42,106
And in general, I tried to ensure

138
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,027
that most textures and shadows appeared

139
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:45,988
flat and consistent when rendered in game.

140
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:49,911
Because if I didn't have that, the pixelated look

141
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,412
would become a lot more apparent and kind of noisy,

142
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:55,134
and I think it makes it a lot more clean when

143
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:56,235
you're able to get rid of that.

144
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:00,399
So here's a quick look at how I adjusted the lighting ramp for a short hike.

145
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,300
On the left, you can see what a default lighting ramp looks like.

146
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:08,042
And then I kind of applied a stair shape to the ramp.

147
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:11,704
And then I ended up kind of shifting all the colors up towards white.

148
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:14,565
So that way, they were really close to their original palette color.

149
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:20,472
Also, by using this flat coloring style, it allowed me to create UV maps really quickly.

150
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:26,296
By unwrapping the UVs just to fit onto a color palette, it allowed me to save a ton of time

151
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:27,937
that I would have spent texturing the object.

152
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:32,700
And it was also really easy to experiment with different colors and alternative palettes

153
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,181
just by swapping out this texture.

154
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:38,874
So I tend to use a lot of post-processing effects

155
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:40,636
to add visual flair to my games.

156
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:45,580
You can get a lot of these effects for free in Unity's default standard asset

157
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:45,940
packs.

158
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,963
And you can kind of quickly experiment with them

159
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:50,704
to change the look and feel of your game

160
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:52,646
without having to actually change a bunch of assets.

161
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,324
So this is what a short hike would look like if you didn't have any effects in it.

162
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:02,051
I think objects in the distance kind of look pretty noisy and it distracts from what's

163
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:03,032
going on in the foreground.

164
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:07,719
So the first thing I do is add a layer of fog to keep the player focused on what's happening

165
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:08,340
in the foreground.

166
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:16,764
And then I add an edge detection post-processing effect to kind of pick out the silhouettes of the things in the background.

167
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:19,925
I think this kind of creates a really dramatic effect.

168
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:25,047
And I actually stumbled upon this look by accident, just as I was experimenting with all the different filters that were available.

169
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,903
And if you look at the arrow on the left-hand side,

170
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:32,427
there you can see the slight difference that's made when I change to,

171
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:35,871
when I change, when I add a color correction as the final step.

172
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:38,654
So I kind of add an extra blue to the shadows

173
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:40,195
to try and make it feel a little more alive.

174
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:47,575
So I guess if you're a small team or a solo developer, here are some things you might be able to take away from this.

175
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:52,421
Play with the strengths that you have and experiment with the tools that are available to you.

176
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:56,927
Consider how the art style itself will affect your workflow and what you're able to create.

177
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:00,451
And your limitations might end up being what makes your work unique.

178
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,194
So most of the art direction work was done in December 2018.

179
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,377
But after I got funding to make it into a tiny project,

180
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,379
I committed to releasing the game in just three months.

181
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,663
So I think the timeline management for this game went pretty well.

182
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:18,107
I wrote up a design document when I first started working on it

183
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:22,431
and kind of planned out three discrete milestones, the alpha

184
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:24,834
and the beta and the release candidate each month apart.

185
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:32,952
And I think one thing that worked really well for me was that I designed this game with a flexible scope in mind.

186
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:36,455
So I was able to keep the core scope of the game really tight,

187
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:39,777
so that I knew I would be able to finish it well within the three month deadline.

188
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:43,240
But there are a lot of features that I really wanted to get in the game,

189
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,022
so I kind of considered them stretch goals.

190
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:49,325
And ideally the game would still be good if the, you know,

191
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:51,687
it would still be fun and playable if those stretch goals weren't made,

192
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:53,509
but it would kind of allow me to, you know...

193
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:59,300
uh... naturally scale the size of the project to the rate at which work was

194
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,121
actually being done

195
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:04,425
uh... and a lot of these stretch goals didn't actually make it into the uh...

196
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:06,427
humble original release but uh...

197
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:09,890
i think the game still worked well without them and i ended up adding some

198
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,732
of those for the later steam and itch.io release

199
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:17,203
And also to keep myself on track, I used a simplified version of the Scrum process.

200
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:21,806
I would usually re-estimate all my tasks for every week and then also at the beginning

201
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:22,326
of every day.

202
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:27,729
This helped me get a good sense of what features I would have time for and helped me plan ahead.

203
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:32,671
And I think it's tempting to skip this step when you're working by yourself, but when

204
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:35,173
I started doing this, I found it really useful to keep myself on track.

205
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:41,000
So I also had an external deadline to hold me accountable on this project.

206
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,563
And for me personally, I think that helped keep me really focused

207
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,726
on finishing something rather than trying to make it something perfect.

208
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:52,590
But I did really want to get as much as I could into this game.

209
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:54,712
So I had to take a few shortcuts.

210
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,054
As I mentioned earlier, the art style was something

211
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:59,517
that allowed me to make a lot of assets faster.

212
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,733
But I was also able to carry over many tools and techniques

213
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:05,314
that I'd used on previous projects.

214
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,997
For example, I used a yarn spinner to handle the dialogue

215
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:11,940
system for my game, which I previously used on the RPG.

216
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,103
I'd already established a workflow with this tool,

217
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:16,904
so I could get up to speed really quickly using it.

218
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:20,107
I also used a plug-in called InControl

219
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:23,290
to handle controller support and automatically take

220
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,051
care of a whole bunch of controllers at once.

221
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:30,008
I used Cinemachine to set up a dynamic camera system really quickly.

222
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:33,129
So it kind of allows me to create a bunch of virtual cameras

223
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:34,410
for different zones in the game.

224
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,831
And then the real camera will transition smoothly between them

225
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,771
as the character walks into different zones.

226
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:41,852
And I think there's a lot of cost.

227
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:44,873
There's a cost to learning new tools like this.

228
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:46,734
But I think it can pay off in the long run,

229
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,214
once you become really familiar with them

230
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,975
and you're able to reuse them across every game.

231
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:54,086
I also have my own set of scripts that I carry forward from game to game.

232
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,168
When I find myself writing generic tools or systems,

233
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,330
I'll usually move them into a separate library

234
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,251
that grows of every single project I work on.

235
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,613
I also reused assets from my RPG where I could,

236
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:05,874
and other things from other games.

237
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:08,656
The level design for the game was mostly done

238
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:10,537
using Unity's default terrain tools.

239
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:14,059
Being able to edit the terrain directly inside Unity

240
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,881
made it really easy to prototype and iterate on the level design.

241
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:22,723
It also was really helpful that I used a triplanar shader to automatically texture the terrain.

242
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:27,228
So this shader effect uses the normal of the mesh to decide which texture to show.

243
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:33,053
That way I could quickly change the texture and create valleys and mountains without having

244
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,055
to re-texture it every time I decided to change it.

245
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:41,306
My terrain shader also incorporated Unity's default terrain painting tools, so it was

246
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:43,208
really easy to add beaches and paths.

247
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,312
I had to modify the blending code a bit so that I maintained the sharp edges that I wanted

248
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:53,435
to use for this style, but that was one of the changes I had to make.

249
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:57,258
So I also made a few custom tools for my game.

250
00:12:57,478 --> 00:13:00,541
Some of them were pretty simple, just as a shortcut for moving the player around the

251
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:03,923
map and previewing the look in the camera, or the angle of the camera.

252
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:10,235
I also ended up building a tool for river and waterfall meshes, so I could create them

253
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:11,216
right inside the editor.

254
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:17,941
Before this, I would model the waterfalls and UV them in Blender, and then I would import

255
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:22,044
them into Unity, and I'd have to go back and forth every time I changed the terrain.

256
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:26,329
But by making this tool, I was able to save a ton of time

257
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:30,654
and actually had fun making rivers instead of finding them really tedious.

258
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:34,359
And creating custom tools like this can take a lot of time, though.

259
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:38,063
So I'd only recommend building them once your workflow actually demands them.

260
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,049
And one of the last things I want to throw in

261
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,810
is that when you're designing big worlds like this,

262
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,371
it's easy for things to get a bit buggy.

263
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:48,532
Assured Hike had its own handful of wonky camera issues

264
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:49,332
and weird slopes.

265
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,833
And I knew about a lot of these issues,

266
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:53,873
but I prioritized adding more content,

267
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:55,013
over-fixing some of them.

268
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:58,794
And I think players were willing to forgive a lot of these issues

269
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:01,155
if they noticed them at all, especially for a game that was

270
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:03,556
pretty clearly an indie game made by a small team.

271
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:10,622
So to summarize some of the tips that helped me meet my deadline, I create milestones and

272
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:11,582
update my estimates.

273
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,685
You can account for unpredictability in your scope.

274
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:19,889
You can reuse knowledge, tools, and assets, and create tools when the workflow demands

275
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:20,049
it.

276
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:22,211
And also you don't need to fix every single bug.

277
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,375
So next I want to talk a little bit about designing the island of Hawk Peak and some

278
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:28,656
of the lessons that I learned along the way.

279
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:32,594
I wanted to make a game where getting lost was part of the gameplay.

280
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:37,878
I feel like the freedom to go in any direction at any time adds a sense of magic to the game.

281
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:42,482
Every untraveled path contains the promise of something new, and I really wanted to capture

282
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:44,383
the feeling that there's always more out there to discover.

283
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:51,900
So when I started building the island, I just jumped straight into Unity and just sculpted areas that felt fun to climb and fly on.

284
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,884
This process led to a whole bunch of ideas and inspirations for what I actually wanted to include on the mountain.

285
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,926
So I eventually jotted down all those ideas,

286
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:06,611
brainstormed different activities and regions, and then I made a plan for what I thought the main path of the island would be.

287
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:10,817
So, this path that I came up with starts here at this cabin.

288
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,008
Since there's only one clear path to take from here, I expect that the player will head this way towards town.

289
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:21,497
In this area, they'll meet characters that teach you how to play the game and

290
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:25,119
introduce you to the world, but they'll be kind of trapped in this area for the

291
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:25,699
time being.

292
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:30,042
Eventually, you'll be able to collect a golden feather, which allows you to

293
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:31,963
climb up walls and flap your wings.

294
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:35,925
And once you've got this, you'll be able to pass that barrier and get to the

295
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:36,546
rest of the game.

296
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:40,828
So once you've passed that, I expected the player would either go up the left

297
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:41,949
or the right side of the mountain.

298
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:46,432
And I eventually kind of led the path so that it would eventually lead you to

299
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:48,033
this one meeting point up near the top.

300
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:51,940
At that point, you wouldn't be able to get to the very top of the mountain

301
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,261
unless you had collected at least seven golden feathers.

302
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:59,464
And that way, players wouldn't be able to beat the game just

303
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:00,224
by running to the end.

304
00:16:00,244 --> 00:16:02,465
They'd have to actually explore a bit and discover the island.

305
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:05,958
So I knew there were a lot of shortcuts you could take.

306
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:10,100
Like, I had this main plan, but there are lots of ways you can get around it by finding

307
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,881
weird slopes or other routes.

308
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:15,744
And I wanted to leave these options in the game to maintain a sense of freedom.

309
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:19,426
Because I think it feels really satisfying as a player when you feel like you're following

310
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,108
your own path or maybe doing something the game didn't expect you to do.

311
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:28,791
But even so, coming up with this rough plan is useful because it helps me control the experience better.

312
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:35,877
I think one of the playtesters who was trying the game would get bored if they were spent too long just exploring without meeting anybody.

313
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:41,221
But if they were in an area with a ton of NPCs, they eventually wouldn't talk to them all and just kind of run off a bit.

314
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:48,007
So I think it got me thinking about the pacing of the game, and I wanted to introduce new characters and places

315
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:52,110
kind of over a period of time to keep the interest up as you went along.

316
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:56,105
So having that plan helped me structure and pace the game,

317
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:57,947
but things didn't always go as I thought.

318
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:01,312
One of the patterns that I noticed quickly during play testing

319
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:03,616
is that many players didn't follow this first path.

320
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:06,320
You know, instead, they just plunged straight into the ocean.

321
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:10,659
I think that players like to test the bounds of the game when they first start.

322
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,980
And you know, they want to see, will the game let you just swim into the ocean?

323
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,160
And I wanted to say, yes, you can.

324
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,341
And then if you do, there will even be stuff out there for you to find, like islands and

325
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:22,221
stuff for you to discover.

326
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,082
But for some players, you know, this wasn't enough for them.

327
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:28,863
You know, they just kept going, all the way around the backside of the mountain.

328
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,263
And this behavior was surprisingly common.

329
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:36,124
You know, it wasn't done by all players, but it was a pattern that I saw a number of

330
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:36,505
times.

331
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:41,310
So, this is a bit of a problem because many players would get lost on the backside of

332
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,994
the mountain and they would kind of miss out on the important tutorial information that

333
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:47,598
I'd put in the way I expected you to go.

334
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,043
And this was even more problematic in earlier playtests of the game because there wasn't

335
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,246
really much behind the mountain.

336
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:59,768
So to solve this problem, I eventually added a cave on the backside of the mountain.

337
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:03,913
I think if players were heading along that way, this cave would naturally draw people's

338
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:05,716
curiosity and they'd head through it.

339
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:08,419
And this would lead you right back to the tutorial zone.

340
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:17,293
Most of the players that had gotten off track would wind up where I wanted them to.

341
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:21,056
But even for those that didn't, they saw the cave and they were like, that's not for me.

342
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:24,859
And they just kept going, that's fine because it's an island.

343
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,120
You'll eventually get back there.

344
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:30,643
So this is one of the ways that I tried to keep the player on track.

345
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:36,247
I wanted to provide some gentle guidance without feeling like the player was forced to do anything.

346
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:39,334
There are many ways to guide the player.

347
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:43,740
I think it helps the pacing of the game if they roughly follow my plan.

348
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,367
So if they're guided naturally by things like curiosity, like a cave or a cool landmark,

349
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:54,233
I think that can make it not feel like the player is following a scripted path.

350
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:59,357
But there are also more direct ways to get the player to go where you want them to go.

351
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:05,141
I could use trails of coins or items to draw players off the beaten track if I wanted them

352
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:06,822
to explore certain areas.

353
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:12,225
But if I wanted them to get back on traft, they could stumble across a path and heading

354
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:14,727
down any path would generally lead you back to a main area.

355
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:20,949
And there were also signs as kind of a last-ditch attempt to get you back on track, because

356
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:24,290
people don't really like reading in games, or they won't kind of breeze by it.

357
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,211
So for people who really got lost and wanted to get back, they could read the signs and

358
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,111
then figure out where to go.

359
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:31,592
But otherwise, they'd kind of ignore them.

360
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:38,994
And also, since the goal of the game was to get to the top of the mountain, players could

361
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:42,135
generally figure out how to get there just by going up any incline.

362
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,495
There's a few different ways to keep people on track.

363
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:51,078
So another thing was to use gates and block off areas

364
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:53,780
until a player has gained certain knowledge or experiences.

365
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,742
But I think it's, I didn't use any literal gates in my game like this.

366
00:19:57,762 --> 00:19:58,923
I tried to use natural gates.

367
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:05,425
In a short hike all these gates that I used were just cliffs that you couldn't get past without enough golden feathers

368
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:11,127
So in this way the gates feel more natural and also maybe suggest that there's multiple ways to tackle the problem

369
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:12,868
Like if you can't get up this cliff here

370
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:16,249
Yeah, that's you can come back to it later when you've got a golden feather

371
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:19,570
but you could also maybe find some other route if you kept exploring the edge of the

372
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,250
the edge of the cliff

373
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,808
And it's also clear that when you have a gate like this,

374
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:26,369
that you can't get past.

375
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,731
Once you get that golden feather,

376
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:29,753
there's a very clear correlation between, like,

377
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:32,635
you getting the jumping ability and then being able to get across,

378
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:34,857
get up higher, somewhere you couldn't get before.

379
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,002
So another thing that I tried to do to keep people

380
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:45,680
on track was use silent repetition as what I'm calling it I guess.

381
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,024
So there were, for example, early on in the game there's this toy shovel that you can

382
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:55,828
find and you trade it for a real shovel so you can dig up things across the island.

383
00:20:56,489 --> 00:21:00,452
And it's technically an optional item, but if players miss it, I think they end up missing

384
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:01,933
like a lot throughout the game.

385
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,697
They'll be kind of exploring and seeing all these digging spots that they can interact

386
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:09,680
with and I think it's more fun if they actually can and it gives them more stuff to find.

387
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,404
So I originally placed this toy shovel at a crossroads that I was certain players would pass

388
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:19,466
and eventually early in the game they would find it, then they would, you know, trade it in for the

389
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:24,049
real shovel and then be good for the rest of the game. But a lot of players would still avoid this.

390
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:28,232
They'd, for some reason, you know, they'd walk right past it, they wouldn't see it, or they'd

391
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:34,676
just find some other cliff and completely derail my plans. So I ended up placing not just one

392
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:38,318
toy shovel, but I placed five of them all around the starting area.

393
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:43,343
So, as soon as a player picked one of them up, though, all the rest of them would disappear.

394
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:47,548
So that way, players would feel like they discovered it on their own, even though it's

395
00:21:47,588 --> 00:21:50,271
practically guaranteed at this point, because you can't miss it.

396
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:56,069
So this ended up solving the problem and that worked really well, but I also ended up using

397
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:58,571
this technique with just things like tutorial information.

398
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:03,213
So like there's a point later in the game where you have to climb all the way to the

399
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:06,655
top of the mountain, and you can actually get that far in the game without actually

400
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:09,157
learning how to climb since there's also a double jump ability.

401
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:14,766
So to make sure that players, when they got to that point,

402
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:18,148
if they haven't been able to climb yet,

403
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:20,208
there would be a sign up there that would tell you, hey,

404
00:22:20,248 --> 00:22:22,369
this is how you climb, and this is why it's useful.

405
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:24,350
But if the player had already demonstrated

406
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,491
that they've learned how to climb at that point,

407
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,512
then it wouldn't bother showing you that information.

408
00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:34,114
So one of the last things that I want to talk about.

409
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:40,855
was priming the player. So I guess getting certain things into their mind when they're playing your

410
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:45,777
game. So about the climbing, it was pretty difficult to early on to get players to learn

411
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:51,220
to climb. I guess it's not a very intuitive thing because you know most games you can jump but you

412
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,961
can't really climb every single wall that you see.

413
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:55,262
And also it's very contextual.

414
00:22:55,322 --> 00:22:57,363
You need to be pressing against the wall and holding A.

415
00:22:57,663 --> 00:22:59,244
And that doesn't really happen by accident.

416
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:02,004
So it was hard for players to learn this accidentally.

417
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,865
And even though one of the characters told you this,

418
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:06,186
players would just kind of breeze through this dialogue

419
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:07,866
and then kind of forget what had been said.

420
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:12,468
So what I ended up doing was I created a climbers club

421
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:13,128
that was in the game.

422
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:16,874
And if you talk to them, well, you have a golden feather.

423
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:18,915
They'll walk you through the process of climbing.

424
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:23,037
But even if players miss this quest, they would still generally,

425
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:25,318
they'd walk by it and see other characters climbing.

426
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:28,920
And hopefully, when they actually got that prompt to climb,

427
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,981
it would be kind of more at the front of their mind

428
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:33,842
because they'd seen other characters doing it and they've talked about it.

429
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:37,284
So hopefully, I think after I added this club,

430
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:39,585
it solved that problem of players not learning how to climb.

431
00:23:41,844 --> 00:23:44,308
So I want to talk a little bit about the final area of the game.

432
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:47,252
So this was probably the trickiest area to design.

433
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:50,257
I wanted this area to be a bit like a puzzle,

434
00:23:51,018 --> 00:23:52,600
and a little more difficult than the rest of the game.

435
00:23:54,454 --> 00:24:01,219
So when the player gets to this area, the feathers no longer come back automatically.

436
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,902
So as you use them up, they'll freeze and you'll have to go back to either a hot spring

437
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:07,923
or a warm campfire until they'll come back.

438
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:14,127
So in that way, players can't just use all the feathers they've gotten to just run to

439
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:14,507
the top.

440
00:24:14,768 --> 00:24:17,970
They've got to figure out how to ration them and what areas they can stop and restore them

441
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,511
and make a plan for how they get up the mountain.

442
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:27,128
And the original design of this area was a lot smaller than the final one and was also confusing to play

443
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:33,532
I actually ended up having to redo that entire area of the mountain and that was difficult because it was one of the last

444
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:39,515
Things that I did so I had to redo the surrounding areas and make room for all this extra space

445
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,297
That was something that I think I could have done better was maybe tackle this part first

446
00:24:44,878 --> 00:24:48,860
But another thing that I added to the final version was I added this very clear route to the top.

447
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,942
So when players would get to this area, they'd follow the main path and it would eventually lead them almost all the way to the top,

448
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,243
but they wouldn't have enough feathers to make it if they had seven at that time.

449
00:24:58,883 --> 00:25:06,926
So it kind of let them see where the goal was, but then they had to work backwards from that to actually plan a route that would get up there

450
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,527
without just going the direct, most obvious way.

451
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:14,546
And I also ended up putting a lot more feathers in the game.

452
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:17,748
In an early play test, they were a lot harder to find,

453
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:18,668
and there were fewer of them.

454
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:21,370
And it kind of made it so that when players got to this point,

455
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,751
they'd end up getting a little bit stuck.

456
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:25,292
And then they would have to go back on the island and like a.

457
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:30,916
scour it for any signs of feathers and I think that really hurt the pacing of the game and

458
00:25:30,936 --> 00:25:34,919
I ended up making it a lot more generous so that players were kind of going at a good pace

459
00:25:34,939 --> 00:25:38,561
throughout and they didn't really kind of get stuck and I think like maybe the game would have

460
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:42,424
been longer if I made it harder to find all those feathers but I think it was worth it to keep the

461
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:44,785
pacing interesting throughout the experience.

462
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:48,836
So now I want to talk a bit about the writing.

463
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:52,762
When I started working on this game, I didn't really expect there to be a lot of writing.

464
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:55,446
But I ended up writing a lot for this game.

465
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:59,232
And this was difficult for me, because writing is hard.

466
00:25:59,713 --> 00:26:00,694
At least for me, anyways.

467
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:06,478
Because when I was working on my RPG before this, writing was one of the things that I

468
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,619
really struggled with the most.

469
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:13,882
I really wanted to write a story and also dialogue itself that was going to be personal

470
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:16,003
or meaningful or at the very least funny.

471
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:19,525
And yeah, that was one of the main things that I struggled with.

472
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:23,448
So when I started A Short Hike, I made a few decisions that ended up making the writing

473
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:24,408
process a bit easier.

474
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:28,006
So for one, I tried to write more natural conversations.

475
00:26:28,406 --> 00:26:31,948
Instead of using these big text boxes with kind of a long monologue,

476
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:34,569
I would use small bubbles without really any punctuation.

477
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:36,670
This actually kind of felt more like the way

478
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,530
that I would write when I'm texting people.

479
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:42,272
So I guess as a millennial, that's all I do these days.

480
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:46,736
It was a lot easier to kind of write natural conversations this way.

481
00:26:47,217 --> 00:26:51,361
I also made Claire not a silent protagonist, like other games that I was working on.

482
00:26:51,802 --> 00:26:53,904
And she actually talks a whole bunch throughout the game.

483
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:58,849
And this was a lot easier to write, because natural conversations have two people in them.

484
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,892
They're usually just not one person talking to you.

485
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:07,616
And another thing was that I didn't really, I didn't put as much pressure on myself when I was working on a short hike.

486
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:12,539
I kind of approached the writing initially just as a silly improvisational kind of way.

487
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:17,021
I didn't expect it to really like carry the game and not be a main part of the gameplay.

488
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:22,944
So I think by maybe like taking it less seriously, I was able to get stuck on it less and just kind of roll with it.

489
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:26,989
And it also just helped to have a second pair of eyes looking at my work.

490
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,215
Whenever my partner would get home from work, she'd usually look over what I'd written that day

491
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:35,320
or test out what I'd been playing. And during my worst writing blocks,

492
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,684
she'd help me draft some conversations and get through with them and

493
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:40,707
I guess get it done.

494
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,221
So now I'm going to talk a bit about the release of the game.

495
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:50,263
So Short Hike was originally released as part of April's

496
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:51,343
Humble Monthly service.

497
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:53,404
And the reception of this was pretty positive.

498
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:56,465
I can't be certain how many people played this release, but

499
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:57,605
I got a lot of kind feedback.

500
00:27:58,185 --> 00:28:01,106
So I decided that I'd work on a big update for its eventual

501
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,767
release on Steam and itch.io, partially because there's a

502
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,168
lot of things that I still wanted to add, but also

503
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:08,649
because I hoped it would generate some buzz around the

504
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:09,309
commercial release.

505
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,932
The biggest things that I added to the game during this period were the mini-games,

506
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:16,194
such as the fishing and the beach stickball and racing.

507
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:19,236
There was also a bunch of other stuff that I needed to do during this time.

508
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:23,474
So I tried to get the word out for my game

509
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:24,614
by sharing work on Twitter.

510
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:26,735
I would try to come up with interesting GIFs

511
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:28,535
that either talked about the development of the game

512
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:29,896
or showcased scenes from the game.

513
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,196
The Twitter ended up being really useful for me.

514
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:36,117
It allowed people to get excited about my game.

515
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:40,098
It also gave me feedback on what other people are interested in.

516
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,599
I saw a lot of people really liked the GIFs where

517
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,239
the character was flying, so I tried

518
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:46,219
to make sure I put that at the beginning of my trailer.

519
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,560
And it was also just motivating for myself

520
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,060
to see other people interested in my work.

521
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:53,582
I also ended up creating a press kit to send out to journalists.

522
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:57,385
I tried to reach out to journalists that covered games that were similar to mine.

523
00:28:57,845 --> 00:29:02,428
So for example, I collected contact information of writers that liked the Frog Detective game,

524
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,510
and I sent my press kit to them, hoping that if they were interested in that game, they

525
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:08,131
might be interested in my game as well.

526
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:10,893
I also reached out to anybody who had liked my work on Twitter.

527
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:15,356
Not all of them wrote an article about my game during release week, but several of them

528
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:17,577
did, which was a big success for me.

529
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:23,951
And also, I don't think a short game was, I don't think a short hike was really a game for everybody.

530
00:29:24,232 --> 00:29:31,375
It's kind of like a slower, more slow-paced game, and there's not really any real puzzles or combat or anything.

531
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:37,978
And I wanted to make sure I got that across to players, so they weren't expecting something a lot more and came out of it disappointed.

532
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:41,179
So I tried to be careful with the presentation of the game on its web pages.

533
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:43,560
I tried to use the word short right in its title.

534
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:47,651
I also emphasized that it was a little exploration game.

535
00:29:49,393 --> 00:29:51,735
But also, I wanted to make sure that players, when they're playing it,

536
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:54,137
actually approach it with the right mindset as well.

537
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:57,220
I kind of thought, in the beginning of the game,

538
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,181
it starts off with this dialogue that's actually

539
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:00,302
covering up a loading screen.

540
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:04,446
But it also tries to tell players that they're getting away from the city,

541
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:06,147
trying to take a break from things that are going on.

542
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:07,869
And hopefully, I would.

543
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:11,218
this would get players subconsciously in the frame of mind that this is a game

544
00:30:11,238 --> 00:30:13,705
that they can relax to, not one that they're going to be challenged by with

545
00:30:13,766 --> 00:30:15,270
puzzles or combat or anything.

546
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:18,168
So eventually the game came out on July 30th.

547
00:30:18,288 --> 00:30:21,890
It released on Steam and itch.io with the extra mile update.

548
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:25,213
I had modest expectations for how a small game like this would do,

549
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:26,653
but it ended up exceeding those for me.

550
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:29,095
And the user reviews for the game are really positive.

551
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,537
And during release week, most of the external visits to my game,

552
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:35,859
external visits to my Steam page came from Twitter.

553
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,001
And I think the traffic from Twitter helped

554
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:43,544
get the game noticed by the Steam's algorithm

555
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:45,845
and then drive a lot of traffic to it through Steam.

556
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:52,107
Over release week, most of the traffic to my Steam page just came from Steam itself,

557
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:55,488
either from the discovery queue or the new and trending thing, so I think that was really

558
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:58,289
useful, the momentum that Twitter pushed to my game.

559
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,770
And I guess that's wrapping up the whole development.

560
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,210
Thank you very much.

561
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:01,470
Thank you.

562
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:01,671
Thank you.

563
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:01,931
Thank you.

564
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:02,231
Thank you.

565
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:02,451
Thank you.

566
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:02,651
Thank you.

567
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:02,991
Thank you.

568
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:03,531
Thank you.

569
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:03,731
Thank you.

570
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:03,931
Thank you.

571
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:04,151
Thank you.

572
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:04,371
Thank you.

573
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:04,612
Thank you.
