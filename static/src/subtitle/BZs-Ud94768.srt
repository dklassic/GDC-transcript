1
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:09,380
Okay, my name is Becca Saltzman,

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,861
and I'm the CEO and co-founder of Finji with Adam Saltzman,

3
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:13,162
who is also my husband,

4
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:14,983
so no, we're not brother and sister, thank you.

5
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:17,504
People who think we look alike, I appreciate that.

6
00:00:18,464 --> 00:00:21,486
I'm going to talk today about how we maintain good conflict

7
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:23,967
and avoid toxicity in everyday decision making at Finji,

8
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:27,569
with both of our internal development projects

9
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:29,490
and our partner publishing projects.

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,371
So give me a second, let me actually start my timer,

11
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:31,991
because I forgot to.

12
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:38,474
Okay. So who am I? I'm going to go through some stuff that we've done, stuff that we're

13
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:42,917
working on so you have a little bit of context. Because sometimes, especially me, I'm

14
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:47,580
completely invisible generally with Finji. So we've worked on a lot of projects over the

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,903
years. Some of our previous titles at Finji and our previous iPhone company.

16
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:57,205
include cannibals, which is sort of like the first endless runner, gravity hook, hundreds and

17
00:00:57,245 --> 00:01:02,627
capsule, which is like seriously niche horror. We've also done a lot of weird turn key work in

18
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:08,230
advertising and the education and research space. So with old spice, hunger games, stuff like

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,812
that. We're currently building overland with a small distributed team all over the United

20
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:20,335
States. And after three years of development, we published night in the woods last week. So I

21
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:29,857
Sorry if you didn't play it. Apologies. Adam hasn't played it either. Long story with that.

22
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:38,200
I have played it though ten times. Or more. Okay. The problem. Okay. Adam and I get asked

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,382
regularly how we can possibly stand to work together day in and day out since we're married

24
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:48,003
and we run an indie development studio which we've been doing for like a decade because we're

25
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:48,563
straight up old.

26
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:51,496
Way older than most people think I am.

27
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:54,959
And this talk is not going to cover ways to be a nice person

28
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:57,822
or words to use to not be a jerk.

29
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:01,226
I'm straight up going to assume that you've been to preschool.

30
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:06,205
But I am going to tell you about a problem.

31
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:08,566
We've noticed with our development teams over the years

32
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:09,807
and our friends' development teams.

33
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:12,268
We've seen the wrong kinds of tension and conflict

34
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:13,668
produce catastrophic outcomes.

35
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:16,589
We've seen canceled games, wrecked friendships,

36
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,610
sleepless nights, wasted life savings,

37
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,811
and Adam and I have actually experienced

38
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:22,392
all of these things over the last decade.

39
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,493
And we've, over the last couple of years,

40
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,973
have found ways to collaborate,

41
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:29,875
but lower the risk of disastrous results.

42
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:35,618
So based on our experiences of the last two or three years,

43
00:02:35,838 --> 00:02:38,020
especially, there are some solutions

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,401
that we propose that can help avoid

45
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:41,563
some of the most toxic team conflicts

46
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:42,464
that we've encountered.

47
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:46,227
So one, use a planning and design process

48
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,029
that emphasizes problems and solutions and downplays ego.

49
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,254
Two, maintain flat and concrete discussions of plans,

50
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:57,817
I'm sorry, maintain flat and concrete discussions

51
00:02:57,857 --> 00:02:59,058
of plans and design merits.

52
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,873
Three, learn how to postpone contentious decisions

53
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:05,374
as long as they're not bottlenecks to current development.

54
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:10,896
Four, trust but verify your experts within each discipline.

55
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,758
And five, always engage external mentors,

56
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,578
especially for long-term planning.

57
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:20,657
you're thinking, whoa, that sounds awesome, but how in the

58
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:26,459
hell do you do that? It's all great. That's cool. So first

59
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,560
we're going to start with like the very, very, very first one

60
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,562
which is keeping ego out of your pitches when you talk to your

61
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:37,343
team on how to solve problems. And this is our methodology that

62
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:39,704
we use. Oops, I'm sorry. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,

63
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:45,856
So there are three things that we do.

64
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:47,699
One, we identify the problem.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,882
Two, we develop a solution.

66
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:51,184
And three, we present it to the team,

67
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:52,707
which seems really simple.

68
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:56,513
However, identifying the problem.

69
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:00,391
For example, a problem that you may come across.

70
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,992
This thing we've already built totally sucks,

71
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:03,752
happens a lot.

72
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:05,493
This part of the game is missing something,

73
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:06,453
also happens a lot.

74
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,935
We have these things to do but no time to do it,

75
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:10,115
pretty much our life.

76
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:13,017
Our players don't get it, yes.

77
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:16,238
It isn't fun when we get to this part of the game,

78
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,339
obviously.

79
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,940
Basically, which problems or issues

80
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,881
are you even trying to get rid of?

81
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:23,702
You have to identify that first

82
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,283
and you have to be specific.

83
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,631
Second, you need to develop your theory on how to fix it.

84
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,252
This isn't necessarily the team's theory,

85
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:33,253
this is your theory.

86
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:34,774
You identify the problem,

87
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:36,755
you develop a theory on how to fix it.

88
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:38,396
You have to put in the work.

89
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:42,558
This isn't like, hey dudes, this shit's broken, you fix it.

90
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:45,659
You identified it, you must have an idea of how to fix it.

91
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,932
So some things that we do internally, we make thumbnails,

92
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:52,353
we draw comics, we hack together test levels,

93
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:55,175
we build tiny prototypes to test mechanics.

94
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:58,056
It's a requirement for our teams

95
00:04:58,076 --> 00:04:59,557
that if you believe in your idea,

96
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:02,079
you must also do the initial legwork

97
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,900
so the team understands where you're coming from.

98
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:10,443
Sometimes this is just like a really carefully phrased

99
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,325
suggestion, but often it's much, much, much more in depth.

100
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,682
And finally, you need to present your idea,

101
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,564
which is actually one of the scariest ones

102
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:22,946
because we all have some form of social anxiety

103
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:24,808
and not like, ha ha, we're video game developers,

104
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,049
but like we're straight up humans, guys.

105
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,551
Like we're putting ourselves and our ideas on the line

106
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:29,331
and that's scary.

107
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,614
So yeah, you are required on our teams

108
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:33,475
to present your ideas.

109
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:37,118
It's awesome, you've identified the problems

110
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:38,919
and figured out a great way to solve them,

111
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,981
but now we really need to hear them.

112
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,675
Now, I need to clarify here that these aren't formal things

113
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:45,356
that we go through.

114
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:48,198
This isn't like a process or a checklist

115
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,940
like you need to identify.

116
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,062
And that's not how we work.

117
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,083
We're like human beings and we're friends.

118
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:55,985
And this is a collaborative process.

119
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:58,987
So these are guidelines that inform

120
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,068
the way that we work together.

121
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,392
So one, when you're at the present part of this,

122
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:04,952
we explain up.

123
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,428
This means that you're explaining the pros of the solution to the problem that you've

124
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:19,620
identified. Basically you've fixed the existing problem or you've introduced something that's

125
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,402
new and interesting.

126
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,099
Two, you explain down.

127
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,640
This means that you are identifying

128
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,561
as many downsides as possible

129
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,223
to the theory that you have already worked through.

130
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:33,204
This might include development time,

131
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:34,245
it's gonna take too long,

132
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,786
infrastructure changes, which is pretty scary,

133
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,848
affected functionality of the other systems in the game,

134
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:42,730
which for something like Overland is like legit terrifying

135
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,270
because it's like a balanced strategy game,

136
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,992
changes to the asset pipeline, which...

137
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:51,697
I'm not even going to get into that, with some of the games

138
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:52,437
that we've worked on.

139
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:55,159
It could take a week to fix that sort of stuff.

140
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,762
But these are the downsides of making any sort of change in

141
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:01,063
your development process or the design of your game.

142
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:04,626
Three, you need to engage the team in the discussion with an

143
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:06,307
open mind and mutual respect.

144
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:08,949
And this is going a little bit back to preschool, but this is

145
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:10,290
also being a grown up.

146
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,652
People have ideas, and you may not like those ideas, but you

147
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:14,793
really do need to hear them out.

148
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,314
And that goes both ways.

149
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:19,655
Should we do the idea that you proposed?

150
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:23,016
Are there downsides that you haven't considered

151
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,697
because the people you work with are smart,

152
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:26,517
brilliant game designers,

153
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:28,078
and they are gonna come up with things

154
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:30,158
and poke holes in things that you think are ironclad.

155
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:34,279
Can we tweak it to have more pros and less cons?

156
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,680
And is your idea a good fit and why?

157
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:43,582
Now, why does this method of communication work

158
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:44,802
for our Fingy development teams?

159
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,113
Now this only works because from the very foundation of our

160
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,815
development team, we have a shared goal.

161
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:54,038
And the goal is that the game matters more than our egos.

162
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,563
And basically, everything else that we bring from the

163
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,365
external in, the game matters.

164
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:01,828
And we need to be true to what the game wants to be.

165
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:01,888
So.

166
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:14,200
We have a shared goal on what the tone of the game should be, what the audience is going to be,

167
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,521
and what the actual goal from the very beginning is going to be.

168
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:18,982
If the team isn't on the same page when it comes to tone,

169
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,183
then you're not building the same game.

170
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:22,204
You're building a different game.

171
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,445
If you're not on the same page when it comes to audience,

172
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:26,986
then you're all building a different game.

173
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,408
And if you're not on the same page when it comes to your development goals,

174
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:31,848
you're also building a different game.

175
00:08:36,113 --> 00:08:39,976
Engage also only works when suggestions and counterarguments are concrete.

176
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:44,880
We talk about a lot of things that, or we talk about things that are answerable in our

177
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,284
discussions, our development discussions, and can be backed up by side-by-side comparisons,

178
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,546
paper prototypes, very strong logical arguments or observations.

179
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:55,108
We treat design discussions like science.

180
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,273
We make falsifiable claims, and this means that you're making claims that can be proven

181
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:01,574
or disproven.

182
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,703
And finally, this only works the way that we talk to each other is if you are able to

183
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:12,645
demonstrate in clear terms for the specific game being built why things are contradictory

184
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:17,347
or complementary. Talking about things that are good for game design in an abstract is

185
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:23,071
super cool and you can do that over beer like later on at the bar. But that is frequently

186
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:26,672
extremely counterproductive when you're trying to solve a single problem that's been

187
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:30,555
identified. Now why?

188
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,148
Why do we run our development team in this way?

189
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:37,831
This produces features that can include support from the

190
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:40,092
whole team, and everybody understands what the new

191
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:40,913
features are.

192
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:43,854
We also get buy-in and understanding.

193
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,780
Basically, online and the new features are important.

194
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,502
Team members have a chance to contribute

195
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:52,663
to the design of the game.

196
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:54,024
And this one's really important for us.

197
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:56,126
We've actually been asked over the years,

198
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,827
isn't it awesome that Adam totally hired

199
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:01,229
all these inexperienced people to work on the game

200
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:02,369
so we can tell them what to do?

201
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,272
And my brain is exploding because I'm like,

202
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:06,972
are you kidding?

203
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:08,673
We hired these people because they're brilliant

204
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:12,176
and we need them to contribute to the design of the game

205
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:14,057
because it's better and more amazing

206
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:15,378
because they're working with us.

207
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,539
And equally important, we can make changes and provide

208
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,600
feedback before implementation when it is very, very cheap to

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:22,960
do so.

210
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,721
So I'm going to go through some examples real quick.

211
00:10:26,482 --> 00:10:27,062
Well, not real quick.

212
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:27,722
It's part of the talk.

213
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:32,364
Of some of the ways that we've used this, specifically in the

214
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,544
development of Overland.

215
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:37,286
And I'm going to show you some really ugly stuff, and I'm

216
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:37,666
sorry.

217
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:41,187
It gets uglier, I promise.

218
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:43,048
So Overland has a roster.

219
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:45,009
So this is like a real-time strategy game that we've been

220
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:45,409
building for.

221
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,103
like half my life it feels like at this point.

222
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:53,949
three years. And it's getting there. It's getting so pretty and so wonderful. This is our old

223
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:56,911
roster. I'm going to show you the old roster which is what you're looking at and then I'm

224
00:10:56,931 --> 00:11:01,515
going to show you the new roster. So we had these little icons that totally weren't selling it.

225
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:06,360
They had annoying screen size problems. They were super repetitive. It cluttered up the

226
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,723
screen. There was just like junk everywhere. And it didn't solve the problem where we needed

227
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:15,568
our players to grow attached to their crew. We needed them to have empathy for their little

228
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,368
dudes on the screen.

229
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:21,834
or dudettes or doggies. We totally have doggies. Obviously.

230
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:27,899
And yeah, totally wasn't selling it. So, uh, so, so, so, so, so,

231
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,176
This is our new overland roster. We proposed a group photo with the current player

232
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:40,501
highlighted. It's turn based game so Cletus is our highlighted player. And we talked to the

233
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:45,866
pros basically showing group togetherness and groupness a lot better. This is down in the

234
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:51,851
corner of the screen. And the cons which was seriously a lot of extra work. We didn't have

235
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:54,774
any ‑‑ I mean we had some like ‑‑

236
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:59,608
code that we could kind of reuse for this, but we straight up had to build this from

237
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:00,849
scratch and it took a while.

238
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:07,271
But this combined ideas from Adam and Heather Penn, who's like a magical, our art director,

239
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:12,193
to produce something better than we could do individually with really in the long run

240
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:14,373
not too much investment or work.

241
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,235
So that's like one of my first examples.

242
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:19,932
The next one.

243
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:22,233
So in Overland, as you're playing,

244
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:24,054
you go on your little 9 by 9 grids.

245
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,516
And then the higher level strategy board is,

246
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,739
or strategy level screen, is our map screen.

247
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,921
So I'm not going to actually talk about the map screen.

248
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:36,662
I'm going to talk about that fire right there.

249
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,723
And you're thinking, yeah, OK, whatever.

250
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:42,755
So we got all these really, really cool animations

251
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:44,776
because for the longest time,

252
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:46,497
like our dudes just like slid around the screen

253
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:49,119
and Yurka, our animator in LA,

254
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,460
sent us all these animations

255
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,980
and we built up the map screens

256
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:54,322
to show the car would drive in,

257
00:12:55,503 --> 00:12:57,384
it would pause, it would park,

258
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,786
the passengers, all of them, would get out,

259
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:02,747
walk over to the campfire,

260
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,908
which is like totally thematically appropriate,

261
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:08,010
sit down, and we just kept going.

262
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,631
It looked awesome.

263
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:17,838
It looked super cool and it was totally keeping with the thematic, with the theme of Overland,

264
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:21,540
which is like you're survivors on a road trip across, you know, post-apocalyptic America.

265
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:29,784
Except, thank you Heather, as she pointed out, it created legit horrible pacing.

266
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:32,608
You had to sit there forever and it was boring.

267
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:36,412
It looked awesome, but it was so boring and it took forever.

268
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:39,937
You were already done strategizing and people were still moving.

269
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,489
So she suggested that we should basically just jump cut it.

270
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,711
We absolutely could not agree on this

271
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,592
because it's really hard to cut your babies

272
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:51,573
that you think are really cool.

273
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,935
So we're like, whatever, we're gonna program this up.

274
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:59,337
It took five seconds and she was absolutely 100% right,

275
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:01,078
which is a theme with Overland.

276
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,299
Heather's always right.

277
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,661
She really is an incredible game designer

278
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:09,603
and no, you can't have her, not yet.

279
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,165
Nope, she's ours.

280
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,086
She's ours for a little bit longer.

281
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:17,668
All right, here's another Overland example.

282
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:20,349
We had an entire cast of Overland characters,

283
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:21,350
which looked like this,

284
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,951
who are like super cool, super iconic,

285
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:25,712
and they were in the game for quite a long time.

286
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:27,574
We spent a lot of time designing them in the first place.

287
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:31,456
It was super easy to produce,

288
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:34,998
and most importantly in any game development, it was done.

289
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:37,479
We were done with game characters.

290
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:43,506
And in our, the way we work, if it ain't fixed,

291
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,528
don't touch it.

292
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:47,570
Like it's not broken, it's fine.

293
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,952
And this was 100% Adam's stance,

294
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,094
and mine to be perfectly honest.

295
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:53,795
But.

296
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,548
These are the new overlaying character models.

297
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:59,629
Heather, who's always right,

298
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:01,589
proposed a new direction for the models.

299
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,110
It took a lot of time to put the new idea in,

300
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,471
but once they were in the game,

301
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:08,571
it was immediately obvious

302
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,372
that this was a much stronger pitch.

303
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:15,273
It solved a ton of design problems that we had,

304
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:18,194
and even with Adam's adamant anti-stance on this change,

305
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:19,654
he had to admit vast improvement.

306
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:21,015
Also a theme.

307
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,475
It's like, let's prove Adam wrong.

308
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:29,127
But yeah, these took forever to redo.

309
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:32,248
I mean, we had to put new clothing and eyeballs

310
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:35,608
and different colors, different outfits,

311
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,029
and you couldn't tell immediately,

312
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,289
like, hey, that dude's a mechanic.

313
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:39,409
He's got the thing on his head.

314
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,410
So it changed a lot of the rules and design discussions

315
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,731
that we had on the iconography on the UI,

316
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:47,811
which we've been designing for years.

317
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:50,812
So these were super, super important.

318
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,272
And it's, just Heather, it's like,

319
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,673
we're gonna fix something that's not broken.

320
00:15:56,414 --> 00:16:05,540
Okay. So those are some of the ways that we've used this to fix things in overland. Okay. So

321
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,025
I'm going to tell you a little bit about what happens when we just can't agree. Which happens,

322
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:19,890
I mean, all the time. Sometimes all the time. We're pretty flexible, so, I don't know, only a

323
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,051
hundred times a week instead of 200.

324
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:27,436
This is when we're backed up into something that is definitely turning into a contentious

325
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:33,437
decision. Our feelings are getting super hot. People are digging in because they think their

326
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:38,898
idea is best and the only way forward. And that's a really awful place to be.

327
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:46,079
So this is when we decide to circle back. And there are two ways that we do this. And these

328
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:50,840
are really, really important. And I'll get to the end less than a second. One, we postpone.

329
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,528
This means that we postpone the decision

330
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:55,269
until we have more information to circle back.

331
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:59,672
This means that it's not necessary to have this feature

332
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,413
in this design discussion right now

333
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,634
because we can continue development without it.

334
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:05,535
We don't have enough information

335
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:07,096
that we can come to a consensus.

336
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:10,118
So we can just postpone it and circle back.

337
00:17:10,418 --> 00:17:11,059
Just make a little note.

338
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:13,540
We'll revisit this in like, I don't know,

339
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,842
two months when we have to again.

340
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:19,624
The other one is intermediate impossibles.

341
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:23,032
We use something called intermediate and possibles

342
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:25,374
when it is necessary to move on through a development

343
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:25,814
bottleneck.

344
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:27,295
And I'm going to go a little bit more into that

345
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:28,835
because it seems like kind of a crazy term.

346
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:31,317
So postpone.

347
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:34,158
I'm going to talk a little bit more about postpone.

348
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,100
Probably going to go over just what I just blurted out at you

349
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,341
because I went a little bit too fast.

350
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,902
This is only possible when the design decision is not

351
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:42,463
bottlenecking development.

352
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:45,765
And most importantly, it's only possible

353
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:49,167
if you have room and flexibility in your budget to postpone this.

354
00:17:51,184 --> 00:17:55,007
which is usually possible if it's not huge.

355
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:59,171
But what happens when you actually postpone the decision?

356
00:17:59,191 --> 00:17:59,972
You learn.

357
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,755
Your brain is always redesigning this game

358
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:03,495
as you're making it.

359
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,018
Because we're indies, we do iterative design,

360
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:07,879
nobody starts out with a design document,

361
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:08,820
like this is what I make,

362
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,201
and three years later that's what happens.

363
00:18:10,562 --> 00:18:11,463
Like that just doesn't happen.

364
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,464
So your brain's always learning more

365
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:15,106
about what you're actually creating as you go.

366
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,507
So each passing day you're getting more and more and more

367
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,650
context on how you could possibly solve that problem

368
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,812
without the contention.

369
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:26,699
So the other one is intermediate impossibles.

370
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:30,760
So this is what if you can't postpone the decision.

371
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,883
What if that problem is blocking development and you can't come to a consensus?

372
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:36,045
And this is when you use an intermediate impossible.

373
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:42,431
This is when you seriously, you hack together whatever garbage solution is easiest to do

374
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:47,296
to make sure that you can go from point A to point B. And who cares what

375
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:48,457
that middle part looks like?

376
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:52,519
because you don't have enough information to fix it properly. But you must continue

377
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:56,920
development. Time is money. If you're arguing over some stupid bridge that you have to get

378
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,542
across, just build the damn bridge. In any way, because you can always rebuild it when you know

379
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:08,063
what you're building. Because you can ‑‑ get it? Are we there? Okay. And we do this all the

380
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:13,005
time. I'm going to show you some intermediate impossibles and how awful two years of

381
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:14,345
staring at them can possibly be.

382
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:20,233
Okay. So this is overland, basically one of the earliest

383
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:23,075
digital versions of overland. Make special note of those pink

384
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:35,041
monsters. So this is, I don't know, 2014ish maybe. Now, we

385
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:37,682
needed monsters, so we just hacked those suckers together in

386
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:39,343
like, I don't know, five seconds.

387
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:43,767
We eventually got this thing on to a 3D board and we still

388
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:46,030
didn't know what kind of monsters we were going to have.

389
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,993
They didn't have really mechanics, we just knew they

390
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:48,914
appeared from the outside.

391
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:51,057
So we just brought those ugly things over.

392
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:58,167
This method obviously is going to require a lot of circling back.

393
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:00,989
Eventually these things are going to have to get out of this game.

394
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:03,071
So this is our first 3D space.

395
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:07,934
Here's our next 3D space and we're seriously now 18 months into development.

396
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,217
And this is before GDC of 2005.

397
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:18,165
15? We put these monsters in a hot minute

398
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:19,786
before we actually put it in the Mild Rumpus.

399
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:25,209
And this design was in form for an entire year of development.

400
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,411
But these were super weird placeholders as well.

401
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:31,933
This was our second intermediate impossible

402
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,394
for our monster designs in Overland.

403
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:36,475
But they did get much closer to the final monster design

404
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:38,937
once we knew more about what the game was actually

405
00:20:38,957 --> 00:20:39,877
going to look and feel like.

406
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:42,819
So this is what our monsters look like today.

407
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,788
Well, some of them, there's a couple on the field.

408
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:56,957
These have hopefully final models, animations, and colors, but it's entirely possible that

409
00:20:56,977 --> 00:21:01,160
in like three months, Heather may come back and be like, we might need to fix this.

410
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,122
So these might actually be intermediate and possible.

411
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:09,267
I don't think so, but we always leave that open that something small may change as we

412
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:10,788
learn more about Overland as we design it.

413
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:15,810
So within our development on Overland,

414
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,991
we still have postponed elements that aren't bottlenecks,

415
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:19,813
yet, we have a lot of things

416
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,214
that we've just straight up postponed

417
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:22,655
until we know more about the project.

418
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:24,756
But when they are bottlenecks,

419
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:27,138
we will hack together some sort of solution

420
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:29,000
until we can fully flesh out the context

421
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,281
of the right solution.

422
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:34,824
For example, we all have different ideas

423
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:38,447
about Overland's ending and zero consensus on it.

424
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:40,889
There's no obvious right answer right now,

425
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,610
given what we know about the game.

426
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:47,547
But yeah, even at this point in development, which we've, I mean, we're like three years

427
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:51,528
into Overland, the ending for the game is not fully fleshed out at all.

428
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:54,049
So yeah, it'll be a surprise to you too.

429
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,912
Now, but Becca, what if nothing worked?

430
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:04,553
What if we tried to identify the problem, we tried to develop a solution, and we presented

431
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,895
the solution to the team, but we can't decide what to do, what do you do?

432
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:12,316
You need to, sorry, oops.

433
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:14,230
You need to lean on your leads.

434
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:18,713
This means that you need to learn how to trust your leads

435
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,114
to make calls so long as you are within budget.

436
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,636
You have an art director for a reason.

437
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:27,058
You have a producer and biz dev member for a reason.

438
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,100
These are your experts.

439
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,621
Lean on them, learn to trust their judgment.

440
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:37,405
You also need to trust your team and not the hierarchy.

441
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:40,127
I don't really care how many games you've shipped.

442
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:42,752
When we're developing and designing something,

443
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:43,773
like that doesn't matter.

444
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:45,513
I don't care about your ego.

445
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:47,354
I don't care how long you've been in the industry.

446
00:22:47,394 --> 00:22:49,995
What I care about is that you have the same shared goal

447
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:51,636
and are you moving to the same place.

448
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,657
Now, Finji does this all the time.

449
00:22:57,198 --> 00:22:58,478
Some of her most recent examples,

450
00:22:58,658 --> 00:23:00,899
Jocelyn, our audio director,

451
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,180
wants a more rhythmic soundscape.

452
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,901
And this is 100% her call to make.

453
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:06,762
Heather, our art director,

454
00:23:06,822 --> 00:23:08,402
wanted to redo all the color palettes.

455
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,020
Totally her call to make.

456
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,300
We had a lot of disagreement about whether or not

457
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,481
Overland should allow diagonal movements on the board.

458
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:20,061
Heather suggested it and Adam trusted her design judgment.

459
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,242
Again, because Heather's always right.

460
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,862
And it was easy to test and she was right.

461
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:29,523
And that's trusting the team

462
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:31,443
and not who's the lead designer.

463
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,184
If somebody has a good idea,

464
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,744
it doesn't matter where that idea comes from.

465
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:38,985
Okay.

466
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:39,065
Now...

467
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,962
It's important though, like trust but verify.

468
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,424
That your leads are actually right.

469
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:47,805
This means that once your lead implements their solution,

470
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,667
discuss the strengths and the weaknesses as a group

471
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:52,989
in the same way, the same mutual respect way

472
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:55,991
that you've developed your team in the first place.

473
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:58,752
For example, we implemented Heather survivors

474
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:01,394
even though they seemed way too cute for Overland

475
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:03,215
when we were initially discussing them.

476
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:06,197
And we removed the campfire animation

477
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:07,218
because it just didn't work.

478
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:08,899
And we spent a lot of time making it

479
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:09,560
and then threw it away.

480
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:19,573
Okay, so finally, indies often work in a vacuum, obviously.

481
00:24:21,536 --> 00:24:23,218
We forgot to or feel like we shouldn't

482
00:24:23,258 --> 00:24:24,540
seek outside's perspective,

483
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,865
and this can lead to poorly constructed ideas

484
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:30,208
on what the industry actually looks like.

485
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:34,749
This can also lead to poorly constructed ideas

486
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:37,131
on the financial viability of our projects.

487
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:40,134
Also, it can lead to toxic partnerships

488
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:41,535
with creative collaborators.

489
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,617
This can also lead to quick burnout

490
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:44,858
with project abandonment.

491
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:48,020
So, why do you need mentors?

492
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:51,523
You need them to play your prototypes.

493
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:54,025
You need them to look over your business plans

494
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:55,466
and you need them to provide feedback

495
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:56,647
on your studio practices.

496
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,482
So prototype viability, we worked on a game called Portico,

497
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,204
which we did a failure workshop on a couple years ago,

498
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,387
for over nine months, and it was fundamentally broken.

499
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:09,069
We misread the industry, we wasted a bunch of money,

500
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,272
and if we had taken this to our mentors earlier,

501
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:13,713
we could have probably saved ourselves

502
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:14,594
months of development.

503
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:18,237
For Portico specifically, we had no strong reactions

504
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,680
to the gameplay, like when we did take it to our mentors,

505
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,141
there's a general sense of like, ehh.

506
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:26,124
This isn't that fun.

507
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:28,945
And to be perfectly honest, we didn't listen right away.

508
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,865
We just kept going on it.

509
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:32,286
So ask yourself these questions.

510
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:33,886
How long have you spent on a game

511
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:35,447
that others told you just wasn't working?

512
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:37,847
How long did you work on something

513
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:39,268
that you knew wasn't working,

514
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,988
but refused to vet with someone outside yourself

515
00:25:41,068 --> 00:25:41,528
or your team?

516
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:45,049
How much time did you waste avoiding the inevitable?

517
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:49,310
You need a mentor or 10 to help you vet your work

518
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,610
before you waste months of resources.

519
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:57,201
For business plans, Overland needed a ton of alpha players

520
00:25:57,741 --> 00:26:00,023
and we needed to vet the alpha and early access programs.

521
00:26:00,463 --> 00:26:02,064
So we actually leaned on our mentors

522
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:04,526
and did a ton of research of our mentors,

523
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:06,307
some of whom are actually in this room right now.

524
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:09,650
We needed to create a way to build a sustainable growth

525
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,991
for our tiny team and get real players

526
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:12,992
providing valuable feedback on our strategy game.

527
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:16,415
And we interviewed and researched other devs

528
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:20,178
who had run alpha programs of varying success in our genre.

529
00:26:21,262 --> 00:26:25,251
to find threads and best practices in the current market.

530
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,650
And then, studio practice.

531
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,171
Mentors can help guide and fix the ways

532
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:32,672
your team or studio functions.

533
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:35,053
They can help alleviate partnerships

534
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,154
that could have gone toxic.

535
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:38,716
This is just basically called peer mediation,

536
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:40,417
before things go too far.

537
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:42,879
Mentors can also provide an outside perspective

538
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:45,220
for team members to keep development teams clean.

539
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,442
With workflow struggles, miscommunications,

540
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,023
design decisions, honest assessment

541
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:50,944
of whether you are reasonable.

542
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:56,547
which also is very important, and not in the way that you're, or if you're being unreasonable

543
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,148
with the way you're interacting with your development team.

544
00:26:58,168 --> 00:27:00,970
So I'm going to tell you a quick story actually.

545
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,133
So we provided a mentorship to the obviously the Night in the Woods team over the last

546
00:27:06,153 --> 00:27:06,693
like three years.

547
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:10,736
And they're distributed on multiple time zones across the United States.

548
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:12,937
And they're basically operating solo.

549
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:15,719
So they had like legit workflow problems.

550
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,441
The thing that they were doing just had Adam and I

551
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:20,463
completely speechless about 18 months ago.

552
00:27:21,203 --> 00:27:23,585
And there was absolutely no way that that workflow problem

553
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,066
was going to allow them to finish the game.

554
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,949
And if they hadn't brought that problem to us,

555
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:32,112
like there is no way that Night in the Woods

556
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:33,173
would have come out last week,

557
00:27:33,993 --> 00:27:35,554
and probably would never have come out

558
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,755
if that hadn't been fixed.

559
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,492
So yeah, and we also, specifically with the Knight

560
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:44,653
in the Woods team, have advised on all sorts of quality

561
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:46,394
of life issues over the last three years,

562
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:49,915
because we don't have, we have skin in the game,

563
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:51,196
but not that kind of skin in the game.

564
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,696
So yeah, in conclusion, these are the practices we rely on

565
00:27:57,736 --> 00:28:00,638
to avoid toxic conflict and engage in good conflict

566
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,180
and productive arguments about the best things

567
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
to do in our project.

568
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:05,882
The upsides, in our experience,

569
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:07,763
this is the way of following through on the promise

570
00:28:07,843 --> 00:28:09,084
we make to our collaborators.

571
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:11,446
We're part of a team.

572
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:14,889
And it's a way of taking advantage

573
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:16,610
of all the intelligent folks on your staff.

574
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:20,173
The downsides, it can be super time consuming

575
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:20,733
in the short term.

576
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:23,792
You have to think about your design meetings

577
00:28:23,812 --> 00:28:25,594
with more rigor and more thoughtful.

578
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,796
It's also a hard system to force onto people.

579
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:30,618
You really have to lead by example.

580
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:32,780
It also means it can take months

581
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,201
in order to get this machine up and running.

582
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:40,006
For us in the medium term, it works.

583
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,168
And if we find a better way to do this,

584
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:43,849
we will absolutely switch over.

585
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,373
All of this talk was built using this exact design process.

586
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:52,512
This has helped us produce better collaborative decisions.

587
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:54,693
And we can't not work this way at this point.

588
00:28:57,114 --> 00:28:58,275
So, thank you very much.

589
00:28:58,955 --> 00:28:59,095
Um.

590
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:08,638
So, I knew this talk was going to be sort of long,

591
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:09,979
so I don't actually know how much time,

592
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,059
we don't have any time for questions,

593
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:12,780
but I do have a wrap up room,

594
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,941
which I will be at for the next 45 minutes.

595
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:17,702
We will go to 2018 if there's room.

596
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:24,554
2022 if there's not. If you have any questions feel free to follow me. I'm also bringing Adam

597
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:27,520
with me. We'll both be there to take questions.
