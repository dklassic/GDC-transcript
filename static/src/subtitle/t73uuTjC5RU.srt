1
00:00:05,978 --> 00:00:09,540
All right, thanks for coming to my GDC talk.

2
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:11,402
Let's get started.

3
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:14,424
My name is Gabby DiRienzo.

4
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:17,125
I'm a Toronto-based independent game developer

5
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:19,707
who's been working as a game artist and art director

6
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:21,909
in the industry for about eight years.

7
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:25,331
Here are some of the projects I'm known for.

8
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:26,652
I think it's this side.

9
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:34,193
I very recently started working with Drinkbox Studios, who are the creators of Guacamelee! and Severed.

10
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:39,978
And whenever I start working with a new team, I like to take a moment to reflect on my past work

11
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:43,761
and think about my strengths as an artist, as well as some skills that I can improve on.

12
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:49,726
So lately I've been thinking a lot about my recent experience with Creative Block, and that's what I want to talk about today.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,561
So let's go back to a couple of years, 2017, which was a very eventful year for me.

14
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:01,042
Early in 2017, I worked as an art director on a game called Graceful Explosion Machine,

15
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:06,003
which was a very colorful shoot-em-up and was also one of the first games

16
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,743
that launched on the Nintendo Switch.

17
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:11,004
So needless to say, it did extremely well.

18
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:15,005
We were very happy with that launch, and the creator of Graceful Explosion

19
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:19,146
Machine, Mobin Fikri, asked me to art direct his next project, which we would

20
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:20,646
start working on later that year.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,365
Later in 2017, I also released a game with my own studio called Laundry Bear Games,

22
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:31,530
called Immortician's Tale, which was a very emotional, story-driven game where you play

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,576
as a mortician running a funeral home. Immortician's Tale launched to massive critical praise. It was

24
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:41,480
nominated for a bunch of awards and stuff, and we were so happy with that launch that we decided

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,942
to start prototyping a new game.

26
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:48,159
So around the end of 2017, while we were in the middle of launching Amortition's Tale,

27
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,625
I started working as an art director on what would eventually become Super Crush KO, as

28
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,888
well as art directing Laundry Bear's next project.

29
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,015
I was juggling a lot of creative and art direction projects at the same time, and you can probably

30
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:01,196
see where this is going.

31
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:08,834
Around the end of that year, in the beginning of 2018, I started feeling really exhausted all the time.

32
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:15,037
I felt really foggy, I had a hard time focusing on things, I was struggling to work a full 8-hour day.

33
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:18,018
I also started feeling really unmotivated.

34
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:20,599
Even though I was really excited about the projects I was working on,

35
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,581
it felt like a struggle for me to actually sit down and do the work.

36
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,463
And when I did do the work on them, I wasn't happy with the work I was producing.

37
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:31,785
I felt frustrated with myself, and I felt like I was making a lot of bad decisions.

38
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:36,922
And on top of that, and this is something that I'm particularly embarrassed about,

39
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:40,927
I was also becoming a very argumentative person with my teammates.

40
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:43,670
They would give me feedback or would share ideas with me,

41
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,592
and I would get really defensive about my own art.

42
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,878
I was miserable, and I imagine I wasn't a very pleasant person to work with at the time.

43
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:54,118
All these feelings started bleeding into my personal life as well.

44
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:59,563
I'm a pretty creative person and I enjoy making things outside of my work, but suddenly I

45
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:02,725
started feeling less motivated to work on even personal creative projects.

46
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:06,889
Normally after work I would come home and would spend my evenings with hobbies like

47
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:13,835
drawing for fun or baking or gardening or whatever, but suddenly I didn't feel motivated

48
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:15,797
to do even those things anymore.

49
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:22,680
I spent a lot of my free time at home watching Netflix or scrolling aimlessly through social media

50
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:27,042
and as a creative person not doing creative things made me feel worse.

51
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:31,684
And after several months of dealing with all these awful feelings both at work and at home

52
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:36,206
my partner suggested that I might be burnt out and maybe dealing with creative block.

53
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:40,408
So what is creative block and where does it come from?

54
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:45,147
Well, a creative block is described as the inability to access your internal creativity,

55
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:51,530
which can result in the inability to create, the lack of motivation to create, and overall just

56
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,491
mental and emotional fatigue. It primarily affects people who are in creative positions,

57
00:03:56,531 --> 00:04:01,253
so in our industry it would be artists, writers, musicians and sound designers,

58
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:05,475
game designers, etc. And there's a lot of reasons why this might happen to a person.

59
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,153
Sorry, I'm trying to lean away from the mic so you don't get that good, good, good T-ASMR.

60
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:23,218
Okay, one theory as to why creative block happens is because our ability to discern

61
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:26,660
something good has surpassed our ability to make something good.

62
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:31,143
This is a handy chart that I've seen pop up on the internet over the last year, few years.

63
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:37,431
And while this is mostly used to talk about art block, I think it also applies to other creative positions as well.

64
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:41,636
This chart shows a creator's progression in skill over their lifetime,

65
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:44,880
with the red line representing the creator's ability to make something good,

66
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,725
and the blue line representing the creator's ability to discern something that is good.

67
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:54,850
When our ability to make something good surpasses our ability to discern something good, this

68
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,131
is called a creative high.

69
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:00,073
When our ability to discern something good surpasses our ability to make something good,

70
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,134
this is called a creative low or creative block.

71
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:06,376
And this is absolutely a thing I've dealt with over my career, in my personal life and

72
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:10,578
in my professional life, and I admit it feels pretty lousy when it happens.

73
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:14,788
But another reason why creative block happens is because of external pressure,

74
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,951
feeling like everyone is watching you and that you're letting people down if you aren't productive or good enough.

75
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:24,595
And in this day and age of indie games especially, with so many games being released constantly,

76
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:29,538
it's important that your game stands out, that it is beautiful and unique,

77
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,920
and runs well on every platform it needs to run well on,

78
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:36,943
and that the whole game is simple enough to be made by a smaller team on top of that.

79
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:43,116
And if you're an indie developer watching this, you probably understand this pressure to be successful

80
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:47,198
because you and your team's personal finances and well-being depend on it.

81
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:52,741
And if you're not an indie developer, if you work in AAA or you're just an aspiring dev,

82
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:56,103
this pressure might sound silly, but it's absolutely real.

83
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,986
And it absolutely adds stress onto game artists, musicians, writers and designers especially.

84
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:06,550
You feel like you can't just make art, you have to make beautiful, one-of-a-kind while

85
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,471
also being efficiently made art.

86
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,233
That pressure can sometimes prevent you from making any art at all.

87
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:20,088
When I had first started art directing Graceful Explosion Machine and A Mortician's Tale years ago,

88
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,628
I didn't feel any pressure at all, really.

89
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,090
I was a relatively unknown game developer and artist,

90
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,690
and I didn't feel like there were any existing expectations of me.

91
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,551
However, I was still a person suffering from anxiety,

92
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:35,533
and I often dreamed about making successful games.

93
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:39,674
But once I finally achieved that success, my anxiety didn't go away.

94
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:42,607
In fact, that success only made it worse.

95
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:47,470
Both Graceful Explosion Machine and Mortician's Tale were successful, and I suddenly felt

96
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,152
pressure to replicate this success, not just for one game, but for two new games.

97
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:56,455
To be perfectly clear, my colleagues weren't the ones putting this pressure onto me.

98
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:57,796
I was doing it to myself.

99
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:02,939
And in hindsight, this wasn't very fair of me to do so, because ultimately, success is

100
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,160
not a cure for mental illness.

101
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:09,533
I think as much as we've grown as a society and we're a lot more open and understanding

102
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:12,996
of things like depression and anxiety, we still have a tendency to take them a lot less

103
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,677
seriously than other types of illnesses.

104
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:24,562
But at the time of my burnout, I remember feeling really angry with myself for still being anxious and depressed and creatively blocked despite having some success.

105
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:34,990
But taking the time to take a step back and acknowledge my creative block and point to this external pressure I was feeling as the cause of it, helped me start to find solutions as to how to overcome it.

106
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:40,571
When we started working on Super Crush K.O., I was given the opportunity by Mo to not only

107
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:44,473
do art direction, but to also take some creative direction over the game as well, with things

108
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,434
like story and themes and narrative.

109
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:50,776
Because I was dealing with this creative block largely caused by this external pressure I

110
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:53,697
just described, I started making some really silly decisions.

111
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:56,999
The art wasn't bad, necessarily, but it was boring.

112
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,040
It's something that we had seen several times before.

113
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:04,779
story was safe and uninteresting and the character designs were uninspired.

114
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:07,845
And when I showed this to my teammates and other colleagues in the industry,

115
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:12,572
their reactions were all very lukewarm, which is not really the reaction you want

116
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,616
when you're trying to make something cool and unique.

117
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:20,304
I remember feeling really frustrated with myself for not immediately having a brilliant

118
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:24,527
idea for the art and story for this new game, and in hindsight, I wasn't being very fair

119
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:25,027
to myself.

120
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:29,030
When you start out with doing pre-production, concepting and developing art for a game,

121
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,054
you don't, or at least very rarely, you don't immediately come up with the finalized look

122
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:35,495
to your game.

123
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,796
This process takes time and iteration.

124
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:41,777
More likely, when you start concepting a game, you start out with this kind of stuff.

125
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:46,639
Moot boards, images that inspire you, rough sketches and ideas, color swatches and palettes.

126
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:47,980
You start with the basics.

127
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,581
And because I was so stressed about getting it right the first time,

128
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:55,323
I forgot completely how much fun concepting can be.

129
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:58,184
When I started working at Drinkbox Studios a few months ago,

130
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:02,346
I told our concept lead, Kusho Keihano, about my struggles with this.

131
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:06,148
and he said something to me that I will never forget which is

132
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,049
you can't get too precious about concept art.

133
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,051
The whole point of concept art, whether it's

134
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:16,174
the whole point of concepting in general, whether it's art writing or music,

135
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:19,636
is that you're coming up with as many ideas as possible and seeing what sticks.

136
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:24,812
and concepting is supposed to be a fun messy part of game development and it's supposed to be

137
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:29,118
enjoyable. It's the only time in the game development cycle really that you can just

138
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,264
set your limits aside and come up with as many ideas as you possibly can.

139
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:37,519
Sometimes you come up with bad ideas, but you also come up with good stuff too.

140
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:41,941
And while I was working on Super Crush, I was so stressed about coming up with

141
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:45,502
something unique and getting everything right the first time, that I

142
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:50,464
completely forgot about how much fun concept art is and how much fun it is to

143
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:54,945
just trust myself with my own art. When I was studying graphic design in

144
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:57,446
school, I had a professor who used to repeat this praise to me,

145
00:09:57,646 --> 00:10:00,427
which was, don't try to be different, just try to be good.

146
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,799
The idea behind this phrase is that by focusing firstly on being good,

147
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,402
following the basics of design and making decisions that you know work and

148
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,244
trusting your own instincts of what is good,

149
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:14,507
you will ultimately make something that is different. Good is different enough.

150
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,969
And if this doesn't make any sense to you,

151
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,411
I totally understand this as a bit of a weird concept and phrase.

152
00:10:19,612 --> 00:10:21,853
So here's an example that will hopefully help illustrate this better.

153
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:32,512
If you haven't heard it, if you haven't played this already, this is Hold Down, a mobile

154
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,754
game by Martin Johansson that came out a few years ago for iOS and Android.

155
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:41,117
And while the artwork isn't necessarily anything new, we've seen lots of minimal, flat-shaded

156
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:45,239
2D games before, what makes Hold Down so special is how well it's executed.

157
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:50,679
Its animations are bouncy and it uses particles, screen shake, visual effects, and feedback

158
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:52,180
to make the game feel really satisfying.

159
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,981
And it has this weird little worm thing that doesn't really do anything, but it acts as

160
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,842
a super cute and super recognizable mascot for the game.

161
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,763
Martin took great care in designing Hold Down to feel good, first and foremost, and that

162
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:08,564
allowed it to be different and to stand out, and for it to become as popular and successful

163
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,144
as it has been.

164
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:13,173
When I think back to when I started to do concept artwork for Super Crush KO,

165
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:18,125
I was focusing so hard on being different that I totally forgot about being good first.

166
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:23,955
So around the beginning of 2018, Mo saw that I was experiencing this creative block and

167
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,216
told me to take a month off just to figure it out.

168
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:31,578
And having this time allowed me to take a step back from my frustrations, refocus, and

169
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:33,958
ultimately start to make good decisions for the art of the game.

170
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:38,260
This month away from my usual work was really important, and I'm grateful that I had the

171
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,000
opportunity to have that much-needed break.

172
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,201
And this is where my biggest piece of advice comes in.

173
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,883
If you're experiencing art block, do not isolate yourself from others.

174
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:48,944
You do not have to suffer this alone.

175
00:11:49,464 --> 00:11:53,005
If you're working with a team or have colleagues, tell them about your struggles with creative

176
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:56,145
block or burnout and encourage them to do the same with you.

177
00:11:56,785 --> 00:12:00,266
Sometimes people can give you an outside opinion or advice you may not have considered if you

178
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,226
were just working alone.

179
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:05,527
And having a group of colleagues you can trust allows you to inspire, uplift, and support

180
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:08,048
each other during creative block or other frustrating times like this.

181
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:14,253
I'm very fortunate to live in a city that has a big indie games community and I have a lot of friends and colleagues in the industry I can turn to,

182
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:21,819
but I realize this might not be the case for everybody, especially if you live somewhere that doesn't have a community or maybe you're new to the industry or whatever.

183
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,943
And if this is the case for you, I recommend trying to look online.

184
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:33,530
Forums, Discord, social media can be a great place to make friends and learn from other game developers and find your community.

185
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:38,055
Having people to turn to when you're experiencing creative block, including online friends,

186
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:43,160
can be beneficial for yourself and for them too. The internet, of course, can be a great resource

187
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,565
for tutorials and to find inspiration, which leads me to my next piece of advice for overcoming art

188
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:50,328
block, which is surround yourself with inspiration.

189
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:55,015
If you're feeling uninspired and frustrated with the things that you're making, try surrounding

190
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:58,700
yourself with other art, music, or writing that you like, that motivates you and that

191
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,462
makes you feel good.

192
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:03,307
And if you're looking to come up with something unique for your game, try your best to look

193
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,711
outside of what people are already doing in video games.

194
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,561
When I took my break from Super Crush K.O., I started a new morning habit where every

195
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:22,344
day or before I started my work for the day, I would drink a cup of tea and spend 10 minutes

196
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,784
scrolling through various art and design websites.

197
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:29,189
Not only was this a great way for me to encourage myself to feel motivated before starting my day,

198
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,412
but it was also being inspired by things outside of video games.

199
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:37,558
Things like architecture and film, fashion, photography, makeup, drag, graphic design,

200
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:42,983
industrial design, tv shows, anime, music, toys, and nature, just to name a few.

201
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:48,642
In May of 2018, our team started working out of a physical office in Toronto, and for the

202
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:52,503
first time since I started making indie games, I had access to permanent wall space that

203
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:53,743
I could use for putting up artboards.

204
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:59,265
I printed out inspiration for Super Crush KO, as well as some early sketches and concepts,

205
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:03,146
and this became a great way to surround myself with the art that was inspiring me, as well

206
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:04,366
as my own art that I was making.

207
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:07,627
Having physical reminders in front of you for both these things is wonderful.

208
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:13,768
really motivating, and also allows you to receive feedback and ideas from office mates

209
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:16,809
which happened quite frequently and was also very helpful.

210
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,810
So after my month-long break where I spent time surrounding myself with inspiration and

211
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,311
letting myself have fun with the concept art, I came back to the Super Crush KO team with

212
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:27,891
this mock-up.

213
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:32,072
And the reaction was a complete 180 from the reactions I was getting the first time when

214
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:33,633
I showed them my old bad art.

215
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:37,815
People were excited and talked about it happily, their faces lit up.

216
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:42,598
This was the exact reaction I wanted, and it was so validating and motivating.

217
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:46,801
This single mock-up was able to inform the art for the rest of the game,

218
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:49,002
which we continued to iterate on and make better,

219
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:54,085
as well as other decisions for the rest of the game when it came to narrative, music, and even gameplay.

220
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,747
This also allowed me to feel a lot more confident with my decisions

221
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:02,030
and helped direct the other artists working with me on the team when it came to animation and cutscene art.

222
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:07,077
We as a team were able to make the game a lot more cohesive once we had this art direction,

223
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:11,818
and this is ultimately where the title of Super Crush KO came from. Crushing your robot enemies,

224
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:15,798
and maybe also developing a bit of a crush on the antagonist while you're at it.

225
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,620
So, in short, I was able to overcome this massive year-long creative block by

226
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,060
acknowledging my burnout and understanding the external pressure causing it,

227
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:30,441
taking a little break from the work that was frustrating me, and finding the fun in concept art again.

228
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,135
leaning on my team for support,

229
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,678
focusing on making something good first

230
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:36,699
before making something different.

231
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,427
and surrounding myself with non-game inspiration daily.

232
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:43,928
I'm also glad to say that by overcoming my creative block on Super Crush,

233
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:47,130
I was able to overcome my creative block on the other project I was working with

234
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,111
with Laundry Bearer. It also provided me with a

235
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:53,473
list of tangible exercises I can do if I ever find myself going through

236
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,855
creative block again, whether it's with Drinkbox or on a personal project,

237
00:15:57,035 --> 00:16:01,657
whatever. So now here is a short list of exercises I did that work for

238
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,178
me and will hopefully work for you if you ever find yourself experiencing

239
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:04,638
creative block.

240
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,840
Number one is revisit your basics.

241
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,182
If you've been making art or music or writing

242
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:16,623
or been designing games for a while,

243
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,725
chances are you feel pretty confident

244
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:19,565
with your fundamentals.

245
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,446
However, if I'm feeling stuck,

246
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:23,848
I find revisiting these basics to be very helpful.

247
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:26,149
For art, it could be things like color theory,

248
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,410
anatomy, lighting.

249
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,911
Even if you're already quite familiar with these things,

250
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:31,432
sometimes finding a tutorial

251
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:32,673
and revisiting your fundamentals

252
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:34,734
can open up new doors you may have forgotten about

253
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:35,795
or never considered before.

254
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:38,745
Number two is try a new thing.

255
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:40,507
If you're feeling stuck with your current work,

256
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:42,268
try playing with a new medium.

257
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:44,690
For art, if you're primarily working digitally,

258
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,572
try sketching things out with pen or marker.

259
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,395
If you're a writer who primarily uses one digital tool,

260
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:53,378
try switching to a different tool or using pen and paper.

261
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:55,920
If you're a musician who largely works with synths,

262
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,822
try picking up an acoustic instrument.

263
00:16:58,122 --> 00:16:59,143
Acoustic? Acoustic?

264
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:01,365
Or vice versa.

265
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,247
This also goes for subject matter.

266
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,018
Sometimes by creating something in a genre or movie you don't normally work with can

267
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:10,258
be creatively stimulating.

268
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,862
If you're an artist who mostly draws figures and people, try drawing environments instead.

269
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:20,024
If you're a game designer who largely designs action or fighting games, try your hand at

270
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:22,246
paper prototyping a puzzle game or visual novel.

271
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:26,928
If you're a musician who largely writes happy, whimsical songs, try writing something darker

272
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:27,689
and more serious.

273
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:46,915
If you are creative professionally and you find your hobbies fall into the same category as what you do for a living, try a different hobby that's completely unrelated, like drawing or picking up a new sport or baking or writing or knitting or gardening or reading or carpentry or playing a musical instrument, whatever.

274
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:55,201
By taking the time to try new things, whether it's a medium, subject matter, or hobby, you're allowing yourself to be creative in new ways you've never experienced before.

275
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:58,403
And sometimes this can inspire all new ideas and motivations for you.

276
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:07,418
My third tip is to do something creative for yourself every day.

277
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,402
This one might seem pretty obvious, but it's important to differentiate personal creative

278
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:14,124
projects from professional creative projects.

279
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:19,328
If I say draw every day, I don't mean draw every day so you can be productive or draw

280
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,170
every day so you can practice and eventually be better.

281
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,911
And Wally's are both important.

282
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:27,395
I recommend drawing every day or finding something creative to do every day purely for yourself.

283
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:31,956
not for something work-related, not for professional development, not to put on the internet.

284
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:37,518
Do something creative every day for you. You don't overthink it, you don't spend longer than 30 seconds,

285
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:43,180
that's all the time you have for it, but just take the time to make something for you.

286
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,881
And the reason why I recommend this is because if you're like a person, if you're a person like me

287
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:52,482
who makes art professionally, sometimes it's easy to forget that making art can also just be for fun

288
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:56,923
and personal enjoyment. So this daily drawing or creative exercise is entirely for you.

289
00:18:58,355 --> 00:19:00,957
And if you're the kind of person who likes to be productive constantly,

290
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:03,999
and the idea of not being productive is stressful for you,

291
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:08,042
then allow me to explain this exercise in a way that might resonate with you better.

292
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,764
Taking time off is productive.

293
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:14,386
I like this quote from one of my favorite artists, Heikala.

294
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:16,888
I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong, I'm sorry.

295
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:18,169
That says,

296
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,291
I try to keep a habit of sketching every day

297
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:23,733
because I believe your imagination is like a muscle that you need to exercise frequently.

298
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:28,657
and I absolutely agree with them. As much as drawing every day is for yourself, it's also

299
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:34,141
in a subconscious way for your work and your productivity as well. And this leads me to my

300
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:39,866
final tip for overcoming creative block or burnout, which is be kind to yourself. If you're feeling

301
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:44,329
frustrated and angry with yourself over experiencing creative block the way that I felt,

302
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,614
continuing to be angry is not going to help you. It's okay to take a break or take time off to do

303
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:53,296
something unrelated and be forgiving to yourself.

304
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:56,238
And I realize this probably sounds really wishy-washy,

305
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,419
especially in comparison to all the tangible advice

306
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,319
that I just listed,

307
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,321
but it's just as necessary and important to remember.

308
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,222
Being kind to yourself is a simple and small thing

309
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:06,903
you can do to yourself that ultimately makes

310
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:09,324
a big positive change for you and your mental health.

311
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:17,783
So Super Crush K.O. was released in January of this year and I'm really proud of it. I'm really

312
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:22,408
proud of this super colorful, super gay thing that we made that people seem to really like.

313
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:26,872
This is some cool fan art that someone made. It's really cool. I'm very excited about this

314
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,435
and I'm really proud of my team and

315
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:34,819
I'm really proud of myself too for overcoming this really rough creative block and to be

316
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,843
able to have a list of tools that I can share with you and other people who might be experiencing

317
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:45,067
creative block or who might know someone who is or may experience creative block in the

318
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:45,407
future.

319
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:51,515
So, in closing, if you're experiencing creative block, you are not a bad artist.

320
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:55,140
If you're experiencing creative block, you are not a bad game designer.

321
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:58,144
If you're experiencing creative block, you are not alone.

322
00:20:58,565 --> 00:21:00,608
If I can overcome it, so can you.

323
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,553
That was really cheesy.

324
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:05,878
But thank you for listening to my talk, regardless.

325
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:07,480
I hope it was helpful.

326
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,524
If you have any questions about Creative Block

327
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:12,487
