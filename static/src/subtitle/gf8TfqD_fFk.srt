00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:07,297
Hello, and welcome to Everyone Can Do PR.

2
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:11,240
Today I'm going to tell you five things you should get right

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,342
to talk to Brett Spetta and get more headlines,

4
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:15,523
and five things you should avoid.

5
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:17,724
Before I can tell you how you should do PR,

6
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:18,885
I have to tell you two other things.

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,167
One is please turn your cell phone off,

8
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:22,888
and the other thing is please don't forget

9
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:24,409
to evaluate the session by the end.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,912
So I think it's safe to assume that most of the people

11
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:30,514
here in the room either have launched a game already

12
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:31,915
or are about to launch a game.

13
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:35,047
And whenever I have launched a game, it felt a bit like that.

14
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:37,770
Your game is just like one of those little stars

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,071
in the big gaming cosmos.

16
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:41,793
And it's just so hard to get attention from anybody,

17
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:45,636
be it press, be it streamers, be it YouTubers, be it players.

18
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:48,298
And that's not only a feeling I have.

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:49,319
That's actually the truth.

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,802
If you just look at some numbers, in 2015 alone,

21
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:55,063
there were over 3,000 games released on Steam.

22
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:56,892
That makes eight games a day.

23
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,514
And if we go a bit more crazy and we look into mobile,

24
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:01,894
and it doesn't even count Google Play.

25
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:02,915
We're just talking iOS.

26
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:06,436
Last year, there were over 160,000 games submitted.

27
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:09,338
That makes 450 games a day.

28
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:11,619
So that is your competition if you release a game.

29
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:14,220
Of course, some of those games are weird rip-offs.

30
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,561
Some of them are not a competitor of you.

31
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:20,342
But the point is, there's a lot of other games out there,

32
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:22,043
and they also want attention from people.

33
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:23,964
The good thing is.

34
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:28,232
I think there are two solutions how you can still succeed.

35
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:30,434
And they're both quite easy, at least technically.

36
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:35,299
Number one is how to make it.

37
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,861
But number one, you're one of those people.

38
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:40,304
Easy, right?

39
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:42,686
You're just so ridiculously good in what you do.

40
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:44,868
You're just a Mozart of your generation.

41
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:45,849
You just move people.

42
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,192
Whatever you did is just so good that you don't really need PR.

43
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:51,013
If you're that good.

44
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,142
You cannot talk about your game at all, and somebody will

45
00:01:54,162 --> 00:01:55,283
discover it, and it will go big.

46
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:58,704
Or you can talk way too much about your game, but still be

47
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,244
successful.

48
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:04,987
But the second path, and that is what 90% of other

49
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:07,508
developers will encounter, 99%, I would say.

50
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:10,750
The solution to still be successful is you make a

51
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,171
really good game, and then you also make good PR, and then

52
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:18,548
get the word out there. Because just making a good game is just not enough anymore.

53
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:22,291
Those days are gone. I remember when I was little and I went into GameStop,

54
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:26,475
there were every week there were two or three new games. That is the past.

55
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:30,639
So today, we're going to look at five things you should get right,

56
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,882
five things you shouldn't get right, five things you shouldn't do, and five future

57
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:38,806
trends. And because one part of PR is also to set expectations

58
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:39,046
right.

59
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,590
We're going to talk a lot about the five things you need to get right.

60
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,031
So there will be like 80 to 90 percent of the presentation,

61
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:47,711
and then very shortly the other two topics.

62
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:51,572
Some words about me before we start.

63
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:53,233
My name is Thomas Reisenhecker.

64
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:55,993
I'm from Austria. Currently I live in the UK in Brighton,

65
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:59,734
and I work for Ico Partners, and we are a consulting and PR agency.

66
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:04,516
I work on the PR side, and we cover a wide variety of games.

67
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,817
There might be some really big games,

68
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:09,017
we worked for a long time with League of Legends and with SMITE.

69
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:13,954
but also a lot of smaller games like Too Dark, A Mellow Dungeon of the Endless, or fragments of him.

70
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:20,338
Before I went into PR, I was a freelance video game journalist, so I also know the other side of the game.

71
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:26,041
And my way from being press to being a PR person was actually just helping my friends out

72
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:28,703
for the indie game, which turned out quite successful.

73
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:34,906
So I also know how it is to work with very little knowledge in that sense, and also very little resources.

74
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,908
What I won't cover in this talk is the basics of PR.

75
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,209
They are also really important, but today we're

76
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,131
going to talk about the five things you should focus on.

77
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,832
There are also a lot of other basics,

78
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,434
like how your website should look like, what is a press kit,

79
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:50,655
what is a basic social media setup,

80
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:52,596
how to write a press release properly,

81
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:53,837
how to build a mailing list.

82
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:55,478
If you're interested in those topics,

83
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,260
you can find a presentation on that on my Twitter

84
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,342
and also on the GDC World Forum last year's GDC Europe.

85
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:05,487
So let's get right into it.

86
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,928
What are the five things you need to get right?

87
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:09,790
Number one is positioning.

88
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,591
And that sounds really easy.

89
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,793
And I bet most people think they have figured it out.

90
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:16,114
But I think also most people are wrong.

91
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:19,437
Positioning your game right is extremely, really hard.

92
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,458
But if you do it, that really pays off.

93
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,161
Because otherwise, you will have a lot of PR efforts that

94
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,723
just go nowhere, really, because you don't have a goal.

95
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:28,903
You don't know what to focus on.

96
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:31,986
So what you want to do is figure out one key message

97
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:33,266
and one key artwork.

98
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,788
That represents a game.

99
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:36,468
That is the basic idea behind the game.

100
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:37,809
Whenever you say the name of the game,

101
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:39,309
the people should see in their head.

102
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,691
So what I like to do is a test to figure out

103
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:44,731
if I've got the positioning for a game right.

104
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:47,613
Is just think about you're going to a dinner with your mom

105
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:48,353
or with your friends.

106
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,674
And you're really not interested in the video games.

107
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:54,075
And then they're asking you, so what game are you working on?

108
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:56,976
And then you have a really short attention window

109
00:04:57,076 --> 00:04:59,717
of about three to 10 seconds to explain what that game is about.

110
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:03,420
And if you say, oh, it's root-like, a random generator

111
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,323
with cool chip tune, and mom would start playing on the phone

112
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:06,884
and that's it.

113
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:08,385
You've lost her attention.

114
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:12,289
But if you say, Goat Simulator, you'll be like, Goat Simulator?

115
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,030
What's that?

116
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:16,393
Or if you say, you're making a space game with ships

117
00:05:16,414 --> 00:05:18,596
that are as big as the Titanic, they'll probably be like, OK,

118
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:19,437
that sounds interesting.

119
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:20,398
They can picture something.

120
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:21,018
They can connect.

121
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:22,880
And that is the basic thing.

122
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:26,618
You're not selling a game, you're always selling a story.

123
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,980
Be it to players, but also mostly to press.

124
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,762
Because similar to your friends that don't like video games,

125
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:33,324
they have a very short attention span,

126
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,526
because press just gets flooded with new games.

127
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,530
And also, a bit controversial statement,

128
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,351
but if you figure out your positioning,

129
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:44,534
I think it's totally fine to go back to the drawing board.

130
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:46,916
We had that happening quite sometimes.

131
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:50,392
that you think you figured out what a good positioning for a game is,

132
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:55,113
then you have a press release, and then actually you see what players respond to,

133
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:58,714
or what fans figure out and pick out what is actually interesting about the game.

134
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:02,294
You shouldn't change your positioning every 10 minutes or a week before launch,

135
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,375
but it doesn't hurt in the beginning to go back once or twice.

136
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:10,716
And now I've just three examples from games that are hard to position,

137
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:12,077
but they did it perfectly right.

138
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:13,717
One is this War of Mine.

139
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,745
And that game is an absolute PR nightmare.

140
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:18,605
Because from far it looks like that.

141
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,266
You cannot picture anything.

142
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:21,626
It looks a bit boring.

143
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:23,706
It doesn't have a real main character.

144
00:06:23,726 --> 00:06:29,167
The word war in the title already paints something

145
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:31,148
like Call of Duty and a lot of ego shooting.

146
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,848
It's already a bit weird.

147
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,189
And what they did to prevent all those things

148
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:37,989
from happening you had when you just read the title

149
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,149
or see the screenshot from you getting bored,

150
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:41,730
they're always using a sub-headline.

151
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:45,426
And that sub-headline is, in war, not everyone is a soldier.

152
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,287
And as soon as you see that, that immediately paints a

153
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:49,967
picture in your head.

154
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,367
You know that that game is probably not pro-war.

155
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:53,787
It's probably not really patriotic.

156
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:57,348
It doesn't have one strong protagonist, but a lot of

157
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:59,448
people, and those people are not soldiers.

158
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,389
So with that little line, which was probably really hard

159
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:04,869
to come up with, they were doing a lot of

160
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:05,750
positioning already.

161
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,230
A similar example, or a different example, is a game

162
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,110
called Axiom Verge.

163
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:16,951
And Axiom Verge's app, look at that title, like, that doesn't mean anything. Axiom Verge is a weird thing.

164
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:22,596
And also the key art, cannot picture a lot what the game is about.

165
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:27,160
But if you know the game, you know it's quite a bit like a modern version of Super Metroid.

166
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,642
And that's the whole thing it communicates really.

167
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,024
It has a really sci-fi title.

168
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:36,430
The thing that the visual style is also quite Super Metroid-y.

169
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:38,192
So they knew their target audience.

170
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,055
They wanted to have Super Metroid fans.

171
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:41,777
And that's exactly what they communicate.

172
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:42,478
So that's OnSpot.

173
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:46,543
And another game that was talked here about a lot is SuperHot.

174
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,421
And SuperHead, technically, is a bit complicated to explain,

175
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,822
but they just summed up their whole positioning

176
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,882
in a straightforward sentence, an FPS game where time moves

177
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,743
only when you move, and immediately you

178
00:07:58,783 --> 00:07:59,763
get what the game is about.

179
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:00,943
So that's very well done.

180
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:06,004
The second thing you need to get right is mastering new speeds.

181
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:09,705
What I mean by that, every game has a certain amount

182
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:12,226
of PR ammunition, and you have to really master

183
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:15,826
that, how you position them and how you sum them up or not.

184
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,650
Just imagine, every game has certain PR beats.

185
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,251
They're definitely going to happen.

186
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:22,613
You have the game announcement, you have the first screenshots,

187
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:25,715
you have the first trailer, a beta start, a release date,

188
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:26,135
a release.

189
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:27,716
That's a thing you can talk about with press.

190
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:30,798
But depending on how important you are, or how high your profile

191
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:32,839
is, or how cool your game looks, you

192
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,460
have to use those things very differently.

193
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,321
If you're Half-Life 3 and you're going to announce your game,

194
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:38,782
people are going to go insane.

195
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:39,783
There are a lot of articles.

196
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:40,343
It's everywhere.

197
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:42,404
First screenshots, people go crazy.

198
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:43,685
First trailer, people go crazy.

199
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:54,933
If you're a small indie dev making a jump and run that looks alrightish but not the best game ever, you announce it, no one will care. First screenshots, no one will care. First trailer, probably two people will care.

200
00:08:55,614 --> 00:09:05,198
But if you sum all those three things up, you have a pretty good announcement. You have a game announcement, brief screenshots and a trailer and quite some info, you have a much higher chance of getting covered.

201
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:10,000
But that of course also means you've already wasted the first three points on that list.

202
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:17,690
And that is really the art about knowing how much you have to use without wasting it to come through to press.

203
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:22,452
And how you can master that is either by hiring an expert or becoming an expert.

204
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:27,214
And by becoming an expert, I think the key is just you read loads of websites each day

205
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:31,415
and just figure out what they write about and what is big enough for them to cover and what is not.

206
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:37,498
But not also talking about which messages you give to press.

207
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:40,496
It's also important in which timing that happens.

208
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:41,736
And they can make quite a difference,

209
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:42,637
but it's not hard to do.

210
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:46,059
And at ICO, we looked at data from thousands of gaming

211
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,921
websites around the world and when they publish articles.

212
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:53,223
And as you can see, they have really high output in June

213
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:53,964
because of E3.

214
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,825
So that's probably a time you want to avoid if you're a

215
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,425
small indie dev.

216
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,807
Or you look at the Christmas period, where there's loads of

217
00:09:58,847 --> 00:09:59,607
articles coming up.

218
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:02,689
It would be more clever for you to go for a summer for a

219
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:03,690
big announcement or a launch.

220
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:05,895
The same goes for weekdays.

221
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,196
Unsurprisingly, press is not too happy

222
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:10,837
about working on weekends, which is why there are less articles

223
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:11,317
on weekends.

224
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:13,178
Also, Mondays start a bit slow.

225
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:15,359
Fridays start a bit early because the weekend starts.

226
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,300
So if you have the option, you want

227
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,081
to choose a day between Tuesday and Thursday.

228
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:22,242
Of course, that doesn't guarantee you get covered,

229
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:23,542
but it gives you better chances.

230
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:26,763
And also, on the day itself, it depends

231
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:28,204
what time you want to pick.

232
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:31,645
Always go for office hours, even for bigger games.

233
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,386
I can tell you, it makes a huge difference

234
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:34,527
if you're outside of office hours.

235
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,348
And keep the time zones in mind.

236
00:10:37,468 --> 00:10:40,310
What we usually do if you want to cover US and European press,

237
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,552
we go for that timing, which is 6 PST is 2 GMT.

238
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:46,153
So you get the US people in the morning

239
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:48,195
and the European people early in the afternoon

240
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:49,476
if you send out communications.

241
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,858
And also keep local bank holidays in mind.

242
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:54,159
May sound a bit silly.

243
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,880
Already happened quite a lot of times

244
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,722
that you just forget that it's a big bank holiday in the UK

245
00:10:58,802 --> 00:10:59,362
or in the US.

246
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:00,623
And then you miss out a lot of press

247
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:01,704
because you didn't wait a day and you

248
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:03,645
didn't spend the time of googling 10 seconds

249
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:04,966
if there's a bank holiday going on.

250
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:08,858
Those were things mostly aimed at press.

251
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:10,699
Just some words about YouTubers and streamers.

252
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,820
It would be an own talk, but we don't have time for that.

253
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,821
So just some really important points I think

254
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:15,781
are worth pointing out.

255
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:19,203
YouTubers and streamers, they are not

256
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,203
getting paid for headlines.

257
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:22,104
They are not interested in having cool stories.

258
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:24,485
They're interested in having games that look fun to play.

259
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:27,007
So when you write to them, I would always

260
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:28,147
advise you make it really short.

261
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:29,108
You have an email.

262
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:30,048
You have one sentence.

263
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,029
You have a really nice GIF where you get the gameplay.

264
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:33,650
And then you have a link to the trailer.

265
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,471
That's all they need, and that's most of the things

266
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:36,131
they would care about.

267
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:41,701
Many of the YouTubers and streamers that cover a lot of

268
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:45,623
different games, that doesn't not so much apply for mobiles,

269
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,805
but for really classic premium games, they will only cover

270
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:49,905
your game once and play it.

271
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:53,587
So you should think about if you want to get some hype

272
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,209
before launch, or if you'd rather wait till the game is

273
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:58,410
actually out so people can buy it as well when they see it.

274
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,752
Definitely try recording your own game before, if it works.

275
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:05,614
If you have a mobile game, sorry to tell you that

276
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:08,075
streamers and YouTubers is just not such a big deal.

277
00:12:09,118 --> 00:12:10,519
And definitely watch out for scam.

278
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:14,481
If you get an email from PewDiePie5000Spaceship2

279
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,542
at Outlook.com, it's probably not a legit email.

280
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,124
And an easy way to look if that email is real or not

281
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:24,486
is most YouTubers, if you go at their About section,

282
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:26,487
they have actually their business email address.

283
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,048
And if that email address that sends you the request

284
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,990
and the other one doesn't match, you can just ask them

285
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,690
and say, hey, can you write me from your official email

286
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,371
address to confirm you're real.

287
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:40,087
The third thing you need to get right, and that's the most

288
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,750
important thing, the most important garage is your

289
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,372
trailer. So if I would be a small indie dev and I have a

290
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,034
limited amount of money and I can only do one thing, I would

291
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:52,818
throw all my money on the trailer. Why is that? Firstly,

292
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:55,560
that is the thing if you send an email that says reveal

293
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,343
trailer or launch trailer, those are the emails that get the

294
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,465
most open rates from press and streamers and so on, because

295
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:02,986
everybody just wants to see what the game looks like.

296
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:07,752
and so you have to make that one minute and spotlight count that's the one

297
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:09,753
minute we definitely got some I post from press

298
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:14,155
and it had one or two minute trailer you have you want to sell credibility

299
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:15,976
that comes back to the key message

300
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:18,577
that means and a one small spotlight

301
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:22,439
what the trailer shows you have really you have to sell that one message you

302
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:22,899
have in mind

303
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:26,881
it could be your interesting story it could be your art style it could be your

304
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:27,341
gameplay

305
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:31,523
don't show all of it focus on it and really sell that one thing that makes

306
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:32,143
your game special

307
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,273
Small note on trailers also in terms of timing,

308
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,295
weird generation, YouTube and Snapchat,

309
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:40,877
make the most first 15 second counts.

310
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:42,838
If they are boring, you're already losing a lot of people.

311
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:45,080
Especially if you make a first or second game,

312
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,882
it doesn't make too much sense to put on your studio name.

313
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:49,363
I know it's nice and you wanna get it out there,

314
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:50,604
but do it in the end of the trailer.

315
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:51,725
Get right in the action.

316
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:54,267
And also keep it short and sweet,

317
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:57,009
so I would say like one minute to one minute 30 is max

318
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,271
if you're in your studio and you make a first trailer.

319
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:04,862
Two examples that I can't show you because of time reasons, but I'm going to talk about them anyway.

320
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:11,686
For really good trailers is again this War of Mine. Again, the game looks horrible. If you just see it, it doesn't look too interesting.

321
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:20,030
But what they did in the announcement trailer was really cool. That's what it looked like. You see some soldiers running. It has really dramatic Hungarian music.

322
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,231
So it always gets the Eastern European taste, which is the setting of the game.

323
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,552
And by the end of it, the camera keeps zooming in that war zone

324
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,093
and then goes straight into the house,

325
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:30,834
where you just see people sitting and crying,

326
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:31,555
normal people.

327
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:34,116
And again, it says, in war, not everyone is a soldier.

328
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:36,758
So that really sets the atmosphere of the game.

329
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:40,620
And the point is, if people are into that atmosphere

330
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,102
and they see that, they want to know more.

331
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,903
And they will be OK with the gameplay not looking

332
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:46,964
that great on first sight.

333
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:48,685
But if they just see the gameplay,

334
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:50,506
they will just click away and not even come to the point

335
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:51,587
where they interact with the game.

336
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:54,209
And again, super hot.

337
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,630
Really different approach, really away from the atmosphere.

338
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,431
What they did in their trailer, they start with super hot,

339
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,851
which is weird by itself.

340
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:04,032
So in the first two seconds, people are really, OK,

341
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:05,492
I might as well watch that.

342
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:08,813
Then they explain the gameplay mechanic really shortly.

343
00:15:10,153 --> 00:15:12,173
So first they got your attention with the super hot.

344
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:13,834
Then they get your interest because they show you

345
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:15,414
the time mechanic, which is cool.

346
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:19,015
And then they just bombard you with quotes

347
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:21,396
that prove to you that that time mechanic does not only

348
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:22,736
look cool, that it's actually cool.

349
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,776
So they really sell it to you from A to C. That's really

350
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:26,136
brilliant.

351
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:31,659
Fourth point you should do, something called guerrilla

352
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:32,159
marketing.

353
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,240
And that is low-cost, unconventional marketing

354
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,720
tactics.

355
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:42,743
And that may sound a bit complicated, but if you just

356
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:46,604
look at one example that I really like to give, because

357
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,565
it explains you perfectly what guerrilla marketing does.

358
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:49,505
And it's just too good.

359
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,146
It's too good to be true, but it actually happened.

360
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:55,966
When Burnout 2 came out, a claim said on the launch day they're going to pay all speeding

361
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:56,786
tickets on the US.

362
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,427
Which is absolutely insane.

363
00:15:58,487 --> 00:15:59,208
It's like mayhem.

364
00:15:59,268 --> 00:15:59,788
It's GTA.

365
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:02,950
It's just everybody can drive how he wants and there's a lot of accidents, a lot of people

366
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,350
would die.

367
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,773
And obviously press found that's really cool and was writing about it.

368
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:10,155
Gaming press, general interest press, all over the place.

369
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,897
And obviously the police was already reading that and were saying, hell no, that's not

370
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:14,378
going to happen.

371
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,418
And they totally forbid it.

372
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:19,239
And of course, gaming press and general interest press,

373
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:22,040
they picked up on that as well again and said, OK,

374
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,900
a game can't do that.

375
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,940
No way that's going to happen with the speeding tickets.

376
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,981
And the game knew that from the beginning.

377
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,921
So if you think about it, they were writing one press release

378
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:31,342
saying we're doing that same thing,

379
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:33,342
and then a second one saying we can't,

380
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:35,983
without ever having to pay anything

381
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,583
and getting loads of headlines in two big waves.

382
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:39,783
That's just brilliant.

383
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:42,704
So why would you care about things like guerrilla

384
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:43,104
marketing?

385
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,362
First of all, it is an extra PR beat.

386
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:48,904
So we were talking about that PR ammunition in the beginning,

387
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:52,407
and that guerrilla marketing, those PR stunts,

388
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:53,828
those are things you can just make up.

389
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,090
They are not given, they are not set.

390
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:57,872
You can just invent them.

391
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:00,174
They are hard to do, they are hard to pull off,

392
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,755
but they give you extra PR ammunition.

393
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,517
They reach really different target groups.

394
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:06,399
They often reach general interest media

395
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,801
or different media that's not necessarily gaming.

396
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:11,083
They often happen on a small budget.

397
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:14,194
And they also go in a quite untapped field.

398
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:17,535
Of course, there are also risks of guerrilla marketing.

399
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,017
It often breaks taboos.

400
00:17:20,777 --> 00:17:23,318
It is not always 100% legal, and you have to look before

401
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:23,938
if it's worth it.

402
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,105
And it doesn't always start in good PR.

403
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:30,287
And I know that saying that all PR is good PR,

404
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:31,288
but that is not true.

405
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:32,009
I don't think so.

406
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:33,950
Because if you just want to have PR somehow,

407
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,231
I would advise you take your phone,

408
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:39,273
make a video of how you punch your co-programmer in the face.

409
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:40,955
That would get you a lot of coverage.

410
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:43,356
Or you just fire a pregnant co-worker.

411
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,237
That would also get you a lot of headlines.

412
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,879
But that's not good PR, and that's

413
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:47,799
not going to sell your game.

414
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,502
So it also has to fit the theme of your game, whatever you

415
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:52,482
do with guerrilla marketing.

416
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:57,536
And what we have now, I'm going to show you two examples of

417
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,357
guerrilla marketing.

418
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:01,579
First of all, what they did, but then also what impact on

419
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:05,962
media and on what impact on sales that whole PR stunt had.

420
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:10,025
So there's a game called Crawl, which looks really cool,

421
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,126
really cool pixel art style.

422
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:15,749
And what they did, they made a boss called Gabe Newell, which

423
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:16,570
looks quite familiar.

424
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,510
It's the boss of Valve.

425
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,973
And because the gifs look so nice, and it's a funny idea,

426
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:24,669
And putting it out alone got them loads of headlines

427
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,530
in different media.

428
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,592
And then Gabe Newell also was writing an email and saying,

429
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:29,572
oh, I think that's funny.

430
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:31,393
I'm fine with you putting me in the game.

431
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:32,394
So they were lucky as well.

432
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:33,675
They got two news feeds out of that.

433
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:36,537
How did it reflect the media coverage?

434
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,999
We look at exclusively European media in that sense now.

435
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,781
When they announced the game in August

436
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:44,061
and they had the early access launch,

437
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:46,503
and some news and some previews, they got about 20 articles.

438
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:49,345
Then Gabe Newell come along and totally crushed that

439
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:50,305
and get over 100 articles.

440
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:54,989
So in terms of media presence, that was crazy compared to what

441
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:55,609
they did before.

442
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:56,709
That really got them forward.

443
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,790
They did also reflect on sales.

444
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,651
Here's the sales data from the same period.

445
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:04,592
We have some small bumps and spikes with updates.

446
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:05,932
And then we have that.

447
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:10,214
The first line is where the Gabe Newell GIF was released.

448
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,694
And the second one is where Gabe Newell said, OK, you can

449
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:13,295
put me in the game.

450
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,986
And as you can see, they have two small spikes from that,

451
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:17,786
which is quite nice.

452
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:19,767
They are like little updates, but they just

453
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:21,387
had to make one boss.

454
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,367
But still, it's not as impressive

455
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:25,508
as the coverage numbers.

456
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:29,028
So in terms of immediate sales effect, it was nice, but it

457
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:29,949
wasn't the best thing ever.

458
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:33,109
But then again, PR is also about repeating the message,

459
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,670
getting the name out of view again over and over.

460
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,430
I just know it for myself.

461
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,571
When I saw Undertale first on the website, I was like, that

462
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:40,031
looks ugly.

463
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:40,811
I don't want to play that.

464
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:43,240
But if you see it 20 times in a row,

465
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,181
you're probably going to play it.

466
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:47,503
So it is also an art form by itself keeping the headlines.

467
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:50,705
And if you wonder what the sales spike is over there,

468
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:52,246
that was actually a streamer.

469
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:54,448
So that had a direct more sales effect.

470
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,971
And then we have another example from a game called

471
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,171
Shooting Stars I worked on.

472
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:03,734
It's an iOS premium game that was first released on iOS.

473
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,655
And then we made an Android version.

474
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,756
And it was obvious that the Android version is going

475
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:09,097
to have a very high piracy rate.

476
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:10,858
And we're not going to earn a lot of money with it.

477
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:15,064
So what happened, what we did, we made two Android versions.

478
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:17,725
One was the normal one, and one was the pirate version.

479
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,547
And in the pirate version, there's a boss coming up that

480
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,849
says to you, we know you pirated our game, so you can't

481
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,409
beat that boss.

482
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:24,789
That's it.

483
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,290
Like, that game is over for you.

484
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,291
You can't progress anymore.

485
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:32,133
And we just released that illegal pirate version on

486
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:34,735
illegal Android file sharing game platforms.

487
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:36,536
So only pirates will play it.

488
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:38,597
And we found it's funny.

489
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:40,378
A lot of other people found it's funny.

490
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:43,059
It got really good mainstream and gaming media coverage

491
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,980
and different things like Forbes, Kotaku,

492
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,701
Video Gaming 24-7, Touchicate, and so on.

493
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:49,862
And that's like, especially for mobile games,

494
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,823
that is media that's really hard to reach.

495
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:55,105
So how did it reflect the number of articles?

496
00:20:55,945 --> 00:20:56,845
We've counted on the left,

497
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:58,846
all articles the game got before,

498
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:01,648
which means the announcement, announcement trailer,

499
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:03,549
launch trailer, previous reviews, interviews,

500
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,609
it did quite some PR.

501
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:07,150
And on the right, just the pirate PR stunt.

502
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:11,415
And just the Pirate PR stunt alone, that one PR beat of

503
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:14,618
making a little, a leaky second version and sending out a

504
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:17,620
press release about that, got more than half of the coverage

505
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:18,962
than all the other coverage combined.

506
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:20,163
So really good for them.

507
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:26,088
In terms of sales, we see on the left in the blue the iOS

508
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:29,290
sales, with the iOS launch going up, going down, quite

509
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,713
normal, the Android launch boosts iOS a bit, Android

510
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,495
starts to sell, and then we have the Android PR stunt,

511
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:35,876
and then.

512
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,791
The Android PR sales really went up.

513
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:42,213
And I think it's also one of the few games that had nearly

514
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:45,114
the same amount of iOS and Android sales because of that

515
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:49,916
PR stunt.

516
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:52,597
Number five for things you should get right are events.

517
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:55,118
And there's a lot to talk about events.

518
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:58,839
They're great, absolutely fantastic for networking.

519
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,480
They're great for recruiting.

520
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,861
They're good for getting inspiration.

521
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:02,801
They're good for feedback.

522
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:04,946
Sometimes they're good for press.

523
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,626
But if you look solely at PR, there's

524
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:09,707
a very limited number of events that pay off for you.

525
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:15,249
We, again, have a graph which events get covered by media.

526
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:16,409
How many times?

527
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,451
What we don't see in the graph is E3.

528
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:25,072
Because if E3 would be on there, you would still see games coming.

529
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:26,732
The other thing would just shrink down

530
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:27,693
and you couldn't see them anymore.

531
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,514
But also for an indie, E3 is quite hard to reach.

532
00:22:31,694 --> 00:22:32,794
So we left it out for that graph.

533
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:36,156
And as you can see, Gamescom gets a lot of articles.

534
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,236
Tokyo Game Show gets a lot of articles.

535
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:39,437
GDC as well.

536
00:22:39,617 --> 00:22:41,937
But everything after that, it really gets more quiet.

537
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:44,658
So I'm not saying going to events is bad.

538
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:47,618
I'm just saying, as an indie, probably don't go to every

539
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,159
event if you don't have to show anything.

540
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,639
I know it's quite cool at the moment because of Rami, and it

541
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:52,419
really works for him.

542
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,080
I'm not sure if it works for everyone.

543
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,201
Five common pitfalls.

544
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:01,801
What you shouldn't do in indie games PR.

545
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,643
First of all, biggest of all, it's just doing too little too late.

546
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:09,384
I know it's really hard to make a game, I know it takes a lot of time and effort,

547
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:13,886
but also, if you spend one or two or three years making a game

548
00:23:13,986 --> 00:23:17,447
and then don't take the extra few months to get a PR campaign off the ground,

549
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:19,268
that's a shame and it happens quite a lot.

550
00:23:21,513 --> 00:23:23,374
Playing J and D cards doesn't work anymore.

551
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:25,516
It was cool a few years back, saying,

552
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:26,617
we're just one developer.

553
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:27,657
We're working in a basement.

554
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:28,898
That doesn't work anymore.

555
00:23:28,938 --> 00:23:29,559
Nobody cares.

556
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,141
If you tell that to press, it's just not impressive.

557
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,562
There are a few examples where somebody is alone

558
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:35,963
and pulls up something insane.

559
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,745
But in general, I think that's not a good angle for press

560
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:39,326
to talk to them.

561
00:23:41,564 --> 00:23:44,705
Number 3 is again, I can't stress it enough, a poor technical trailer.

562
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:47,527
That's the one time people are going to look at your game for sure.

563
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:51,870
And if you just put it together somehow and you show how many shaders and features you have,

564
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,711
that's not something people care about.

565
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:55,792
You have to transport your one key message.

566
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:59,694
I think also a lot of indies don't repackage enough.

567
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:03,997
What I mean by that is, if you announce your game and it doesn't get press coverage,

568
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:05,298
just announce it again.

569
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,500
It's a bit sleazy, but it does work quite sometime.

570
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:12,579
And if it's not announced and if it's not out there, it just doesn't officially exist.

571
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:14,221
So just don't care and try it again.

572
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:17,244
Don't be too annoying, don't announce it like 50 times,

573
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:19,466
but it doesn't hurt to give it a second or third try.

574
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:23,090
A thing where we did that is a game called Too Dark, where we had

575
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,696
a reveal teaser, which was nice and it worked nice. It got a few thousand views, it got media pick-up, all that.

576
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:31,760
But we thought from the material that we have, it could be better.

577
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:35,294
So after quite some time, we went back to the drawing board,

578
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:37,715
took the trailer again, recycled it,

579
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:39,736
let it cut by a professional company,

580
00:24:40,836 --> 00:24:42,137
also added a story in the trailer

581
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:44,078
that was more appealing, like a concept,

582
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:46,999
and sent it out again to press.

583
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:50,361
And what happened in the end was the second trailer

584
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:52,662
got 40,000 extra views on top to the first one,

585
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:54,743
and it got over 60 articles more.

586
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:55,923
And a lot of press were thinking,

587
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,784
we just announced the game with the second trailer.

588
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:04,741
And number five is, I would definitely recommend you

589
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:07,143
to do pull PR instead of push PR.

590
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:08,904
What I mean by that, I know it's tempting,

591
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,546
you have something you want to share with the world,

592
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:12,287
and just go out there and rub it

593
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:13,929
in all the journalist's face all the time

594
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:15,110
and you want to get covered everywhere.

595
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,852
Which can work sometimes, but usually it doesn't.

596
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,273
It makes much more sense.

597
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:23,608
to properly find out which websites usually cover that kind of games you're talking about

598
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:29,671
and also find out what editor likes. So really going in depth, listening to their podcasts,

599
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:33,133
reading their articles, getting familiar with the sites that are important for you

600
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:39,516
and then just serving them something interesting. You're already like kind of writing up the story

601
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:44,558
for them. You sent them a very detailed pitch of what they could write about.

602
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,894
But that is really, even as a small game,

603
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:49,437
how you can get on board with a Kotaku or a Polygon.

604
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:51,738
Because you really know that that is an angle

605
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,679
that that editor likes.

606
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:55,281
And I think if it gives them that assets and that story,

607
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:55,782
it could work.

608
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:59,205
So I think sending out a big press release campaign

609
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:00,966
to a few hundred people definitely doesn't hurt.

610
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:03,308
And it's always a good second plan.

611
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,850
But to really get the spicy, really good coverage,

612
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,152
it is really good to have some poor PR

613
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:10,294
and have something interesting that the editor actually wants

614
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:11,635
instead of forcing him to write it.

615
00:26:13,736 --> 00:26:16,837
And now we're going to talk quickly about 5 future trends in indie games PR.

616
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:22,158
One is, I think it will be even in the future, even more than now, it will be

617
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:25,239
more focused on high compact quality info.

618
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:28,440
That's just with more games coming out but not more press coming up.

619
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,061
You will have to use more of those new speeds we talked about and bundle them up

620
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:33,201
even more in the future

621
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:36,602
and waste more of your PR ammunition to even cut through to press.

622
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:42,903
I think visual content will be more important, again, because of YouTube, Snapchat, all that,

623
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:47,167
attention spans just go down. So I think having nice GIFs is kind of essential now.

624
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:50,811
Having a really nice short trailer gets more and more and more important.

625
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:58,058
PR marketing will get even closer. That has to do with a few different things. One of is that

626
00:26:58,078 --> 00:27:01,821
streamers and YouTubers, they just get more commercialized and they often won't have a

627
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:03,743
revenue share or some money to cover your game.

628
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:10,336
And also, there are a lot of editorial houses and publishing houses having a tougher time now and start buying each other.

629
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:14,557
And marketing deals just get more important to get all your stories off the ground.

630
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:19,859
I think credibility through platform will vanish.

631
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,960
A few years back, it was a big deal if you were on Steam.

632
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,661
If you were on Steam, you've pretty much made it and everybody knew you were a proper good game.

633
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:29,313
That is gone.

634
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:30,593
If you're on Steam, that's cool.

635
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:31,934
But there's so many games on Steam

636
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:32,994
that just doesn't work anymore.

637
00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:35,655
If you come on console now, it still gives you some

638
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,655
credibility, but it always gets less.

639
00:27:37,735 --> 00:27:41,436
Also, with programs like with ID at Xbox, just more games

640
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:41,996
are coming out.

641
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:45,637
So just pretending or saying you're on a platform now

642
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:47,878
doesn't give you as much boost as it did back in the day.

643
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:53,919
And one last thing that I think will take off even more.

644
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:56,225
It's clever in-game social sharing.

645
00:27:56,405 --> 00:27:58,527
What I mean by that, one example is again, super hot.

646
00:27:58,907 --> 00:28:00,588
If I were to share what it is, it would be a spoiler.

647
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:04,050
But we have one example from a game called Alpha Bear,

648
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:06,452
which is a puzzle game where you're puzzled with words.

649
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:09,074
By the end of each level, they have certain templates

650
00:28:09,094 --> 00:28:11,976
with sentences, and depending on which words you created,

651
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:14,397
different words are filled in into the template.

652
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:17,459
And a lot of times, the thing that comes out in the end

653
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:18,340
doesn't make any sense.

654
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,621
Sometimes, things like that come out.

655
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:22,952
And people really like that.

656
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,133
And people think that's funny.

657
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:25,614
And they share it on the social media.

658
00:28:25,974 --> 00:28:27,975
And they don't do it because they get an in-game bonus.

659
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:30,337
They don't do it because they get an extra thing.

660
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:31,617
They get it because they want to.

661
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,018
And this was brilliant.

662
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:36,140
I tell you, when AlphaBear came out, I didn't pay attention.

663
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,981
But my timeline was flooded for days.

664
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:38,802
And it came back.

665
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:40,402
And again, and finally, I was like, OK,

666
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:41,363
I want to check out AlphaBear.

667
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:42,504
And I downloaded it and played it.

668
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:45,866
So I think that's really a way to go forward.

669
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:53,825
and to also fight against the things like that it's getting more difficult to get streamers and press to listen to you.

670
00:28:55,386 --> 00:28:57,248
That's it from my side. Thanks a lot for listening.

671
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:12,003
I think we're pretty much on time or out of time, but if anyone has questions, I will be around here and also in the wrap-up room later.
