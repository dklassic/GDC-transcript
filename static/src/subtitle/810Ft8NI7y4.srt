00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:19,056
Hello, I'm Kim Belaire and on stage around is David Boudard.

2
00:00:19,677 --> 00:00:24,540
We're writers and narrative designers and we're also the founders of Sweet Baby Inc.

3
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:29,844
Sweet Baby Inc. is a narrative development company with a physical space in Montreal

4
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:34,026
where I am right now and a distributed team working remotely.

5
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:37,316
And when we say that we're a narrative development company,

6
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:40,340
it's a term that we use to encapsulate a lot of the stuff

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,843
that we do, which I guess ranges from consults and script

8
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:46,867
writing to narrative direction and cultural assessments.

9
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:48,949
It's kind of a full service thing

10
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:51,352
where we work on games with a lot of different clients

11
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:53,053
in a lot of very, very different ways.

12
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:57,418
And that means we've had to be very, very flexible, of course, in the way that we work,

13
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,743
while also developing a very rigorous production and organizational structure

14
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:05,768
to keep us on track and working to like a dozen client schedules at a time

15
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:07,530
without breaking our own.

16
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:12,155
No matter what happens, we as Sweet Baby need to be able to stay working about 9 to 5.

17
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:16,999
We need to be salaried and comfortable and we need to keep our own work-life balance

18
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,322
while also shifting to the demands of a lot of different projects.

19
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:25,486
And that's been great, but it's also meant that we have to be equally rigorous in our

20
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:31,171
production pipelines as we are in managing just the way that we're treated and ensuring that any

21
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:37,536
challenging collaboration gets handled as quickly as possible with as much empathy as firmness.

22
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:43,396
So today, I think what we want to do is just share some of the things that we've seen in

23
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:48,538
terms of tough collaborations and a bit of what we think might hopefully have helped

24
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:52,380
them go more smoothly or at least share, this is when we knew that it was time to say, forget

25
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,760
it and walk away.

26
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,040
So thank you.

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,300
Thank you.

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,580
Thank you.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,801
Thank you.

30
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,361
Thank you.

31
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:54,661
Thank you.

32
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,161
Thank you.

33
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:55,361
Thank you.

34
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:55,661
Thank you.

35
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:56,922
Thank you.

36
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:57,162
Thank you.

37
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:02,471
First off, I think it's important to say that collaboration can be challenging.

38
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:06,393
Most collaborations are going to be challenging a little bit, especially at the beginning,

39
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:10,136
because there's a rhythm to collaboration and a language to learn.

40
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:14,719
And even in best case client scenarios, we have to embed, right?

41
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,320
And that naturally takes a bit of time.

42
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:23,025
So to start, we kind of wanted to give a couple examples without naming names of things that

43
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:26,007
have gone kind of poorly and that we'd like to...

44
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,711
kind of share. So I'll start with project A. We joined a project that looked really,

45
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:37,972
really great. The game was stunning. It had a diverse cast, and we were told, of course,

46
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:43,293
that it needed our diverse voices. And it also lined up with our gameplay sensibilities.

47
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:48,194
And when we got on board with the team, they promised us this thing was ready to write.

48
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:52,515
It's got everything it needs. The blocks are all there. We just need to put the words in.

49
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:55,575
We'll show you here, and we'll build the final systems.

50
00:02:56,882 --> 00:02:59,504
But what happened was, it was not ready to write.

51
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:01,846
And the systems that were promised were never built,

52
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:04,188
because as we went through this project,

53
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,649
the studio began shedding seniors

54
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,311
and replacing them with juniors.

55
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:09,592
And suddenly the expectation became

56
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:12,595
that the work we were promised would be done in the dark.

57
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,557
We ended up, and I'm not proud of this,

58
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:16,679
but we basically writing an entire game

59
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:20,462
without level design block out for a lot of the experience.

60
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:23,523
And on top of that, the marginalized perspectives

61
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:27,024
that we were consistently reassured were behind our hiring

62
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:28,605
ended up being fully lip service.

63
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:30,385
They wanted a diverse team,

64
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:32,726
but they didn't want to have to represent them

65
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:33,667
or make any changes.

66
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:36,208
And we eventually, of course, just said,

67
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:37,968
there's not much more we can do here,

68
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,449
it's not coming together, and we walked away.

69
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:47,701
So, Project B was another collaboration that was literally years in the making.

70
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:52,805
It had this lengthy runway of conversations, and every time we met with them, they stressed

71
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:58,470
the importance of our team and its specific makeup being key to crafting the franchise

72
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,534
narrative and offering our perspective on characters and story.

73
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:09,017
We spent ages, just months, figuring it all out, and at every gate reassurances were made

74
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:12,219
that we're the right people, we'll be able to shape this game, we're going to be fully

75
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,942
embedded and embraced, and we were told specifically that our role as contractors in the studio

76
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:22,164
would actually give us a lot of freedom and a lot of movement and allow us to do really

77
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:23,065
specific work.

78
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:29,643
And so what happened, of course, because this is this talk, is that we joined with a ton of excitement,

79
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:36,851
but ultimately ended up shoved pretty hard into this internal hierarchy of like this deeply hierarchical place.

80
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:41,780
Like all of a sudden there were these soft rules about who can speak to who and when.

81
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,342
There are these unspoken grudges and politics and some very loudly spoken grudges and politics.

82
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:52,724
There was public disrespect that we were witnessing happening like in meetings just between developers.

83
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:57,927
And obviously we're contractors, but we still brought this up to management and it got a shrug.

84
00:04:58,267 --> 00:04:59,967
They said like, no, don't worry about it. You're not part of this.

85
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:03,149
Our job is to fix the studio. We're going to handle this.

86
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,629
And just do your work as contractors.

87
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,253
And so, you know, with a certain amount of hope early on, we did.

88
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:14,118
And still we checked what was needed, and eventually we were asked to do this huge,

89
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:18,822
involved narrative document to solve this problem that the team had been having with the story,

90
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:25,609
and especially the later parts of the story. And so we submitted this document, and we were

91
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:29,512
expecting some kind of creative feedback, because finally it got up to the creative director.

92
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:33,289
And after everything, after working on this super hard,

93
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:35,950
after trying to navigate it and trying to give something of ourselves

94
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,011
to the team that they had asked for,

95
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:40,772
we got this quote that we'll never forget from the creative director

96
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:42,513
who had nothing to say about the narrative,

97
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,933
nothing to say about any of the creative.

98
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:47,495
It was just an email that says,

99
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:50,336
Why are outsourcers writing our ending?

100
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:52,216
Because that was all that mattered.

101
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:53,957
It didn't matter what we did, it mattered who we were.

102
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:56,958
And so we left the project at that point within days.

103
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:03,118
So finally Project C is a little different in that this is a project we worked on on

104
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:07,103
an ongoing basis with a process that very early on was sold as easy and friendly and

105
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:08,564
very much felt easy and friendly.

106
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,708
And it allowed us to meaningfully embed with the team to share values and build a narrative

107
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:12,969
and tell the story that really did work for all of us.

108
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:13,230
It felt easy.

109
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:13,530
It felt easy.

110
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:13,890
It felt easy.

111
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,251
It felt easy.

112
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,531
It felt easy.

113
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:14,932
It felt easy.

114
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:15,232
It felt easy.

115
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:15,552
It felt easy.

116
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:15,853
It felt easy.

117
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:16,233
It felt easy.

118
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:16,513
It felt easy.

119
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:17,074
It felt easy.

120
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:22,693
It felt perfect in a lot of ways that a lot of game dev collaborations don't, but that

121
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:28,281
looseness and that vibe meant that very few deadlines or refined narrative pipelines were

122
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:33,507
built and often we found that our desire to be good teammates saw us taking on more than

123
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,049
we should have to kind of fill in gaps.

124
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,851
while our status as contractors still kept us on the outside of very meaningful decisions.

125
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:45,893
So what happened was that that easy and friendly process was mentally and emotionally true,

126
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:49,573
which is wonderful, but it fell apart very quickly when production hit snags.

127
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:54,875
And kind of as a result of the focus being on that easy relationship versus something more rigorous,

128
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,755
a lot of production nuance ended up left unspoken.

129
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,817
And that meant that when things change on production,

130
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:03,418
or alterations were made to scope,

131
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,819
there was this assumed shared understanding

132
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,440
based on a general sense of alignment,

133
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,661
but there were no actual processes

134
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:12,222
to determine or ratify that alignment.

135
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:15,023
And so a lack of micromanagement, which is nice,

136
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:17,544
easily became a lack of management at all,

137
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:20,866
and resulted in these assumptions being held as truths.

138
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:24,228
And they were held as truths that we were assumed to inherit

139
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,488
just because we vibed.

140
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,693
but that didn't really exist in a more meaningful way beyond that.

141
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:33,120
And it took a long time for us to fix, and we did, I think, and we're happy about that,

142
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,465
but so much of that time could have been spent on making the game better

143
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:39,790
rather than resolving something that we should have done at the outset.

144
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:44,946
Because just to say it, I think, we also make mistakes.

145
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:47,327
There are plenty of things internally

146
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:50,748
that we are still building, and we very much respect

147
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:51,828
how challenging this stuff is.

148
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,849
We're a kind of company that we're still

149
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:54,930
figuring out how we operate.

150
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,030
We're relatively new to the game.

151
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,771
But this talk, I just want to make sure

152
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:00,632
is not just for venting.

153
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:02,832
It's mostly to share some realizations that we've had.

154
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,033
The first, I think, being that our issues with clients

155
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:09,094
tend to fall into two distinct categories.

156
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:16,083
The first is a lack of clarity on how our work even functions, how narrative works.

157
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:18,245
Not in our case, but I think it goes across the board.

158
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:22,811
Because a lot of times we find that when we're hired, there's a faulty perspective on what

159
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:25,695
writers and narrative designers need to work and how they work.

160
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:28,518
There's this assumption that you get a contractor fully formed.

161
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:33,241
But the second focus is a lack of focus on people

162
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:38,083
and a perception of projects as being importantly work first, game first,

163
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:41,545
and then humans second, contractors third.

164
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:46,248
And I think looking at those, regardless of what we do, like...

165
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:48,277
if we weren't in narrative or writing,

166
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:49,858
I think we'd still have this problem as contractors.

167
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:53,439
We see that it's core, the core issue here is a way

168
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,401
that teams and companies view contractors and outside help.

169
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,662
So the question becomes how are contractors seen?

170
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:02,403
And I think from our perspective,

171
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,124
a fundamental issue is that contractors

172
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,885
are often perceived as a tool.

173
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,366
They're like a hammer that you can grab

174
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:09,287
to go at some nails and in a good scenario

175
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:10,187
just be an easy solve.

176
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:14,090
And contractors are also seen as workers who can perform a task

177
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,032
without like the pesky overhead of HR.

178
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:18,495
They're a quick fix, little context is needed,

179
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:22,199
and contractors provide a way to weaponize talent

180
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,962
without the company having to consider the human behind it.

181
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:27,284
We become this extension of the team itself,

182
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,407
but wielded by their hand.

183
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:31,068
And I think...

184
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:39,002
In a cohesive, empathetic, kind, community-focused, organized, well-produced, and efficient game

185
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:42,862
production process, this relationship could be a beautiful symbiosis.

186
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:47,403
But that's just not how most games work.

187
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:53,084
There are no nails simple enough to just wield a hammer against them, and to me what contractors

188
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:55,445
are in an ideal scenario here is collaborators.

189
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,765
People you invite into your team.

190
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:03,041
Because with luck, you've hired people who are experts in their own field and who are deeply knowledgeable of the discipline,

191
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:07,303
and who have taken that knowledge and made a living not only from that knowledge,

192
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:12,365
but of grasping context very quickly, producing that very efficiently,

193
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:14,787
and applying their knowledge to a project in an ongoing manner.

194
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:21,910
And while it's tempting, I think, to assume that this external role of a contractor or a craftsperson here

195
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:25,752
creates distance between that person and the team,

196
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,713
I think that the reality that...

197
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,591
is that games require creative collaboration and shared vision.

198
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:34,492
And there's often actually more work

199
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:37,553
to be done to bring contractors in to share that vision

200
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:39,814
and to make them cohesively, and in terms

201
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:43,495
of their own perspective and knowledge, part of that system.

202
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:47,756
So to that end, we came up with some guidelines, just

203
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:50,377
some thoughts and stuff that David's going to take us

204
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,997
through, and that hopefully provide

205
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,598
at least the beginnings of some structure or just some ideas

206
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:57,659
to think on about how we can do this better.

207
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,033
All right, hi, I'm David.

208
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,153
We've said it before already,

209
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:07,095
but every collaboration is challenging to some degree.

210
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,096
That's just what collaborations are.

211
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,378
But we've found solutions to lean on

212
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:13,239
when challenges do happen, because they will.

213
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,461
We've worked through the challenges,

214
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,422
and we now know things that we wished we knew

215
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:19,124
before we left some of these projects.

216
00:11:19,284 --> 00:11:20,124
So, first up.

217
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,147
We're going to talk about what to do before you're

218
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,407
bringing in external collaborators.

219
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:26,248
The very first question you need to ask yourself

220
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:29,909
is, why do you want to bring on an external collaborator?

221
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,070
What is the problem that you're trying to fix?

222
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,430
And really, the real question is,

223
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,051
are you ready to solve this problem?

224
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:39,212
Or do you wish to be told that there is no problem?

225
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:41,172
If you're bringing in a producer,

226
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:43,453
are you ready to change the way you're doing things?

227
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:45,173
If you're bringing in a sound designer,

228
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,214
are you ready to invest in some tools

229
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:49,695
so that they are able to do their work better?

230
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,292
if you're bringing in a sensitivity reader.

231
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:54,573
Are you ready to examine your own biases

232
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:55,893
because it's going to happen?

233
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,894
We can sense as collaborators

234
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:02,775
when the client is asking for safety

235
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:04,095
versus asking for changes.

236
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,616
And the best collaborations are when people

237
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:08,097
are willing to change.

238
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:11,547
Next question is, what are you paying for?

239
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,488
Are you paying for an opinion that you are maybe or maybe

240
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:15,348
not going to implement?

241
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:18,169
Are you paying for a content producer with strict

242
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:21,249
deadlines, or are you paying for a co-creator with many

243
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,430
responsibilities and lots of autonomy?

244
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,671
These are all very, very different.

245
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,831
They're quoted differently.

246
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,731
The contract is different.

247
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:28,831
They're built differently.

248
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:32,794
and they need different levels of access and onboarding to your project.

249
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:36,056
You have to be ready for this and you have to adapt based on what you actually want.

250
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:39,938
And the other question you need to ask yourself, because we always get asked this, is

251
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,540
is it really full-time or are you just trying to lock them down?

252
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:47,863
There is no benefit in locking down a freelancer. We're used to doing the work

253
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:52,886
on time according to your schedule. If they take the work, it's because they know that they can do

254
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:59,050
this in this amount of time. No need for full-time if the freelancer knows that they can do this work.

255
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:04,534
Remember, freelancers get better because they do more projects at the same time.

256
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:08,456
They accumulate more experience over a shorter amount of time because they touch many different

257
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:08,896
projects.

258
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:10,677
And locking them down prevents that.

259
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,741
Before you sign the contract, you're going to want to talk about deliverables.

260
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:20,203
The first question is, do you know deliverables ahead of time as the client?

261
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:21,684
You might not, and that's okay.

262
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:25,026
But that means you're not asking for a content producer, you're asking for somebody to fill

263
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,367
a full role within your team.

264
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:29,561
And then when that happens, you have to ask yourself,

265
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,302
who's going to determine the deliverables?

266
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:35,925
More often than you think, we, as contractors,

267
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:37,947
are asked to onboard to a project,

268
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,149
and then we're asked, okay, what should we do first?

269
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:42,750
So we have to determine the steps

270
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,752
between nothing and something.

271
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,594
When that happens, we become a team member,

272
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:48,915
whether we're contractors or not.

273
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,677
And we're hired for our expertise, not just our time.

274
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:52,678
And so...

275
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:58,407
you as a client end up bringing someone who will need to be very embedded in the team.

276
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:03,111
It's important to have that conversation before the contract to determine the place that your

277
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:08,516
contractor is going to have within your team ahead of time and to make that space in your team

278
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:15,842
within your project. We're always asked in the first opening calls when's the right moment to

279
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:16,903
bring us on and

280
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:19,517
We don't really know what the right time is.

281
00:14:19,577 --> 00:14:20,758
It depends for every project.

282
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:21,719
We do know one thing, though.

283
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,641
There is such a thing as too late.

284
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,943
And when there isn't time to do meaningful work,

285
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:29,125
when you're up against the wall and you're like,

286
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:30,947
we're gonna bring in somebody because we're out of time,

287
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:33,549
chances are this collaborator will also not have

288
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:34,950
enough time to do their work.

289
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,452
And it might not be a good idea to bring someone else

290
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:40,054
to the mix who will also get crunched

291
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:42,596
and turn in subpar work due to the circumstances.

292
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:47,320
And there is also no such thing as too early.

293
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,702
Oftentimes, clients will wait to be

294
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,383
ready to bring somebody on, to have enough documentation,

295
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:54,824
to have enough for the vision to stabilize.

296
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:57,466
And the best way we found to work, honestly,

297
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:59,747
is as early as possible so that we can follow the project

298
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:00,027
along.

299
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:02,229
It's not about influencing the project.

300
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,910
It's about knowing and being there and avoiding pitfalls

301
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,831
before they happen.

302
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:08,112
So we like to onboard very early on

303
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:11,134
and do regular check-ins monthly or quarterly

304
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,094
before production starts.

305
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,851
That way we have time to build project knowledge.

306
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:21,436
We can add our opinions and influences to the project when it's needed, in order to

307
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:23,657
be ready to hit the ground running when the production starts.

308
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:29,302
This avoids things like calling into question major game pillars halfway through production

309
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:30,102
because we weren't there.

310
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:33,599
before we actually had to encounter them.

311
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,042
This prep time is not time consuming.

312
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,944
This can happen as a couple times a month,

313
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,386
which means it's a couple hours for us

314
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:41,747
and it's not super expensive.

315
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:45,110
And it really helps collaboration be easier in the long run.

316
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,772
So please consider bringing any external collaborators

317
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,454
you would want early on,

318
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:51,356
even just to see what the product is like

319
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:53,458
and to have a long ramp way

320
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:56,400
towards your successful collaboration.

321
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,834
Now, you've decided to work with a collaborator,

322
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:00,975
and you've signed the contract.

323
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:02,536
We have some guidelines for that, too.

324
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,579
You have to remember that they're game developers.

325
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,421
The way contracting works, oftentimes,

326
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:12,544
is that we will have one point of contact with your team,

327
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:13,965
somebody who's responsible for talking to us.

328
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,446
And it's also their responsibility,

329
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:17,867
because we're game developers, to give us

330
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:20,089
as much information as possible on the game.

331
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,291
And that's on top of their regular responsibilities

332
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:24,252
on your team.

333
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:27,009
This means that despite their best efforts,

334
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:30,170
they're only human, and we can't get a full vision

335
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,971
of what's happening on your entire team.

336
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,411
And we're kept in the dark.

337
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:35,152
And we can't do our best work

338
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:36,913
without the context of your wider game,

339
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:38,694
just like your regular employees.

340
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:42,255
So don't treat your contractors like a service house.

341
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,716
External developers do their best work

342
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,017
when they are part of the team.

343
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:48,778
Invite them to syncs and end of sprint reviews,

344
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:50,559
and have them meet the whole team,

345
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,439
even if it's just like an hour long of fun facts.

346
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:58,564
And don't just have a private channel where you talk to the contractors in one person.

347
00:16:58,604 --> 00:16:59,384
That's never useful.

348
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,685
Bring them into the full Slack channel, have them embedded in the team, have them participate

349
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:03,185
in activities.

350
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:07,327
More collaboration and more connections, more access means better work at the end of the

351
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:07,487
day.

352
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:11,328
The other thing is time.

353
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,095
In case you don't know, freelancers plan their own work

354
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:15,756
according to time.

355
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:17,796
They have a week, and they're slotting

356
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,657
all these different projects in that week

357
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:21,197
to be able to meet their deadlines.

358
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:23,878
And they need their own calendars for that.

359
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:26,719
They can't really have waiting periods

360
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:28,359
to start or complete a deliverable.

361
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:30,220
A waiting freelancer is a freelancer

362
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,461
whose personal calendar is getting really messed up,

363
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,181
and that leads to worse work at the end of the day.

364
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,922
That's why you're having all these conversations

365
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:37,682
before you start.

366
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,161
Remember to give feedback in a timely manner.

367
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:43,902
It sucks to send something and hear nothing back.

368
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:44,682
It always sucks.

369
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,764
But also, if you hear feedback two weeks on,

370
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:51,066
you have to reacclimate and context switch back

371
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,706
onto this project every single time.

372
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:54,671
So keep that in mind.

373
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:56,292
The same thing applies if we require more time

374
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:57,053
from your freelancers.

375
00:17:57,754 --> 00:17:59,255
Always remember that if you're crunching,

376
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:00,616
your collaborators are crunching too,

377
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:03,938
there's no such thing as one without the other.

378
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:04,939
You have to acknowledge this.

379
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:06,380
You can't just like bury your head in the sand

380
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,661
and pretend that everything is fine.

381
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,202
They're freelancers, they're used to it.

382
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:11,264
You have to have a conversation about this.

383
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:13,125
And don't take it for granted.

384
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,248
And the last thing is if your deadlines

385
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:17,709
change midway through production,

386
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:20,050
it's because your team can't meet

387
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:24,027
deadline. They can't produce the work in the time you've allotted ahead of time.

388
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:28,929
So why wouldn't the calendar of the contractor change as well? We know that

389
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:31,810
there's a date on the contract, we know that there's a deliverable, but if the

390
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,711
whole project changes then that contract doesn't fit with what you're making

391
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:41,014
anyway. So have the conversation to, you know, open up the contract again, see how

392
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,855
we can collaborate better, and see how we can get to the finish line together

393
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:44,375
better.

394
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:48,909
A topic that's very near and dear to my heart,

395
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,810
not Garfield, iteration.

396
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:53,472
This is video games.

397
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:55,053
Nothing's ever right on the first try.

398
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:57,215
I don't think I'm saying anything new here at GDC.

399
00:18:58,195 --> 00:18:59,816
Nothing ever fits on first delivery.

400
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:02,198
It has to be tested, balanced, edited, reviewed,

401
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:04,359
whatever the hell it is.

402
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:05,840
Sorry for swearing, I'm French.

403
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:08,402
There will be many passes.

404
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:10,123
This is the normal process.

405
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:13,810
So don't build your calendars expecting collaborators

406
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,892
who have less visibility on your project

407
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:17,093
to get it right the first time.

408
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,154
It's not because they're bad at their jobs.

409
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,516
It's because they need iteration just like everybody else

410
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:22,016
on your team.

411
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:23,878
This is the process of making games.

412
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:25,979
And to that effect.

413
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:31,991
integrate. We need to see our first passes in the game to know if it's good. We need to see it in

414
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:38,518
action in order to improve it and make it better. This applies to everybody. Your wider team has a

415
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:42,963
better perspective on the project and everything going on in the game and getting your collaborators

416
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:48,149
work in the game will allow your team to react to this content and help improve it for future passes.

417
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:52,426
To make it simple, integrate the content into the game

418
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:55,588
to compensate for the fact that your collaborators are not

419
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:58,891
fully integrated into your team.

420
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:01,874
Honestly, you'd be surprised at how much times we've sent

421
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:03,796
scripts and we don't see them in-game ever.

422
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:05,017
And we get lots of notes on them,

423
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:09,461
but we can't help them make them better until they're in-game.

424
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:11,383
And we can also add our perspective to this.

425
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:17,763
We've said this a couple times before, but contractors are honing one specific skill

426
00:20:17,903 --> 00:20:19,506
across multiple different productions at once.

427
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:23,595
Generally speaking, you are an expert in your game.

428
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:25,536
You've spent thousands of hours and years

429
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:27,837
learning and figuring out and knowing

430
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:28,977
how to make this specific game.

431
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:31,379
But think of the fact that the freelancers that you're hiring,

432
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,321
the same thing goes for them and their field of expertise

433
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:36,901
across many different games.

434
00:20:37,422 --> 00:20:39,143
They spend their time being the best

435
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:41,464
at doing what they do across multiple different productions

436
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:44,165
on multiple different scales, multiple different scopes.

437
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,906
In our case, from AAA to a very small indie.

438
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:51,328
So we know how to do narrative on any type of production.

439
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:53,949
So oftentimes, the problem isn't about your project.

440
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,130
It's about making our expertise fit with the project at hand.

441
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,311
So listen to your collaborators.

442
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:01,372
They're experts.

443
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:04,253
And remember, don't hire people to tell you

444
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:06,854
things that you think you know better than them.

445
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:09,275
That's not going to lead to successful collaboration.

446
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,695
You hired them for a reason.

447
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:14,743
Work requires vulnerability, experience, energy,

448
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,445
and thus it requires humanity.

449
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:19,869
A task can have taken 15 minutes to perform,

450
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:21,871
but it requires thousands of hours

451
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,593
honing a craft to do in this amount of time.

452
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:27,418
You're paying to access a human being with life experience

453
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:29,861
who knows how to do their job, so please respect that.

454
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,535
And finally, here's something everybody knows.

455
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,636
Games change scope during development.

456
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:38,896
It's just what games do.

457
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,376
And that's why we like doing this.

458
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:44,717
Sometimes that happens while your contractors

459
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:45,597
are working on the project.

460
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:48,398
The thing you have to remember is, yes, we

461
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,978
will sense it as it's happening.

462
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:51,658
We'll see that what we're trying to do

463
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:53,959
doesn't quite fit with what you're doing.

464
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,079
But they should also be told about it.

465
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,659
You can't just assume that they'll find out

466
00:21:58,679 --> 00:21:59,340
from somebody else.

467
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
There needs to be a conversation about the game's scope

468
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,200
and how it's changing.

469
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:06,199
Because change in scope means change in expectations.

470
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,740
Employees can weather a change in scope

471
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,921
because they can wait around for a little bit.

472
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:12,302
You're paying them full time to weather this change.

473
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,863
But contractors are deliverable based

474
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:16,024
and they have other things going on.

475
00:22:16,464 --> 00:22:18,786
They need to have the relationship re-evaluated

476
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:20,567
and re-examined when these changes occur.

477
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:22,648
Is it the right time to put an end to a relationship?

478
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,728
Does it have to change?

479
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:24,749
Does the contract need to change?

480
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:26,230
Does more people need to be brought on?

481
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,950
All these questions need to happen

482
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:29,871
when you're changing the scope of your game.

483
00:22:32,428 --> 00:22:33,929
Now, we've given lots of advice for clients,

484
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:35,750
but we also wanted to touch base on a couple points

485
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,111
in case you're the collaborator.

486
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:41,513
First, be honest with what is and what isn't your

487
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,694
responsibility, with yourself and with the client.

488
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:48,417
Be clear about what they are getting

489
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:49,778
and what you are willing to give.

490
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:52,519
And that line will always move throughout the contract,

491
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,300
so it's a conversation that needs to happen often.

492
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:57,682
Get everything laid out first before you start on any work.

493
00:22:57,722 --> 00:22:59,023
We talked about deliverables before.

494
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:00,464
This applies to contractors too.

495
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:04,738
And advocate for yourself as best as you can, especially when challenges arise.

496
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:07,539
This can lead to conflict, but conflict is not bad.

497
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,922
All of the guidelines we've mentioned can and should be brought up when challenges are

498
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:13,282
happening.

499
00:23:13,823 --> 00:23:15,523
It's not easy, but it's necessary.

500
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:20,226
It's what you need to make it through those challenges to do a successful delivery of

501
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,046
a successful project.

502
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,634
Always make sure to build a good relationship with your clients in order to be able to have

503
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:26,374
those conversations.

504
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:30,256
We've told two clients today to try to build relationships with you, but it's also the

505
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:35,497
contractor's responsibility to build these relationships, to be able to have challenging

506
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:37,378
conversations.

507
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:40,039
Your good clients will listen and make changes.

508
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:43,830
And how do you keep going when a project keeps falling short?

509
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,010
Well, you need to have honest conversations with the client.

510
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,431
You need to reevaluate both your intentions and your roles.

511
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:53,372
And deciding whether to push through and continue

512
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:55,652
depends on their understanding of your points

513
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:56,352
as a contractor.

514
00:23:57,973 --> 00:24:00,873
It's perfectly OK to keep going in a challenging situation

515
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:03,194
as long as all parties understand that it

516
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:04,394
is a challenging situation.

517
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,414
But if not, nothing.

518
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:10,715
Not credits, not cash, not connections.

519
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,314
is worth suffering. So always consider if you can leave a difficult situation. Remember

520
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:20,279
that as a freelancer, you also have leverage. And that's going to help you enter these challenging

521
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:26,865
conversations and oftentimes find a solution towards those challenges. So Kim is going

522
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:27,826
to give you the takeaways.

523
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:37,930
Yeah, so just to kind of wrap it up with some final takeaways from this and kind of simplify things that we've talked about and give things to think on.

524
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,812
The first is decide what you're paying for.

525
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,373
If you're hiring someone, are you paying for their expertise?

526
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:45,595
Are you paying for their hours? Are you paying for their time?

527
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:47,416
Are you paying for their work? Are you paying for their muscle?

528
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:53,040
Because whatever you're really, really and truly paying for beyond their knowledge is going to determine your ask.

529
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,902
And that's what the contractor is going to use

530
00:24:54,922 --> 00:24:56,043
to set up their own workloads

531
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:58,745
and also their own lives for the foreseeable.

532
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:01,207
So that's something that's super important at the outset.

533
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,749
You also have to decide what you're not paying for.

534
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,530
And you have to communicate that very clearly

535
00:25:05,611 --> 00:25:07,392
to ensure that expectations are met

536
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:10,735
and that contractors' work and time and knowledge

537
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,116
are never wasted.

538
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:15,539
Things are never done without compensation on either side

539
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:17,400
and things are not done with an expectation

540
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,062
of pleasing a client that the client doesn't even need.

541
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,902
And third, even if a contractor is one person versus something like us, which is a company,

542
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:30,005
these relationships are still the joining of two ecosystems.

543
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:36,068
And as in ecosystems, an imbalance in one area can affect another and it can spread

544
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:36,729
between the two.

545
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,770
So always make sure that that balance is maintained.

546
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:43,713
And speaking of ecosystems, if you are crunched for time.

547
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,963
Assume that that rolls onto your collaborators as well.

548
00:25:47,484 --> 00:25:49,847
You need to be aware and be honest about the way

549
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:52,130
that the project is going, the way that the studio is feeling,

550
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,752
the way that individuals are feeling,

551
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:56,135
and you need to find solutions early whenever you can.

552
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:59,139
And finally, to really reiterate this,

553
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,326
good collaboration requires understanding of the work and empathy for those who do it and

554
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:11,412
anything you know anything less than that anything that doesn't feel as good as that is truly

555
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:18,520
genuinely not worth the pain so thank you and good luck good luck

556
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,250
I think we might, we can do questions.

557
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,491
I think we have five minutes, right?

558
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:33,231
Yeah, about five minutes.

559
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:35,072
If you wanna go up to the microphone,

560
00:26:35,152 --> 00:26:36,632
I think it's, so that Kim can hear it.

561
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:39,793
And if we don't have time for all questions,

562
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,934
we have a breakout room after.

563
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:42,854
Testing, okay.

564
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:43,514
Hi. Hi.

565
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:45,555
Yeah, I've got maybe an odd question.

566
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:49,216
Other than being like a World of Warcraft guild leader,

567
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:53,017
do you know of any software that teaches good

568
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:55,117
team and task collaboration skills?

569
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:58,955
Video game software specifically.

570
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:04,919
I think nothing that necessarily teaches that that I can think of off the top of my head.

571
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:10,803
But I think that the, for me, the thing that's been most valuable in terms of how to manage client collaborations

572
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:15,727
has been to use genuinely like happiness and well-being as a metric and to...

573
00:27:16,347 --> 00:27:19,470
to realize that that is fundamental to the work.

574
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,311
I think a lot of the time, especially in contract situations early on,

575
00:27:22,612 --> 00:27:23,472
there's this temptation to say,

576
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:25,474
okay, well, this is frustrating, I'm hurting,

577
00:27:25,494 --> 00:27:27,815
but I'm a contractor, I have to keep this work, I have to do this thing.

578
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:30,397
And to say, well, I'm just dealing with this stress,

579
00:27:30,437 --> 00:27:32,118
I'm just dealing with this bad feeling.

580
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,680
And that spreads to a team.

581
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,941
That spreads very easily to a team.

582
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:41,463
the biggest help has been just examining how are people feeling in this space,

583
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:43,043
and how can I address that?

584
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:46,444
Because the second that you start paying attention to, I think, the flow of those emotions,

585
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,985
the flow of that power and the way that people are feeling

586
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:50,466
and the way that people are being handled,

587
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:53,706
you can start to, I think, get a better picture of what needs to be done.

588
00:27:54,147 --> 00:27:55,907
Because ultimately, even as a contractor,

589
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,568
the way that I think about deliverables sometimes is not,

590
00:27:59,128 --> 00:28:01,549
what is this deliverable, when is it due, why am I going to panic about it?

591
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:06,571
What value does this have to the person or team I'm giving it to, and how do they feel about it?

592
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:11,073
The urgency is often determined by the energy.

593
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,274
And I think that that's kind of something.

594
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:17,196
So I would even generally like to start looking just towards community building

595
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:21,277
and the ways that communities work, and then start applying that to the models of collaboration.

596
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:25,619
So just quickly then, happiness for the contractors and the team

597
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:27,500
would probably equate to quality of the work.

598
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:29,273
Absolutely, absolutely.

599
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,433
Because I think you can get work of a certain quality no matter what.

600
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:32,573
Right.

601
00:28:32,593 --> 00:28:35,694
You can beat work or people that's happened.

602
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:36,354
It's awful.

603
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:36,554
Right.

604
00:28:36,774 --> 00:28:39,615
I think the games industry is very, very happy to do that a lot of the time.

605
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:43,276
But I think fundamentally when it comes to building a team that lasts, to building a

606
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:46,617
team that you want to stay with and to keeping a bunch of people, especially as

607
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,217
contractors, for me, that's very important, right.

608
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:52,418
To have those relationships, that kindness is necessary to.

609
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:54,724
any development at all.

610
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:58,346
And, you know, if you reach a point with someone who really does have that

611
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:02,549
knowledge, who has enough experience, that, that line that they can draw, that

612
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:03,870
boundary they can put down is very firm.

613
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:08,093
You know, and I think that it's, it's, it's, it's all, it all comes down to, are

614
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:08,894
we having a good time?

615
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:09,955
Is there joy being created here?

616
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:11,015
Is it worth it?

617
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:11,776
And it has to be.

618
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,865
Okay, thank you.

619
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:16,807
We're gonna go there first, I think he was there first.

620
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:18,288
Oh, thank you.

621
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,690
I just have a short remark because my company's

622
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,892
actually built exclusively on collaborators

623
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,334
and I wanted to share my experiences with that.

624
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:27,075
First off, thank you for the talk

625
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:29,357
because I can really agree with everything that you said.

626
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:36,147
And my experience was at the beginning very scary because I had intentions to include my collaborators

627
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:40,773
and I wasn't sure whether they actually want to be included or whether they just want to make money and then just go.

628
00:29:41,374 --> 00:29:44,539
And we had in the beginning these discussions with the meetings, like there were like...

629
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,040
let's not do too many meetings.

630
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,941
I was like, oh, let's see whether that works out.

631
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:50,843
And I just wanna share, it actually worked out great

632
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:53,484
and my collaborators actually love working

633
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:55,125
and being included everywhere

634
00:29:55,185 --> 00:29:57,026
and I can only encourage everyone here,

635
00:29:58,107 --> 00:30:02,710
try to hire collaborators and integrate them

636
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,271
as well as possible into your team.

637
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:06,732
Absolutely, thanks for sharing.

638
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:09,574
Yes, next question.

639
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:11,083
Hi, thanks for the talk.

640
00:30:11,483 --> 00:30:14,484
I was wondering if you have tips on how to decide beforehand

641
00:30:14,744 --> 00:30:18,206
what is going to be a good collaborative relationship,

642
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:19,227
if you have a way of like,

643
00:30:19,707 --> 00:30:22,148
tips of how to assess whether a company's

644
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:22,968
gonna be a good fit.

645
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:28,028
Um, I think it's...

646
00:30:28,068 --> 00:30:29,209
Yeah, I'm happy to speak to that.

647
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,069
For me, it's a...

648
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:34,530
One, anything can change, right?

649
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,970
Like, leadership can change, and there's no way...

650
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,371
There's no surefire way to say it, but I think that

651
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:42,111
at the outset, it's been very, very important for me and for us

652
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:45,212
to establish our values very clearly, and to say that, like,

653
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:47,053
this is something that's going to have to happen,

654
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,133
and to be very outright about the way that

655
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:51,053
I don't just perceive this work,

656
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:53,714
but that I perceive the work of games, that I perceive...

657
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:59,619
this industry. For me at this point, if I can't be honest when I'm meeting a Sweet Baby client for our team

658
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:04,903
about the fact that this industry is broken, then I don't think that's going to be a positive relationship.

659
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:11,689
But it took me several years of being in the position of relative comfort in this industry to even be able to bring that up.

660
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:18,795
Because I think that if right now we don't see the problems, if they don't see the systemic issues that are going to be holding us back,

661
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:22,333
then I don't know that there's a collaboration that can even

662
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:23,655
happen in an equitable way.

663
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:27,000
So it's about value matching and making sure

664
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,665
that that perspective is the same beyond even the work

665
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:31,969
and technical matching, I think.

666
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,191
Thanks.

667
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:34,072
Thank you.

668
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:38,168
Hello. Thank you for the talk. I really appreciate it.

669
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:40,069
I wanted to dig a little bit into...

670
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:41,390
You were talking about integrate?

671
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,031
Yes.

672
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:45,512
So, you know, just having experiences with, you know,

673
00:31:45,552 --> 00:31:47,573
where narrative is trying to be structured into the game,

674
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:50,695
it's like, hey, you're making this narrative, let's play test it, you know?

675
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:53,817
And sometimes contractors are working a bit earlier.

676
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,217
It really depends when that's available.

677
00:31:55,237 --> 00:31:57,759
Do you have any thoughts about what kind of structures are useful

678
00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:00,160
for integrating narrative in a way that's successful?

679
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:04,970
I think the most important thing is to, as contractors, it's really hard to learn every

680
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,011
specific engine and project and how integration happens.

681
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:13,253
So having somebody on your end as a client who is able to integrate the work is always

682
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:14,293
very, very helpful.

683
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:17,534
And sometimes it's impossible and that's okay, but to be upfront about it and say, okay,

684
00:32:17,554 --> 00:32:17,694
well.

685
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:19,996
We don't have the resources to integrate right now,

686
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:22,600
so the calendar will match when we can integrate,

687
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,682
knowing that your second pass will happen

688
00:32:24,702 --> 00:32:25,703
when we can integrate.

689
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:28,147
That recording will happen after you've done a second pass,

690
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:30,830
making sure that the calendar reflects

691
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,973
the actual capabilities of the project

692
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:35,095
to integrate the work inside the engine.

693
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:39,419
Yeah, and I should add also that design documents and stuff can be immensely helpful in that way.

694
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,644
I think that the aim is mostly to ensure that the contractor has the same perspective on the integrated gameplay as you do.

695
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:50,987
So if you don't have integrated gameplay, that's okay because that means that we're still aligned.

696
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:56,391
It's more that a lot of the time, because the team is working together very intimately and very connected,

697
00:32:56,772 --> 00:33:00,414
they have kind of an invisible knowledge that the contractor doesn't.

698
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:04,858
And so being able to kind of package up and provide that knowledge in a build, in a design breakout,

699
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:08,364
something like that means that your contractor gets armed the same way as your team.

700
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:09,306
Cool.

701
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:09,786
Thank you.

702
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:10,528
Appreciate it.

703
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,930
Oh, hi.

704
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:12,431
How are you?

705
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:13,787
Hi.

706
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:17,350
Thank you so much, first of all, for having this talk.

707
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,252
I feel like, especially at GDC, it's

708
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:22,715
so easy for the industry to get caught up

709
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:24,837
in this cycle of back padding about,

710
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:27,359
here's this game that was so successful,

711
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,881
and here are our staff designers that are talking about it.

712
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:33,264
And then all of the hundreds of people

713
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,685
that have been collaborators on it

714
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,547
aren't credited in any meaningful way.

715
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,853
I noticed that, like, especially impacting, like, creators of color, creators of marginalized

716
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:46,253
genders.

717
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:55,339
Do you have any, like, impactful strategies or frameworks that you can advise people to

718
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,162
engage with the subject of labor accreditation in any meaningful way?

719
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:07,076
I think for accreditation it's an uphill battle right now.

720
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:12,878
I think industry-wide it's a huge push, but for me, the only thing I can do is advocate

721
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:18,219
for it, and on any team, even before the question is asked, I often try to...

722
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,551
soft discuss it the same way that I would talk about.

723
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:24,433
I want to know genuinely, like a lot of the time,

724
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:26,194
what the team's perspective is on the industry.

725
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:29,996
What a team's perspective is on the issues that we suffer.

726
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:33,138
I want to know what they feel about accreditation

727
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:33,839
at the outset.

728
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,841
I think that's something important to really discuss

729
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,942
and also to make sure that it's in the contract,

730
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:41,904
in areas especially where you don't trust that.

731
00:34:42,004 --> 00:34:43,265
No matter the team, no matter how kind,

732
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:45,106
no matter what anything, having that on paper

733
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:47,087
is super important and means that.

734
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,982
you know, you will be guaranteed a place on this.

735
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:52,188
But I think largely, yeah, largely for me,

736
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,895
the biggest fight to have or the biggest way to advocate.

737
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,287
is to do it at the outset before any work even begins.

738
00:34:57,547 --> 00:35:00,229
Is to treat it the same way that you would treat

739
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:03,471
any kind of relationship where, at the beginning, right?

740
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:06,493
For me, that rule of dating that I've always heard

741
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:08,314
but hated is like, well, you don't discuss this,

742
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:09,335
you know, don't discuss politics,

743
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:10,436
don't discuss this, don't discuss that.

744
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:12,778
For me, it's like, no, any kind of relationship

745
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:14,899
that I enter into is gonna be really, really,

746
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:17,181
you know, colored by that person's perception.

747
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:19,202
Because I'm not just coming in as a writer,

748
00:35:19,282 --> 00:35:22,304
I am coming in as Kim Bollier, a black writer.

749
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:26,289
who is from this background, who has this company, who has this team.

750
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,054
And I don't... all that enters into the world for me.

751
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:34,740
So I have to make those safeguards before I can even consider anything else.

752
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:39,046
So I think always having that... finding advocates, like finding people.

753
00:35:39,226 --> 00:35:41,149
I'm always happy to have those talks.

754
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:45,065
Folks like myself in the industry, people who are there,

755
00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:47,027
I'm happy to have that.

756
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:49,228
But advocacy and community are the most important parts,

757
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:51,250
fundamentally, and then just bringing that up

758
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,171
to any client I think that matters.

759
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:54,152
Awesome.

760
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:55,313
Thank you so very much.

761
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:55,913
Thank you.

762
00:35:57,594 --> 00:35:58,895
I'm just gonna check if,

763
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,577
I know it was supposed to be, can we keep going?

764
00:36:01,457 --> 00:36:01,677
Yeah?

765
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:02,518
All right, cool.

766
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:04,840
So, one quick question.

767
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,941
When it comes to collaboration, as you mentioned,

768
00:36:07,422 --> 00:36:09,803
scope changes a lot throughout the process.

769
00:36:10,597 --> 00:36:13,979
and there are times where because of scope being limited,

770
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,501
we have to cut out some things.

771
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:18,022
Yes.

772
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,543
In terms of cutting content

773
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:22,704
that has been worked on by a collaborator,

774
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:26,747
when do we really communicate that and how?

775
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:29,648
Like what is the best way to approach that communication?

776
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:32,758
I think with kindness.

777
00:36:32,778 --> 00:36:34,398
This just happened to us.

778
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:39,119
With kindness and with understanding that despite their role outside being external

779
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:44,241
to the team, the work was valuable and the work was, meant something to them.

780
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:47,802
And I think, you know, the reality, yeah, the reality of the scope is that sometimes

781
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:52,403
things don't make it in, but I think the importance of any situation like that is to realize who's

782
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:52,923
losing something.

783
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,830
and that it's not just, you know, it's easy to say,

784
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,930
like, we had to make that on our site,

785
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,911
it was a production decision,

786
00:36:58,311 --> 00:36:59,832
but it was a creative decision to that person.

787
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,553
And I think just approaching with that knowledge

788
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:03,774
and say, hey, look, you did work,

789
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:05,955
you're still valued, and we're gonna credit you for it.

790
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:07,676
It got cut for scope reasons,

791
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,697
and we understand how painful it is,

792
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,798
but, you know, we want you to be prepared for that.

793
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:16,360
And I think that, for me, is the only thing we can do,

794
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,442
because there are realities, you know, that we can't change.

795
00:37:20,182 --> 00:37:21,363
And I think we just have to talk around them.

796
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:26,051
I also want to add, if you can involve your collaborators in those decisions, in what

797
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:30,939
needs to be cut, if the scope concern is we need to cut X number of minutes from this

798
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:34,464
game as narrative collaborators, we can help you find the best minutes that won't

799
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:38,626
completely undermine a lot of the structural work

800
00:37:38,646 --> 00:37:39,946
that we've done for the narrative of your game.

801
00:37:40,347 --> 00:37:43,028
I know from the project perspective,

802
00:37:43,048 --> 00:37:44,669
it might be easy to go,

803
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:47,311
well these are the easiest ones to cut for us,

804
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:49,072
but then it might make your narrative way worse.

805
00:37:49,192 --> 00:37:51,053
So always try to involve your collaborators

806
00:37:51,073 --> 00:37:51,814
in those discussions,

807
00:37:52,054 --> 00:37:52,954
and be upfront about like,

808
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:55,476
this is why we need to cut this content,

809
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,598
and any information you have for us is appreciated.

810
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:00,499
Okay, thank you very much.

811
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:00,959
Thank you.

812
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,941
I don't know who was first.

813
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:06,621
I'm going to bounce around.

814
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:06,981
Hi.

815
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:07,041
Hi.

816
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:11,064
First off, thank you very much, Kim, David.

817
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:15,548
I had no offense to any other presenters this week,

818
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:17,410
but for me personally, this may have

819
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,572
been the most beneficial and valuable seminar I've attended.

820
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:21,954
Thank you.

821
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:26,938
And speaking from a contractor outside of the game development

822
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:27,398
industry.

823
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:36,442
My question for you guys is do you think that the end goal or the real solution for a lot

824
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:42,005
of the problems that you're talking about and you're having occur within the industry would be

825
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:50,629
more control or rather more implied control and a seat at the table of product

826
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:53,730
and project management and development down the road?

827
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:55,531
Yes.

828
00:38:56,393 --> 00:39:04,996
100 percent. So, second part to that, I'm sorry, but would be, wouldn't the representation

829
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:10,798
of the contractors within the industry in and of itself be the key point and solution

830
00:39:10,978 --> 00:39:17,460
to that end goal? Yeah, I think so. I think that that's, you know, that kind of advocacy

831
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,101
and representation is super important, and I think that.

832
00:39:21,177 --> 00:39:27,740
Hopefully within years our industry will be better at that and I think that's like reform on a very very large level.

833
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,843
And I think until until then that that is why for me like a lot of these these channels are like having communities of contractors

834
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:42,925
having these open discussions having you know for for us we made a company that is essentially a contract a contractor.

835
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:45,512
filled with full-time folks.

836
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:49,155
And that has allowed us to have a certain measure

837
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:51,758
of freedom of movement because of that size.

838
00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:53,679
But I think that all that says to me

839
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:56,522
is that that's what we need on a huge macro level.

840
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,464
And it's something that, yeah, I think we could,

841
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,506
I could talk about this for a very long time,

842
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,187
but I do think it's the only,

843
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:06,029
moving towards a world in which there is more.

844
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,992
And I think there's more room for representation, it's huge.

845
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,042
You mentioned control, and I think that that might be one of the issues.

846
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:14,444
It's not so much about control, it's about influence.

847
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:17,967
It's about being able to have the conversation at the moment where it needs to happen,

848
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:23,031
as opposed to then having to assert some sort of control to be able to rectify the situation.

849
00:40:23,511 --> 00:40:27,054
It's about not being afraid to let those people in the room who...

850
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:29,716
you need to let in early on.

851
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:32,497
Well, the key to that is honestly leverage.

852
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:33,918
Yes.

853
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:36,900
And speaking from a categorical industry

854
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,882
where our contractor base does have that leverage,

855
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:43,023
that's going to be a key point.

856
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:43,363
Yeah.

857
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:45,164
So thank you all very much.

858
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:45,584
Thank you.

859
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:46,385
Thank you.

860
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:47,725
This will be the last question.

861
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:48,646
Sounds good.

862
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:56,440
Okay, thank you. I come from a country where game development is still advancing,

863
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:03,925
so I feel like I shouldn't give me the luxury of rejecting jobs just because they are not healthy.

864
00:41:04,606 --> 00:41:12,611
And I am lucky enough to be in a position where I can teach them healthy relationships with game developers,

865
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:14,493
because they are not used to it.

866
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:18,806
You guys are like the hammer analogy you said.

867
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:25,376
So my question is how to tackle this with my clients?

868
00:41:25,436 --> 00:41:28,841
How can I teach them these healthy relationships?

869
00:41:30,263 --> 00:41:31,785
So I think it's.

870
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,083
It's going to be, it's always a battle, right?

871
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,145
Because I think that fundamentally,

872
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:39,566
I believe in what you're doing,

873
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:40,967
and I will do it as well, right?

874
00:41:41,027 --> 00:41:43,108
I think that it's always worth going to the table.

875
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:46,490
My rule is that I will always show up at the table

876
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,110
for that discussion.

877
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,052
If someone is being, especially someone who's holding power,

878
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:53,433
is being challenging, is having an issue,

879
00:41:53,473 --> 00:41:55,274
and I have the strength, advocacy, and safety,

880
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:58,656
to be able to say, okay, I'm going to sit in this room and have that conversation.

881
00:41:59,057 --> 00:41:59,857
I'm always going to do it.

882
00:42:00,137 --> 00:42:03,419
I think it's important to challenge that power.

883
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,421
It's important to ask them the very tough questions.

884
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:11,344
You know, for me in narrative, a lot of the time that question is just like,

885
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,986
okay, you've asked me here to write a black character.

886
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:17,969
And the question I can ask that's very challenging for a lot of people to answer is,

887
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:19,429
why did you make them black?

888
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:23,884
Just that. And that question is going to give me the information that I need.

889
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:28,127
So I think it's about not necessarily teaching them, but interrogating them and

890
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:32,570
having them explain to you the framework by which they are currently working, the

891
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,452
framework by which they are currently behaving badly.

892
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:38,955
And then it falls back to you, I think, to decide, is this a person who can be taught?

893
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:43,038
Is this a person who is whose framework allows for a change of opinion or a change

894
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:44,158
in in behavior?

895
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:47,450
Or is this a person who cannot be changed?

896
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,832
Because I think that's the line, right?

897
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:50,794
It's, there's a line that we don't,

898
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:53,698
especially, you know, coming from the background that I do,

899
00:42:54,259 --> 00:42:56,281
there's a lot of stuff that I've had to just deal with.

900
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,123
I've had to just eat this a lot of stuff and go,

901
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:00,086
okay, that has to happen.

902
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:00,466
But.

903
00:43:01,508 --> 00:43:06,471
what I have never benefited from was a situation that was purely detrimental.

904
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:12,394
At a certain point, I have to be able to know that I can create shields, guards, and structures

905
00:43:12,414 --> 00:43:15,616
that will keep me safe despite how bad things are on that other side.

906
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:22,500
So I think it's, yeah, always go to the table, always ask them questions about their perspective

907
00:43:22,981 --> 00:43:24,101
and let their...

908
00:43:25,277 --> 00:43:27,919
Answers determine whether that fight is even worth having.

909
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:31,441
And then when you are having that fight, I think it's just important to just always remember that

910
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:35,983
this is about people. This is about bringing people into a situation. And this is about,

911
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:43,808
if you want to have access to humans, you have to be human. And I think that's the core factor,

912
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:47,309
because eventually there will always be a point that...

913
00:43:48,522 --> 00:43:51,804
you should leave in and that it is unhealthy

914
00:43:52,044 --> 00:43:54,025
on a way that cannot be mitigated.

915
00:43:54,485 --> 00:43:56,827
And I think that the challenge is finding

916
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:58,948
where that level sits for you specifically.

917
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:00,549
I think a good metric to use,

918
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,631
and being able to walk away is a privilege.

919
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:10,056
But at the same time, if as a contractor you're juggling multiple contracts and one of them is hurting your other contracts,

920
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:14,159
this is a good sign to start having those conversations and start making those decisions.

921
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:22,064
Because if your whole stock as a creator is falling, and your energy levels are falling because of one specific challenge,

922
00:44:22,804 --> 00:44:25,346
then that affects you more than it affects them.

923
00:44:27,347 --> 00:44:28,408
Okay, thank you very much.

924
00:44:28,548 --> 00:44:28,848
Thank you.

925
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:29,509
Thanks, everybody.

926
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:33,512
I don't know if it's needed. I'm going to be in the breakout room for like, I don't know, 30 minutes or something.
