1
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:06,992
Thank you very much for coming.

2
00:00:07,612 --> 00:00:10,773
So my name is David Enason, and I'm a senior project lead

3
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,814
of player experience at CCP Games.

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,775
I've been with CCP for 11 years now,

5
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:18,015
and I want to tell you about one of the most interesting

6
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:20,156
challenges that I worked on in this time,

7
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,477
an exploit named Ghost Training.

8
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:25,598
Now, EVE Online has a lot of legacy.

9
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:28,118
The game is actually turning 15 later this year.

10
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,219
So to make sure you have all the necessary context,

11
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,940
I'm going to start with a crash course

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,040
in internet spaceships.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,660
So what is EVE Online?

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,020
Well, first of all, there's possibly as many answers

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,761
to this question as there are EVE players.

16
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,921
EVE is a pretty complex game,

17
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:46,101
and it has a multitude of different play styles.

18
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:48,062
It's also a very competitive game.

19
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:50,482
Now, if you ask me what EVE is,

20
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:54,543
I'd say that at its core, EVE is a game of economics.

21
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:58,264
The way I see it, EVE's player-driven economy

22
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:01,324
is what gives meaning to all player achievements in EVE,

23
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:03,624
and I consider it to be the most important

24
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:04,945
core system of the game.

25
00:01:06,386 --> 00:01:12,170
Virtually every mechanism and system in the game, directly or indirectly, touches the economy in some way.

26
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:16,873
You could say that the rest of the game is essentially built on top of it,

27
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:21,576
and whether they realize it or not, our players interact with the economy in every game session.

28
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:27,520
Now another core system which every EVE player interacts with in pretty much every session

29
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:31,863
is the skill training system, EVE Online's unique real-time progression system.

30
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:35,186
Last but not least, EVE is a single-shard game.

31
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:38,389
Everyone is playing together on the same shared global universe.

32
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,492
Let's talk a little bit more about the economy.

33
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:46,236
So first off, most items in the game are manufactured

34
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:47,797
and sold by the players themselves.

35
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:49,819
This includes the spaceships they fly,

36
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:53,021
the weapons and mining lasers they equip to their ships,

37
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:54,863
and the ammo that they shoot at pirates.

38
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:57,125
It even includes the space stations

39
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:58,466
which they dock their ships at.

40
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:01,739
There's also no soulbound items in EVE.

41
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,480
Every item in EVE is tradable.

42
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,722
If you get tired of a shit, just sell it to the highest bidder.

43
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,303
Now, to facilitate trades,

44
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,164
we have a dynamic player-driven market broker system.

45
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:15,265
It works sort of like a stock market,

46
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:19,727
where players create buy orders and sell orders.

47
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:22,468
There's not just one market either.

48
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,510
Each space station in the game has its own unique market.

49
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,572
So in other words, there's no central auction house in EVE.

50
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:34,868
Instead, market hubs form organically based on the landscape of the universe.

51
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:39,790
Every day, there are around 1 million transactions made by players on the market.

52
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:46,774
So again, the market is a player-driven ecosystem, and it's not regulated by CCP in any way.

53
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:52,556
Since we don't set the price or a price range for any item, their value is determined by

54
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:55,958
the players themselves and simple economics, supply and demand.

55
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:02,194
Now as an example, an in-game war can increase demand for certain spaceships

56
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,535
and in turn make their prices skyrocket all over the universe.

57
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:10,516
The outcome of conflict is also sometimes even determined by attrition.

58
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:12,416
Whoever has the biggest pockets wins.

59
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:16,417
All in all, the market system is also deep enough

60
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:19,738
that there are some EVE players who never undock their ships from stations.

61
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:22,698
All they do is sit in stations and play on the market.

62
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:28,648
Also another important thing of note is that EVE has permanent asset loss.

63
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:32,931
Any item in the game can be destroyed or stolen by other players.

64
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:36,612
If a player's spaceship is destroyed, it's gone forever.

65
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:41,735
And depending on a dice roll, items carried on the ship can either be destroyed or dropped as loot.

66
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:46,117
Dropped items can then be stolen by any player that's in the area.

67
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:50,199
And it's because of this that the number one rule, often quoted by EVE players,

68
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,780
is to never fly what you cannot afford to lose.

69
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,655
Now on one hand, permanent asset loss keeps the economy healthy,

70
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,878
since there's always new demand for new ships and items.

71
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,462
On the other hand, it makes PvP combat very consequential

72
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:10,026
and makes it important to always have capital on hand to replace lost assets.

73
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:15,030
Now, EVE is primarily a PvP game, and at the end of the day,

74
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,894
the most meaningful achievements in the game often come at the expense of another player.

75
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:25,161
A staple economy is in other words a critical component to keeping EVE balanced.

76
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,164
Let's talk about character progression.

77
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,947
So progression in EVE is based around training skills.

78
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:43,519
Skills unlock new functionality such as flying new ship classes and they also offer various bonuses such as increasing weapons damage or reducing broker fees on the market.

79
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:47,676
Now, skill training is performed passively and in real time.

80
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,378
Players don't even have to be logged into progress.

81
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:52,999
Training continues while you're logged out of the game.

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,000
Now, depending on the skill, they

83
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,721
can take anywhere from a couple minutes

84
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,243
to over a month of real-world time to train.

85
00:05:01,263 --> 00:05:04,325
And players also have access to a training queue, which

86
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:06,086
can be used to queue up and train

87
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:07,406
skills in the preferred order.

88
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:09,107
The training queue looks like this.

89
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:17,713
This is actually one of my characters, and as you can see on the slide, I've got skills queued up for the next 122 days.

90
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:23,095
Some of these skills take a relatively short time to train, while other more advanced skills take longer.

91
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:29,557
As an example, the skill on the bottom, Capital Repair Systems, is going to take me 33 days to train.

92
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:34,278
From a lore standpoint, it works sort of like in the film The Matrix.

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,261
In order to learn, data is downloaded into the character's head.

94
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:43,083
It just tends to take quite a bit longer to learn Kung Fu than it took Neo.

95
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:50,106
I'm not sure exactly why that is, but my thought is that maybe there's just no fiber optic connections in Eve.

96
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,747
Now, Eve has no set character classes.

97
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:57,928
Players are free to progress in any direction they choose.

98
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,214
It's common for players to specialize in certain areas such as combat or industry,

99
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:06,696
but there are also other players who choose to be jacks of all trades.

100
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:13,319
Access to high-end skills is gated by requiring prerequisite skills.

101
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,140
Here is an example.

102
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,762
In order to train this skill, which is a battleship skill,

103
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:22,504
you must first train your character to fly cruisers and battlecruisers.

104
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:27,987
The speed of a character's training can also be influenced by in-game means.

105
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:32,305
There's in-game items for one, such as performance-enhancing implants,

106
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,225
and there's also an attribute system.

107
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:37,726
Now, the biggest effect on a player's speed of progression

108
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:40,607
is however decided by whether you play for free

109
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,148
or pay for your subscription, which brings us to clone states.

110
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:49,130
Now, clone states are our version of open access slash free-to-play,

111
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,710
which was launched in November 2016.

112
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,491
Free-to-play users are called alpha clones,

113
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:57,032
and paid users are called omega clones.

114
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:02,339
Converting to paid status grants perks and lifts various restrictions.

115
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:08,542
As you can see on this slide, most of the benefits of a paid account concern skill training or character progression.

116
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:15,825
The perks include doubling the training speed, which significantly speeds up progression.

117
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:20,987
Alpha clones are also limited to a certain pool of skills, which you can think of as a level cap of sorts.

118
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:26,260
At the time of the Ghost training exploit, the pool of skills available to alpha users

119
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,722
was approximately 5 million skill points, which is the equivalent of around 5 months

120
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:32,923
of skill training at maximum speed.

121
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:37,605
Alpha users are also limited to a 24-hour long training queue.

122
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:42,647
So as you can imagine, doubling the speed of training and bypassing the skill restrictions

123
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:46,268
are by far the most important drivers for free-to-play conversion.

124
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:52,031
So on the subject of free-to-play and paid access, Plex is worth a mention.

125
00:07:53,030 --> 00:08:00,093
So PLEX, or Pilot's License Extension, is an in-game item representing Omega Time, which can be bought from CCP.

126
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,595
This item behaves exactly like any other item in the game.

127
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:10,258
It can be sold on the market, and it can also be destroyed or stolen by other players if you're not careful.

128
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:16,780
PLEX also enables Omega conversion with in-game cash, known as ISK or ISK.

129
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:24,462
With enough ISK, an alpha user can upgrade their account to Omega status by buying PLEX on the market from another player.

130
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:34,870
Now, since PLEX is bought for real-life money and traded on the in-game market, we can also establish an exchange rate of sorts between real-life money and ISK.

131
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:42,075
And since all items in the game are also tradable, we can in a roundabout way assign a real-world value to items in the game.

132
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:45,497
This is how we reach dollar values in headlines like this.

133
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:49,462
That being said, Plex is a one-way street,

134
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,023
and real money trade is strictly prohibited in EVE.

135
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:55,684
So numbers like this are largely theoretical.

136
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:59,065
Now the last game system I'm going to cover

137
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,225
is skill trading.

138
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:04,587
In early 2015, we added new items to the game

139
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,148
called skill extractors and skill injectors.

140
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,789
These items facilitate trading of skill points.

141
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,310
So skill points and in turn character progression

142
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,490
are in other words, an in-game commodity.

143
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:20,252
Skill extractors are bought from CCP for real-life money,

144
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,992
and when a skill extractor is activated on a character,

145
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:25,693
it consumes 500,000 skill points

146
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:27,554
and is turned into a skill injector.

147
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:30,074
A skill injector, on the other hand,

148
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:32,355
grants up to 500,000 skill points

149
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:33,895
to a character when it's consumed.

150
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:37,656
Now, these two items essentially enable conversion

151
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:40,197
of character progression to ISK and vice versa.

152
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:43,277
So as you can imagine, they've become an expensive

153
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:45,198
and very heavily traded commodity.

154
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,462
They have also created very clear overlap between EVE Online's two core systems,

155
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:52,983
the economy and character progression.

156
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,064
So what have you learned about EVE Online?

157
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:59,906
We've established that the economy is the central game system

158
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,187
which ties everything together.

159
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:05,589
We've also established that EVE is primarily a PvP game

160
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:08,190
where great wealth confers great advantage.

161
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:12,693
And we've established the free-to-play conversion is largely driven

162
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:15,694
by enhanced character progression available to paying users.

163
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,903
Finally, wealth is somewhat interchangeable with progression in EVE due to the skill trading system.

164
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:25,445
Now let's talk about the ghost training exploit itself.

165
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:32,989
So what is the ghost training exploit?

166
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:42,093
In short, it was a bug which enabled a non-paying alpha user to obtain pretty much all of the benefits of a paid Omega user.

167
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,895
You could in other words go from this to this.

168
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:51,406
You could get double training speed with no skill or training queue restrictions,

169
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:53,447
no Omeka subscription required.

170
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:57,828
Unfortunately, the repro steps were fairly simple as well,

171
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:01,149
making this exploit highly susceptible to abuse.

172
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,210
Let's go over the repro steps.

173
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,952
To trigger the bug, you had to fulfill the following requirements.

174
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:11,592
Have an account with Omeka status active.

175
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:14,733
Set a long skill queue. The longer it is, the better.

176
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:19,184
Let the account's Omega subscription run out and lapse to alpha.

177
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,566
Wait for a few months without logging into the game.

178
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:26,868
And finally, upgrade to Omega status first before logging in.

179
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:31,490
The result of doing this is that after logging in at step 5,

180
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:36,073
the user skill training progressed as if the account was in paid Omega status

181
00:11:36,353 --> 00:11:40,975
for the entire absence in step 4, no matter how long that absence was.

182
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:46,398
You could also potentially chain the exploit, moving straight back to step 1 after step 5.

183
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:53,720
Also keep in mind that since PLEX can be purchased for in-game money and used to activate Omega status,

184
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,681
real money payment wasn't actually necessary to trigger either step 1 or step 5.

185
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:05,023
One thing of note that I want to highlight is that unlike most exploits we've dealt with,

186
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:09,644
the Ghost Training exploit had a direct effect on both our game and on our business.

187
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,225
On one hand,

188
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:14,688
it undermined the integrity of the game's economy.

189
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:18,231
By abusing the exploit and utilizing skill trading,

190
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:21,052
a player or an organized group of players

191
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,074
could get very, very rich.

192
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:26,556
On the other hand, it compromised our newly launched

193
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:27,336
free-to-play model.

194
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,718
With knowledge of the bug, a player

195
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:32,420
could effectively bypass the restrictions of a free account,

196
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,321
removing much of the incentive for converting to paying

197
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:35,702
status.

198
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:39,204
So what made all of this possible?

199
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:40,405
Well.

200
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:44,426
When we identified the root cause, it came down to two factors.

201
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:48,228
The first is how skill training is handled in the back end.

202
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:54,452
Skill training progress isn't calculated or recorded while the user is logged out of the game.

203
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:58,454
Instead, a calculation is made when logging into the game,

204
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:02,977
and it's at this point that any progress made while offline is recorded to the DB.

205
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:14,972
Now I know this isn't a perfect analogy, but since the real state of an offline character's training isn't determined until after logging in, I like to call it shredding or skill training.

206
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:21,434
Now the other root cause of the exploit was a critical bug in our free-to-play implementation.

207
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:31,877
We basically wrote a new system which is independent of the EVE DB to manage clone state entitlements. You can think of these entitlements as expiry dates.

208
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:36,235
We call the system CIS, which stands for Customer Information

209
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:36,595
System.

210
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,558
In short, and keep in mind that this

211
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:41,059
is a little bit of a simplification,

212
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:43,881
the bug can be boiled down to a communications issue

213
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,242
between CIS and the EVE DB.

214
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,585
Let's look at a couple hypothetical scenarios.

215
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:53,747
In this first example, our user stopped playing

216
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:55,228
in the third week of January.

217
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:58,191
And as you can see on the slide, their last login

218
00:13:58,431 --> 00:14:00,352
was about three days before running out

219
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:01,273
of Omega subscription.

220
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:09,050
This user logged back into EVE in the final week of February while still in Alpha state and then upgraded to Omega the next day.

221
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:17,474
On this first login after the five-week absence, the EVE DP asked CIS for the user's Clone State entitlement.

222
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:21,735
And the answer given is, this account's Clone State is currently Alpha.

223
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:27,598
Now as far as the DP is concerned, the account's last known Clone State is Omega.

224
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:35,435
Since there's a discrepancy, the game checks for the Omega expiry date before calculating skill training between these two logins.

225
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:44,137
So the end result is basically that the character is credited with the remaining three days of Omega training time and 24 hours of Alpha training time.

226
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,598
In other words, everything worked as it should.

227
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:51,599
Things, however, did not go planned in this second example.

228
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,920
It's essentially identical to the first scenario, with one key difference.

229
00:14:57,848 --> 00:15:04,410
After taking a five-week break, the user upgraded to Omega before logging into the game.

230
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:12,993
So on this first login after the break, the EVE DB asks CIS for the same clone state entitlement as before.

231
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:17,795
The answer given is that this account's clone state is currently Omega.

232
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:23,176
Now according to the EVE DB, the account's last known clone state is also Omega.

233
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:25,617
Now since there's no discrepancy...

234
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:29,788
The DP just assumes that the account was in Omega state for the whole time,

235
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:32,008
so despite having lapsed to Alpha,

236
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:35,429
the user is credited with five weeks of Omega skill training time.

237
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,470
The user has, in other words, ghost trained.

238
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,871
Do you think that Schrodinger's cat analogy is starting to make some sense now?

239
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:49,252
But the repro steps were fairly specific,

240
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:51,092
and in order to pull off the exploit,

241
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:52,812
you had to stay locked out of the game.

242
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:56,206
So who did we think was actually exploiting this bug?

243
00:15:57,346 --> 00:16:01,468
Well, our main concern was about what EVE players call skill farms.

244
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:03,870
So what's a skill farm?

245
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,173
Well, as we covered before, skill injectors became a very valuable commodity

246
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:14,676
after skill trading was introduced, and some clever players noticed an opportunity.

247
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:21,549
The idea was to create dedicated characters to train, extract and sell skill points for a profit.

248
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:24,331
And this turned out to be a great money-making idea.

249
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:31,836
Now most players who operate skill farms do so essentially for free by maintaining their Omega subscription with Plex.

250
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:38,400
And when properly set up, a skill farm can turn a really high profit even after calculating the cost of Plex.

251
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:45,145
There is one drawback though. Operating a skill farm is very time-consuming and labor-intensive.

252
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:49,424
They don't scale particularly well regarding time spent.

253
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:54,367
However, by exploiting the ghost training exploit,

254
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:57,789
the operating cost in Plex could be greatly reduced.

255
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,850
And since the user didn't constantly

256
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,072
have to extract and sell skill points to fund more Plex,

257
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:05,913
the process also became less labor intensive.

258
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:09,255
It was basically a win-win situation.

259
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,317
Less time spent, more profit.

260
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:14,678
But skill farms weren't the only thing

261
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:15,679
we were concerned about.

262
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:17,416
Let's look at the timeline.

263
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:22,300
So the bug was introduced on November 15th, 2016.

264
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:26,984
Now at this time, we did receive a handful of reports

265
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:28,725
and support tickets and bug reports

266
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:30,126
about the ghost training exploit.

267
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,429
But the repro steps were regrettably unknown until later.

268
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,071
In other words, we knew it was possible

269
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:38,153
under certain unknown circumstances

270
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:40,495
to train Omega skills as an alpha user.

271
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:43,457
But what we didn't know is that it could be triggered

272
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:45,118
on purpose and so easily.

273
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:50,149
So the problem therefore didn't get the attention it deserved and flew under the radar.

274
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,011
Fast forward to May the following year.

275
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:58,434
A post is made on Reddit which exposes the easy-to-follow repro steps.

276
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,858
That's when we realized we had a major issue on our hands.

277
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:06,432
So this threat, which was posted on May the 12th,

278
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,192
got a lot of attention.

279
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:11,333
And other threats popped up in the following days

280
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,254
with various theories and speculation

281
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,175
about who might have benefited from this exploit.

282
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,916
To be quite honest, our players were furious with us,

283
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:23,876
and rightfully so.

284
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:26,877
It had, after all, taken us over six months

285
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:28,097
to address this problem.

286
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:30,258
So now, on top of everything else,

287
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:33,178
we were faced with a massive PR problem.

288
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:38,475
In retrospect, we really should never have let this happen.

289
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,217
But on the bright side, we've looked at this as a learning opportunity,

290
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:46,280
and we've already addressed the internal processes which failed and allowed this to happen.

291
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:48,721
But back to the timeline.

292
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:52,904
So in early June, we deployed the first iteration of a fix.

293
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:58,027
First thing first, we ran a DP script as a stopgap measure.

294
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:03,050
This script parsed skill training for characters likely to be ghost training.

295
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:08,666
The idea was that since the setup to make the expert work takes roughly around a month,

296
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:12,468
the script would put an end to any current abuse in progress,

297
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:15,229
since a permanent fix could be deployed in that time.

298
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,010
Now while the intent was solid,

299
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,491
the script actually ended up causing us more problems than it solved.

300
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:24,212
Now this is an important detail.

301
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:29,714
Players can normally only pause skill training while logged into the game.

302
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:35,647
And this is also an action which causes skill training progress to be recorded in the game DP.

303
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:40,010
The script, however, did not force a login event,

304
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,413
meaning that the CIS system did not provide the game DP with a clone state update.

305
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:52,318
Now remember that any account potentially ghost training must be lapsed to alpha in CIS

306
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:56,240
and must have been in omega state during the player's last play session.

307
00:19:57,581 --> 00:20:00,243
That was basically the criteria we were targeting with the script.

308
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:05,036
Now, since these characters hadn't logged in yet, their

309
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:08,536
Omega to Alpha lapse had not been communicated to the DB.

310
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:10,957
Do you see where this is going?

311
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:13,297
Let's look at the repro steps again.

312
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:15,498
These were the five steps.

313
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:19,359
Be in Omega state, set a long training queue, lapse to Alpha

314
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,219
state, and stay logged out for a few months.

315
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,900
Lastly, make sure to upgrade to Omega before logging in to

316
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:28,741
ensure the DB thinks the account was in Omega state

317
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,242
during the absence in step four.

318
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:34,305
Now what the script essentially did was bypass step five.

319
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,246
Thanks to Schrodinger's skill training,

320
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:40,087
any character who had reached the fourth step

321
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,568
when we ran the script essentially goes strained

322
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:44,409
without having to fulfill step five.

323
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,630
Now as you may imagine,

324
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,271
this greatly increased the number of characters affected

325
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:51,952
since the fifth step was by far the most obscure one.

326
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:55,574
The first four steps are actually not an uncommon pattern

327
00:20:55,974 --> 00:20:57,955
for a player who's just taking an extended break

328
00:20:58,015 --> 00:20:58,455
from the game.

329
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:02,718
Additionally, there was a bug in the script itself.

330
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,659
We paused skill training for far more characters

331
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,499
than we intended.

332
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:09,340
Over 200,000 characters, actually.

333
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,861
Many of these characters were even active,

334
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,862
and most certainly not ghost training.

335
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,783
So this in itself caused quite a bit of drama

336
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,024
on top of the whole ghost training situation.

337
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:23,146
But now, shortly after we ran the script,

338
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:26,607
the relevant stakeholders sat down to discuss the next steps.

339
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:32,030
Fixing the underlying bug had naturally already become our top priority,

340
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,934
and we also immediately committed to addressing damage caused to the economy

341
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:38,575
by heavy abuse of the exploit.

342
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:43,199
At this point in time, however, we had no concrete data available yet

343
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:44,940
regarding the extent of the abuse.

344
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:48,203
What we did have were the results of a manual review

345
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:51,546
by our player experience team of a few prominent skill farms.

346
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:55,769
This investigation validated that there were indeed some players

347
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,771
who were greatly benefited from the exploit.

348
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:03,030
Now armed with this knowledge combined with the repro steps being fairly simple,

349
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:07,354
it was easy for us to conclude that the potential for abuse was very high.

350
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:12,038
There was really never a question of if we'd address the damage, but how.

351
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:15,661
So we explored the options available to us.

352
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:21,766
The preferred option was naturally some form of automated solution such as a DP script.

353
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:26,770
Maybe we could automatically revert ghost trained skills to an untrained state.

354
00:22:28,404 --> 00:22:31,185
This option was, however, ruled out after some debate.

355
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:34,006
For one, it was inherently risky.

356
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,887
We were, after all, talking about character progression,

357
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:39,748
a system we prefer not to mess with at all

358
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:40,649
if it can't be avoided.

359
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:43,830
It didn't help either that we were coming fresh

360
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,591
off that other DB script, which went terribly wrong

361
00:22:47,091 --> 00:22:50,612
and had already anchored some legitimate players.

362
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:54,594
We were also concerned about the possible negative effect

363
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,235
of removing prerequisite skills.

364
00:22:57,328 --> 00:23:02,270
In the worst case scenario, doing so could potentially render the game practically unplayable.

365
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,471
Take for example a hypothetical user who ghost trained for three months.

366
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:12,113
Now imagine that this player returned to the game and played for another three months,

367
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:14,894
legitimately training skills for that whole time.

368
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,836
If we automatically removed ghost trained skills from this player,

369
00:23:20,476 --> 00:23:25,018
it could and most likely would render many of the legitimately trained skills unusable.

370
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,540
We had some other concerns, but these were the main ones.

371
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,340
So long story short, we weighed our options

372
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,741
and found out that an automated solution

373
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:34,961
was not going to work,

374
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:38,142
because it had far too much potential to cause problems.

375
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:42,143
In the end, I volunteered to lead a team

376
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:45,344
which would attempt to address the worst damage manually.

377
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:51,245
Now, I've told this story a few times in private settings.

378
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:55,426
And at this point, I often get asked the question, why?

379
00:23:56,397 --> 00:23:57,857
Why go through all that trouble?

380
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:01,980
There's already a commitment to fix the bug,

381
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,601
so this won't happen again.

382
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:06,202
Why not just leave things as they are?

383
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,304
Now that's a valid question for sure,

384
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:12,686
and I totally understand that manually addressing the damage

385
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:16,328
seems like it could be a lot of effort with unproven payoff.

386
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:20,090
First and foremost, though, we felt responsible

387
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:23,132
for cleaning up this mess that we ourselves had created.

388
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:29,088
Letting the exploit exist in our game for over six months was our mistake,

389
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:32,431
and there was a strong collective feeling within the company of having

390
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,214
let our players down. We intended to set things right.

391
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:42,598
Furthermore, we see ourselves not just as game developers, but caretakers of a

392
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:46,021
universe. It may sound a little cheesy, but the

393
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,303
EVE universe has taken on a life of its own,

394
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:52,826
and we see it as our responsibility to protect the integrity of the game.

395
00:24:54,517 --> 00:24:58,640
It also simply just felt like the right thing to do.

396
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,582
As caretakers of this universe, or space janitors if you will,

397
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:06,284
we always make an effort to have as little direct influence

398
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:08,565
on the political landscape of the game as possible.

399
00:25:09,105 --> 00:25:12,147
It's our job to create the systems which drive conflict,

400
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:14,548
not to interfere with what the players are doing.

401
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,991
We also see it as our duty to ensure a clean and level playing field

402
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:19,931
for all of our players.

403
00:25:20,637 --> 00:25:26,699
It's a big taboo for us to directly give a player or a group of players an advantage over their enemies.

404
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,022
The way we basically saw it is that we'd be overlooking a massive potential advantage

405
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:37,923
given to a select number of players if we let things stay as they were,

406
00:25:38,243 --> 00:25:39,824
and that just didn't sit right with us.

407
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:43,945
But that's not to say we had our work cut out for us.

408
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:48,547
First thing first, we needed data on who exactly had benefited.

409
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:52,525
So one of CCP's expert data analysts went to work.

410
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:55,146
Sometime later, he emerged from his cave

411
00:25:55,506 --> 00:25:58,947
with a list in spreadsheet format of individuals

412
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,888
who had benefited from the exploit.

413
00:26:02,248 --> 00:26:04,449
Now, I scrubbed some player identifiable data

414
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:07,009
and removed some other sensitive information,

415
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:08,730
but this is what the list looked like.

416
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,751
Each row on this spreadsheet shows a single individual,

417
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,992
the amount of skill points that goes trained.

418
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:19,227
and on how many different characters the training took place.

419
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:24,651
The list is also sorted so the most severe abuse is visible on the top of the list.

420
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:29,714
Now, as we had suspected, there were indeed people who had benefited massively.

421
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:33,616
The person at the top of the list, for example, had ghost trained on over 300

422
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:38,619
different characters and in total obtained more than 1.2 billion skill points.

423
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,223
That's the equivalent of about 50 years of skill training at the fastest possible

424
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:45,844
speed for Omega users.

425
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:49,940
And as you can imagine, that's a whole lot of free money

426
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,002
when it's converted to skill injectors

427
00:26:52,142 --> 00:26:53,043
and sold on the market.

428
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,726
So now we had the data we needed,

429
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,868
and the numbers confirmed a massive amount

430
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:00,069
of skill points had been ghost-trained.

431
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:03,852
Thankfully, there was a little bit of a silver lining.

432
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:05,273
These skill points were spread

433
00:27:05,313 --> 00:27:06,934
across tens of thousands of accounts,

434
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,056
and the vast majority of those accounts

435
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,838
hadn't ghost-trained enough skill points

436
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,339
to be of much significance.

437
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:16,866
If you ask me, it's probably because many of the users who

438
00:27:16,906 --> 00:27:18,747
go strained did so because of the script,

439
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:21,529
and they didn't have long training queues set before the

440
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:22,510
lapse to alpha state.

441
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,432
That being said, there were over 100 people who had

442
00:27:26,532 --> 00:27:29,194
obtained absolutely massive benefit, and they

443
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:30,035
had to be addressed.

444
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:33,377
Now let's backtrack a little bit.

445
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:36,819
While the data was being gathered, I sat down and

446
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:39,501
created a standard procedure which our team would follow

447
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:41,022
once we had the necessary data.

448
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:44,960
Now we've dealt with our share of exploits in the past,

449
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,921
and I saw no need to reinvent the wheel.

450
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:49,182
The procedure was therefore modeled

451
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:51,243
to be quite similar and consistent

452
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:55,185
with our approach to serious game exploits in the past.

453
00:27:56,806 --> 00:28:00,348
Now, I assumed that any player who'd greatly benefited

454
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:03,489
from the exploit would most likely have abused it on purpose

455
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,391
and the action plan was therefore largely geared

456
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:07,832
towards punitive action.

457
00:28:09,132 --> 00:28:10,153
Let's go over the procedure.

458
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:14,373
The first step was establishing intent.

459
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:19,457
Did the player intend to abuse the exploit, or did they benefit unintentionally?

460
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:27,443
In the case of intentional abuse, the next step was to find out what had happened to the Ghost Train skill points, following the money, if you will.

461
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:32,687
We basically foresaw two possible scenarios for these cases.

462
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,950
The skill points would either still be in the character's head,

463
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:40,313
or they'd been extracted and likely already sold on the market for profit.

464
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:45,303
In case of unintentional benefit, no action was to be taken.

465
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:49,046
This was because I didn't expect any accidental abuse

466
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:50,827
to be massive in scale.

467
00:28:51,808 --> 00:28:54,910
Nevertheless, I did instruct the team to keep an eye out

468
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,112
for massive unintentional benefit,

469
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:00,213
just on the off chance that it was there.

470
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:03,476
If they came across any such cases,

471
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:04,896
they were to note them down

472
00:29:05,237 --> 00:29:06,778
and discuss them with the rest of the team.

473
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:13,600
Finally, the importance of context was stressed regarding the level of punitive action taken.

474
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:20,044
Things such as attempts to hide the abuse or hide the trail of laundered benefits were to be

475
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:26,168
considered. The intent behind this was to be a bit more lenient towards those who perhaps didn't

476
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:31,532
quite realize that they were breaking the rules. Furthermore, some leniency was also to be given

477
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:33,653
to players who proactively turned themselves in.

478
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:40,630
Now the action plan itself was also broken down depending on what happened to the Ghost

479
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,410
Train skill points.

480
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:48,152
We intended to issue a permanent ban to any Skillform account still in possession of the

481
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:49,153
Ghost Train skill points.

482
00:29:50,073 --> 00:29:55,215
The idea was that Skillform accounts had probably been created just to abuse this exploit anyway,

483
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:59,537
and the damage could therefore be contained by closing these accounts down.

484
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:02,543
The player's main accounts, on the other hand,

485
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:04,744
were to be suspended on a three-level scale,

486
00:30:04,764 --> 00:30:08,105
14-day, 30-day, or permanent bans,

487
00:30:08,165 --> 00:30:09,565
depending on the player's history.

488
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,866
The permanent bans were reserved for those

489
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,887
that were involved in prior exploit abuse.

490
00:30:16,768 --> 00:30:19,268
Now, in case of skills having already been extracted

491
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:20,849
and circulated on the market,

492
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:23,430
the approach was to be pretty much the same,

493
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,631
with the added caveat that ISK, or assets,

494
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:29,972
should be confiscated to account for profit.

495
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:35,745
This confiscation was to be done from the players' main accounts.

496
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:41,688
We didn't actually have a concrete plan for players who had benefited unintentionally.

497
00:30:42,668 --> 00:30:48,871
Again, I didn't really expect we would come across many or any accidental abusers near the top of the list,

498
00:30:49,552 --> 00:30:52,893
so we were just going to cross that bridge if we got to it.

499
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:58,076
I just didn't see a need to create a process in advance for non-existent cases.

500
00:30:59,342 --> 00:31:04,626
So in summary, establishing intent was the first step of the manual review process and

501
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:06,528
a primary theme of the investigation.

502
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:12,172
We intended to go through each individual on the list and take action according to what

503
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:13,553
had happened to the proceeds.

504
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:20,378
Now that we had all the data we needed and the process, it was time for the team to start

505
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,078
investigating.

506
00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:26,173
I instructed the team to not take any action for the first few days.

507
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:31,015
The order of business was to only review and mark the users in the worksheet

508
00:31:31,235 --> 00:31:33,496
without any direct action taken just yet.

509
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:37,778
The idea was that these investigations would likely be complex

510
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,721
and we might learn a lot along the way. So in interest of ensuring a

511
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:47,523
consistent approach, I wanted the team to be well familiarized with any possible

512
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:50,625
nuances before taking punitive action.

513
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:55,689
The thought was also that if for some reason we had to change our approach,

514
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,710
it's much easier to do so before directly involving the player.

515
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,111
Now this turned out to be a very good call.

516
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:08,512
Now once we got started, the team held daily regroups

517
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:12,253
for about half an hour each day. On the second day

518
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:15,774
it became apparent that many of our assumptions

519
00:32:16,094 --> 00:32:17,574
had been completely wrong.

520
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:25,436
So contrary to our expectations, the majority of players didn't appear to have abused the exploit on purpose at all.

521
00:32:26,597 --> 00:32:32,662
On one hand, we had underestimated how easy it was to accidentally fulfill the criteria for the exploit.

522
00:32:33,963 --> 00:32:38,487
On the other hand, we had underestimated the effect of the skill queue passing script.

523
00:32:39,468 --> 00:32:45,613
In hindsight, I'd estimate that around 80-90% of the people on our radar benefited unintentionally.

524
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:52,299
The team also noted that many of the top offenders weren't actually operating skill farms,

525
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:54,779
another assumption which turned out to be wrong.

526
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:59,080
Now, our expectations had been shattered,

527
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,561
but the fact remained that while these players had benefited unintentionally,

528
00:33:03,961 --> 00:33:07,961
the scale of the benefits was far too large for us to look the other way.

529
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:13,342
We, however, also knew that the standard procedure wasn't going to be fair.

530
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:16,123
It was way too focused on punitive action and banning.

531
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:18,914
So we went back to the drawing board.

532
00:33:20,594 --> 00:33:24,436
To be quite honest with you, we were a bit lost at this point.

533
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:28,217
We thought we were getting into a fairly routine investigation,

534
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:30,297
but that wasn't the case at all.

535
00:33:30,997 --> 00:33:31,978
So we brainstormed.

536
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:38,259
In the end, we decided to shift our focus to confiscation of benefits instead of bans.

537
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,761
Bans were to be used only as a last resort in cases of clear and very serious abuse.

538
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:50,456
So we had our starting point. We knew what we wanted to do, but we didn't quite have the how nailed down yet.

539
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:57,378
We knew that chasing down and confiscating assets in every case would be extremely time consuming.

540
00:33:57,998 --> 00:34:01,619
Far too time consuming to be realistic for a problem of this scale.

541
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,800
Communication was also a concern.

542
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,542
If we removed assets or money out of the blue, it was bound to cause player confusion and frustration,

543
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:14,423
which could result in support tickets and increased load on the support team.

544
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:23,195
So being mindful of these concerns, we decided to proactively contact the beneficiaries of the exploit.

545
00:34:24,076 --> 00:34:28,860
The idea was to give a transparent, clear and honest explanation of the situation

546
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,103
and appeal to the players' cooperative side in order to set things right.

547
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:37,107
So what we did is send an email to the players on our list.

548
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,450
This email began by explaining what the Ghost Training exploit is.

549
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,826
It also clearly stated that while we were fairly certain it was done unintentionally,

550
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:52,513
they had benefited to way too large a degree for us to ignore.

551
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:58,682
We also made it clear that we did not intend to issue any kind of ban or account suspension.

552
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:04,557
The message we sent also included the exact number of skill points costrained by the player

553
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:07,958
and highlighted the ISK value of these skill points.

554
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:13,700
In other words, the potential value or potential profit which could be obtained by selling

555
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,340
these skill points.

556
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,702
Overall, the tone of the message was apologetic, making it abundantly clear that we considered

557
00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:27,564
this primarily an issue of our own making, a mistake which we sincerely regretted but

558
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:28,504
needed to set right.

559
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:36,245
Finally, we ended the email by offering a choice to the player on how to set things right.

560
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:43,088
Three different options were proposed. The first option was to hand over the sum of ISK

561
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:48,951
already highlighted as the potential profit gained from the exploit. The player could also

562
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:54,114
choose to hand over assets, any number of in-game items which represented the same value.

563
00:35:55,478 --> 00:36:03,987
The last option was for players to manually extract the Ghost Train skill points with skill extractors provided by CCP.

564
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:09,572
This last option was mainly intended for players who hadn't extracted the skill points yet.

565
00:36:11,354 --> 00:36:14,937
Now players were furthermore not limited to just one of these options.

566
00:36:15,137 --> 00:36:16,799
They were able to mix and match at will.

567
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:26,947
And to establish confidence in our data, we gave a copy of the same data that we were using to calculate the potential profit to any player who asked for it.

568
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:32,128
So how did it go? In fact, it went really well.

569
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:38,969
Most of the players showed a great deal of understanding that the benefits of this exploit had to be removed.

570
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:46,951
The vast majority of the contacted players were quick to respond with their preferred option, cooperating with us throughout the whole process.

571
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:53,269
Now we certainly did speak to a handful of frustrated players, but there were far fewer

572
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:56,852
encounters of this kind than we anticipated based on our past experiences.

573
00:36:57,452 --> 00:37:00,374
We expected far more resistance than turned out to be the case.

574
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:04,317
Overall, this approach turned out to be a major success.

575
00:37:05,177 --> 00:37:09,240
To put a number to this success, we looked at the results of our Customer Satisfaction

576
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,583
Survey, or CSAT, which was sent to each contacted player.

577
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:18,807
Now the way we structure our CSET survey is a were you satisfied, yes or no question.

578
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:25,550
Now by the end of this process, we found that over 80% of players who answered the survey chose yes.

579
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:35,014
Now considering that these ratings weren't for traditional support tickets, but cases where we were removing money from the player,

580
00:37:35,574 --> 00:37:37,795
we found this percentage to be extremely high.

581
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,976
We also had a pretty decent response rate of 21%.

582
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:49,311
Now to put these percentages into context, our overall CSET score for 2017 was 91.16%.

583
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:58,359
It's a fair bit higher for sure, but again consider the difference between a support case and these ghost training communications.

584
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:01,601
So why did it work?

585
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:08,327
Well, I personally for the most part attribute the success to honest and transparent communication.

586
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,084
I believe that by making it clear from the get-go that this was a result of our own mistake

587
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:18,668
and that we didn't intend to issue bans, we managed to break down the us-versus-them

588
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:23,572
barrier and set a positive and cooperative tone to the conversation.

589
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:31,279
You could also say that within that initial communication, we managed to subvert the player's

590
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:31,980
expectation.

591
00:38:33,016 --> 00:38:37,039
There is somewhat of a perception of heavy-handedness within our playerbase,

592
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:41,642
and after seeing the word exploit in the subject of an email from CCP,

593
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:47,727
the initial expectation may have been that we take a shoot first and ask questions never approach.

594
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:51,049
That, of course, didn't turn out to be the case.

595
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:56,373
Now, I also believe that offering players the choice of how to proceed

596
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,795
played a critical role in making this a success.

597
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:05,555
Being directly involved in the solution rather than being dictated to by the space police

598
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,758
was something our customers genuinely appreciated.

599
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:15,322
We even had a few examples of players explicitly thanking us for being in touch,

600
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:20,346
since they most certainly didn't want anything to do with an unfair advantage.

601
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:28,051
So again, this was overall a major success and we definitely made some serious mistakes.

602
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:31,187
maybe even a series of serious mistakes,

603
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,788
but we managed to make the best of a bad situation.

604
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:36,369
And we made sure to learn from these mistakes

605
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:39,009
and use these learnings to address problems

606
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:40,470
on many fronts of our company.

607
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,550
Now let's backtrack a little bit

608
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,371
and talk about potential profit.

609
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:49,232
So we talked a lot about the potential profit

610
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:52,293
which goes to train skill points represented in ISK.

611
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:55,674
How did we determine and calculate this value?

612
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:57,794
The answer is skill trading.

613
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:02,306
Since skill points are extracted and sold on the market in increments of 500,000,

614
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:08,630
skill trading enabled us to assign a monetary value to each such increment.

615
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:13,232
First, we looked at the in-game market value of a skill injector

616
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:15,734
and subtracted the value of a skill extractor.

617
00:40:17,155 --> 00:40:20,337
This difference represented the potential profit made

618
00:40:20,457 --> 00:40:23,519
from each 500,000 skill points goes trained by a player.

619
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,200
Now at the time of our investigation,

620
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:34,667
Skill injectors cost 740 million ISK and skill extractors cost 350 million ISK,

621
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:37,708
which is a difference of 390 million ISK.

622
00:40:38,308 --> 00:40:42,829
And that is the ISK value we assign to each 500,000 skill point increment.

623
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:46,690
Now to put these numbers into context,

624
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:52,071
it takes an Omeka user approximately 8 days to train 500,000 skill points

625
00:40:52,371 --> 00:40:53,971
at the maximum possible training rate.

626
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:58,628
So in one month, a character can at most train approximately 2 million skill points.

627
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:05,633
Now, Plex representing one month of Omega game time costs 19.99 US dollars.

628
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:13,758
At the time of the Ghost Training exploit, this amount of Plex was worth a little over 1.4 billion ISK on the game's market.

629
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:19,642
With these values, we can also assign a dollar value of 5.44 US dollars to 390 million ISK.

630
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:27,886
Again though, keep in mind that since ISK cannot actually be legally traded into real money,

631
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:30,328
these numbers are largely theoretical.

632
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:35,091
It does make for a fun thought experiment though.

633
00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:38,294
For example, remember the number one player on our sheet?

634
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:45,139
He goes train around 1.2 billion skill points with a potential profit value of about 960 billion ISK.

635
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:45,960
Using this conversion...

636
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:53,776
the skill points heco strain were worth about 13.4 thousand US dollars.

637
00:41:56,398 --> 00:42:00,821
Now you may have noticed that there's a bit of a flaw in the options that we gave to our players.

638
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:05,284
If skill points can only be extracted in increments of 500,000,

639
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:11,249
how did we treat skill points which exceeded 500,000 but didn't reach the next million?

640
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,552
Now that's a great question and here's a real example to illustrate.

641
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:22,129
This is another spreadsheet which we made in order to visualize ghost training done by a single individual.

642
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:27,191
This is actually the same spreadsheet we gave to players if they asked for a copy.

643
00:42:28,912 --> 00:42:34,354
Now the player in this example, and this is a real example, ghost trained on 14 different characters.

644
00:42:34,514 --> 00:42:39,957
And as you can see in column C, some of his characters didn't even cross the 500k threshold at all,

645
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:43,059
while the other characters had varying amounts of excess.

646
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:47,384
Now, how did we deal with this?

647
00:42:48,305 --> 00:42:49,245
The answer is simple.

648
00:42:49,546 --> 00:42:51,167
We let them keep the excess.

649
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:54,929
It was a compromise which left us sweet in the deal

650
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:57,591
a little bit as a token of our appreciation

651
00:42:57,871 --> 00:43:00,372
for the player's understanding and cooperation.

652
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:04,215
So in other words, this player in this example

653
00:43:04,335 --> 00:43:07,537
goes trained around 37.7 million skill points

654
00:43:08,057 --> 00:43:10,539
with a potential profit value of 29.25 billion ISK.

655
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:19,180
However, when we add up only skill points in increments of 500k, the total is 34.5 million

656
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,763
skill points trained, and the potential profit goes down to 26.9 billion ISK.

657
00:43:24,444 --> 00:43:29,226
So all in all, this particular player got to keep about 8% of the proceeds.

658
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:34,730
For other users, the excess generally accounted for between 5 and 10%.

659
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:46,042
Now we considered this to be an acceptable compromise, which also no doubt contributed to players walking away relatively satisfied.

660
00:43:47,843 --> 00:43:57,407
Now to be consistent, we also extended this leniency to the ISK and ACID confiscation options, and this was all communicated in our initial correspondence to the player.

661
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:04,350
Now I want to show you some stats which sum up our actions during the investigation.

662
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,582
First off, we looked at a lot of users.

663
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:12,066
We investigated 6036 unique characters,

664
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:15,128
which were operated by 119 different people.

665
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:19,272
We permanently banned 796 accounts

666
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:21,514
operated by 23 different individuals.

667
00:44:22,635 --> 00:44:23,996
In terms of in-game money,

668
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:28,039
we removed a total value of just over 8 trillion ISK

669
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:28,820
from the economy.

670
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:31,422
To put this value into context

671
00:44:31,562 --> 00:44:33,244
using the same calculation as before,

672
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:38,627
A trillion ISK corresponds to just under 112 000 US dollars.

673
00:44:39,768 --> 00:44:45,614
If left in the game, this amount of ISK would definitely have given a very significant advantage

674
00:44:45,654 --> 00:44:51,319
to the players involved. Now I also thought it would be interesting to look up some customer

675
00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:52,781
retention and revenue stats.

676
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:57,484
What I discovered is that seven months after the investigation concluded,

677
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:02,509
57.85% of the accounts with an active Omeka subscription

678
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:05,932
during the investigation still had an active subscription.

679
00:45:07,593 --> 00:45:09,975
I also looked at Omeka game time purchases.

680
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:12,458
In this same seven month time frame,

681
00:45:12,898 --> 00:45:16,241
the accounts we investigated made a total of 6,531 game time purchases.

682
00:45:20,113 --> 00:45:22,314
Now some of these purchases were for multiple months.

683
00:45:22,855 --> 00:45:27,237
In total, 7,456 months of Omega game time

684
00:45:27,618 --> 00:45:28,798
were bought by these users.

685
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:32,681
Now I unfortunately wasn't able to determine

686
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:34,822
the currency used for each purchase,

687
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:37,504
but these months represent a revenue

688
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:40,666
of just under 140,000 US dollars or euros.

689
00:45:41,146 --> 00:45:43,868
And this is after accounting for bulk purchase discounts.

690
00:45:45,594 --> 00:45:50,679
Now keep in mind that while this isn't necessarily a large amount of number in the large scheme of things,

691
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:56,605
this is revenue we would definitely have lost if we'd gone with a trick-or-happy and ban-heavy approach.

692
00:45:57,907 --> 00:46:03,933
Also keep in mind that it's revenue from just 119 different people in a seven-month period,

693
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:05,835
or just under 1200 US dollars per user.

694
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:12,835
It's pretty clear to us that the users in question have a very high customer lifetime value,

695
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:16,377
which further justified the time spent on our investigation.

696
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:23,779
I also believe that this is yet another indicator of our approach, largely having been perceived

697
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,941
positively by the players involved. Many of them are still playing after all.

698
00:46:29,762 --> 00:46:33,563
But what did we learn from this experience that can help us in the future?

699
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:37,265
Now, I know it sounds like common sense,

700
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:44,924
but the most important learning for us was just how important open and honest communication is to player satisfaction.

701
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:50,549
We were honest and we took responsibility for letting the exploit stay in the game for too long.

702
00:46:51,089 --> 00:46:52,590
Our players appreciated this.

703
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:58,114
We also strongly highlighted the purpose of removing the benefits of the exploit,

704
00:46:58,595 --> 00:47:00,436
which was protecting the integrity of the game.

705
00:47:01,457 --> 00:47:05,040
The players involved understood and agreed with this principle.

706
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:11,289
Our eyes were also open to just how important first impressions are.

707
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,170
Far more important than we realized before.

708
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:19,212
Now in the past we've been pretty reactionary when it comes to

709
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:23,273
explaining the purpose and reasons for our actions.

710
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:27,315
This time around we made both the why and the how clear

711
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:33,597
up front before taking any action. So basically rather than making this into

712
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:36,238
one-sided rule enforcement situation.

713
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:40,538
We established a personal and human dialogue right off the bat,

714
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:45,260
and this greatly increased the likelihood of a collaborative relationship.

715
00:47:46,641 --> 00:47:49,802
I'm pretty confident that the player's perception would have been far worse

716
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:52,783
had we shot first and asked questions later, or never.

717
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:58,705
Now, we also learned that directly involving the player in the solution

718
00:47:58,945 --> 00:48:00,785
can be great for customer satisfaction.

719
00:48:01,616 --> 00:48:05,579
The player is much more likely to be invested in what's happening,

720
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:07,700
and with increased buy-in by the player,

721
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:12,044
the chance of a mutually understood and agreed solution is much higher.

722
00:48:13,565 --> 00:48:17,107
Last but not least, and somewhat tying the rest of the points together,

723
00:48:17,448 --> 00:48:22,891
we validated just how important direct and human engagement with our customers is.

724
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:30,611
In fact, we got the idea of offering a choice to the player and letting them extract skill points on their own

725
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:34,032
after talking to the player in the number one spot on our spreadsheet.

726
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:42,816
So before I continue the story, I want to show you a letter of appreciation which was sent to us by this player

727
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:45,817
and a CSAT survey result from another player who goes train.

728
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:51,608
I'm not going to read them out loud, but I think they really underline how appreciative

729
00:48:51,968 --> 00:48:54,468
these players were that we engaged with them to this extent.

730
00:48:56,129 --> 00:49:01,170
Now to make a long story short, the player in the number one spot contacted us proactively.

731
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:06,091
He basically came forward about having obtained benefits from this exploit.

732
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:12,072
Now remember when I said that we felt a bit lost before we found our final approach?

733
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:16,333
During this time, I was engaged in a conversation with this player.

734
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,782
He gave his side of the story, which showed that while he had benefited a lot,

735
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:23,363
it had been unintentional.

736
00:49:24,444 --> 00:49:29,846
I made it clear that he'd benefited to far too large a degree for us to ignore,

737
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:34,889
but that I wanted to work with him to find as painless a solution as possible.

738
00:49:35,749 --> 00:49:37,990
So I floated some ideas and he responded.

739
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:40,992
I floated more ideas and he responded again.

740
00:49:41,672 --> 00:49:43,393
He even floated some ideas on his own.

741
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:49,575
Now after talking for a couple of days, we decided together to try the skill extraction method.

742
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:58,504
Now this individual expressed clear appreciation that we were willing to work with him and proposed various different solutions.

743
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:07,834
Based on our interactions with this guy, we got the idea to give everyone else a choice of the bat and making manual skill extractions as one of those choices.

744
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:11,997
So the point of the story is, engage with your players,

745
00:50:12,457 --> 00:50:15,439
even if the subject matter is inherently unpleasant.

746
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,361
If I hadn't done so, we probably would have settled

747
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:21,543
for a much less customer-friendly approach.

748
00:50:23,424 --> 00:50:24,585
Now, this is the final slide,

749
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:27,607
and as a closing comment before we go to Q&A,

750
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:30,749
I want to leave you with a few points on areas

751
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:33,751
I think we as an industry can grow in.

752
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,272
I believe there's a lot of room

753
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,674
for improving communication with our customers.

754
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:43,946
To achieve this, I recommend focusing on increased honesty and transparency.

755
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:49,770
Take responsibility for your missteps, such as bugs and exploits, and do so publicly.

756
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:53,372
Also put down that ban hammer whenever possible.

757
00:50:54,993 --> 00:51:00,116
Let's also improve engagement by increasingly involving the customers in the things that we're doing.

758
00:51:01,036 --> 00:51:03,758
Ask them for feedback on how they would like things to be done.

759
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:09,044
Present them with choices when you're deciding between a few predetermined options.

760
00:51:10,265 --> 00:51:13,726
This may of course not always be possible, but it's worth keeping in mind.

761
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:16,047
Apply it when the situation allows for it.

762
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:22,129
Also, none of this necessarily has to be in a crisis or customer service setting either.

763
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:27,072
It could be a thing like letting players vote on a few different options for a balancing change.

764
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:31,230
Now, these were the main points that I wanted to get across today.

765
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,571
And I hope this talk gave you some ideas and inspired improvement

766
00:51:34,951 --> 00:51:36,551
in these areas for your organization.

767
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:41,132
Before we go to Q&A, I also want to encourage all of you

768
00:51:41,352 --> 00:51:44,692
to fill out the evaluation survey sent by GDC about this session.

769
00:51:45,653 --> 00:51:48,633
And if you can't see it in your inbox, please check your spam folders.

770
00:51:50,113 --> 00:51:52,094
So I'm now opening up the floor for questions.

771
00:51:53,254 --> 00:51:55,854
There's a couple of microphones in the middle.

772
00:51:55,874 --> 00:51:57,355
I think we have.

773
00:51:58,167 --> 00:52:00,949
time for two or three questions if there are any.

774
00:52:02,793 --> 00:52:06,734
Hi, thank you for the talk. Fascinating as so many stories from Yves are.

775
00:52:07,034 --> 00:52:07,374
Thank you.

776
00:52:07,534 --> 00:52:12,635
I am one of those people who constantly regret not having as much time as I'd like to play again.

777
00:52:13,776 --> 00:52:18,996
But I'm just curious about the whole single shard, big interconnected economy thing.

778
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:22,557
What was the third party impact of all the money?

779
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:29,258
Because you talked about solutions directed at people who still had the money or taking away something from them.

780
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:36,002
Did anyone do anything really interesting with profits, like maybe influence the war or anything like that?

781
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:39,744
So, we didn't see... That's a really great question by the way, thank you.

782
00:52:40,164 --> 00:52:48,509
So we didn't see anyone influence a war, but we did see quite a few cases where the player didn't have any of the ISK left yet,

783
00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:51,451
because they'd already spent it somewhere or tried to launder it.

784
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:55,114
and we actually went to pretty great lengths to try to track down the ISK.

785
00:52:55,455 --> 00:52:59,399
In almost every case we were able to do that, but there were a couple cases

786
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:02,622
where we just couldn't figure out where the benefits went.

787
00:53:02,922 --> 00:53:06,125
So we ended up banning the players' main accounts,

788
00:53:06,906 --> 00:53:11,310
kind of in hopes that they'd negotiate with us and tell us what happened

789
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:14,373
to get their accounts unbanned. In the end they actually didn't.

790
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:23,474
But I guess the silver lining is that none of the guys in the top 15 slots that I showed you guys before were these people.

791
00:53:23,574 --> 00:53:32,480
These were players who benefited a little bit less, maybe around 30 billion ISK, which is a lot, but not as much as 960 billion.

792
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,862
Thank you. I think you were next.

793
00:53:35,523 --> 00:53:37,384
Thank you very much for your talk. It was really interesting.

794
00:53:37,404 --> 00:53:37,704
Thank you.

795
00:53:38,945 --> 00:53:43,748
I had a question about, was there a call from the larger player community, the ones who didn't?

796
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:48,406
participate in the exploit for some type of compensation due to like just

797
00:53:48,966 --> 00:53:52,647
flustering the community or if they found out that you were kind of sweetening

798
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:55,308
the deal where people who the exploit are saying, well,

799
00:53:55,688 --> 00:53:58,589
we should get something too. And how do you handle those kinds of situations?

800
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:04,471
Well, uh, I don't remember hearing anything like that. There were a lot of,

801
00:54:05,011 --> 00:54:09,052
um, there was a lot of unrest in the player base, especially on Reddit,

802
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:13,513
where, uh, some of our most critical users are, are based. But, um,

803
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:21,652
As far as I remember, I didn't see a single ticket or a social media post asking for some

804
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:23,332
sort of compromise to other players.

805
00:54:25,113 --> 00:54:31,495
For the most part, the people who got their deal sweetened a little bit, they were guys

806
00:54:31,595 --> 00:54:36,856
that, well, they had circumstances.

807
00:54:38,638 --> 00:54:45,507
The skill points had already been extracted, the isk had been spent, so they actually had to meet us in the middle as well.

808
00:54:45,587 --> 00:54:56,021
There was one guy who had deployed a Sigtetal, which is a huge space station, and he had to take it down in order to fund the amount of isk that we needed to take away.

809
00:54:56,933 --> 00:55:02,436
So really no, the answer is no. I don't remember that happening, but it's food for thought.

810
00:55:02,496 --> 00:55:09,260
I mean, I'm sure if we had messaged out more clearly that we were sweetening the deal,

811
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,463
that players might have asked for that. This information was out there, but we didn't

812
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:17,125
like post a news item saying that, hey, we're sweetening the deal for everyone.

813
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:19,926
But yeah, good question. Thank you. Thank you.

814
00:55:23,328 --> 00:55:27,770
I was kind of wondering if you think you would have done like the same thing like an honest transparent

815
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:34,793
Communication if the community would not have figured out the exploit in the first place like is it worth it to like admit the mistake?

816
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:40,496
To your community or if they didn't figure it out, or if they don't figure it out. Do you do something else?

817
00:55:41,516 --> 00:55:47,739
Well my opinion. That's a great question by the way my opinion is I think we should be transparent because I think

818
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,580
if players

819
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:55,777
hear about the exploit from you, it's much better than the potential of them hearing about it from

820
00:55:55,837 --> 00:56:01,762
somewhere else. And in this case, the knowledge of the exploit was out in the open before we had

821
00:56:01,842 --> 00:56:07,666
made any sort of comment. And that was one of the reasons that players were so frustrated and

822
00:56:08,147 --> 00:56:13,250
upset with us. So I would say in these kinds of scenarios, if you know something went terribly

823
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:17,934
wrong, own your mistake, go out there, tell people that it happened, and tell them that

824
00:56:17,954 --> 00:56:18,695
you're addressing it.

825
00:56:19,432 --> 00:56:22,492
That way you can also control the messaging a little bit.

826
00:56:22,532 --> 00:56:25,473
You're able to basically make it clear

827
00:56:25,793 --> 00:56:27,613
that you are going to take this seriously

828
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:30,654
before the speculation on social media

829
00:56:30,714 --> 00:56:34,115
goes around like wildfire, that your company doesn't

830
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:36,415
care about the game, et cetera.

831
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:38,656
Because I think all of us care.

832
00:56:39,336 --> 00:56:40,997
It just might not always look like that.

833
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,677
And when someone's posted the thing that's

834
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,538
blown up on social media, it's really

835
00:56:45,638 --> 00:56:47,118
hard to change that message.

836
00:56:48,058 --> 00:56:49,238
So that's my recommendation.

837
00:56:50,112 --> 00:56:50,412
Thank you.

838
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,972
I wish we had taken that approach to go straining.

839
00:56:54,052 --> 00:56:54,372
Thank you.

840
00:56:54,813 --> 00:56:55,533
Really good question.

841
00:56:57,573 --> 00:56:59,814
Okay, I think we're actually right on time.

842
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:03,154
So thank you very much for attending the talk.

843
00:57:03,714 --> 00:57:05,175
Really appreciate you guys coming.

844
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:08,235
If you have any further questions in the next few days,

845
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:10,416
please don't hesitate to get in touch.

846
00:57:10,436 --> 00:57:11,636
You can find me on LinkedIn.

847
00:57:12,436 --> 00:57:15,037
Also, if you see me in the conference hall,

848
00:57:15,077 --> 00:57:17,517
feel free to poke me and we can have a chat about Eve

849
00:57:17,577 --> 00:57:19,078
or talk about this exploit.

850
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,652
Thank you very much for listening and being a great audience.
