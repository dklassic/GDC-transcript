Hi, my name is Genevieve, Senior Instructional Designer for Roblox.

2
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:10,377
At this year's GDC, I'll be talking about the design process of Roblox's Creator Challenge.

3
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:16,702
It's a self-paced tutorial we launched last year designed to show students that they too can be game developers.

4
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:22,106
I'll take you through why we created it, some of the design process, what we learned,

5
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:25,469
and how we do our best to ensure that students stay motivated.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,713
So if you want to learn about how we use dinosaurs, exploding volcanoes,

7
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:36,938
wave finding, peak-end theory, and progression curves to attract new developers to our platform,

8
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:37,959
come to my talk!
