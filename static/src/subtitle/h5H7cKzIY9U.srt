1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,374
Okay, yeah, this is us. I'm Stephen Jarrett, VP of Game Design.

2
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:13,399
This is Bob Woodburn, Director of Design Operations.

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,563
And I think we have the longest title, which is

4
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:18,027
Implementing Pixar's Brain Trust Model at King,

5
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:21,473
How It All Went Wrong, and How We May Have Finally Got It Right.

6
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:25,280
So, first give you a bit of a background about King.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,341
You know, we're from King.

8
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:28,964
These are a bunch of our franchises and brands

9
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:29,745
that you probably know of,

10
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:32,408
but we're most famous for Candy Crush, obviously.

11
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:34,791
So we got a little bit of a quiz.

12
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:37,333
Candy Crush has been played,

13
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:39,676
how many game rounds do you think Candy Crush

14
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:40,257
has been played?

15
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:41,438
You can just shout out a number.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,000
How many?

17
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,330
Two billion.

18
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:47,753
One trillion game rounds, actually.

19
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:53,518
And time spent in the game, if you added up all the time spent in the game, how long do

20
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:54,139
you think it could be?

21
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:57,061
Ten years?

22
00:00:57,622 --> 00:00:58,803
Over five million years.

23
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:07,102
So that is actually the time that humans and apes separated from a common ancestor.

24
00:01:07,923 --> 00:01:11,907
And then we have data people that obviously come up with this all the time for us.

25
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:15,811
So wall bounces, if you added up all the wall bounces for Bubble Witch...

26
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:22,714
You've got 384,000 kilometers and that's 24 times from Earth to the Moon.

27
00:01:23,294 --> 00:01:24,174
That's how much that was.

28
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:28,056
So the reason I'm talking about this is because as we all know making games is hard,

29
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:33,357
and making a great game is very, very hard, and we want to make these really successful

30
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:34,017
great games.

31
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:35,038
And so because of that...

32
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:38,601
We're looking at other studios' processes, that we're doing it right.

33
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,084
And Pixar's Brain Trust, we read Creativity Inc.

34
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:44,346
and Pixar's Brain Trust was the one that we thought,

35
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:46,348
okay, we can make this work, right?

36
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:49,131
And if you don't know what the Brain Trust was,

37
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:53,095
it's where this group of high-end directors,

38
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:56,017
like John Lasseter and a bunch of others, Andrew Stanton,

39
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:58,460
and they meet together every few months

40
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,782
to assess the kind of movie that they're making.

41
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:05,584
It's like very open, it's like, you know, like they're very honest with each other.

42
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:11,467
And I think it started round about Toy Story and they claim that it's made them have lots of really great hits.

43
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:16,609
So we did a lot of research about it and we thought it sounded, you know, this sounds really, really great.

44
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:19,811
You know, we have a lot of very experienced, passionate people at King.

45
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:26,494
We have these amazing values at King, like care and craft, creative champions, humble and open, fast and fluid, fun and friendly.

46
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,755
And we thought we can make this, make this work.

47
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:36,881
So we called ourselves the Creative Champions and we had this logo which was always good

48
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:40,725
and we had a mission and the mission was to help studios and we could be called up at

49
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:45,990
a moment an idea is conceived and we would work from the beginning of a game all the

50
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,615
way to the end of the game and we had this experience like a team of tech, game design,

51
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:52,757
UX, UI, artists and producer.

52
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:59,653
And then, like the Brain Trust, which puts smart, passionate people in a room together

53
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,314
and charges them with identifying and solving problems and encourages them to be candid,

54
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:07,536
we had a different problem with Pixar because we had studios all over the place.

55
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:12,817
So we would visit studios regularly, and then we would do these workshops and deep dives

56
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:16,938
with the teams and with the producers and the game teams.

57
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,940
And we would help solve these issues all together in a candid way.

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,920
And it felt great, great.

59
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:24,899
We can do this.

60
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,041
But trouble was brewing.

61
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:34,143
One of the biggest problems we had is the word,

62
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:37,444
we felt the word champion, like creative champions,

63
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,425
was great because it was like we're

64
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:41,006
going to champion a process, right?

65
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:42,966
We're going to champion a process, champion your teams.

66
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:44,667
But a lot of studios.

67
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:49,044
A lot of our studios, English is not their first language.

68
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:52,248
And so champion kind of meant winner, right?

69
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:53,530
And they were kind of thinking,

70
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,711
oh, who are these guys, right?

71
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,273
They're calling themselves the champions

72
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,875
and they're like these experts

73
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:58,816
and they're gonna come and help us.

74
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:02,869
And this was a typical team member that we used to come and visit.

75
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:04,229
They would like freak out and go,

76
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,049
the creative champions are coming, this is a gate.

77
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:08,010
Everyone worked like crazy to get the game ready.

78
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,091
They have the power to shut our game down.

79
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:11,831
They are the angels of death.

80
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,592
We were actually called the angels of death,

81
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,573
mainly by this guy, but other people as well.

82
00:04:20,162 --> 00:04:23,044
And it was very confusing for the creative champions as well.

83
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:26,446
They didn't even know how to define success, right?

84
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:29,609
They didn't know how to set goals.

85
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:30,970
How do you set a meaningful goal

86
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,211
when you're just going to a team

87
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,672
and then just giving them feedback?

88
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:39,035
And how did we show that we were actually adding value

89
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:40,016
to that team as well?

90
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:42,599
and why won't a team listen?

91
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,700
And that was like a real big problem, right?

92
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,121
Because you go there and you're working together with a team

93
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:49,402
and you're discussing problems

94
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:52,763
and you feel that you're putting this knowledge to them

95
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,384
and stuff and then they just don't listen

96
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:56,045
and they go off and do something else.

97
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:00,587
And then we were used by the boss peeps

98
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,569
to be sent in to like, when a team was in trouble,

99
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,349
it was always like, send in the creative champions,

100
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,990
they're help the team release.

101
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:13,480
So we kind of went from this A-team solving problems here to help,

102
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:17,206
to looking for problems and don't disappoint me,

103
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:19,530
which was complete opposite.

104
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:23,046
And it was kind of like this.

105
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:25,287
And so we had this expectation that we would support,

106
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:27,268
but we were actually a review team.

107
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:29,649
And so it wasn't working well at all.

108
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:32,970
So one year later, we thought, OK, this is terrible.

109
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,950
This is not going well.

110
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,531
So we thought, OK, we'll redo it.

111
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,791
We'll call it Creative Champions version 2.

112
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:40,052
Yes, and we still called it Creative Champions.

113
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:45,620
And we decided to, okay, we can solve some of these issues, right?

114
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,543
And we did it from the creative champions' point of view and not from the team's point of view.

115
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:58,889
So we had about five or six champions and then we assigned different game teams to that champion.

116
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,771
And we thought, okay, this is really great because, you know, like...

117
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:09,437
like Sally who's a champion, she can work with these teams and she's part of the team

118
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:13,940
but she's not totally part of the team so she can review stuff and see it from different

119
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:16,002
eyes and that kind of stuff.

120
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:17,143
We thought that was pretty cool.

121
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:21,607
But the team started getting design feedback from multiple places.

122
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:24,489
So a team normally gets feedback from game design and producer.

123
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:30,729
Then from this creative champion that was giving this ad hoc feedback every time they played a build

124
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:35,793
or they were reading documentations and giving like ad hoc feedback or they were providing

125
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:41,479
workshops and giving guidance or they attended this like scrum thing like every two weeks and

126
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:41,979
give feedback.

127
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,382
Then you would have the studio design director that would also give feedback to the team.

128
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:52,346
And then you would have the head of studio, and they would give feedback through the studio design director and actually through the producer.

129
00:06:52,826 --> 00:07:00,911
And then you have myself, the VP of game designer, who would sometimes go through head of studio, sometimes through studio design director, and then some time from assigned creative champion.

130
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:04,393
And then you had the CCO that was just like, bam, just like everywhere.

131
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:06,835
So the team was like, ah!

132
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,317
So it was like this broken system, right? So who does the team listen to?

133
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:16,266
a year was into this as well, and then we completely said,

134
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:17,587
OK, this is not working again.

135
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:19,588
But we're super fast and fluid at King.

136
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,150
So as soon as we find that something isn't working,

137
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,331
and it was the actual creative champions that actually said,

138
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,432
this is not working.

139
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,113
This is a disaster.

140
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:30,935
So we decided to completely redo it again.

141
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,418
So first we did an analysis of what is working.

142
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:40,529
When requests actually come from the team or the studio design directors or the head of studio,

143
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:46,135
that was really great because they were actually asking for information and asking for help.

144
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:51,781
So requests for workshops, so they might say we need a social workshop or we need a

145
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:55,505
workshop around level design or something like that, that worked really great.

146
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:59,408
And value was seen with helping teams get to greenlight.

147
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,408
The champions actually did help a lot of teams,

148
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,568
like solve a lot of problems,

149
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:04,449
and actually got them through pre-production

150
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:05,409
and to greenlight.

151
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:08,349
And we do these things called FQAs,

152
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,030
which Bob will talk about later,

153
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,570
which is where it's called a fun quality analysis,

154
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,551
where we actually, the team come up with something

155
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:17,051
for us to review, and then we review it,

156
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,071
and that was seen great as well.

157
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:21,772
And like I said, we did actually increase quality

158
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,912
in problematic titles.

159
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:24,632
But what was not working,

160
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,865
is when feedback was not requested by a team,

161
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,490
when multiple sources of feedback

162
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,434
with conflicting guidance,

163
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:33,796
and who should a team listen to,

164
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,501
and when teams were incredibly stressed

165
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,004
to get a visit from the champions.

166
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:44,919
So the first proposal was completely remove the creative champions process, right?

167
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,121
And everyone that was a creative champion just ended up working on different projects.

168
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:54,145
Stop trying to copy another studio's process and actually create something better,

169
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:58,428
something that actually fit our values, something that actually felt right for King.

170
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,149
And Bob's going to go into that.

171
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,428
So at this point, we still have the same problem.

172
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:12,309
We still need to come up with a way to support games,

173
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,550
support teams, and also to review.

174
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,791
So the first thing we did is decide to unpack the two

175
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:17,912
into two separate things.

176
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,793
We'll support on one end and review on the other,

177
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:22,194
but they won't be tied together.

178
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:23,835
What we did find, though, is even though

179
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:24,815
that we were gonna unpack them,

180
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:26,456
they were essentially some common threads

181
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:27,016
that went through it.

182
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:29,117
First of all, the teams need to trust the reviewers,

183
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:30,678
which wasn't happening previously.

184
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:33,239
The feedback needs to actually be good.

185
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,741
And the teams need to want the feedback.

186
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:37,801
So.

187
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,793
To take a look at the first bit, getting teams to trust it,

188
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,275
we started with the creative champions,

189
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:46,277
which was the exact opposite of being trusted,

190
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:49,882
if I'm fully honest, and got rid of that.

191
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:51,604
So we needed to replace it with something,

192
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,526
and we decided to look in the wider King community

193
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:56,550
of game designers and involve everybody

194
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,832
that we could in this process.

195
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,585
So we have a game design leadership team,

196
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,206
which is some of the most fantastically talented people

197
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:04,966
I've ever worked with.

198
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:06,906
They're all across the globe.

199
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:08,347
They're extremely experienced.

200
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,667
And we've worked really hard over the last couple of years

201
00:10:10,687 --> 00:10:12,268
to make sure that they're connected with each other.

202
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:15,228
And we do this by every three months,

203
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:17,069
we make sure that we get everybody in the same place

204
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,390
so they can actually spend time, talk through issues,

205
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,530
wear stupid Viking helmets, and go for beers.

206
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,771
Of course, Steve helps us out as well there.

207
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:37,605
And this group of people, and not just them, but the wider community of designers at King have a fantastic amount of experience.

208
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:43,547
These are the games that we've worked on, I think these are some of the most highly performing games that have ever happened in mobile.

209
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:52,430
But if you look a bit deeper, this group of people has worked on an amazing, amazing library of titles.

210
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,931
Some of the things from when I was a kid, some of the top performings of the day.

211
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:00,079
So what we did is we went designer by designer

212
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:01,900
through the entire company and cataloged

213
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,081
what their experiences were.

214
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:04,402
What were they good at?

215
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:05,082
Were there strengths?

216
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:05,923
What genres they know?

217
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,264
Were they great at balancing or great at narrative?

218
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:12,147
And we created this list of who was great at what.

219
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:16,990
So this is, I mean, it's not particularly our process,

220
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,271
but at the same time, what we were doing

221
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:20,312
is looking at our overall operating model

222
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:21,173
and how we make games.

223
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,843
And one of the decisions was to make a more light,

224
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:28,325
but decisive governance in the production process.

225
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:30,947
And if you look in the play test stage,

226
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:31,748
that's where this came in.

227
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:34,763
We called it Senior Creative Review.

228
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:39,345
And the principle behind that was to make sure that the game would be reviewed by experts

229
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:43,488
when it comes to design rather than just a random association of senior management.

230
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:47,490
We'd remove the feedback from any sort of formal gate.

231
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:51,713
I don't know how many of you, probably most of you have been through some sort of gate

232
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,054
and the amount that people are actually interested in getting feedback when you're getting a

233
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:58,196
decision is usually next to nil.

234
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:01,150
Especially if you get a positive response.

235
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:02,653
I mean, when people are told yes,

236
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:04,496
they don't actually go, well, why are you saying yes?

237
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,738
They just go, okay, great, move on.

238
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,262
And we want to make sure that we are leveraging

239
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:09,645
this creative talent from across King.

240
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,894
So this is kind of a snapshot of what the average SER would look like.

241
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:20,559
It's a combination of qualitative data and qualitative feedback about the design, and

242
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:24,042
also we give numerical assessments of each aspect of the game.

243
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:28,746
So we look at core gameplay, we look at envelope, social, the theme, audience fit, and then

244
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:33,750
we also discuss the reviewer's overall confidence level and how well they think that game is

245
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,474
going to proceed, excuse me, how well they think that game is actually going to do and

246
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:39,635
achieve the goals that they set out.

247
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:44,912
Uh, so reviewers are given a week to go through, play through the build, read documentation,

248
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:50,916
uh, they fill out a Google survey, that's how we capture the data, um, and then ultimately

249
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:51,717
report back to the game.

250
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,899
And that worked, uh, that worked perfectly actually.

251
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,460
Uh, it was super, super well received by the team.

252
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:00,703
I'm just kidding, it was, we screwed that up as well.

253
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,351
Yeah, we made a huge amount of mistakes and had to go back to the drawing board and come up with something better.

254
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,532
Right from the beginning we noticed that we were getting a lot of reviews saying that, you know,

255
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:18,773
I don't think this game is going to achieve its goals, and the reviewers weren't actually aware of what those goals were.

256
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,674
So we started putting in a kick-off meeting to make sure that the reviewers and the team was aligned.

257
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:25,194
And I think that was after the second or third one when we did.

258
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:28,275
So it was an iterative process. We did work to keep making it better.

259
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:32,175
And then ultimately what we had to do is go out and talk to all the game teams.

260
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:37,827
We held workshops with not just designers, because one of the problems we made from the

261
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:41,809
beginning is we knew what management wanted and we knew what the designers were capable

262
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,771
of reviewing, but we didn't really talk to the game design, or sorry, the game teams

263
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,332
in detail to make sure we were doing the right thing.

264
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:52,034
So ultimately we made a huge amount of changes.

265
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:56,379
What we did is make sure that that feedback

266
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,461
was a lot more clear.

267
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,545
What we were handing people was about 42 pages

268
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:01,466
of random thoughts.

269
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:04,650
So we found a way to actually concisely summarize that

270
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,553
and take the biggest takeaways that a team can go

271
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,756
and present that back.

272
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:10,798
And we launched that this year.

273
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:16,119
As far as the support side, which is the second part of the equation,

274
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:20,021
what we did is we created a really, really robust menu, I guess,

275
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:22,802
of different feedback channels that are available for the side teams.

276
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,624
The FQA is one of the ones that Stephen mentioned earlier.

277
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:29,926
This is similar to the other process

278
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,327
in that it's a written documentation, it's fairly formal,

279
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:36,088
but there's no evaluation, it's there strictly to the support of the team.

280
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:37,549
They can ask whatever they want.

281
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,410
It could be a small issue like, is this feature right?

282
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,511
Or it could be a big one like, is this game fun?

283
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,912
And we provide that and put it back to the teams.

284
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,054
We have another one called Playdates,

285
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:51,897
which is essentially designed for early stage games

286
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:52,978
that are iterating quickly,

287
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,700
and they don't really have time to wait a week,

288
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,721
because by the time that comes in,

289
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:58,243
you're basically reviewing a game

290
00:14:58,263 --> 00:14:59,284
that doesn't exist anymore.

291
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:01,045
So this is, we get a load of designers together,

292
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:02,747
they all get on video conference.

293
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:06,993
play through a game and the team can ask questions in real time.

294
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:10,335
We also run workshops, both face-to-face and virtual.

295
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:13,457
So the face-to-face ones is when there's a serious issue with the game,

296
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:14,998
we get everyone together in the same room

297
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,759
to work through a problem.

298
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,581
And the virtual one is the same basic thing,

299
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:21,682
we just do it over email.

300
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:25,144
So, for example, teams want suggestions on blockers

301
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:26,184
that they can use in their game,

302
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:29,587
we get some of the designers who have strengths in that area across King,

303
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:31,568
they put together a few slides and send it through.

304
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:34,937
And we are still iterating in these.

305
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:38,538
We're coming up with new ideas all the time for the future.

306
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,559
I don't know why I put a robot there

307
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,019
having a coffee with a lady.

308
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:44,180
I think it has something to do with future and coffee.

309
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,501
But concept coffees are something that we're working on

310
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,262
where people can discuss these early ideas.

311
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:52,543
So ultimately, whenever we do create

312
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,463
one of these new channels,

313
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,844
we go back to the three kind of core principles

314
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:56,765
that we look for in all of our...

315
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:03,375
our feedback channels, which is that you need to trust the reviewer, it has to be quality

316
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:05,176
feedback and the feedback needs to be wanted.

317
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:07,457
As far as actually me...

318
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:11,379
That is like the ugliest slide I think I've ever done.

319
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:16,801
As far as actually measuring how this is successful, it's a little tricky because we've only been

320
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:17,381
doing this about...

321
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:22,261
I guess a year and a half at this point, so a lot of the games that go through this from

322
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:24,202
the beginning have not actually reached launch yet.

323
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,425
But one of the things we wanted to do was to make sure that our pipeline looked a little

324
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,407
bit more healthy.

325
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:35,731
Back in summer 2016, if you look, we had a huge amount of games that were in late rounds

326
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:39,174
of production, either in playtest or prototype, or sorry, prototyper.

327
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:44,726
production or play test, and very few that were in prototype or concept stage.

328
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,108
And when we're actually able to implement this and get people to really think about

329
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,049
is this game going to be big?

330
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,811
Can we have a huge, huge bar for quality?

331
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:58,194
And by introducing these various channels that people can do, if you look a year later,

332
00:16:58,454 --> 00:16:59,415
it looks a lot healthier.

333
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,057
We get a lot more bets in the early stage, a lot more things we're working on, we're

334
00:17:03,077 --> 00:17:07,259
failing quicker, and we're allowing teams to actually focus on the ideas they think

335
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:07,760
are really good.

336
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:10,930
That's pretty much it for my part.

337
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:21,417
Yes, so just to kind of wrap up then, is that we made a lot of mistakes trying to follow another studio's process, right?

338
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:26,620
And so we originally went from this static group of experts, kind of like the Pixar Brain Trust,

339
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,321
and that's what the creative champions were,

340
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:33,484
to this rotating panel of experts throughout all of King's senior creatives.

341
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:34,045
And that was like...

342
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:39,528
super great because like you sometimes a creative would be going through the process themselves of getting

343
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:44,330
Feedback and other times they would actually be giving feedback and just opening it up to everyone

344
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,132
Really felt like it was trusting our creative

345
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:50,814
creative experts throughout the whole of King

346
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:54,515
And then the other thing, it was very, very team-focused, right?

347
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:56,716
So it actually came from the teams.

348
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,257
So we had these support channels that Bob mentioned,

349
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:01,878
with these workshops, these FQAs and these play dates.

350
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:06,699
And they run from concept, from prototype to production.

351
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:10,781
We're currently looking about how we can apply this to live games as well.

352
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:14,982
And then we have this Senior Creative Review, and it's a review system.

353
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:18,363
It wasn't being hidden like it was before through the champions.

354
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:18,803
It was like...

355
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:23,185
it's obvious a review system and the team can actually ask for this review system

356
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:26,767
when they want to ask for it, which is another great thing.

357
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:28,767
So it's not forced on them. When they feel they're ready,

358
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:30,468
then it goes to the SCR.

359
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:34,110
And we've been doing it like this now for about a year,

360
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,210
but we're going to probably end up involving it again,

361
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:39,492
because it is kind of flexible, but it's uniform, right?

362
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:40,592
It goes across all our studios.

363
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:44,434
So now we feel that our teams have gone from this...

364
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:52,018
to this. That's what it feels like. So, we are hiring, obviously, so if you go to king.com

365
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:56,721
jobs and you want to actually come through this yourself and actually create games with

366
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,642
us, then please go there. Thank you.

367
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:21,549
uh is there any carry over between the SDRs like do you take some of the feedback from a

368
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:27,151
previous SDR and see how the game has evolved in direct uh correlation to what was given in

369
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,072
the in a previous SDR?

370
00:19:29,678 --> 00:19:31,039
Yeah, I think that happens quite often.

371
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,981
Normally most teams will only go through the process once,

372
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,622
but occasionally a second time.

373
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:39,804
The feedback's usually taken over,

374
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:41,665
and then teams will come up with a plan

375
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:43,627
on how they're gonna mitigate those risks that are raised.

376
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,448
And usually if we go back and we do another one

377
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,070
in six months, it's one of the things

378
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,151
the reviewers will look at is how well did they execute

379
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,253
on their plans to mitigate those risks that were flagged up.

380
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:04,806
Do you think the brain trust would have worked if we just do it purely as feedback like here's some feedback

381
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:06,009
Do what you want with it

382
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:29,862
I don't know, I don't think so. We tried to do it like that but it was, I think part of our problem, maybe if we were in one big studio it might have been able to work like that, but I think this whole feeling of travelling to a studio and having these people travel there was kind of really stressful for the teams.

383
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:36,687
But like I was mentioning, I think we evolved enough for us to get to this point

384
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:41,251
where rather than having this brain trust of experts,

385
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:44,253
we have so much expertise around King,

386
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:48,276
so actually bringing them all in together felt right for our studio.

387
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,241
Is anybody watching the watchers?

388
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:57,103
Do you guys give feedback to the SCR panel?

389
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:04,923
That's a very good question. To an extent, yeah. I go through, I don't actually write

390
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:08,844
any of the reviews, but I always go through them all, and I've had a lot of conversation

391
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:13,585
with the reviewers saying that your feedback's maybe a little bit too harsh or the criticism's

392
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:18,426
a little bit off. I mean, ideally, you want to have different opinions. You can't just

393
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:22,487
say somebody gave a bad review to a good game. You want to have that person say that they

394
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:23,487
don't believe in the project.

395
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:28,789
Sometimes you get people who are a little bit rushed and they'll write about two lines and things like that.

396
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:33,632
But we don't have like a formal system. It's more on a kind of case-by-case basis.

397
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:37,834
I think a big change that we did recently though, it used to be anonymous, right? The SCR.

398
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:43,817
And then we changed it now to, like, you can actually, you know who the reviewer is now.

399
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,138
And that was something that evolved as it went along.

400
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:50,667
Hi, thanks for your talk.

401
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:53,991
So my question was, maybe I lost a little bit,

402
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:56,774
but I saw that you evaluate the designers

403
00:21:57,035 --> 00:21:57,875
on your spreadsheet.

404
00:21:58,136 --> 00:21:59,277
I saw some marks.

405
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,219
So how are you doing this?

406
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:05,544
How you evaluate if the guy is good or the girl is good?

407
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,108
It wasn't an evaluation of the designers.

408
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,829
You know, they had the different colours and...

409
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:14,050
Yeah, yeah.

410
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,690
It was more...

411
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,451
First of all, people would self-assess.

412
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:22,935
They'd say, I'm really, really strong in RPGs or I'm weak in puzzle games.

413
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:29,239
And the design director, the studio design director who's responsible for the designers

414
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,941
in each studio would kind of go through and calibrate that before we put it into the system.

415
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:39,979
Okay, another question. You mentioned that it's important to build trust, so the team must trust the reviewer.

416
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:44,081
Do you build that trust somehow? Is there any process for this?

417
00:22:44,701 --> 00:22:52,624
Yeah, I only touched on it briefly. We don't have a huge amount of time, but we created this game design leadership group a couple of years ago.

418
00:22:52,684 --> 00:23:00,607
And we meet virtually every two weeks, and then every three months, so once a quarter, we all get together face to face.

419
00:23:01,387 --> 00:23:05,770
This has been something that's been going on, we've been pretty religious as far as making sure that these meetings happen,

420
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,971
so that people get to know each other, you know each other's strengths.

421
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:15,355
And that's kind of like a first step, but through that you actually talk about games, you get to know these people,

422
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:20,577
and like I said, you go out for beers and wear stupid hats.

423
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:26,640
And the other thing is, because the reviews are done by people from the game design community,

424
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:30,743
you might have your team's game being reviewed one week

425
00:23:30,763 --> 00:23:32,444
and then the next week you're reviewing somewhere else.

426
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:35,166
So you've been through the situation

427
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,748
both as a designer and as a reviewer.

428
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:40,831
So it gives a familiarity with the process.

429
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:42,392
Well, it really helped to stop going

430
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:46,255
from this central group, right, to this global group

431
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:49,557
and take a creativity direction

432
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:51,519
from everyone in the different studios.

433
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:52,860
Yeah, okay, thank you.

434
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:56,427
Thanks for the talk guys, very useful.

435
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:00,230
So I had a question, if this is successful for you

436
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,612
in the future, do you plan to expand it

437
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:03,513
to other disciplines as well, and not just

438
00:24:03,594 --> 00:24:05,916
the game designers, to involve more of the team members?

439
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:14,582
Yes. I guess we like art, right? We're doing the uh, we're currently, it was uh, we used to have

440
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:20,306
art actually evolved in the SCR as well, but now they're going to get their own one, uh, their own

441
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:24,970
kind of review and uh, UX as well. UX UI is another one that we're doing too.

442
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,687
Hi, given the poor reception to the creative champion approach,

443
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:35,293
did you have to do anything to kind of like encourage the game

444
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:38,158
teams to reach out to the new group for feedback?

445
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,735
No, I think because we were just very honest, right?

446
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,076
And King's actually, it's a very flat company,

447
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,057
a very honest company.

448
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:48,339
So we just said, this is not working to everyone.

449
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:49,699
And then we went to all the teams

450
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,341
that have actually been working with the champions

451
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:53,601
and said, what would you like to improve?

452
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:54,782
What would you like to do that?

453
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:55,922
And like Bob was saying,

454
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:58,384
having this design leadership group as well,

455
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,965
where we could all talk openly about with each other

456
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:03,566
and then that to filter down through their design teams,

457
00:25:03,946 --> 00:25:06,007
actually, you know, it became quite easy

458
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:07,428
to everyone to embrace it.

459
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:09,369
Great, thanks.

460
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,212
Hi, this is Joni from Rovio.

461
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:17,796
So your experts are kind of like helping teams to get through the gates and green lights.

462
00:25:18,236 --> 00:25:24,241
But who are those people the same that are actually approving the green light or approving the gate or how does that work?

463
00:25:26,815 --> 00:25:32,276
Yeah, sure. I think the goal of the reviews are not to help get through a gate, they're

464
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:37,197
to evaluate it, and that's used as one of the data points that would be in a gate. Our

465
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:42,018
chief creative officer is one of the people who's involved in that as well, and he's one

466
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,899
who would bring the opinion of the senior creatives to that meeting. But there's all

467
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,240
sorts of other stakeholders as well. There's people from business performance, there's

468
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,641
tech people to say, can we actually build this game? There's someone from human resources

469
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:55,481
who looks at...

470
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:59,706
Do we have the people to make this game as well?

471
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:05,352
The creative reviews is, I feel, a pretty important data point, but it's just one that

472
00:26:05,372 --> 00:26:05,672
we use.

473
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:07,974
Last question.

474
00:26:08,975 --> 00:26:11,678
You mentioned that you're starting to roll this out to other disciplines.

475
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,224
Are there any significant differences giving that review between different disciplines,

476
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,466
or is it kind of the same system?

477
00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:21,706
I think there will be. We're only just starting it off now.

478
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:25,248
Aaron, who's over there, is head of art.

479
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:29,171
So we're going to be working with him and trying to figure out the best process.

480
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:32,232
One of the problems we had in the original SCR is that we could never...

481
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:35,635
We weren't showing images or anything like that

482
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:39,237
because we didn't want designers to take pictures of images and stuff.

483
00:26:39,677 --> 00:26:41,839
But obviously art needs to show images, right?

484
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:44,820
So we'll work with him on the process

485
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,262
and then maybe we'll be here next year talking about...

486
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:48,384
how it felt.

487
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:48,485
Cool.

488
00:26:48,846 --> 00:26:51,534
Thank you.

489
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:51,734
Thanks.

490
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:51,995
Thanks.

491
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:52,176
Thanks.

492
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:52,757
Thanks.
