1
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:06,095
inform game design.

2
00:00:06,936 --> 00:00:08,117
My name is Leroy Atanasoff.

3
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:10,438
I'm the game director on Rainbow Six Siege.

4
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:13,340
And to give you a bit of context, because maybe not

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,782
everyone knows about this game, Siege

6
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:18,603
is a five versus five competitive first person

7
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,004
shooter.

8
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,686
And it's an asymmetrical game with attacker and defender.

9
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:25,548
And one of the distinct elements of it

10
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:28,349
is that there is a presence of what we call operator.

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,191
You know, that's our character that

12
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:32,532
come into the battlefield with a specific ability.

13
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:37,355
So just to wrap up, think about like a MOBA that meets a shooter.

14
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:39,176
And this is a bit what is Rainbow Six Siege.

15
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:42,377
And today I have a special guest with me, that is Geoffroy Mouret.

16
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:46,639
Hey guys, so I'm Geoffroy Mouret, I'm a data scientist part of the analytics team on Rainbow

17
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:47,100
Six Siege.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,422
So historically what we guys do, we just make reports and try to get people from the production

19
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:53,303
team know we exist.

20
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:58,165
But the goal of the presentation today is to show that we actually have some very useful

21
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:01,387
collaboration when we communicate with the people we're working with.

22
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:04,868
Yeah, so let's go right away into the plan.

23
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:07,652
So we're going to talk about the philosophies that mean,

24
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:10,736
what does it mean for us, like a data-informed game designer,

25
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:12,719
and how do we have this relationship,

26
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,344
and how we work with analysts, and why we are working with

27
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:18,166
them, and why we found like a.

28
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:21,109
super interesting stuff working that way.

29
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:24,332
Then the methodology on how, at least on Rainbow Six Siege,

30
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:25,693
we apply it, okay?

31
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:27,514
I think it's really dependent for your context,

32
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:31,317
but we are going to show you how we do it in Rainbow Six Siege.

33
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,118
And then a quick conclusion.

34
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,901
And all of this, even though we believe

35
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,622
that intelligence design can be applied

36
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:39,724
to any kind of feature in a game,

37
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,485
we are going for this presentation,

38
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:43,246
focus on the operator balancing,

39
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,988
because it's more meaningful for this presentation,

40
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:47,950
because operators are a big part of...

41
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,012
of this game.

42
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:52,141
So let's start right away with the philosophy.

43
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:52,963
So

44
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:56,612
Quickly, intelligence design is how

45
00:01:56,632 --> 00:02:00,333
you share the design ownership as designer with an analyst.

46
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,413
And we really mean design ownership.

47
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:06,154
That means designer and analyst are sitting close together.

48
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:08,735
They work hand in hand on the design of a feature,

49
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:13,036
from the conception to the release on live of this feature.

50
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,337
And they take decision together about this feature,

51
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:17,797
either in conception or either in real.

52
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:22,018
They are just one team working together on design.

53
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:22,958
And why is that?

54
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,761
It's because the backbone of the intelligence design is data.

55
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:34,786
And it's all about how we use data to make better design

56
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:35,207
decisions.

57
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:37,108
And why data, you can ask.

58
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:41,291
It's because it's the best tool that will help your intuition.

59
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,171
Especially as game designers, everyone has intuition.

60
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:46,272
But as game designers, often we are

61
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,992
in this position of after a prototype,

62
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:51,133
after an iteration, everyone is turning in front of you

63
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:54,154
and they are waiting for validation or consent.

64
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:54,894
Is it good?

65
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:55,514
Is it OK?

66
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:56,634
Are we moving forward?

67
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:57,254
Stuff like that.

68
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:00,855
And you have to make a quick decision, most of the time

69
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,895
based on the PlayStation.

70
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:04,436
Sometimes it's one or two-hour PlayStation that you just add.

71
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:05,636
And the thing is that.

72
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,732
to help to confirm your gut feelings,

73
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:11,675
you have something like it's sometimes a tool

74
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:12,696
and sometimes an enemy.

75
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:16,159
This is a cognitive bias codex.

76
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:17,901
It's normal if you can't read anything.

77
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,584
It's all the mechanisms that are in your brain that

78
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:22,685
alter your perception.

79
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:24,727
There is really a lot of them, so that way you

80
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:27,931
can't read them, like loss aversion, spacing effect.

81
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:34,718
That means you have all those mechanisms in your brain that alter your perception and when it comes to make a decision

82
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,342
It's it's it's hard for human being in general

83
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:44,050
But especially designer because we ask them to make this decision to understand what really happened versus what you think really happened

84
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,635
And data can be a useful tool to help you to build this,

85
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:54,678
to make those decisions, and to iterate and make a better

86
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:55,318
design.

87
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:58,480
Quick example, for example, we always

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,602
had this moment in a game where we are like,

89
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:03,264
and even it's stuff that happened during PlayStation,

90
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,125
like, ah, this hero is too strong.

91
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,307
You know, ah, I'm always dying against this operator.

92
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,868
Or you know, ah, this map, we're always losing on this map.

93
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:13,211
And we had this kind of story on Rainbow Six Siege.

94
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:14,933
We are playing with analysts after work.

95
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:17,295
We have kind of a team.

96
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,257
And there were always this map.

97
00:04:19,497 --> 00:04:20,658
Every time we are playing on this map,

98
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:22,760
we are like, ah, this map is so bad.

99
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,422
You know, we are always losing on this map.

100
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:25,382
Ah, we hate this map.

101
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:26,804
You know, why are we always losing?

102
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:27,765
Ah, we're so bad, so bad.

103
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:28,565
Oh no, it's this map.

104
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:29,426
Okay, free lose.

105
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:30,527
And stuff like that.

106
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,789
And the cool thing is that because we are working

107
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:35,011
on Rainbow Six Siege, we have access to our own data.

108
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:39,656
So with this guy we can fact check everything we are saying,

109
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,218
like every misconception that we might have.

110
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,260
So at some point Geoffroy was like,

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,542
okay let's look at our win rate on this map.

112
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:48,664
And actually we were winning more

113
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:49,946
than we were losing on this map.

114
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:53,869
And still if you have asked any one of us in this team,

115
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,452
everyone has a perception that we are always losing.

116
00:04:56,912 --> 00:05:00,094
It's because it's one of the cognitive bias theory

117
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,015
that you tend to remember always things that

118
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:04,716
confirm your first intuition.

119
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,337
So every time we were losing, we were remembering,

120
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:08,718
you see, I'm losing on this map.

121
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:11,739
And every time you win, you don't remember that much.

122
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,879
At this point, I think cognitive bias is something

123
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,060
that when you are a modern designer, you know all of this.

124
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,942
You need to be very careful when you take decisions,

125
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,902
when you work after a play session, and stuff like that.

126
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,083
But there is another element for what

127
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:27,724
I think data is the backbone of the intelligent design.

128
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:32,986
It's because you are just one human, or as a designer team,

129
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:35,207
you are just one team of people.

130
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,909
And you only see the context that you are in.

131
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,850
For example, you only play maybe on PS4, or PC, or Xbox One.

132
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,371
And you also have what we call your skill rate.

133
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:48,431
Like you're a copper player or you're a diamond player.

134
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:50,952
That means you have access to one specific context

135
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:51,432
of the game.

136
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:53,632
That means even if you're good with your perception,

137
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:56,673
like you have an Excel sheet and you write everything

138
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:59,413
that happens to be sure that you're not biased,

139
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:03,454
you will only see a slice of the reality of this game.

140
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:06,014
For example, a copper player will always say,

141
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,195
there is so much Caveira in my game.

142
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:09,615
Caveira is an operator.

143
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,875
She's a girl on the right.

144
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:13,276
And the diamond player on the other side will say,

145
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:15,256
Caveira doesn't exist in this game.

146
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,477
But there is so much bondi, guys.

147
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:17,537
There is some issue with bondi.

148
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,958
And if those two people talk at the coffee machine

149
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:24,199
the morning, like, hey, I had a game yesterday night.

150
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:24,719
Hey, me too.

151
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:25,920
Caveira, such an issue.

152
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,720
And the other, like, huh?

153
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,140
Caveira doesn't exist in the game.

154
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,384
So you only see one aspect of your game

155
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:33,466
when you play, when you are engaged with.

156
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,130
So that's why you need to have data to see everything,

157
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,774
basically, to have a 360-degree vision of your game.

158
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,917
So OK, data is important.

159
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:43,257
Fine.

160
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:44,999
We know it's kind of a buzzword.

161
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:47,362
And OK, we have analysts anywhere.

162
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,883
They handle data, and they send us reports.

163
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:53,624
And I'm sure we all receive email after a milestone,

164
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:56,585
after a playtest, after when we ship a season,

165
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:57,326
or something like that.

166
00:06:57,746 --> 00:07:00,187
And it's 100 pages with a lot of boards and graphs.

167
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:03,928
And I'm sure everyone is reading them, like missing nothing.

168
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:06,069
And they are sure, like, yeah, I get it.

169
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:06,449
I get it.

170
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,969
I know exactly what happened in my game.

171
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:08,970
I read all those emails.

172
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,891
Are you really sure that you read them well

173
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:12,611
and there is no issue?

174
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:16,946
Well, you know, like, as analysts, most of the time,

175
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:19,787
we have, or we used to have, game designers coming to us

176
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:22,427
saying, OK, we want a report with that data.

177
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,548
We want to follow the operator's win rate

178
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,268
through the seasons and everything.

179
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,569
So you make that report, because you know they ask you something

180
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:30,569
so you're happy to have them.

181
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:34,490
But sometimes the report is not what they try to,

182
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,871
it's not answering the question they want an answer for.

183
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:40,251
A good example of that is Frost.

184
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,452
So Frost was our first DLC operator.

185
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:46,573
She came out like three months after the game released.

186
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:51,274
And at the time, we had basic reports for the game design

187
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:51,534
team.

188
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:56,055
And people were not happy because they were saying,

189
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,135
like, Frost is overpowered.

190
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:58,295
Like, she's way too strong.

191
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,776
And when we looked at the report, it was the case.

192
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:04,617
Like, Frost's win ratio was the highest

193
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,937
of all the defending operators.

194
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:10,324
And so your basic intuition might be to say, well,

195
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:13,066
the winner ratio is actually a good representation

196
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,308
of the power level of an operator.

197
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,209
But I'd like to show you something

198
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,231
when we digged as analysts a bit more into that data.

199
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:24,253
So what we wanted to check was whether this operator was

200
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:27,115
good for new players versus advanced players.

201
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,536
So we took the data that we had before.

202
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:31,358
We split the population into four different categories.

203
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,280
And so we had beginner players.

204
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:37,998
For which we saw that, OK, Frost is not the best operator

205
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:40,499
because she wins less than Rook.

206
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,340
So if you play the game, you know

207
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,801
that Rook is an operator that just drops a bag of armor plates

208
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:47,601
at the beginning of the round.

209
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:50,162
And Frost is laying down traps around the map.

210
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:52,782
So you know that when you're playing Frost,

211
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:53,963
you need to have good map knowledge.

212
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:56,444
You need to know where to put these traps and everything.

213
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:59,525
Whereas when you're playing Rook, you just drop your bag

214
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:00,005
and you're done.

215
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,885
You've done your job, basically.

216
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:05,143
So we're like, OK, it makes sense.

217
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:08,005
So we are going to look at advanced players, so a player

218
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:10,006
who spent a bit more time in the game.

219
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:11,387
And it was the case as well.

220
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,408
Like for these players, Rook was winning more than Frost.

221
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:16,890
So we're like, OK, so obviously Frost

222
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,771
is an operator for advanced players.

223
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:22,653
But the fact is that when you split your data

224
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:25,194
across your whole population, this is what you get.

225
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,508
meaning that for all levels of play,

226
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,089
Rook was winning more than Frost.

227
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:33,090
And this is the exact same data split

228
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,530
into four different subpopulations.

229
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:41,952
So if you're used to work with data,

230
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:45,193
this is something that is known as the Simpson's paradox.

231
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:46,173
So you can look it up.

232
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:51,149
But the explanation behind that is actually not that hard.

233
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:53,691
Because if you're looking at the win rates

234
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,552
for the different populations, you

235
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:59,295
can see that advanced players win more than beginner players.

236
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:01,697
Like overall, whether it's with Frost or Rook.

237
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:04,720
And the thing is that Frost is a DLC operator.

238
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,382
So to get her, you need to have a season pass

239
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,643
or to have spent a lot of time in the game grinding

240
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:11,785
some soft currency to get that operator.

241
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:15,147
So when we looked at pick rates for these populations

242
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,888
for the two operators, you could see that Frost

243
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:21,169
was picked a lot more by advanced players

244
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,049
rather than new players.

245
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,370
So what explained these win rates

246
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,791
was not the fact that Frost was better than Rook.

247
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,213
It was the fact that Frost was played by better players,

248
00:10:32,853 --> 00:10:35,574
meaning that this metric is basically useless in terms

249
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:36,334
of power balancing.

250
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,795
It just shows you if an operator is more played by good players

251
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:40,015
or not.

252
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,410
So this is where we started to show to game designers that,

253
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,733
OK, you guys, you need to be careful when you're asking

254
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,334
for data, when you're reading your data.

255
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:53,197
So this is one of the many examples

256
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:56,159
that we have about misinterpreting data

257
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:59,682
or getting the wrong metrics for an issue.

258
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:03,485
So when they show us the Simpson paradox, as designers,

259
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:03,765
we're like,

260
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:04,920
Oh, wow.

261
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,462
So OK, so maybe we are not like super mathematical people.

262
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:12,224
We didn't come from a school with statistics

263
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:12,684
and stuff like that.

264
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:16,286
So maybe we should let analytic people do the balancing,

265
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,707
look at the report, and maybe take decision,

266
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,568
while us designers, we focus on new stuff,

267
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:24,730
like making new feature, new aspect of the game.

268
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,093
And this question came into the table as a legitimate one.

269
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,054
And to answer this one, I feel like it

270
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:35,316
was a concept of being data-driven versus being

271
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:36,957
data-informed.

272
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:39,699
When you are data-driven, you might have the tendency

273
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,981
to focus on decisions that will enforce,

274
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:45,482
like for example, the perfect balancing.

275
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:49,584
So stall and simplify your design in order

276
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:50,805
to achieve this perfect balancing.

277
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:52,527
Let me give you an example.

278
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:54,830
Imagine this system being your game.

279
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:57,273
So you have three marble and one plate.

280
00:11:57,774 --> 00:12:00,737
So in terms of maintaining the balance, it's quite easy.

281
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:03,201
And every time you want to add a new marble,

282
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,983
if you're data-driven, you might say,

283
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:07,846
I'm not sure you should add a new marble on this system

284
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:09,408
because it might create imbalance.

285
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,470
So let me give you a concrete example

286
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,751
of what I'm talking about.

287
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,212
So this is a graph that represents

288
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:18,874
a win rate between attacker and defender in Rainbow Six Siege.

289
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:21,536
And since we are an asymmetrical game,

290
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:23,837
it was really important for us to try to maintain

291
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:25,258
as much as possible this balance,

292
00:12:25,718 --> 00:12:27,099
because at the beginning of a run,

293
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,700
we want to have each player having a 50-50 chance

294
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,801
to win the run.

295
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:33,142
And at some point, around August,

296
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:35,584
you see that we are quite close and quite happy

297
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:36,744
in terms of balancing.

298
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:39,406
But at that point, we had another issue in the game.

299
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:41,067
That was the shotgun.

300
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:45,389
The shotgun were overwhelmingly good at everything,

301
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:48,950
from long range to mid range to short range,

302
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,711
good at destruction.

303
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:51,752
And everyone was using shotgun.

304
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:54,413
And they were, in terms of diversity, it was like a

305
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:57,670
creating shadow for all the other weapons.

306
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,372
So we decided to change them and to nerf them.

307
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,114
And because of the nature of the game,

308
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:04,256
defenders were using them the most.

309
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:08,580
So we anticipated kind of an imbalance on the defense side.

310
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,743
And it happened, and it happened like super badly.

311
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:12,904
When you look at this,

312
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:15,326
it was one of the worst balance situation we ever had

313
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:16,928
in the history of the game at that point.

314
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,490
So here, for example, if you're data driven,

315
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,851
you might say, maybe we should reverse this change.

316
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:24,673
Maybe it affects too much the balancing of the game.

317
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:26,494
Maybe we should find another way.

318
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,634
Maybe we should change something.

319
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:30,296
But just we are more focusing on what

320
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:31,416
we call the iterative balance.

321
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,538
And when we were talking with pro players,

322
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,399
with people that were playing.

323
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:40,041
with a Reddit forum and pro Reddit play session,

324
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:41,282
pro player coming to the studio.

325
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:44,744
And even us as designers were like, the game is better.

326
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,105
In terms of experience, the fact that now you

327
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,947
have multiple strategies, multiple viable weapons,

328
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:52,068
it's less like a shotgun festival.

329
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:52,968
And it's more interesting.

330
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:55,670
So in terms of pure experience, yes, the game is better.

331
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,611
Still, we have this balancing issue.

332
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:01,293
So instead of coming back to and revert,

333
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:03,514
we decided to introduce another change.

334
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:04,434
That we decided to.

335
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,559
decrease the timing of a round down to three minutes.

336
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,302
And again, because it's an asymmetrical game,

337
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:16,446
when the timer hits zero, the defender wins by default.

338
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:19,389
The attack team has to reach and breach the objective in order

339
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:19,770
to win.

340
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,812
So decreasing the timer to three minutes

341
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:26,376
were favorizing more the defense.

342
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:28,539
So it has an impact on the balance on the attack side.

343
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,620
But again, the game, we had PlayStation, we had playtest,

344
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,240
and stuff like that.

345
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,820
And people were like, yeah, it's more interesting

346
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,981
because it creates more tension, more meaningful choices

347
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,001
for the attacker team.

348
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:41,162
They have to now take decisions in time, and it matters.

349
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:43,562
And even for the defensing team, it

350
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:45,743
was now about not only killing the opponent,

351
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:47,963
but they can play the timer, they

352
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:50,124
can try to slow down the push, delay the action,

353
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:54,184
so open for more variety and more diversity.

354
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,245
And as you can see.

355
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:57,647
In the end, we came back like we were super lucky.

356
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:00,310
Even though we anticipated that, you never can tell.

357
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,472
If you wish, you will come back to normal.

358
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:05,815
But we come back really close to where we were before.

359
00:15:06,376 --> 00:15:09,739
So just to recap this example, to me, this is data-driven.

360
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,861
And what we want with DataInform is

361
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,425
that we want to continue to add as many marble as possible,

362
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:18,028
as many plates as possible, working with analysts.

363
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:19,918
to ensure the balancing.

364
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:24,720
So yes, designers should mostly focus on the diversity.

365
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,641
I think, especially when you're on a prototype,

366
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,282
you're working on conception and stuff like that, a lot of times

367
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:34,243
there is discussions that are crippled by power balancing.

368
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:37,945
How many times after a play session, 90% of the feedback

369
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:40,105
is, I think it's too good, it was always

370
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:40,986
killing me, and stuff like that.

371
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:44,347
Where actually, you should focus about, OK, is this interesting?

372
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:46,348
Does it create a new gameplay mechanic?

373
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,968
Are we creating a new player experience?

374
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,250
How are we adding a new layer of strategy?

375
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,571
Are we creating new situation?

376
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,794
Rather than focusing directly on the power balancing system.

377
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:57,637
Because analysts are the best to ensure that,

378
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,239
to ensure the fairness, being sure it's not too strong

379
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,240
or it's not too weak.

380
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,902
That when it's live, as they have the data,

381
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,085
they have the report, they can help you to fine tune

382
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:07,786
and tweak your value.

383
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:09,647
And even when you're in conception,

384
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:11,547
they can help you thinking of future too.

385
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,508
OK, don't care about the power balance for now.

386
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:16,549
Just care about adding a mechanic and, you know,

387
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:17,730
like a value.

388
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,031
Then we will be able to tweak when we'll be live to be sure

389
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:22,632
that it becomes balanced at some point.

390
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:25,393
And we believe that this is this collaboration of those two

391
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:28,274
people that make great feature and that one of the reasons

392
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:31,095
that make, we believe, Rainbow Six Siege a good game.

393
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,416
So now, Geoffroy, methodology.

394
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:38,197
Yes, because what do you do in practice when you have guys

395
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:40,358
like Leroy and his team playing around

396
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:43,139
with lots of marbles and plates, just adding them in the game?

397
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,261
And so because we have lots and lots of data,

398
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,102
and sometimes it's hard to know what to look,

399
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:51,423
because you cannot monitor everything in the game.

400
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:56,265
So what we try to do is try to define a way of finding issues

401
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:56,866
more quickly.

402
00:16:57,286 --> 00:17:00,407
And then once we have that, try to dig deeper into the data

403
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:01,628
to find exactly what's wrong.

404
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,435
So the process is actually the following.

405
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,296
We start by trying to define problems.

406
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:09,137
And once we have that, we try to find the causes,

407
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,279
like making hypotheses with a community,

408
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,080
with a design team and everything,

409
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,141
and then using data to validate these causes,

410
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:18,563
being, OK, is this the actual problem

411
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,324
that we have in the game?

412
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,046
And once you have that, you can start designing solutions

413
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:25,287
and then implement them in the game.

414
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,210
What we'd like to do is to start with focusing a bit more

415
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,854
on the defining problem part, because it's more data heavy,

416
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,296
and it involves a lot of collaboration and discussion

417
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:35,896
between our teams.

418
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:38,359
And for that, we need three steps.

419
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:41,402
You need to define the context, to find the metrics you

420
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:43,483
want to look at, and then set priority

421
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:45,866
to find what problems you want to tackle first.

422
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,208
So choosing context.

423
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:51,111
As you've seen before.

424
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,149
we don't have a single game in Rainbow Six Siege.

425
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:56,170
We have lots of them.

426
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,511
If you're a Cooper player and you love to play Secure Area

427
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:02,433
or you're a Diamond player playing, like, Bomb

428
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:04,934
on different maps and everything on different platforms,

429
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:06,175
this is not the same game.

430
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:09,576
So trying to balance for everyone at once is not feasible.

431
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:12,898
And so what we do is that we are looking mostly

432
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,018
at people in terms of skill.

433
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,578
Because we have this distribution of skill

434
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,599
in Rainbow Six Siege.

435
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,442
So we have lots of silver and gold players

436
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:21,983
in the middle of your distribution,

437
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:24,725
a few copper players that are less good than them,

438
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:26,227
and a few very good diamond players.

439
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:28,849
And there are multiple approaches to this.

440
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:31,251
You could decide that, well, I want the experience

441
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:34,274
to be fun for these low-level players

442
00:18:34,294 --> 00:18:36,216
because they're having a hard time at the game.

443
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:38,778
So I want to make sure that they're having a nicer time.

444
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:41,841
You can try to balance around the cover of your population

445
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:43,022
for the silver and gold players.

446
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,384
Be like, OK, these are where we have the most players.

447
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:47,206
We need to ensure that it's balanced for them.

448
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,009
But what we actually do on Rainbow Six Siege

449
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:52,932
is we try to balance for these top players

450
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:53,813
for multiple reasons.

451
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:56,655
The first one being that we're looking at ranked matches.

452
00:18:57,376 --> 00:19:00,098
So we want to have an environment that

453
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:03,039
is as competitive as we can, because these people are

454
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:03,720
playing to win.

455
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,321
They're trying to optimize their strategies.

456
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:06,922
They're trying to figure out ways

457
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:11,004
of exploiting the game mechanics weaknesses and everything.

458
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,987
So these people are the most involved in your game

459
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:16,428
balancing.

460
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:17,648
And we have that.

461
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,389
And you also have pro players, streamers,

462
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,791
like people who have an impact on how your population,

463
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,593
how your players see the game played at a higher level.

464
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,254
And what we see is that usually strategies

465
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:29,715
that are played for the.

466
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:34,865
at the top of the ladder, usually makes its way

467
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:37,426
towards lower skill levels.

468
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:39,346
So what you see today in diamond,

469
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:42,347
you see tomorrow in platinum, and then a few days or weeks

470
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:43,648
later in gold and silver.

471
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:46,869
So by focusing on these players, you're

472
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:51,311
trying to find the biggest issues

473
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:52,411
that you have with your game.

474
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:55,772
And when this metagame makes its way to lower levels,

475
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:57,533
you make sure that it's more balanced

476
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,593
and it's more enjoyable for your population.

477
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:02,593
So you have your population.

478
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:05,114
We have lots and lots of data to look at,

479
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:10,016
from the gadgets to the weapons to the maps, the objectives,

480
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,837
everything we can look at.

481
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:14,818
So this is going to sound like we're just

482
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,739
looking at two metrics, which we are not.

483
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,860
Every time we are trying to put as much context as we can.

484
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,701
But with that being said, we are still

485
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,182
looking to try to get a broad overview of what's

486
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:24,803
happening in the game.

487
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:28,124
And for that, we are focusing on two metrics, basically

488
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:29,065
win rate and pick rate.

489
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:32,407
to then map the operators on this graph

490
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,469
to see where the metagame is at at the moment.

491
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,971
So we have pickrate, which is an indication of whether operators

492
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:41,432
are over-picked or under-picked.

493
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,613
Are they attractive to players?

494
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,915
Are they not fun to play?

495
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:45,835
People don't want to play them?

496
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:51,876
So we usually split them, but try to have more blurry lines.

497
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:54,158
We don't say if the pick rate is above that value,

498
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:54,979
then it's an issue.

499
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:57,701
We're just trying to have it as centered as we can.

500
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:00,244
And the same goes with the win rate.

501
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:02,205
If you have a very high win rate, you're overpowered.

502
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:04,347
So it's not a nice experience for the players

503
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,489
because the game is imbalanced, and you don't want that.

504
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,632
So we tried the same way to bring operators more

505
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,233
towards a more interesting place.

506
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,705
And once you have that, you have a quick overview

507
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:15,265
of your metagame.

508
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:18,806
So these are the defenders in Rainbow Six Siege

509
00:21:18,926 --> 00:21:20,347
in last year's season three.

510
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:25,269
And you can see that we have two huge issues.

511
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:27,709
We had two huge issues at the time, the first one being ELA.

512
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,710
So if you're looking at the top right-hand corner,

513
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,611
you would see that this new character that was released

514
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:35,572
was winning way more than other people.

515
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:36,512
This is the win delta.

516
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:37,273
So the.

517
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:40,275
increase in win ratio when you have the operator on your team.

518
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:43,677
And you can see that people realized that this operator was

519
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:44,277
way too strong.

520
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:46,359
Like, her pick rate was insane.

521
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:46,979
It was more than 90%.

522
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,402
She was everywhere, like in Pro League, even in Copper,

523
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:52,683
in Diamond, like everywhere.

524
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:55,585
So you know that you have to do something about it.

525
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:57,927
And on the other hand of the spectrum, we have Tachanka.

526
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,868
So I don't know if you've played the game before,

527
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:01,969
but this has been a big issue.

528
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:06,053
Like, some things are easier to balance

529
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:07,654
because in terms of power levels,

530
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:09,054
so we're going to talk about that.

531
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,455
But sometimes it's a core mechanic

532
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,536
that you need to change, and it takes more time.

533
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:14,237
You can adjust both this operator

534
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:17,299
because he's standing still in a game

535
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,180
where knowing someone's position is crucial

536
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:22,922
in terms of intelligence and everything.

537
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:29,586
So, yeah, you need to have bigger production processes

538
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:30,126
to deal with that.

539
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:34,711
So once you've seen that, you can then set priorities.

540
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,633
What we try to do, we give a higher priority

541
00:22:37,653 --> 00:22:41,357
in terms of balancing to operators that are overpicked.

542
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:44,679
Mostly because when you are picked 100% of the time,

543
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,761
when you have five options for your team,

544
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:49,123
it means that you are taking one of these options

545
00:22:49,323 --> 00:22:52,086
instead of having lots of different situations

546
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:52,726
that could emerge.

547
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:55,750
you are fixing your metagame into one situation.

548
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:57,713
A good example of that is Ella.

549
00:22:58,013 --> 00:22:59,595
So we recently nerfed Ella.

550
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:03,120
And as you can see, so she is the top pick rate.

551
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,205
And so she went down to the middle of the pack

552
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:08,107
in terms of pick rate with the latest season.

553
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:12,093
And sometimes you could have another operator

554
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:16,136
taking someone's place and becoming the next superstar.

555
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:20,019
But this time, what we saw is that by bringing Ela more

556
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,801
in line with the other operators,

557
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:24,102
we gave room for the meta to grow.

558
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:27,245
Because you could see all the other operators

559
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:29,206
shifted in terms of pick rates.

560
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:32,248
And so this challenges the metagame.

561
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:33,650
This pushes it forward.

562
00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:36,295
So they're trying to take care of that.

563
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:40,119
Another good thing that is not an absolute truth,

564
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,482
but a good rule of thumb,

565
00:23:43,962 --> 00:23:47,886
is that usually it's easy to fix operators

566
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:50,388
when their win rates are correlated with the pick rates.

567
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,151
Because it means that either they're good

568
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:53,951
and people know it.

569
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:58,580
So they're playing them, or they're bad, and people know it,

570
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,540
and they don't play them.

571
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,721
So by nerfing top pick operators that are winning a lot more,

572
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,962
you're decreasing their attractivity,

573
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:09,242
and you're bringing them more in line instead of balancing,

574
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:10,103
and vice versa.

575
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,643
Because if you have an operator that's never picked,

576
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:15,304
but you buff this one to increase his pick rates,

577
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:17,904
you just get an operator that is way too strong,

578
00:24:18,044 --> 00:24:19,685
people will notice, and then go straight

579
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:21,505
to the top right-hand corner.

580
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:25,598
So by having parameters that you can tweak in terms of weapons,

581
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:28,759
in terms of gadgets, you can most of the time

582
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:29,279
do that easily.

583
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,280
So we saw that with LR, which was easier to fix.

584
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,540
But touch and key is another issue.

585
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:38,221
So the conclusion is that you want to grab those quick wins.

586
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:40,882
If something is problematic, you see it every time.

587
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:41,662
People know it's broken.

588
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:43,543
You have to take care of that as soon as you can.

589
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:51,014
But don't forget that sometimes you can also give some love to operators that have fallen out of meta

590
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:57,756
to just like increase their attractivity mixed with the nerfs to like challenge the meta

591
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:00,537
and make sure that everything is becoming interesting again.

592
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:04,178
And we have a great example of that.

593
00:25:05,198 --> 00:25:05,578
Blackbeard.

594
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:08,936
So if you've played the game, Blackbeard

595
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:12,136
was released during season two, so three months after Frost.

596
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:16,057
And it was a huge issue when it was released.

597
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:17,777
So this is where it was at.

598
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:21,878
So if you remember that, it was the exact same spot.

599
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:24,939
You're winning all the time, and people know it.

600
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,420
And when you have that, so we had the data,

601
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,120
we had the players feedback, we had everything.

602
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,860
We're like, OK, we need to address Blackbeard.

603
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:35,498
So cool, thank you.

604
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:38,160
The data was showing us we needed to act on Blackbeard.

605
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,422
So it was about now to try to find the causes

606
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:43,625
and validate the causes of what was the issue with Blackbeard.

607
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:46,187
So to this, we have many processes,

608
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:48,729
the first one being the qualitative feedback.

609
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:51,651
As I mentioned, we have a pro player session

610
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:54,393
that mean people that come to the studio, they play,

611
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:55,274
and we have focus group.

612
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,135
And since we are focusing on Blackbeard,

613
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,718
because we knew it with data that we need to focus on him,

614
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:03,179
So it allows us to converge faster on those topics.

615
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,179
We have a pro subreddit.

616
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,640
We even look at Reddit sometimes.

617
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,701
And we have also designer playstations.

618
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:11,181
We gather together.

619
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:14,582
We play specifically centered around Blackbeard.

620
00:26:14,882 --> 00:26:18,704
We try to recreate situations and see what was the problem.

621
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:21,084
And if you know a bit of the game and you know Blackbeard,

622
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:23,725
it was quite easy to make an hypothesis

623
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:25,606
about what was the problem.

624
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:28,088
meet the offender, the shield.

625
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:29,830
So just to give you a bit of context,

626
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,314
Rainbow Six Siege has a high lethality in terms of gameplay.

627
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:37,357
That means one bullet from any weapon in your head,

628
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:40,601
in the head of an enemy, eliminate the enemy

629
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:42,483
for the duration of the round.

630
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,733
The ability of Blackbeard was to have a ballistic shield on the top of his rifle that was protecting

631
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,113
his head.

632
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:52,595
So it was making a huge difference in terms of gameplay.

633
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:58,558
So quickly enough, we were like, probably the shield might be the issue on this one.

634
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:00,839
So it was just a hypothesis.

635
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:06,282
Then we go back to Geoffroy and ask him, OK, can you look at the data and see if there

636
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:09,844
is a correlation between the shield being an issue and something in the data.

637
00:27:10,444 --> 00:27:11,905
And they come back with a lot of data

638
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:15,606
and it was quickly clear that just with a kill-death ratio,

639
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:17,927
for example, that Blackbeard was killing more

640
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:20,068
than he was dying.

641
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:23,490
So clearly, on operators, that was too safe.

642
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,091
So, okay, and I just say, go work on the shield.

643
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:30,379
So now, I will explain you this story,

644
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,600
because it's really interesting, because you

645
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,162
will see that it's a two-step solution.

646
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:37,064
Because at that time, we knew that we had the problem,

647
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:38,805
and we knew we had to work on the shield.

648
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:43,208
But at that time, we didn't have the kind of process

649
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:43,968
that we have right now.

650
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:46,730
That means the analysts were still on one side of the team,

651
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,630
like far away.

652
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:50,372
They send us info about Blackbeard, about the shield.

653
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,594
But then we came back a designer,

654
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:55,115
on our room of designers, working on the solution

655
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:55,976
and the implementation.

656
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:58,457
So I'm like, OK, guys, let's act on the shield.

657
00:27:58,557 --> 00:27:59,597
And we make a change.

658
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:00,918
The shield was destructible.

659
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:04,419
At the beginning, he had 800 HP.

660
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,220
So we decided to change that to make it 150 HP

661
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,341
and add a second shield.

662
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:12,742
So you could have a second shield.

663
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:13,902
That means overall 300 HP.

664
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:18,445
but 150 HP per shield.

665
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:22,487
And it creates a nice mechanism of resource management.

666
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:24,068
And since it was the only ability,

667
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:27,350
we felt a bit bad to just nerf him down to this point.

668
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,532
And so we make that.

669
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:30,853
We believe it's interesting.

670
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:32,254
We make some PlayStation.

671
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:33,715
We discuss with pro and stuff like that.

672
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:34,175
We play it.

673
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,035
And we're like, that's good.

674
00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:35,356
That's good.

675
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,317
We were even like, pfff.

676
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:40,319
Maybe it's too big as a nerf.

677
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:43,722
Like maybe we might have put him in an underwhelming position.

678
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:46,745
But you know, at that point, it was the biggest issue

679
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:47,746
we ever had in the game.

680
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,469
So we were like, we need to strike hard to show

681
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:51,810
that we care about the meta.

682
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,753
And there is no overpowered character under our reign.

683
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:57,475
So confident enough, we push those changes.

684
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,016
And we look at the data.

685
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:02,010
And nothing changed.

686
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,331
Like, literally, nothing changed.

687
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:06,672
It was way above the other operator,

688
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,533
and we were like, oh, wow.

689
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:10,635
So, wow.

690
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:13,076
So we came back to our analyst friend,

691
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:15,838
and we were like, okay, so we validated

692
00:29:15,878 --> 00:29:16,798
that it was a problem.

693
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:18,419
We validated that it was a shield issue.

694
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,041
We nerved down the shield like, hey, insane.

695
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:23,162
We even took some clash from the community

696
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:24,203
and stuff like that for doing so.

697
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:27,045
And the guy is still like super overpowered.

698
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,726
So guys, we need your help on this point

699
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:30,907
because we don't really understand what is going on.

700
00:29:32,332 --> 00:29:35,820
Yeah, and so at the time, we were super happy,

701
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,885
because having designers coming to your desk being like,

702
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,789
oh my god, maybe he loves me or something.

703
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:45,983
And so we were like, but we can actually help you,

704
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:48,125
because we have lots of data about Blackbeard.

705
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:51,826
Like Kirill said, we had information about kill, death,

706
00:29:51,886 --> 00:29:54,028
but more especially about the shield.

707
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:57,609
Like we knew how much damage the shields would receive,

708
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,471
how many times it would be destroyed and everything.

709
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,492
So just by looking at the data, we

710
00:30:03,532 --> 00:30:05,853
saw that with the new shield that was supposed

711
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:07,594
to have a low amount of HP.

712
00:30:08,895 --> 00:30:11,737
it would break like one round out of 20.

713
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:15,238
So it's like, OK, basically it's not working.

714
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,019
It makes perfect sense that nothing changes,

715
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,401
because, well, it's still heavily protected.

716
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:25,462
And so what it is that, well, actually we

717
00:30:25,482 --> 00:30:27,203
have the data about the damage distribution.

718
00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:31,384
So we can look at how much damage the shield would receive.

719
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:34,746
And if you want to set a percentage of.

720
00:30:35,788 --> 00:30:37,948
the times the shield should be destroyed, we can do it.

721
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:40,509
So what we did is that we asked them.

722
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:42,210
They wanted to have about a third of the time

723
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,910
the shield to be destroyed.

724
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,251
So we just did a basic model trying

725
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:49,471
to add two distributions for the two shields,

726
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:50,892
depending on whether they were used or not,

727
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:56,773
to see if we put this threshold of damage at this level,

728
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,114
then this percentage of shields would break.

729
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:00,998
This is what we did.

730
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:04,499
We came back to the design team saying, hey, we've solved it.

731
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,019
And so you should put it down to 60.

732
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,860
And Lira's reaction at the time was like, no way.

733
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,140
This is just insane.

734
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,321
You could just put a piece of paper on that trifle,

735
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:16,301
and that would do the same thing.

736
00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:20,082
That's two to three bullets at most.

737
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:23,402
But we're like, guys, we do math.

738
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:25,803
We are pretty confident about this.

739
00:31:28,063 --> 00:31:29,743
And so luckily enough, this guy didn't.

740
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:32,345
So they're like, OK, I guess maybe you're right.

741
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,266
And so they trusted us on this.

742
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,367
And then they patched it.

743
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:39,128
And the community's reaction was exactly the same.

744
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:41,830
Like, everyone was like, this is the biggest

745
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,170
nerf in the history of Siege.

746
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:44,971
Like, this character is useless.

747
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:48,613
Like, nobody will play Nerf Beard ever again.

748
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:52,239
And so we had like memes for months and months after that.

749
00:31:52,800 --> 00:32:00,131
Except that we did the change and actually it finally brought Blackbeard back in line with the other operators.

750
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,047
He was still good.

751
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,049
Like, he was still one of the top faggots of the game,

752
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:07,970
which is like what he's supposed to do,

753
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,871
because that's what his gadget does.

754
00:32:10,651 --> 00:32:12,733
But like, he was actually a good operator.

755
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,514
And it took months for the community to figure that out.

756
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:18,336
So the pick rate went down to 2% or 3%,

757
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:21,478
and slowly went back up to the point

758
00:32:21,498 --> 00:32:25,481
where today it's now played in Pro League at the top level.

759
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,769
He's even considered one of the best operators in the game.

760
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:31,871
And except for maybe one change on one of these here,

761
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:34,753
nothing changed since we nerfed it for the first time.

762
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:38,955
So just by trying to get your data more carefully

763
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:41,057
and trying to work together, trying to find solutions

764
00:32:41,177 --> 00:32:45,480
and how to fix them using data smartly,

765
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,181
you can do great things for your game.

766
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:50,003
Even if it's counterintuitive, even if you're

767
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:52,925
playing the game, you can get some information that

768
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:53,545
is really useful.

769
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:56,168
And we meet Capitao later.

770
00:32:56,528 --> 00:32:57,369
Let's go back.

771
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,250
Bye-bye, Capitao.

772
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:01,513
And just to finish this on this example,

773
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:04,836
you have to keep in mind that here we are joking about it.

774
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:08,440
But at that time, imagine we were working on Anbu 6 Siege.

775
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,861
We were making some design.

776
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:13,645
So design documentation, prototype test, the two shields,

777
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:16,348
some new mechanics, like you have a resource management.

778
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,231
We send those documents to programmers, development team,

779
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:19,871
production team.

780
00:33:20,272 --> 00:33:20,892
They make the change.

781
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:22,754
They spend time and money working on it.

782
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:24,616
Then we put it into the game.

783
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,398
We look, and nothing happens.

784
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:27,539
Nothing happens.

785
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,161
It's pure waste of money.

786
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:32,385
It's like if we have put money on the fireplace.

787
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:32,905
The same thing.

788
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,266
So this is where we realized, OK, guys, we need to change,

789
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,726
and we need to do the things differently because we're

790
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:39,947
wasting so much time.

791
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:42,827
And just by talking with you, having you close to us,

792
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:46,628
it makes so much difference in terms of impact into the game.

793
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:49,249
So we should never, ever leave again

794
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:52,149
what we had with Blackbird in terms of production waste.

795
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:54,030
And we should always try to have you

796
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,650
and that with us in any kind of discussion

797
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,671
and anything related to design.

798
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:02,291
So Blackbird was kind of the turning point of our game.

799
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:04,093
relationship, I would say.

800
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:08,280
So now I will give you another example with Capitao, a faster

801
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,304
one, just to recap, to show you, yes, Blackbird was a big

802
00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:14,549
one, but this process worked super fine and super fast,

803
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:16,933
also for smaller adjustments that we might

804
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:17,874
encounter into the game.

805
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:21,177
So let's go back with the process, you know, like define problems.

806
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:23,658
You look at the capital, it's a bit of the charts.

807
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:26,599
So mostly the data that is detecting that.

808
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,322
Then we try to find the causes, so we discuss with Pro, community feedback.

809
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:37,645
So the causes from this guy went, you know, like, yeah, he has good utilities, the ability

810
00:34:37,665 --> 00:34:39,786
is okay, but the weapon are underwhelming.

811
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:44,489
And since Rainbow Six Siege is a shooter, we believe that the weapon should need a little

812
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:45,609
help and a little buff.

813
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,191
We validate the causes, we look at the data,

814
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:51,314
yes, the capital weapon was performing lower

815
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:54,557
than the other weapon, and the Geoffroy team validates that.

816
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:58,981
So we decided to push a solution where we were changing

817
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:03,145
and making some variation and some buff of the weapon,

818
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:08,129
sorry, using again this time the intelligence of those people.

819
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:09,991
And this is exactly like the patch note

820
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:12,192
that we were communicating, because the cool thing also

821
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:12,393
is that,

822
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:13,933
When you have this kind of process,

823
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,254
and when you're working with those people,

824
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,015
everything makes sense.

825
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,336
You can explain at every step what you are doing

826
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:21,716
and why you are doing it.

827
00:35:22,077 --> 00:35:23,857
And so it doesn't mean that you will always succeed.

828
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,018
It doesn't mean that every time you hit the spot.

829
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:28,219
But at least there is a reasoning,

830
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,220
and there is a math behind it, I would say.

831
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,020
And even when you talk with community,

832
00:35:32,441 --> 00:35:33,981
it's easier for them also to understand

833
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:36,982
what you are doing and why you are doing it that way.

834
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:38,363
So it's really valuable.

835
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,384
It allows us to have those kind of patch notes

836
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,324
that are super clear of.

837
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:42,643
what we are doing.

838
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,082
So quick recap, so we saw all the steps.

839
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:50,064
Define problem that imply a lot of data.

840
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:53,506
Find causes where the qualitative is super important.

841
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:56,528
Never underestimate the focus groups, the propagation,

842
00:35:56,548 --> 00:35:57,689
the survey, and stuff like that.

843
00:35:58,309 --> 00:35:59,850
And what is important is that at the end,

844
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,051
when you do your change, you need to follow up your changes.

845
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:03,452
This is what happened with Blackbird.

846
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:04,673
This is what happened with Capitao.

847
00:36:05,253 --> 00:36:07,294
Every time you push something live,

848
00:36:07,654 --> 00:36:09,775
you need to follow up and do the same exercise to see like,

849
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:11,556
okay, is everything balanced?

850
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:14,588
So in terms of conclusion, if there is one thing

851
00:36:14,628 --> 00:36:16,289
that we want you guys to take away today,

852
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:18,230
it's not our process and stuff like that

853
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,131
because it's really specificity

854
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:22,472
of how we work on Rainbow Six Siege,

855
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:25,353
and I don't believe things can be applied right away

856
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:27,454
in any game or any other project.

857
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,515
But at least keep in mind that features should be owned

858
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,056
by both game designer and analyst,

859
00:36:32,536 --> 00:36:34,057
at least when you're working on a live project.

860
00:36:34,497 --> 00:36:37,959
And we really believe that this is part of the success

861
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:38,739
and why we are...

862
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,943
we are working like that on Rebooting Siege,

863
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:45,406
is really like sharing everything with them.

864
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:47,068
And I know it's hard because as game designers,

865
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:51,814
we used to have kind of the last call on design topic,

866
00:36:51,914 --> 00:36:54,717
but you really need to learn to share with those people

867
00:36:54,757 --> 00:36:56,960
because they can really like add value

868
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,041
and just make you,

869
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:02,523
take better design decision, being data-informed,

870
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:04,144
and make better design solution.

871
00:37:04,604 --> 00:37:07,445
And for now, there is sadly only people

872
00:37:07,465 --> 00:37:10,345
that do analyst study, that come from school

873
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:13,006
with math and statistics, designer on the other side,

874
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:15,547
doing design school and prototyping and stuff like that.

875
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,768
And maybe in the future, there will be people

876
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:20,788
that will have both skill sets, but until then,

877
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:22,469
this is how we work on Rainbow Six Siege,

878
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:26,110
one team having analyst and design

879
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,190
working together on the design.

880
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:30,175
If you have questions, guys, thank you.

881
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:41,539
OK, question?

882
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:43,540
Thanks very much for the talk.

883
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,421
It was really interesting to hear you talk through perception

884
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:48,001
versus reality as it pertains to the game.

885
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:48,661
I've played a lot.

886
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:51,923
A lot of your anecdotes about.

887
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:56,048
Blackbeard in particular there reminds me kind of, you know,

888
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,428
thinking about the most recent update,

889
00:37:57,848 --> 00:37:59,829
where there's a lot of conversation around a character

890
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:02,189
called Lion that you introduced in March.

891
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:05,310
I'm sort of wondering, I'm sure it's very early,

892
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,990
but how are you accepting information around this character

893
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,971
where in the most recent Pro League,

894
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:15,231
we're seeing very high pick rates for Lion in Rainbow Six Siege?

895
00:38:16,732 --> 00:38:17,792
So what is the information telling you

896
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:19,452
and how are you processing it around this character in particular?

897
00:38:20,212 --> 00:38:21,293
Balancing so quick.

898
00:38:21,853 --> 00:38:23,574
So thanks a lot for that question.

899
00:38:23,674 --> 00:38:26,796
So the question was, with the recent release of an operator

900
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,338
that is working, he's been working really well,

901
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:32,280
especially in Pro League, so for our eSports scene.

902
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,201
So what do we do to deal with that?

903
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:37,903
So most of the time, before you release, like Leroy said,

904
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:40,645
trying to fine tune the balance in the power level

905
00:38:40,665 --> 00:38:42,046
of an operator is extremely hard.

906
00:38:42,146 --> 00:38:43,627
Because the context that you have,

907
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,668
you have PlayStation with designers

908
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:48,430
that have different levels, playing on a specific case

909
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,211
with a lot of variance.

910
00:38:49,891 --> 00:38:51,833
So usually for that, the pro players

911
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:54,455
are your best allies in terms of position.

912
00:38:54,575 --> 00:38:57,658
Because they can help you see what's going to go wrong,

913
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:59,740
try to tune the values before you set it up.

914
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:02,142
And what's important is that you make sure

915
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:03,723
that you can fix it once it's live.

916
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:05,465
So you need to have founders that you can tweak.

917
00:39:06,606 --> 00:39:10,469
And so the issue about what you asked us was that once it's

918
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,591
released, what do you do?

919
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:12,511
Because the point is that.

920
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:16,340
It's kind of hard because it's really early.

921
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,741
Sometimes you don't know if the operator is extremely strong.

922
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:22,222
If people haven't learned yet to play with or against,

923
00:39:22,302 --> 00:39:25,744
like in some situations, we've seen the win rates

924
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,505
decrease for weeks after the release of an operator.

925
00:39:29,025 --> 00:39:31,146
So it's not always easy to have that.

926
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,826
So sometimes you have clearing issues.

927
00:39:32,846 --> 00:39:36,748
You would see that the win rates of a team would spike and stay

928
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:38,629
there for at least one or two weeks.

929
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:40,229
But why we want to?

930
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,795
avoid is making a decision based on like one or two days on data.

931
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:50,003
So we usually wait at least one or two weeks to let the metagame to settle,

932
00:39:50,523 --> 00:39:53,928
to see what's happening, and then once we have that we use these parameters to tweak

933
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:55,210
the issues that we have.

934
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:59,796
Actually, it's quite similar to what you just said.

935
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:01,256
Looking at the data for Blackbeard,

936
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:03,437
it's in that when you push the update,

937
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:05,578
it took some time for the community

938
00:40:05,618 --> 00:40:07,979
to adapt to the new meta and find its place.

939
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:10,000
So you won't see the result right away.

940
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,480
So how do you approach that?

941
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,541
What do you know if the change actually

942
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:15,302
get the results we're expecting?

943
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:16,382
How long are you waiting?

944
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:17,983
Do you track a number of games?

945
00:40:18,003 --> 00:40:19,344
Do you know that kind of information?

946
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:21,664
Are you based on competition, e-sports scene?

947
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:23,225
When do you know, oh, you know what,

948
00:40:23,265 --> 00:40:24,946
we need to revisit that character again,

949
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:26,787
because clearly it's still not enough.

950
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:29,759
Again, it's balancing cell process.

951
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,647
You might talk, you know, like.

952
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:33,019
Yeah, so we have that balancing cell.

953
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:35,759
So what we do is that we release the content.

954
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:37,540
So two weeks after its release, we

955
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,060
are checking whether it's working or not.

956
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,480
The thing about using product data,

957
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:43,841
this is something that we've looked at,

958
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:45,221
but it's extremely tricky.

959
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:48,642
Because you have a very small sample of data,

960
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:50,062
because we don't have that many matches.

961
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:53,763
And let's say you have one very good player, the best

962
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:55,583
player of one's team, who's decided

963
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:57,023
to start playing a new operator.

964
00:40:57,043 --> 00:40:57,663
And then.

965
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:01,366
this guy could win a lot, but he would win with someone else as well.

966
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:03,748
And you could get a situation where

967
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:08,052
you would have this very tight match where they would

968
00:41:08,072 --> 00:41:09,513
play the operator for eleven rounds

969
00:41:10,394 --> 00:41:14,097
and sometimes some complete stomps and the operator would be able to play it for five rounds.

970
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:16,459
So sometimes some matches would...

971
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,921
way more heavily than others.

972
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:25,024
So usually we try to focus on the metrics for top players

973
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,845
and qualitative feedback from pro players

974
00:41:28,226 --> 00:41:31,147
to know how they feel, what's curving the issue, what

975
00:41:31,427 --> 00:41:34,309
they think make them lose or win with a specific provider.

976
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:36,110
And two weeks is mostly the time that we wait.

977
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,511
Like after we release the changings, we wait two weeks.

978
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:41,232
And then after two weeks, we look at the data, the player,

979
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:42,693
and we act if we need to act.

980
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,972
If I may, just the two weeks, was it because just you found

981
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:49,293
that usually it was like enough match were played,

982
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,774
and so that you get good information?

983
00:41:50,794 --> 00:41:53,216
It depends on the amount of data you get in two weeks,

984
00:41:53,356 --> 00:41:56,138
or was it just you pick a time in two weeks?

985
00:41:56,158 --> 00:41:57,959
We said two weeks because it represents

986
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:01,521
a number of games in our game.

987
00:42:01,882 --> 00:42:03,763
But yes, it's kind of a threshold

988
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,784
in terms of quantity.

989
00:42:04,804 --> 00:42:07,665
The game tends to stabilize after two weeks,

990
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:08,486
most of the time.

991
00:42:09,186 --> 00:42:09,366
Thanks.

992
00:42:11,788 --> 00:42:15,609
Hi, my company also got analysis and game designers, but

993
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:18,109
it's kind of hard to put them to work together.

994
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,870
It's like sometimes the game designer thing,

995
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,310
and they don't understand the games,

996
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,111
and it takes time for the analyst to tell

997
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:27,192
how to figure the data out.

998
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:30,533
Like, because my company is in China,

999
00:42:30,893 --> 00:42:32,113
and the market is very competitive,

1000
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:35,174
they got no time to listen to the analysis,

1001
00:42:35,574 --> 00:42:38,475
and tell them the mathematical things about the data.

1002
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,255
So my question is like, in your team,

1003
00:42:40,695 --> 00:42:42,096
how could you figure this out?

1004
00:42:43,056 --> 00:42:44,256
This question comes a lot.

1005
00:42:44,276 --> 00:42:46,857
So it's about how do we make an analyst working with designer,

1006
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,279
or at least most of the time, designer listen to analyst.

1007
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:51,979
When we had this example of Blackbeard,

1008
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,560
when he came back saying, guys, it should be 60 HP,

1009
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:57,801
obviously the first effect was to not listen

1010
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,462
to those people that are not designers,

1011
00:42:59,482 --> 00:43:02,043
that don't know how we are making games.

1012
00:43:02,323 --> 00:43:04,584
The thing is, as I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation,

1013
00:43:05,184 --> 00:43:06,504
we had a team of Rainbow Six Siege,

1014
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:07,705
and we were playing all together.

1015
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,526
And this is, to me, the key part is that those guys,

1016
00:43:10,766 --> 00:43:13,407
they were playing the game even more than us designers.

1017
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:16,448
They were so embedded into the game that at some point,

1018
00:43:17,368 --> 00:43:20,390
to me, it was like, OK, so clearly you speak

1019
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,230
the language of the game.

1020
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,351
When we are talking about what happened in the Pro League

1021
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:27,032
last night, or what are the new tendencies on Reddit,

1022
00:43:27,412 --> 00:43:29,533
those guys were like, hey, I saw the match, me too.

1023
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,394
So they were so connected to the game.

1024
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:35,177
that there were no gap between us.

1025
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:37,900
And that's why we are always saying,

1026
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,342
when you're working on a game, if you're an analyst,

1027
00:43:40,382 --> 00:43:41,403
if you're a programmer, if you want

1028
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:45,387
to talk to a designer or people that are handling the content.

1029
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:48,670
And even sometimes, designers should play their own game.

1030
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,451
But yes, you need to spend time.

1031
00:43:50,992 --> 00:43:52,752
playing the game, because this will give you

1032
00:43:52,772 --> 00:43:53,873
the language of the game.

1033
00:43:54,273 --> 00:43:56,373
And then you will be able to speak the kind of set.

1034
00:43:56,413 --> 00:43:59,214
Because we both have two different jobs.

1035
00:43:59,594 --> 00:44:03,696
Sometimes he talks to me about the Simpson paradox, data, SQL,

1036
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:04,436
basis, whatever.

1037
00:44:04,456 --> 00:44:05,056
I'm like, woohoo.

1038
00:44:05,616 --> 00:44:08,357
And if I start to talk into design, prototyping,

1039
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:09,818
and stuff like that, he's like, OK, guys,

1040
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:10,798
I don't know what you're talking about.

1041
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:12,318
But the things that we are in common.

1042
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:13,379
eat the game.

1043
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,001
The language of the game is the fact

1044
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,544
that we share the same passion and love for this game.

1045
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,428
So to us, at least, this is how it works

1046
00:44:20,448 --> 00:44:22,290
and how we notice each other.

1047
00:44:22,711 --> 00:44:25,134
It's because we share the same love of the game.

1048
00:44:25,434 --> 00:44:27,417
So play the game and show to the designers

1049
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:31,842
that, yes, you are as much involved as them into the game.

1050
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:37,187
Yeah, and the same way you have like, it's dangerous to have designers using data without

1051
00:44:37,227 --> 00:44:41,632
knowing statistics, it's extremely dangerous to have analysts using data without knowing

1052
00:44:41,652 --> 00:44:41,952
the game.

1053
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:47,457
Like sometimes you have a bias that could be easily explained by the fact that you cannot

1054
00:44:47,537 --> 00:44:49,940
have like this operator with this one because it's a bad interaction.

1055
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,305
And if you don't know that, you could take the wrong conclusions and it could like shift

1056
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:56,786
all your conclusions way off.

1057
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,396
Hello. How do you choose and manage the data you want to track?

1058
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:05,862
Do you plan in advance what kind of data you want to have?

1059
00:45:06,262 --> 00:45:09,748
Do you choose to track new one when you discover there is a problem?

1060
00:45:10,618 --> 00:45:11,879
Yeah, that's a good question.

1061
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,240
So before we had this process, it

1062
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,501
was like when you're working on a AAA,

1063
00:45:18,141 --> 00:45:19,602
you have to make some decisions.

1064
00:45:19,622 --> 00:45:21,242
You reach a point where you need to ship,

1065
00:45:21,882 --> 00:45:26,004
and you reach a point where you need to cut some stuff.

1066
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:29,885
And what were the things that we were cutting every time

1067
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:30,725
at the highest level?

1068
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:33,167
the data.

1069
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,869
People are, hey, we need to add this tracker and this stuff.

1070
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:36,770
Hey, we don't have time.

1071
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:37,891
You need to ship and stuff like that.

1072
00:45:38,512 --> 00:45:41,314
Now, since we are working that way, since we have this process,

1073
00:45:41,635 --> 00:45:43,676
the cool things of having the designer being

1074
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:45,979
embedded at the beginning of the conception of a feature

1075
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:48,881
is that when we define the spec of the feature,

1076
00:45:49,362 --> 00:45:51,844
now we have directly what they need.

1077
00:45:51,904 --> 00:45:52,064
OK.

1078
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:55,548
For us, in terms of process, gate, and validation,

1079
00:45:55,968 --> 00:45:58,311
we are not going through a gate if we are not

1080
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:01,475
data ready in terms of code, in terms of feature.

1081
00:46:01,555 --> 00:46:02,156
You see what I mean?

1082
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:07,101
Because now this is totally part of how we reach the goal,

1083
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:09,103
or we reach the beta of a feature.

1084
00:46:09,204 --> 00:46:10,145
And since it's a

1085
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:13,106
since it's a part of the design, you know, like exactly like,

1086
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:16,567
oh, if there is not this ability or this cool down,

1087
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,668
we don't ship the thing.

1088
00:46:17,748 --> 00:46:19,528
And now there is like, OK, but if there is no data,

1089
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,108
we don't ship the thing.

1090
00:46:20,608 --> 00:46:21,789
And in terms of spec, maybe you want

1091
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:24,650
to talk about how you decide what kind of data you are

1092
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,290
looking for.

1093
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,151
Usually try to, there's a lot of discussion involved

1094
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:31,312
with the designers to try to figure out the mechanisms they

1095
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:33,833
want to put in place and make sure how they can be used.

1096
00:46:34,213 --> 00:46:38,054
Like, let's say you have something that has an impact,

1097
00:46:38,134 --> 00:46:39,734
a debuff on someone else's.

1098
00:46:39,994 --> 00:46:42,175
You want to check whether the people who get killed

1099
00:46:42,355 --> 00:46:44,215
who are affected by this debuff.

1100
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:46,856
You want to see the number of times it triggers.

1101
00:46:46,876 --> 00:46:48,836
You want to see, like, everything you can think of.

1102
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:51,857
Because once you have an issue, if you don't have tracking,

1103
00:46:51,997 --> 00:46:56,158
if you cannot verify that, well, this effect is way too strong,

1104
00:46:56,798 --> 00:46:59,259
then you'll just go with a black belt again.

1105
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:01,339
You're like, OK, well, I think we just tune the value

1106
00:47:01,399 --> 00:47:02,220
and see what's up.

1107
00:47:03,557 --> 00:47:07,900
So this data list you want to track came from the analysts themselves?

1108
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,541
Or it's like a mutual process?

1109
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:15,845
So the analysts put it directly in the game specifications.

1110
00:47:15,925 --> 00:47:17,786
When you're doing that, you should send us an event saying,

1111
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:18,526
OK, I've done that.

1112
00:47:19,187 --> 00:47:21,628
Exactly, as we are bad to ask for reporting,

1113
00:47:21,729 --> 00:47:23,530
because we ask for the wrong reporting.

1114
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,931
We are also bad to ask for the tracking.

1115
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:28,333
We think, OK, it should be good to track this kind of stuff.

1116
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:31,615
So what do you want to know exactly about this guy?

1117
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:32,315
But we want to know that.

1118
00:47:32,755 --> 00:47:34,817
Yes, but you should try more of that and that and that.

1119
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:36,258
Thank you very much.

1120
00:47:36,278 --> 00:47:37,458
Hi.

1121
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:39,440
Before I ask my question, I just want

1122
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,800
to compliment you guys and your team

1123
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,602
for one of the biggest turnaround stories

1124
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:43,762
in the history of this industry.

1125
00:47:43,782 --> 00:47:44,303
Thank you.

1126
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:45,203
It's absolutely incredible.

1127
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,666
My question is, you guys have been looking at pick rate

1128
00:47:49,726 --> 00:47:51,007
and win rate for a long time.

1129
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:54,409
Is there any big insights in those data

1130
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:56,290
that you guys have found in looking those numbers

1131
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,031
that come up and down, like stories that you're like,

1132
00:47:58,071 --> 00:47:58,732
if we only would have.

1133
00:47:59,183 --> 00:48:01,744
looked at win rate and pick rate through this angle

1134
00:48:01,764 --> 00:48:02,825
or through this question, it really

1135
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:04,486
would have saved us a lot of headaches early on.

1136
00:48:05,907 --> 00:48:10,029
Yeah, so like I said, most of the time people would be like,

1137
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:11,970
OK, you're just looking at pick rates and win rates

1138
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,651
and call it a day.

1139
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:16,893
What we do, what we've been trying to do a lot more

1140
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:18,834
is try to add more context into that.

1141
00:48:18,934 --> 00:48:20,194
Because sometimes, like.

1142
00:48:21,155 --> 00:48:22,455
No metrics is perfect.

1143
00:48:22,675 --> 00:48:25,316
Like, you could have something that would win a lot,

1144
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:27,377
but that could be very situational.

1145
00:48:27,777 --> 00:48:29,437
So let's say if you would use that operator

1146
00:48:29,477 --> 00:48:31,178
in a different context, it wouldn't work.

1147
00:48:31,558 --> 00:48:33,018
So what we're trying to do is just

1148
00:48:33,098 --> 00:48:37,360
to add that situationality to the different operators

1149
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,140
to put more context.

1150
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,380
Because every time we want to define a problem,

1151
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:43,581
say, OK, this operator, there's a problem with it.

1152
00:48:44,062 --> 00:48:47,082
We want to understand why the pick rate or the win rate

1153
00:48:47,162 --> 00:48:47,543
is where it is.

1154
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:51,526
So we try to add as much context as we can.

1155
00:48:51,886 --> 00:48:53,868
So usually it's hard because you would release some data

1156
00:48:53,888 --> 00:48:55,490
to the community and they'd be like, well, you

1157
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,330
should have thought about that.

1158
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:57,712
And we're like, we did.

1159
00:48:57,732 --> 00:49:01,135
We're just going to send you a 10 pages report

1160
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:03,437
on why it should be that way.

1161
00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:06,760
Yeah, you should be extremely careful.

1162
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,622
And that's why you need a list to do that.

1163
00:49:12,434 --> 00:49:18,023
Hey, so your slide earlier had a couple of outliers, uh, Ayla and Tachanka. Um, you nerfed

1164
00:49:18,504 --> 00:49:22,610
Ayla and you kind of gave Tachanka a buff with that shield. Uh, do you feel like Lord Tachanka

1165
00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:27,458
is in a good place right now? And what sort of design challenges does he pre- present?

1166
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:29,239
So the thing with Tachanka is that there is,

1167
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,501
so the design issue is that, as we said,

1168
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:33,742
this game was made in a context where,

1169
00:49:33,782 --> 00:49:35,002
when they were working on it,

1170
00:49:35,063 --> 00:49:37,464
we didn't know how Siege was going to be played.

1171
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:42,286
And as Geoffrey said, the core ability of Tachanka,

1172
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:43,967
deploying a turret that means...

1173
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:48,328
trading his movement ability to firepower,

1174
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:51,009
it's not something that works in Rainbow Six Siege.

1175
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:53,169
Because of the destruction, because of all the Intel cam,

1176
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:56,070
not being able to move is not something that works.

1177
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,391
So the thing is that if it was not Lord Tachanka,

1178
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:03,311
we would have revamped the operator

1179
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:04,611
and maybe totally changed it,

1180
00:50:04,632 --> 00:50:06,712
like maybe remove the turret, do something else.

1181
00:50:07,312 --> 00:50:11,213
But at some point, it becomes kind of, I would say, God.

1182
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:13,533
for a lot of people.

1183
00:50:13,893 --> 00:50:16,574
So we're in this situation of if we really want to address it,

1184
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:19,895
we need to change it in a way that it won't be Tashanka

1185
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:20,215
anymore.

1186
00:50:20,295 --> 00:50:20,896
See what I mean?

1187
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:22,156
It will be a new operator.

1188
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:26,477
And it's kind of a difficult decision

1189
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:28,938
to take because it's not only program design at this point.

1190
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:31,099
It's also what the community, the stories

1191
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:31,959
that they are making with it.

1192
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:36,520
So it's like, to me, since As The Lord is above us,

1193
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,001
I would say he's a nice place right now.

1194
00:50:39,981 --> 00:50:40,201
Thank you.

1195
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:48,815
Back when you were talking about Blackbeard and the analysts put forth the solution that

1196
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:52,459
was at least according to the data, the correct one, and then the designers are like, oh my

1197
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:54,020
god, that's way too low, we'll never do that.

1198
00:50:54,441 --> 00:51:00,226
How do you reconcile what the data suggests and is probably right versus the opinions

1199
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:03,710
of the designers and their more like human reactions into what they believe the game

1200
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:03,990
should be?

1201
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:04,470
That's the thing.

1202
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:05,451
To me, it came like a...

1203
00:51:06,632 --> 00:51:08,495
It's because those guys were playing the same game as us.

1204
00:51:08,976 --> 00:51:11,919
So if those guys were confident, like having

1205
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,923
we put the patches, and then they

1206
00:51:15,124 --> 00:51:17,767
are going to play those Blackbird in matches,

1207
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:20,531
and they are fine saying, like, yeah, 60 HP is enough.

1208
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:22,894
Like, it still creates this interesting gameplay

1209
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:23,935
at the window and stuff like that.

1210
00:51:24,656 --> 00:51:27,177
But they have as much as good feelings than us,

1211
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,218
plus because they know the same game,

1212
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:30,879
they are playing a lot with us.

1213
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,660
Plus they have the math aspect of it.

1214
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,862
So I mean, why not listen to them?

1215
00:51:36,162 --> 00:51:37,263
And yes, it was a bet.

1216
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,685
But if you look at what we did us before, yes,

1217
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,446
it was a bet in terms of community action.

1218
00:51:42,486 --> 00:51:44,066
But their solution was super simple.

1219
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:45,687
We just changed the value of a shield.

1220
00:51:45,707 --> 00:51:48,509
So in terms of cost versus reward, if it works.

1221
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,281
It was kind of easy to try it.

1222
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:53,181
The thing was like, one of the things

1223
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:54,862
that we were I think a bit afraid was like,

1224
00:51:55,502 --> 00:51:56,683
if it doesn't work again,

1225
00:51:56,903 --> 00:51:59,464
it's like we really look like stupid people.

1226
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:00,004
You know what I mean?

1227
00:52:00,365 --> 00:52:03,006
But to me, I'm very humble when people talk

1228
00:52:03,026 --> 00:52:04,286
about mathematics and stuff like that.

1229
00:52:04,626 --> 00:52:07,528
So I tend to believe them when they do the job.

1230
00:52:08,868 --> 00:52:10,029
Why am I speaking in this mic?

1231
00:52:12,605 --> 00:52:16,109
Okay, so Siege has a very strong community and that's because of a lot of the effort

1232
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:19,133
that you guys put forward to, you know, listening to them and making them feel like they have

1233
00:52:19,153 --> 00:52:19,874
an input in the game.

1234
00:52:20,174 --> 00:52:23,858
But how do you decide how much weight to give them at the table and, you know, how do you

1235
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:26,902
try to avoid situations like, you know, the infamous Bartlett University?

1236
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:32,051
That's the thing, that's why we call it qualitative data.

1237
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:34,653
That means we have process for that.

1238
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:38,857
That means exactly as you are tracking data,

1239
00:52:38,997 --> 00:52:41,640
like it's super serious, a programmer putting

1240
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,501
some hook in the code.

1241
00:52:43,021 --> 00:52:46,623
gathering qualitative data, that means coming from the community, coming from the pro.

1242
00:52:47,043 --> 00:52:53,506
It's also a process that is super serious, and you have where you have metrics, you have

1243
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,307
a process on how you gather that.

1244
00:52:55,387 --> 00:52:59,369
It's not like, oh, this morning I went on Reddit, they're talking about this guy, I

1245
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,389
think he's bad, we should do something.

1246
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:00,930
You see what I mean?

1247
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:05,632
It's more like we say we have pro players that come, we have focus groups, we have dedicated

1248
00:53:05,672 --> 00:53:07,113
people that know how to...

1249
00:53:07,973 --> 00:53:13,074
manage and handle those focus groups with animated them,

1250
00:53:13,415 --> 00:53:13,855
ask questions.

1251
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,776
We prepare some kind of survey, and we

1252
00:53:16,796 --> 00:53:19,616
make a correlation between data and what they are saying.

1253
00:53:19,997 --> 00:53:21,237
Most of the time, as Geoffroy said,

1254
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:23,978
we have a lot of data in this game, a lot, a lot of data.

1255
00:53:24,558 --> 00:53:26,179
And mostly, what qualitative is doing,

1256
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,139
it's help us to focus and look at some aspect of the game.

1257
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,780
OK, there is an issue with this guy.

1258
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,541
People seem to complain about this aspect of the game.

1259
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:38,284
Let's put the light on the data and see if there is a correlation.

1260
00:53:39,105 --> 00:53:39,365
Thank you.

1261
00:53:42,027 --> 00:53:48,673
I was wondering, in your experience, is there a sample size where you thought that this

1262
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:53,957
relationship just accelerated between game design and the data?

1263
00:53:54,617 --> 00:53:58,180
Where previously maybe it wasn't so highly correlated?

1264
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:02,066
on the data with the players, and then after,

1265
00:54:02,446 --> 00:54:05,247
we just a certain threshold of whatever,

1266
00:54:05,267 --> 00:54:09,708
that you really started getting a lot of info out of this.

1267
00:54:10,028 --> 00:54:13,389
You mean sample size, statistically speaking?

1268
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:15,409
Of the player base.

1269
00:54:15,429 --> 00:54:19,690
I mean, if you went from 500,000 players to like a million,

1270
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,031
or if you have a player base of 100,000.

1271
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:27,212
Is this relationship, could this relationship still continue between game design and...

1272
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:29,653
Oh, okay, yeah.

1273
00:54:29,973 --> 00:54:36,634
You need to have reliable data, because otherwise you would just make assumptions, or you couldn't

1274
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:40,135
be as precise as these guys did.

1275
00:54:40,835 --> 00:54:48,317
So we are lucky enough to have a big player base, so we can focus on a smaller group of

1276
00:54:48,337 --> 00:54:48,777
top players.

1277
00:54:48,797 --> 00:54:51,698
So basically what we do is that we adjust the...

1278
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:57,343
the size of the context to have enough information to provide them with what they need.

1279
00:54:58,564 --> 00:55:03,649
Right, so sorry, so just to reiterate, was there a point where you felt like when the

1280
00:55:03,689 --> 00:55:09,094
player base went from 500,000 to 1 million or something like that, or accelerated I think

1281
00:55:09,134 --> 00:55:13,698
with 20 million or whatever, was there a certain point that you really felt like there was

1282
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:17,902
a strong connection between the game design and data, or where previously it wasn't such

1283
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:18,563
a strong connection?

1284
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,535
No, we always had a...

1285
00:55:23,485 --> 00:55:24,705
enough data.

1286
00:55:24,765 --> 00:55:26,626
We always had lots of data.

1287
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:30,207
We never went down to 10,000 players a day.

1288
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,948
Even just considering PC only, we

1289
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:37,869
have enough players to be tweaking.

1290
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:39,929
We never reach that point, so it's really hard to tell.

1291
00:55:40,389 --> 00:55:42,310
And I never see, even with the game growing,

1292
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,471
I never see a correlation of increasing

1293
00:55:45,511 --> 00:55:47,812
of the quality of the version.

1294
00:55:48,032 --> 00:55:51,192
I think we were always above the cool threshold.

1295
00:55:51,613 --> 00:55:52,353
All right, thank you.

1296
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:58,300
Hi. First of all, thanks for sharing your methodology and the way that you're approaching

1297
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,965
some of these challenges. My question has to do with in the, what you've shared today

1298
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:09,130
or even beyond it, are there particular topics or parts of this methodology that are difficult

1299
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:14,575
for you guys to share with players? And if so, what are the challenges to being more

1300
00:56:14,695 --> 00:56:17,217
open or more thorough in explaining why you do what you do?

1301
00:56:19,154 --> 00:56:22,819
One thing that I find quite challenging is sharing data,

1302
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,983
because usually when you send that to the payers,

1303
00:56:25,003 --> 00:56:27,967
you would get either people who don't know statistics,

1304
00:56:28,288 --> 00:56:29,469
and you would get like very.

1305
00:56:30,505 --> 00:56:35,786
like very very wrong interpretation and you'd be like but no you didn't understand and you would

1306
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:40,408
get people who do know statistics and be like but have you thought about this and this or this effect

1307
00:56:40,508 --> 00:56:45,249
and you're like well we have but we didn't want to just give you too much information because

1308
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:49,170
people would not understand and it would take too much time. So like pushing information and

1309
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,191
see the community reacts like in two ways.

1310
00:56:52,051 --> 00:56:55,032
that sometimes can be frustrating.

1311
00:56:55,693 --> 00:56:58,914
So trying to just focus and make it as simple and clear

1312
00:56:58,954 --> 00:57:00,795
as possible, I think it can help.

1313
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:03,277
Do you think that narrowing, sorry, a follow up,

1314
00:57:03,297 --> 00:57:06,058
but do you think that narrowing the conversations to buckets

1315
00:57:06,378 --> 00:57:08,859
of very experienced people who are discussing this

1316
00:57:08,979 --> 00:57:10,820
versus parts of your community that are less experienced,

1317
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,921
do you think that would have an effect?

1318
00:57:11,941 --> 00:57:14,022
Or is that something you have any desire to do in the future?

1319
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:17,001
Hard to tell.

1320
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:20,643
I think at some point we had like a, we did like a,

1321
00:57:20,724 --> 00:57:24,266
we released some raw data to the full community.

1322
00:57:24,286 --> 00:57:27,187
Like we let the full, the big community, like Reddit

1323
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:29,509
and all of those people, play with the raw data.

1324
00:57:29,649 --> 00:57:32,491
But the thing that there were one bias is that we spent a lot

1325
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:34,832
of time trying to communicate with the community,

1326
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:37,974
as Geoffroy said, like trying to explain a simple and clear

1327
00:57:38,014 --> 00:57:39,915
concept about how to work with the data.

1328
00:57:40,656 --> 00:57:42,497
And we were surprised to see like the,

1329
00:57:43,257 --> 00:57:44,698
I mean, the way they were handling it,

1330
00:57:44,718 --> 00:57:46,100
they were like, every time someone like,

1331
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,761
well, not every time, but there were some posts

1332
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:49,402
where people think like, okay, look,

1333
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:50,663
I saw that in the data, you know,

1334
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:52,665
if I do this and this, it shows that this guy is broken.

1335
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:55,167
And there were often some people saying,

1336
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:58,170
hey, but wait, remember, it depends on the context

1337
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,611
and stuff like that, so you know, they start to,

1338
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:01,632
personally, I really believe that,

1339
00:58:02,013 --> 00:58:04,054
and because it's maybe I'm like an idealist,

1340
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:07,277
I really believe that the way you're talking to people

1341
00:58:07,557 --> 00:58:09,819
depends on the way they will talk you back.

1342
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:10,960
They will talk you back.

1343
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,644
So if you think people are smart and they can understand,

1344
00:58:17,144 --> 00:58:19,606
the more you explain them and the more you take time to,

1345
00:58:20,546 --> 00:58:22,527
I don't want to say educate them because I don't think

1346
00:58:22,547 --> 00:58:24,168
they have the same sense in English.

1347
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:27,971
But you really try to be transparent, and it takes time.

1348
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:29,712
But honestly, I think we saw some.

1349
00:58:30,412 --> 00:58:31,573
Some interesting, uh.

1350
00:58:31,914 --> 00:58:32,794
People are smart.

1351
00:58:32,834 --> 00:58:35,297
Like, there are smart people in the gaming community

1352
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:37,739
that can help you monitor this.

1353
00:58:37,779 --> 00:58:39,200
It's only an issue when you're not

1354
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,282
able to respond to these people.

1355
00:58:41,342 --> 00:58:43,804
Because I want to talk to them.

1356
00:58:44,204 --> 00:58:48,828
Because these are passionate, like very interesting topics.

1357
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:50,189
And you want to share that.

1358
00:58:50,209 --> 00:58:51,571
You want to say, yeah, we thought about that.

1359
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,052
And we saw that this was an issue as well.

1360
00:58:53,092 --> 00:58:54,533
But we don't have time.

1361
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:54,913
But I think.

1362
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,501
Releasing data to the community is something

1363
00:58:57,541 --> 00:59:00,864
that we've been working on to have a more stable clean process.

1364
00:59:00,984 --> 00:59:03,506
And I think it will help in these discussions.

1365
00:59:03,846 --> 00:59:03,986
Yeah.

1366
00:59:04,106 --> 00:59:04,566
Thank you so much.

1367
00:59:04,867 --> 00:59:05,047
Thanks.

1368
00:59:05,467 --> 00:59:07,088
I think we have time for one last question.

1369
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:07,633
Am I?

1370
00:59:07,893 --> 00:59:08,053
Yeah.

1371
00:59:08,113 --> 00:59:09,555
Because we need to clear the room.

1372
00:59:09,735 --> 00:59:10,195
OK, sorry.

1373
00:59:10,736 --> 00:59:11,496
But I want to ask you a question.

1374
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:14,299
My question is kind of out of the session,

1375
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:19,042
but I was curious about how the culture was made

1376
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:21,605
to hire an analyst in your project.

1377
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:26,469
Because in Japan, on mobile, we're really related to it.

1378
00:59:26,589 --> 00:59:26,969
Because for.

1379
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:34,735
the purpose to monetize, we have analysts, but on like in PCs and consoles, we don't have analysts

1380
00:59:34,895 --> 00:59:40,799
and we don't take budgets for to hire the analysts. So how was the culture made in your company?

1381
00:59:41,975 --> 00:59:43,236
It's complicated.

1382
00:59:43,256 --> 00:59:45,257
It's kind of started with the lab.

1383
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,097
Yeah, it came.

1384
00:59:46,117 --> 00:59:48,599
It started at Ubisoft with a user test.

1385
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:52,561
So we had these small focus groups

1386
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:53,882
during the development of the game.

1387
00:59:54,222 --> 00:59:57,044
And we had analysts at the time, so making sure

1388
00:59:57,064 --> 00:59:59,826
that we could get some tracking information in the builds,

1389
01:00:00,286 --> 01:00:03,408
and then see what were the players actually doing.

1390
01:00:03,828 --> 01:00:05,669
And so since we had that, we had people who were like, well,

1391
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,932
Once you've launched your game, we can also

1392
01:00:07,992 --> 01:00:10,216
help you see what people, what players are doing live,

1393
01:00:10,476 --> 01:00:12,219
and then send you some reports about what's happening.

1394
01:00:12,259 --> 01:00:13,260
So it started like this.

1395
01:00:14,082 --> 01:00:15,864
And so what we did on Rainbow Six Siege

1396
01:00:15,905 --> 01:00:17,727
is going further than this and making sure

1397
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:20,031
that we are communicating and making

1398
01:00:20,111 --> 01:00:21,092
the best use of that data.

1399
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:25,219
And to give you a quick last anecdote story,

1400
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:27,161
it's like when I was,

1401
01:00:27,522 --> 01:00:28,943
one of the first things that I was doing on Cities

1402
01:00:28,963 --> 01:00:30,886
that I was doing on, at some point,

1403
01:00:31,326 --> 01:00:34,190
I was asked to work on the kind of experience,

1404
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,972
monetization, you know, a lot of numbers

1405
01:00:36,012 --> 01:00:37,033
and balancing and stuff like that.

1406
01:00:37,754 --> 01:00:39,916
and I knew that was not super good in math.

1407
01:00:40,357 --> 01:00:42,639
So I was like, okay, who is the smartest guy on this floor?

1408
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,621
And this guy, I was like, yeah, I know math.

1409
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,043
I said, okay, come at my desk and I start.

1410
01:00:46,283 --> 01:00:47,724
And this is how we met together.

1411
01:00:48,165 --> 01:00:49,927
And he said, I mean, you're really good at math actually.

1412
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:51,328
You know, like it's interesting what you're doing

1413
01:00:51,368 --> 01:00:52,089
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1414
01:00:52,589 --> 01:00:53,350
And then we.

1415
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:53,751
Yeah.

1416
01:00:55,873 --> 01:00:56,554
Thank you guys very much.

1417
01:00:56,834 --> 01:00:57,034
Thank you.
