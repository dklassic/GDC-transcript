1
00:00:06,185 --> 00:00:08,685
A lot of people here want to learn about banning players.

2
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:09,346
That's pretty cool.

3
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:14,187
I've been asked to remind you,

4
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:16,488
please put all your phones and tablets

5
00:00:16,588 --> 00:00:19,108
and anything else on silent, please.

6
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:22,109
My name's Devin Connors.

7
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,810
I'm the community manager for Psionic Studios.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,531
We make a game called Rocket League,

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,751
and today I'm here to talk about the language ban system

10
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:32,052
that we put into Rocket League last summer.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,314
And just a few of the things we'll be talking about today is just a brief catch up on what

12
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:42,499
Rocket League is and how we had to catch up to our own growth over the last two and a

13
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:42,919
half years.

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,045
The inspiration and the goals for this language ban system that we built, how we put the team

15
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:54,791
together and the process that we used, the execution of that, the results and the reception

16
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:58,175
from our community, and some of the changes and future plans we have in mind.

17
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:05,283
For those of you who are unfamiliar, Rocket League launched in summer 2015 on PS4 and

18
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:05,623
Steam.

19
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:09,468
It was a PS Plus game on Steam right near launch.

20
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:15,055
We followed that up on Xbox One the next year and then Thanksgiving last year on Nintendo

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,841
Switch and coming later this year we're going to be doing a version for Xbox One X as well.

22
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:26,604
So far we have over 43 million players worldwide with over 2 billion matches played.

23
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:30,706
And last but not least, RLCS, our chief eSports league,

24
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:33,147
along with all the other eSports activations that we have.

25
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:37,749
It's one of the few eSports that's truly family friendly and appropriate for all ages.

26
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:44,912
So with Rocket League, when the game launched we were expecting

27
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,834
about 10,000 concurrent players in the launch window.

28
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:52,075
That ended up being a little more than that,

29
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:55,757
closer to about 100,000, which is great.

30
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:58,819
Business is good, but when you grow that quickly,

31
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:01,581
you have to catch up to your own growth in many ways,

32
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:05,603
whether it's content, features, or in my case,

33
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:07,684
with the community team and the customer care team,

34
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:11,946
catching up with the pitfalls of player behavior

35
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:12,687
in online games.

36
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:19,295
The more players you have, the more matches are being played, and just the more natural

37
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:25,458
opportunity there is for the typical kinds of online verbal text harassment, stuff like

38
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:26,759
that that you see in online games.

39
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:31,181
And to help catch up with this, we hired for key positions in a few different departments,

40
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:34,623
including the community team, the customer care team.

41
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:35,663
Is Franco here?

42
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:37,384
Franco, maybe?

43
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:39,025
I think he's on his way.

44
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:41,366
Our customer care manager is popping in at some point.

45
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:47,776
and also our online services team, which is half of our engineering squad that focuses

46
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:54,538
on our back end, the matchmaking system, getting players into servers, the trade system, stuff

47
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:54,838
like that.

48
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,400
What really inspired us to build this tool was kind of the community.

49
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:07,499
community feelings around how toxic players are being handled in Rocket League.

50
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,287
We've had a ban tool for a long time, since launch, but it was a manual process for us

51
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:18,391
so we just weren't hitting the quantity of players that we needed to.

52
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,854
And even though we weren't talking about it publicly very much,

53
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,197
the players of our game were pretty hip to that

54
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:27,819
within the first few months after the game launched.

55
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,701
And you know, here's a great example on our subreddit

56
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:32,743
talking about how the report system does nothing.

57
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:36,306
I think this is something that you'll see in a number of online games,

58
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:40,569
big or small, you know, just seeing harassment in matches

59
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,272
immediately leads to the conclusion that there's no sort of

60
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:45,994
disciplinary action being taken against these players.

61
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:54,101
So that really inspired us to flesh out this system and build it in a way that we were hitting as many players as we could,

62
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:59,185
and really driving the narrative that Psyonix and Rocket League are very much community first,

63
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:04,970
and we're doing everything we can to work with the community and make sure that their opinions are heard.

64
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:11,131
So some of the goals, again, community first, that's something that we take very seriously

65
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:11,792
at the studio.

66
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:16,816
And with that in mind, we really wanted to serve the community, moderate the community,

67
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:21,259
without completely sterilizing the online play experience.

68
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,243
Rocket League is a very competitive game by nature, similar to fighting games and other

69
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:27,444
sports games that you might see.

70
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:33,609
And with that competitive element, you're going to see some amount of appropriate

71
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:36,910
Competitive banter, we'll leave it at that for now.

72
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,192
So really, you want to draw a line in the sand

73
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:41,494
of what's appropriate versus what's inappropriate,

74
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:44,056
and that's where this goal came in.

75
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:46,639
We also wanted to reduce the manual workload

76
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,300
on the community and customer care teams.

77
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,664
You know, we were really focused on the worst offenders

78
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:53,905
when it was a manual process,

79
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,667
and we wanted to take that same philosophy

80
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:57,689
and apply it to all of our players.

81
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,111
Using this automation,

82
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:06,116
was important to us, but we wanted to make sure that it fit in with our current terms of use and our code of conduct.

83
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:11,281
And we also wanted to deploy this without dramatically affecting the production schedule.

84
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:15,124
We try to push out six to eight major updates a year,

85
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:21,590
and being able to build and execute this system without affecting any of those updates was really important to us.

86
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:28,007
So assembling the team, it was definitely a multi-discipline

87
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,107
effort at the studio.

88
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,928
The community team handles player behavior

89
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:33,848
and the code of conduct.

90
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:36,088
That's myself and Kevin Sweeney.

91
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:40,729
Our customer care team, led by Franco with Derek Harvey.

92
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,870
Our chief data scientist, Eric Carpenter,

93
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,490
who did a lot of the heavy lifting on the algorithm side.

94
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,371
Dan, Thomas, and Matt at Online Services

95
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:51,631
for helping to build out the backend tool

96
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,332
that we use to...

97
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:57,454
you know, execute bans and other game-altering punitive stuff.

98
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:01,075
And also additional support from Corey, our game director,

99
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:03,456
Bobby, who's our technical producer.

100
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,197
He's kind of the lead producer on Rocket League Prime,

101
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:06,777
as we call it.

102
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:10,338
And also additional input from Jeremy, our VP of publishing,

103
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:12,679
and Phil, our in-house counsel.

104
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,960
We call him Legal Eagle for some reason.

105
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm not sure why.

106
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:23,995
And the process for this language ban system is pretty simple once all the tools are in place.

107
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:30,517
During a match, one player uses inappropriate or harassing language. They're reported by

108
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:35,878
one or several other players in the match. The chat log after that report is filed,

109
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:41,640
the entire chat log from that match is saved in our back end. And then our algorithm scans

110
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,541
that chat log and looks for words that are on our language ban list.

111
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:51,985
If it's triggered, we also look at the last seven days of reports against that player

112
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:56,632
to see if the same word is popping up more than once or if other words are popping up

113
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:56,953
as well.

114
00:06:58,657 --> 00:07:03,101
If flagged words do appear, depending on the threshold, and I'll get into that on the next

115
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:07,885
slide, depending on the threshold and if they meet that threshold for these words, they're

116
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:13,289
then escalated into the ban system starting at 24 hours, 72 hours, a week, two weeks,

117
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:13,870
and so on.

118
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:18,394
Right now we don't have permanent bans as part of the automatic system.

119
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:23,298
We still want a human eye to look at these reports when it comes to an eventual permanent

120
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:23,458
ban.

121
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,721
And we also give players the opportunity to de-escalate, so after they're banned,

122
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:33,483
if they behave themselves for 30 days afterwards, they then de-escalate

123
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:37,585
so they're not getting dinged as a strike two six months later,

124
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,726
if they've behaved themselves for those six months.

125
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:44,828
And here's where it gets interesting.

126
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:48,349
We call words grams when we're talking about this system,

127
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,091
and the threshold's tied to those grams.

128
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:54,625
So the language ban list started with about 20 words,

129
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,610
including variants for those words, misspellings,

130
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:01,594
using leet-speak, stuff like that,

131
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,717
trying to account for any sort of sidestep

132
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:07,260
that players would use to get around

133
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,302
this language ban system.

134
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:10,825
We also don't treat all these words equally.

135
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:15,074
Racial slurs, gender slurs, homophobic slurs,

136
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:17,835
they all typically have a threshold of one.

137
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,195
So if you use it once, you get reported,

138
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,576
you're immediately escalated into this ban system.

139
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:24,817
Or if you're using a word like shit,

140
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:26,678
we give you a little more leeway

141
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,358
because we understand that you might be playing

142
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:30,319
with your friends, you and your friends

143
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,039
might talk to each other in a certain way.

144
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,560
So we wanna give you a little bit of leeway

145
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,721
that way you're not immediately getting the ban hammer

146
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:40,062
every time you might have a slip of the tongue.

147
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,922
This list is constantly evolving.

148
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:47,823
We're always looking for new variants of these words,

149
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:51,505
looking at misspellings and stuff like that.

150
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,726
The original list though was completely data driven

151
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:57,047
where we took a chunk of reports,

152
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:58,427
I think it was over six months,

153
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,008
looked at these reports,

154
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:01,669
pulled out all of the common words

155
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,949
that you would use in gameplay.

156
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:05,414
simple stuff like and, if, or, or but,

157
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:09,818
or just common Rocket League related phrases and words.

158
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:12,780
And we're basically left with the worst of the worst.

159
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,903
So for us it was having it data driven like that

160
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,025
means that we're not putting too much

161
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:19,266
of a subjective spin on it.

162
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:22,268
We're looking at words that the community is actively using

163
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:23,830
and policing it from there.

164
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,092
And then we take a look at this list

165
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,694
every once in a while to make sure it's still on point.

166
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:35,116
The execution of this system was also a multi-team effort.

167
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:37,937
We crowd-sourced the list.

168
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:40,618
It was community, customer care, and our analytics team.

169
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:46,379
We used existing UI to inform players for the band reason and the duration.

170
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,561
As we make changes to this system, the UI team and the client teams will definitely

171
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:51,121
be involved.

172
00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:54,938
The algorithm that we use is created by our analytics team

173
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:58,200
and then deployed into the game by online services.

174
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,602
On the internal side, it's BigQuery scanning these reports

175
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:05,864
and how it hooks into the game is C-sharp,

176
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:07,424
just a few simple lines of code.

177
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,186
The online services team, they did a lot

178
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:11,486
of heavy lifting here as well.

179
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:14,788
They completely built what we call the Rocket League backend

180
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:19,070
tool, which is where we do game bans, coming soon chat bans.

181
00:10:19,682 --> 00:10:21,683
looking at trade history, match history,

182
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:24,685
virtually anything that's tied to player data

183
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:26,646
that we have need access to.

184
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:29,928
The customer care team is also involved at every step

185
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:32,109
because they're effectively the front line

186
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:34,791
when it comes to talking to players who have been banned,

187
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:39,593
no matter how hostile or mild-tempered

188
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,094
they might be after the fact.

189
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:44,276
So customer care is involved to help inform

190
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:46,618
the decisions we were making on the list

191
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:49,019
and also to help anticipate player reaction.

192
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:50,426
contact volume.

193
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:55,529
And then last but not least, the community team did most of the messaging for this.

194
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,792
So blogs, social media posts, being active on the subreddit, on our discord, and making

195
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:05,774
sure that players knew that this new system was coming, how it works, and how it's going

196
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,715
to be beneficial for the community in the long run.

197
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:13,858
And again, that really ties in with this community first, kind of the cornerstone of our internal

198
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:14,538
mission statement.

199
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,220
And the fun part.

200
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:21,355
The results I think speak for themselves.

201
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:24,137
Taking a look at kind of a six month range,

202
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,959
three months before, three months after

203
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,540
we implemented this system,

204
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,282
you see a 33% increase in the number of reports filed.

205
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:34,724
So after our messaging went out

206
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:36,545
about this language ban system being added,

207
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:38,406
a lot of players who assumed

208
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:39,907
that the report system did nothing

209
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,229
started actively using the report system

210
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:43,389
to report toxic players.

211
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,491
Within the first 90 days, we had almost 100,000 bans.

212
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:51,853
80% of them, or 81.6% of them, were 24-hour bans.

213
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,495
And then from there, you see a pretty significant drop

214
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:57,136
from players who were banned once versus twice

215
00:11:57,697 --> 00:11:58,457
versus three times.

216
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:03,320
And last but not least, 98% of players banned in this window

217
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,941
came back to play after their ban was up.

218
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:08,503
So we saw an incredibly low churn rate

219
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:10,824
with this new system being implemented.

220
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:15,887
And here's the same information in graph form.

221
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:18,733
Everybody loves grass, I think.

222
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:22,455
But right in the middle is where you can see a pretty significant jump.

223
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:26,676
Kind of the waves that you see at the end, those tend to be tied to weekends

224
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:28,496
when most of our players are active.

225
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:35,438
And the community reception, as I said, was strong and it was also very positive.

226
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:38,878
Once we started banning players with this automated system,

227
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:41,863
we had players who were banned by the system showing up

228
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:44,527
on the subreddit, not posting in anger, but saying,

229
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:46,090
I'm sorry for what I said.

230
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,332
I was having a bad night.

231
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:51,827
Also, I'm glad to see this reporting system is working, so you guys can totally believe

232
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,329
Psyonix when they say it's working.

233
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:59,174
And stuff like that really does have a ripple effect among all of your, especially your

234
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:04,259
hardcore players, but any of your players who are on social, on the subreddit that you

235
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:09,705
might control or have moderators on, and whatever Discord or voice service you might be using.

236
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:12,788
The public change in attitude is very important for us,

237
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:14,689
and it helped laid the foundation

238
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:18,390
for any of the other player behavior tools and methods

239
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,531
we want to use in the future.

240
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,012
This is something that we're always evolving, especially

241
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,874
with the word in the gram lists.

242
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:29,435
We definitely want to add languages beyond English.

243
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,576
Our game is predominantly English speaking

244
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:34,997
in the US and Europe, and of course, our studio.

245
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:35,957
So now we're trying to.

246
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:43,959
effectively crowdsourced lists of slurs and curse words in other languages, which is always

247
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:47,841
a fun conversation with people on Reddit who are like, oh, I speak Dutch, let me give you

248
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:51,223
the 50 worst words I could possibly think of in my native tongue.

249
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:57,166
Fun fact, Dutch people really like to tell people to get cancer in online games.

250
00:13:57,286 --> 00:14:01,608
I don't know if that's like a European thing or just Dutch or what, but just Dutch.

251
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:06,310
Well, you know, health is important, right?

252
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:06,550
Yeah.

253
00:14:08,324 --> 00:14:11,186
We also adjust thresholds for these words when appropriate.

254
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:15,211
An example I like to use is the KYS,

255
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,713
which typically stands for kill yourself.

256
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:20,336
It's something you never want to see in a chat log

257
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,917
directed at another player.

258
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:24,260
We have it at a threshold of two,

259
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,683
not because we think that KYS isn't serious enough

260
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:31,267
to be a one, but because it's very close to the word keys.

261
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:36,620
And because we have a crates and keys system in Rocket League, we give it a little bit

262
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,823
of buffer in case someone was legitimately making a spelling mistake.

263
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:41,864
We don't want them to immediately be banned.

264
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:46,808
With the seven day window that we use, if someone's using that to really say kill yourself,

265
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:49,690
they're going to be saying it more than once in a given week.

266
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,474
So by setting it at two, we give you one mistake and then you get escalated into the ban system

267
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:56,635
as appropriate.

268
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:00,731
Here are some of our future plans.

269
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:04,713
The first one coming up, this is going to be part of Rocket League's spring update

270
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:05,733
in a couple of weeks.

271
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:12,356
Chatbans are not replacing game bans, but they're going to slot in in front of game

272
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:12,636
bans.

273
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:16,937
So this language ban system that we have will be tied into chatbans first.

274
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:20,038
So if you're reported, you go through the same process.

275
00:15:20,957 --> 00:15:24,018
instead of being banned for 24 hours from online gameplay,

276
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:26,259
you'll be banned from chat for 24 hours.

277
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
And you'll go through that same escalation process.

278
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,780
If you're banned from chat enough times,

279
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,981
you'll eventually escalate and convert into game bans

280
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,441
to really help drive that message home

281
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:37,702
that you need to course correct

282
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:39,422
how you're talking to other players.

283
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:42,931
Trade bans should be coming later this year.

284
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:47,373
Those aren't as chat heavy all the time, but because people do try and

285
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:51,236
game the system when trading with other players, there is a chat window in

286
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:54,618
the trade system that we're going to be looking at as well, potentially.

287
00:15:54,638 --> 00:16:00,302
And it's just another player to player interaction that we want to start

288
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:01,242
policing in some way.

289
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:06,906
Further down the road, we're also doing research on third-party tools that are out there to

290
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:13,189
see what benefits there would be to converting from our homegrown system into a larger, more

291
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:14,489
robust third-party system.

292
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:20,491
Also, much further down the road, how machine learning could potentially play a role in

293
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:21,331
player behavior.

294
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:26,113
This is something that we're treading very lightly with because machine learning is a

295
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,214
very powerful tool.

296
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:32,193
But I think you want to be careful when you're using it in conjunction with how

297
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:33,194
people talk to each other.

298
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:38,140
And, uh, that's it for the presentation.

299
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,461
So I'm happy to take any questions.

300
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:48,176
Hi.

301
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,637
Yo.

302
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:53,360
It's interesting that the bans are always

303
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,723
triggered by a player reporting bad conduct.

304
00:16:57,204 --> 00:17:00,767
Have you contemplated triggering a ban automatically

305
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:04,670
based on just always scanning the chat logs?

306
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:07,533
We definitely talked about it internally.

307
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:10,756
I think the reason we stick with active reports

308
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:13,278
is we understand that, especially with the party

309
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:14,159
system in Rocket League.

310
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:18,553
A lot of people are playing with their friends, and if you have a certain way of talking with

311
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:23,656
your friends, and there's someone outside of your friend group who's in the server who

312
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:26,777
might be cool with that, then they're not going to report you.

313
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:30,299
If they, if it's something that they take offense to, they can file a report.

314
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,925
And that's also where thresholds come in is,

315
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:34,826
as I said earlier in the deck,

316
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,788
we're not trying to completely sterilize

317
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:39,069
this competitive gaming experience,

318
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:42,691
but we do want to set up some pretty strict boundaries

319
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:43,732
when it comes to certain things.

320
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:47,374
So with scanning all of the reports,

321
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:49,315
it's something we've talked about,

322
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:53,357
but the system as is seems to be working pretty effectively.

323
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,539
And really, it really just comes down to playing

324
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,200
with your friends and the kind of language

325
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,601
that you're comfortable with with your friends.

326
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:00,956
Thank you.

327
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,417
Great talk.

328
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:01,877
Thank you.

329
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:04,679
OK, so kind of a two-part question.

330
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:06,920
You use the term chat a lot.

331
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:10,203
Are you talking about chat as in people are typing in text

332
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:12,624
while they're playing the game with the controller, or chat

333
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:13,705
as in people are talking?

334
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:15,286
Text chat.

335
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,608
So it's purely text chat, is everything that you've

336
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,129
reported, is everything that you're doing here?

337
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:21,291
Yeah, there is voice chat in Rocket League, but it doesn't

338
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,112
get used very frequently.

339
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:27,895
And chat logs are much easier to record and analyze after

340
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:28,256
the fact.

341
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:35,126
Especially on Steam, you know, we have a really big population on Steam and console players can type pretty quickly.

342
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,111
Usually just asking to trade with other players, but if...

343
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:41,607
they're having a bad night or whatever the case may be,

344
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,548
they'll definitely get their point across for better or worse.

345
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:45,969
So what about post-hoc?

346
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:49,010
How do you do bad actors in

347
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,072
the community that don't actually get reported but are visible?

348
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,833
For example, people who are on e-sports games and then type bad things

349
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:58,955
while the games are going on and they have 100,000 people watching them.

350
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,956
What's your current strategy on that and how do you deal with that?

351
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:05,958
That's a great question. I can definitely answer that from,

352
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:11,717
point of view of streams that we control. Basically any, any public commun- any public

353
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:17,862
platform that we have that we have any sort of influence on, that also extends to in game

354
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:23,426
behavior. So with the subreddit that we have and our discord server, our mods treat players

355
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:29,550
the same way using the same code of conduct as we do in game. And one thing that we've,

356
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:33,173
we've done this a little bit in the past but we're going to be ramping it up as we've made

357
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,855
changes to our code of conduct is.

358
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:41,032
behavior outside of the game can affect your ability to play the game online in the future.

359
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:46,335
It's something that we were wary about originally with how the code of conduct was set up, but

360
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:49,958
now that we're making it a little more clear in that code of conduct, telling players like

361
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:54,221
you're gonna have your streams, you're gonna have your Twitter and Facebook accounts, but

362
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:58,664
if you're constantly harassing other players and you're mentioning Rocket League in these

363
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:02,627
tweets and these posts, there are potentially going to be in-game consequences.

364
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:03,547
Thank you.

365
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:08,530
So, thank you for the talk, that was awesome.

366
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:15,156
I work on RTS games, so the breadth of toxic experiences that players go through beyond

367
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:18,358
verbal abuse, the breadth just expands a lot.

368
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:25,244
So I was wondering what sort of toxic behaviors your players report or would like Rocket League

369
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:30,208
to be able to react to, such as AFKing, griefing, if anything.

370
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:39,073
Want to get some insight into whether you see in the future any sort of automated verification for those toxic behaviors and

371
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:42,935
whether they happen frequently enough in order to make it the effort worth it.

372
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,250
Sure, that's a great question, thank you.

373
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:48,092
So right now we have a few different report reasons

374
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:48,632
in the game.

375
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:49,752
So during the middle of a match,

376
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,574
you need to report a player, you hit start,

377
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,494
you go to this report slash mute.

378
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,475
So in the same window that pops up,

379
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:58,136
you can mute any player in the server

380
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,397
or you can report that player.

381
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:00,897
Once you hit the report button,

382
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,438
you have a few different categories you can choose from,

383
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:05,419
including verbal text harassment,

384
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,080
but you also have unsportsmanlike conduct.

385
00:21:08,238 --> 00:21:14,001
You also have cheating and if crate farming isn't in there,

386
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:15,042
we're gonna be adding it soon.

387
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:19,104
So that list, we're working on making it static data

388
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:20,344
so we can update it on the fly.

389
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:22,946
So as trends pop up, we can add new reasons

390
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:25,007
without forcing a client update.

391
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:32,450
Unsportsmanlike conduct is probably the biggest reason outside of verbal or text harassment

392
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,352
because that covers a number of different things including playing for the other team.

393
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:41,134
So if you're in a ranked match, your team goes down 1-0, we've seen players who just

394
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,756
immediately take that as an opportunity like, well, we're going to lose this game so I'm

395
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:49,298
just going to be as toxic as I possibly can and start playing for the other team against

396
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:49,899
my teammate.

397
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,380
So unsportsmanlike conduct is a frequent report.

398
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:58,485
Those we still have a bit of a manual process for where we do analyze the chat logs to see

399
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,746
what kind of context we can get.

400
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:03,309
We also look at frequency of reports against a player.

401
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:09,033
If a player is being reported two dozen times in the span of a couple of days for unsportsmanlike

402
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:14,017
conduct and then we can get other clues from the chat logs with players saying, this guy

403
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:17,960
is on-going, can everybody in the server please report him based on how that conversation

404
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,201
goes.

405
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:23,419
Do you have any measure of trust attached to that player

406
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:25,621
based on the reports that are being received

407
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:26,801
or the types of reports?

408
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:28,242
Not at the moment.

409
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:31,204
What we really use as a measuring stick for that

410
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:33,225
is how many times the player's been reported

411
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,966
and also how many times they've been banned.

412
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:38,168
We try to be pretty lenient with permanent bans

413
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:39,829
unless it's a very severe case

414
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:41,490
because we always want to give players.

415
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:47,427
ample opportunity to course correct and then come back to the online community and be just

416
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:49,168
a happy normal member of that community.

417
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:56,153
As far as feedback goes, that's also something we're going to be doing in the spring update.

418
00:22:56,493 --> 00:23:00,696
So along with chat bands, you're going to be getting two kinds of feedback.

419
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,042
If you're banned, you're going to be getting feedback with chat lines of exactly what you

420
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,684
said that triggered the ban.

421
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:10,146
So there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.

422
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:16,231
On the other side, we're also including report feedback, and it'll be vague intentionally,

423
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:21,216
but if you report somebody who's been banned within a couple of days, you'll get a pop-up

424
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:25,139
message saying, like, thanks to your report, we've taken action against another player.

425
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,823
We're not going to show you that player's name or when they were banned because we don't

426
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:33,006
want to gamify it too much, but that kind of just simple feedback will also reinforce

427
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:36,730
that the report system definitely does something and bears fruit down the road.

428
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:37,671
Awesome.

429
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:38,391
Thank you so much.

430
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:38,792
Thanks.

431
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:50,442
Hey, so when you announced on Reddit the new report system and ban system, were you, like

432
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:51,523
how explicit were you in?

433
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,244
like detailing, like how it works, like you,

434
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:59,231
or did you leave intentionally some fuzziness in there

435
00:23:59,332 --> 00:24:01,195
to keep people from kind of gaming,

436
00:24:01,476 --> 00:24:03,579
like, oh, well, if I just don't say these, whatever.

437
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,561
We kept it pretty vague.

438
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:04,922
Yeah.

439
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:09,470
And I know that's probably a topic that's up for debate among many in this room.

440
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:14,333
And the reason we kept it vague is for that exact reason of we wanted to avoid players

441
00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:15,393
trying to game the system.

442
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:20,096
We have an appeals process with an appeals email that our customer care team funnels

443
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:20,676
players to.

444
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,639
So if you contact the appeals email, we'll tell you exactly what you said to get banned.

445
00:24:26,475 --> 00:24:28,456
And that's generally what players are looking for,

446
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:30,697
and that's why we're including it with the chat band system.

447
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:34,858
Because our goal, when we first kicked this off,

448
00:24:34,898 --> 00:24:37,839
was to have minimal impact on the production schedule,

449
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,020
we wanted to launch a system that

450
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,141
didn't require any major UI or client work, which

451
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:45,201
is another factor for that.

452
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:47,222
But really, it was to keep players

453
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:50,323
from trying to circumvent the system all the time.

454
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:54,655
And because we're giving them the exact reasoning now,

455
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,556
we're kind of balancing it out.

456
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:57,417
OK, thank you.

457
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:57,837
Thanks.

458
00:25:00,018 --> 00:25:01,619
Hi, I really enjoyed your talk.

459
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,040
Thank you.

460
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,381
And I found it really useful because I

461
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,563
am involved with a project very similar to that

462
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:08,004
in my own company.

463
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:16,081
My question, I have two questions. First one is I was wondering how you deal with the indirect insults. For example,

464
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:24,287
I want to see your mother tonight, something like that. It is a clear insult, but the word system wouldn't detect such

465
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,109
verbal attack.

466
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:30,075
So that's one of the reasons why we're evaluating

467
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,457
third party tools that just have a team

468
00:25:33,477 --> 00:25:35,258
with more experience in player behavior

469
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:38,619
and also have a tool set that's already built out

470
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,380
that can address the kind of language

471
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,621
that we're already addressing,

472
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,843
but also take that kind of nuance into account

473
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:48,764
and effectively moderate it,

474
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:52,026
whether it leads to a ban or just muted chat temporarily

475
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,828
or just censoring one line like one and done.

476
00:25:55,988 --> 00:26:00,813
So that's a big reason why we're looking at third party tools that just have an expertise in this area.

477
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:05,898
So those third party tools would be like machine learning based detection systems?

478
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:15,007
Machine learning based but also more just based on linguistics and having kind of a more fleshed out word list and sentence and phrase list.

479
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:16,977
So I think machine learning is part of it,

480
00:26:17,017 --> 00:26:19,998
but it's still grounded in human eyes,

481
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:22,579
analyzing this data and making sure

482
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:23,879
everything is working effectively.

483
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,280
I see.

484
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,620
When I was talking about machine learning earlier,

485
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:30,681
our goal is to never flip a switch on

486
00:26:31,202 --> 00:26:32,162
and then just leave it be.

487
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:34,703
You know, even with the system that we have here,

488
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:37,344
it requires a lot of human interaction

489
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:39,184
on a day-to-day basis,

490
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,225
making sure that players are being banned

491
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:43,866
or policed in the right way.

492
00:26:44,446 --> 00:26:44,626
I see.

493
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:50,840
My second question is like your game Rocket League is also huge in Asia like for example in South Korea

494
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,487
We have a lot of users playing the game, and I was wondering if that system also serves the Korean language, too

495
00:26:57,368 --> 00:27:01,032
Not yet, but we're working on it. That's one of our goals is to get as many

496
00:27:02,113 --> 00:27:04,356
other languages into the system as possible

497
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,382
It's tough when you don't have anybody at the studio who speaks that natively.

498
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:11,925
So we're doing a lot of crowdsourcing with this where we're talking with community

499
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:16,589
members, we're talking to members of our third party customer care team, 5CA,

500
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:21,613
who they have people all over the world who do customer care for

501
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:24,215
us so they can offer insight into those languages.

502
00:27:24,696 --> 00:27:28,199
The tough part is you can't really open a dictionary and

503
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:31,041
look for this stuff because a lot of it is very slang based.

504
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:34,586
So you really have to get into the weeds and talk to people

505
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:37,510
who are using this kind of language online inside of a

506
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,735
game or out, just with their friends or in state of day

507
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:43,479
life, and kind of build out a list that way.

508
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:44,962
Thank you very much.

509
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:45,242
Thanks.

510
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:48,997
Hey, quick question.

511
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:52,820
When it comes to the, you say you're gonna,

512
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,761
or I don't know if you're doing this yet,

513
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,303
it was giving them the exact string that they said

514
00:27:57,863 --> 00:27:59,604
or the exact message in email.

515
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:02,446
Are you concerned that they could reverse engineer

516
00:28:02,486 --> 00:28:04,908
and go, that's right, I said that to so and so,

517
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:06,509
and then they're gonna go harass that person?

518
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:11,406
I think that's something you always have to take into account and we just need to be ready

519
00:28:11,486 --> 00:28:11,746
for it.

520
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:16,348
Because if that happens and we start talking to players and are getting feedback that it's

521
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:19,049
happening frequently, we'll adjust the system as best we can.

522
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:27,932
And also just go and find the player or players who are being this level of toxic and just

523
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:31,433
remove them from the game and have a zero tolerance policy towards that sort of thing.

524
00:28:32,573 --> 00:28:35,194
It's part of the reason why we don't have the reasons in there now.

525
00:28:35,254 --> 00:28:37,035
It's something that we've had to put a lot of thought into.

526
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:45,253
But for us now, it's worth the risk because we want players to know exactly what kind

527
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:46,334
of language is inappropriate.

528
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:49,816
At some point, you have to make that decision and you can't keep it vague forever.

529
00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:55,940
And then one more question, and that is, do you have anything in your system that considers

530
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:59,964
friendships when it comes to a complaint filed against them?

531
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:04,387
Because I'm in moderation as well, and we'll see it where this one person continually gets

532
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:07,370
banned, banned, banned, and they're like, man, I keep getting banned, and they gripe

533
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,912
to their friend about it, and that's the person who is...

534
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:14,357
filing the complaints and continually doing this.

535
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:14,897
That's a bad friend.

536
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:16,099
So do, right?

537
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:16,960
That's the question.

538
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,243
Do you have any kind of like feedback about that

539
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,685
or is there anything in your weight ban system

540
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:22,506
that you consider?

541
00:29:22,932 --> 00:29:26,834
We've gotten a little bit of it, and the appeal system definitely helps with that.

542
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,916
We don't have it built into the automated process.

543
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:35,478
I mean, we could potentially down the road, depending on, you know, if we made any relevant

544
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:39,400
changes to the party system and that sort of stuff, but the way the game is built right

545
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,021
now, there's no...

546
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:47,644
I think the only way we could do that is looking at if the person who reported the player was

547
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:48,925
in a party with that player.

548
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:52,194
But you can't rely on that too much

549
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:53,635
because they could be in a party

550
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:55,095
because they were trading with each other

551
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:57,676
or found each other on like Rocket League Garage

552
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:58,517
or Rocket League Central,

553
00:29:58,557 --> 00:30:00,878
like a third party fan site

554
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,878
where people try and find teammates all the time.

555
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,919
So even if you're in a party together,

556
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,820
you might be relative strangers

557
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,341
and after a minute or two, you're like,

558
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:10,522
I think this guy is terrible.

559
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,843
I'm just gonna start being as mean as possible to him,

560
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:14,023
whatever the case may be.

561
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,084
But it's definitely food for thought.

562
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:16,764
Okay, thanks.

563
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:17,185
Thank you.

564
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:20,244
Howdy.

565
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:20,804
Hi.

566
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:25,247
Yeah, you said when you're looking at reports

567
00:30:25,347 --> 00:30:28,109
for unsportsmanlike conduct, where I'm assuming

568
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:30,310
it's difficult to find real data of what's happened,

569
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:32,612
and probably also because of that,

570
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:34,473
difficult for people to appeal.

571
00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:38,756
Are you doing anything to protect minority groups, women,

572
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:42,879
racial minorities, LGBT people, who are often

573
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:44,320
targeted with?

574
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:50,343
reports of unsportsmanlike conduct when really they just noticed a rainbow flag, like, on their car.

575
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:52,987
Yeah, that's a great question.

576
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:56,630
And I think that's why when we're looking at unsportsmanlike conduct reports,

577
00:30:56,671 --> 00:31:00,414
we still go to chat and analyze those chat logs.

578
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:04,077
Cuz it's a pretty rare case that somebody's exhibiting unsportsmanlike

579
00:31:04,117 --> 00:31:07,900
conduct behavior, but they're not saying anything in chat, right?

580
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:12,044
And with those kind of context clues that we get, especially on the other side where

581
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:15,707
if someone sees a rainbow flag and decides to target that player without,

582
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:18,850
no matter how much or how little they know about that player.

583
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,737
they're also likely to say something about it in chat.

584
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:25,959
So it's definitely not perfect, but with the chat

585
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,961
logs, you can draw a pretty good bead on what's leading to

586
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:31,782
this behavior in these kinds of interactions.

587
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,183
But it's definitely on our priority list.

588
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:36,744
We're an all-inclusive game.

589
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:37,784
We're rated E for everybody.

590
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:38,625
We want everybody.

591
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:43,752
inspiration for this system was to make sure

592
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:45,593
there was zero tolerance, especially when it comes

593
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:48,695
to gender slurs, homophobic slurs, racial slurs,

594
00:31:48,735 --> 00:31:49,455
and stuff like that.

595
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:52,396
We don't want anybody to feel unsafe or targeted

596
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:53,297
while they're playing our game.

597
00:31:53,837 --> 00:31:54,417
Very good, thank you.

598
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:54,838
Thanks.

599
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,051
So that's probably the last question, right?

600
00:31:57,771 --> 00:31:57,931
Hi.

601
00:31:58,972 --> 00:31:59,552
That's the last.

602
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:02,574
You mentioned before that the people who are actually

603
00:32:02,614 --> 00:32:05,956
getting banned are getting a report of some kind saying why

604
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:06,596
they got banned.

605
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:10,479
But the people who are actually doing the reporting, they

606
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,819
report someone to get banned.

607
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,181
They don't get one, but they will get a vague.

608
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:18,483
Report that thank you for your report and everything

609
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:25,527
So are you trying to encourage people to report more by doing this and if that's the if that's a yes

610
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:27,228
Have you considered?

611
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:30,010
applying gamification techniques

612
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,991
To encourage people to report more

613
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:35,250
I think we're walking the line.

614
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,372
With the Spring update and the chat ban system that we're going to be putting into Rocket

615
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:41,533
League, the report feedback is going to be part of that.

616
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:46,896
And we want to give players feedback on when they've successfully reported somebody.

617
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:52,439
But by gamifying it too much, our concern is it'll lead to too many reports that are

618
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:52,959
irrelevant.

619
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,682
Where you're just, you know, potentially, especially younger players going into a server.

620
00:32:58,668 --> 00:33:02,810
just immediately reporting everybody and it just leads to higher volume which makes it

621
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,591
harder to sift through all these reports and address new kinds of language being used that

622
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:12,372
we actually have to police. So with this report feedback that we're keeping relatively vague,

623
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:17,814
we feel like we're walking the appropriate line of giving feedback without incentivizing

624
00:33:17,854 --> 00:33:20,355
it to the point of manipulation.

625
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:28,036
And also, please fill out your surveys after leaving the room.

626
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:29,477
I've been asked to remind you about that as well.

627
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:31,220
And yeah, thank you so much for coming, everybody.
