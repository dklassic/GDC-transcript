1
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:13,164
All right. I think we're good to go. Our nice little intimate gathering here. We're going

2
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:21,787
to remember who among you have chosen to come here instead of the Dolby panel that was pitted

3
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:30,531
against us. So thank you. Like I said, I'm taking down names here. I'm Austin.

4
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:34,153
Hi, I'm Christian from Ubisoft Quebec.

5
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:36,794
And we're basically just going to dive right in here.

6
00:00:37,443 --> 00:00:37,664
Yep.

7
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,045
So I want to hear.

8
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:39,325
OK.

9
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:42,809
So as I said, I am Christian from New South Quebec.

10
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,050
I'm the music supervisor.

11
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,893
Worked on Assassin's Creed Syndicate, of course.

12
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:51,037
And on that game, what I did was music direction, music design,

13
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:54,620
editing of the music, integration for a score,

14
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,764
and also initial research and design for the source music

15
00:00:58,965 --> 00:00:59,625
aspect of the game.

16
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:02,187
So in this presentation, what we're

17
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:05,330
going to talk about roughly is how

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,771
we define the vision for the music in Assassin's Creed

19
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:12,254
Syndicate, how we came to work with Austin on the music

20
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:15,837
direction for the game, and afterwards, an overview

21
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,919
of a couple of music systems from the game,

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,341
and also aspects of the score.

23
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:31,803
So, how this all began. Basically we were at a summer party for the studio, drinking

24
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:38,068
beer, everything was fun. And there were rumors flying around that our boss would announce

25
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:43,472
you know the next big project for the studio. And he did. It was, you know, we were going

26
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:46,674
to work on the next main Assassin's Creed game, Syndicate.

27
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:50,836
So reactions all around were, you know, people were surprised,

28
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:51,636
really happy.

29
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:54,757
And it was an incredible opportunity for the studio,

30
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:57,018
because, you know, it was Ubisoft Montreal that

31
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:58,398
did the main games before.

32
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,639
Now it was us, you know, our turn in the spotlight.

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,940
So we wanted to make our mark with this game.

34
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:09,642
As for me, what that meant, we were without an audio director

35
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,142
at that point.

36
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:13,283
So it fell on me to define the music direction

37
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:14,464
for the game for that moment.

38
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:17,305
And our audio director on that project, Lydia.

39
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:20,719
Andrew wouldn't come in until a couple of months later.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,762
So I did research on forums, articles, editorials,

41
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,923
about what music means to gamers and to Assassin's Creed fans.

42
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:36,225
Also, I talked with the directors

43
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:38,386
from the previous Assassin's Creed games

44
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:41,287
to see how they came about defining

45
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,688
their vision and their direction for the music.

46
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,381
And my conclusion from all that research

47
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:51,083
was that defining that vision for the music

48
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:54,986
wasn't about finding specific instrumentation

49
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:56,567
or style of composer.

50
00:02:56,667 --> 00:03:00,850
It was about really finding what was the philosophy, what

51
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,392
was the way of thinking behind how

52
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:08,496
we would get to those parameters, those specifics.

53
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:22,094
So the next step was building a brief for the pitch process

54
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:23,757
to find our composer.

55
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,424
And there was this word that kept.

56
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:32,816
popping back in my mind, and it was potential.

57
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:36,979
For every game, every game has its own unique set

58
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,900
of parameters, their own specifics.

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,382
So every game has their own setting.

60
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:44,243
They take place in their own era.

61
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:46,244
They take place in their own fantasy world,

62
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,144
or maybe in space.

63
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,065
They have their own story, their own characters.

64
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:51,467
All that translates into musical opportunities.

65
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:56,370
For Assassin's Creed Syndicate.

66
00:03:56,865 --> 00:04:02,108
Those opportunities, it's a game about, at the same time,

67
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:04,410
it's science fiction and it's historical fiction.

68
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,792
That means it's a clash of genres, of eras,

69
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:09,814
of instruments, of musical influences.

70
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:12,355
All that is musical opportunities to exploit.

71
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:19,309
And Victorian London is also shock-full of musical opportunities to explore.

72
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,632
It's full of contrasts, it's full of cultures, it's full of all the social classes from the

73
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:32,394
poorest child factory worker to the richest banker walking side by side on the streets.

74
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:36,176
It's also very vivid in the pop culture imagination.

75
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:39,777
Everyone has expectations of what Victorian London should be.

76
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:47,879
look like and sound like. Also, our story, you know, Jacob and Evie, the characters,

77
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:53,264
their brother and sister, their siblings, but they're also rivals, so musical opportunity.

78
00:04:53,284 --> 00:04:59,750
You know, the assassins versus the Templars, and you can go even more abstract, like concepts

79
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,596
like one versus all, past versus present, poor versus rich, all that musical opportunities.

80
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:10,532
Which leads me for real now to the...

81
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:13,273
That's a subtle way of saying you moved the slide early.

82
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:13,813
Exactly.

83
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:15,993
To the pitch process.

84
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:23,415
Now that we knew what we were looking for, someone to fully tap into all those possible

85
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:30,416
opportunities, all that potential, I built the pitch brief that we were going to send

86
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:31,076
to the composers.

87
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:34,197
And as it was our first contact with the composers...

88
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:38,921
We put a lot of attention to the language, the wording,

89
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,182
the tone in that document.

90
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:43,664
So we were making sure that we would communicate

91
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:47,407
our enthusiasm as much as possible.

92
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,068
We were looking to drive home the point

93
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,890
that we were looking to be surprised by the pitches,

94
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,993
that we were ready for anything to bring it, to take risks,

95
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,515
to be bold, basically.

96
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:04,092
Which leads me to our experience working with Austin on that pitch.

97
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:09,614
He responded to that call with an incredible pitch.

98
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:14,335
It was bold, risky, like we wanted, and even more.

99
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:22,797
He rose up to the challenge and basically surprised us with, you know, it was really...

100
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:25,556
Psychotic.

101
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:28,458
I'm speechless, so that should give you an impression.

102
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,663
I have to add to that before I kind of dive into my forthcoming slice of this,

103
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:45,609
that what he's describing was this pitch document which said the exact things that he just spelled out.

104
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:51,775
You know, challenge us, surprise us, don't be overly caught up by the fact that this

105
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:59,057
is Assassin's Creed, which has a long-running musical history, treat it as whatever comes

106
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:00,917
to mind, you know, and whatever your instincts are.

107
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:06,779
In other words, you're not beholden to the previous musical ideas in the prior games

108
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,740
if that's not what speaks to you.

109
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
And of course I thought that they were bullshitting.

110
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:17,466
Because I thought, you know, it's a long-running and widely beloved musical legacy within this franchise,

111
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:22,390
so surely they don't actually want to abandon that, but I decided I would take them at their word,

112
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,312
and I was fully prepared to never hear from them again.

113
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:28,414
And happily, that's not how that worked out.

114
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,226
And what's really interesting about that pitch is it became really the template for what the score would become in the future.

115
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:47,293
And we would actually iterate upon what that pitch was stylistically to get to the final result for most of the aspects of the score.

116
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:54,979
So, I'm going to play you what I sent them.

117
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,320
And...

118
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:06,700
By the way, I want to bring up that who here submitted questions on the gang Facebook page

119
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:12,006
in advance a couple months ago? I put a post on, and a bunch of people did, although I

120
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:13,668
think they're all in the Dolby panel right now.

121
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:24,767
I'm sorry for my voice if I'm downgrading into a 14 year old boy in front of your eyes

122
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:24,967
here.

123
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,211
It's end of GDC voice.

124
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:34,818
In any case, I just wanted to make mention of the questions we got in advance because

125
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,920
I've tried to build basically all of them that we got into the talk.

126
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:46,306
Because one of the questions involved the sort of evolution and the derivation of thematic

127
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:47,247
material in the score.

128
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:51,350
And the reason I'm bringing that up now is because that all began at this moment with

129
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,372
the initial pitch.

130
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,033
Because I looked at the...

131
00:08:56,178 --> 00:09:01,521
The material they sent, which included things like the brief about Jacob and Evie as siblings

132
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:08,024
slash rivals, and that there's a sort of overtone of their struggling with legacy, their father,

133
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:09,165
and these kinds of things.

134
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:11,546
And so I said, this seems like something that...

135
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:20,286
It's about the two of them as a unit, as opposed to two different separate arcs that I wanted to think of differently.

136
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:21,946
It was all about their journey together.

137
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:27,749
And then also, just sort of looking at the overview of the setting and what that implies.

138
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:30,130
And so I came up with a thing that I kind of jokingly...

139
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,274
I'm going to play a little bit of a video that I made, half jokingly, because it's sort of

140
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:40,481
accurate, called Neo Mendelssohn music. And not actually because there's a period accuracy to

141
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:44,786
that approach, I actually tend to avoid things that are designed to be period authentic,

142
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,670
is the period. Why are we going to be redundant to that through the score when the game is

143
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,653
already solving that for us? So instead, despite the fact that this is sort of drawing from

144
00:09:56,733 --> 00:10:03,716
a period authenticity, the idea was I want to do music which feels like that of a pair

145
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:07,478
of sarcastic assassins. You know, one of the things I really liked that the game has a

146
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:09,699
bit in common with Black Flag was that the main...

147
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,921
The main characters of Jacob and Evie had a lot of personality.

148
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:16,945
They weren't sort of like the glowery, brooding heroes.

149
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:21,469
They're young and arrogant and different from each other.

150
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,712
But nonetheless, I'd say they have that in common.

151
00:10:25,732 --> 00:10:30,617
They were kind of cocky and very aware of how skilled they were.

152
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:32,818
So I thought a musical language which...

153
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,444
It has that nimble light on its feet quality, but there's also a sort of sarcasm to it,

154
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:40,706
was sort of the idea.

155
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,769
So I sent them, I did kind of a test recording.

156
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,751
That's loud and crazy.

157
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,497
Make sure we are sufficiently high volume, though I don't want to kill you all.

158
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:57,801
But it was fun, because I said, you know, how about this?

159
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,708
This transcript was provided by Transcription Outsourcing, LLC.

160
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:55,231
So I sent more than that, but that's kind of like a taste of the sort of, you know,

161
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:56,852
the neo Mendelssohn.

162
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:59,433
Although, funny enough, well, I'm getting ahead of myself.

163
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:01,273
I'll stick with that.

164
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:02,174
Could you all hear that all right?

165
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:05,675
Because with the speakers facing away from us, it's impossible to tell what that sounded

166
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:05,795
like.

167
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:06,236
Is that all right?

168
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:08,637
It's sufficiently loud and not weirdly phasy and stuff?

169
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:08,917
Okay.

170
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:10,137
So that's just our perspective.

171
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:11,556
All right, moving on.

172
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:13,858
That's my turn, right?

173
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:14,578
All right.

174
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,781
So with the music for this game, we

175
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,543
were trying to achieve, well, a lot of things.

176
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:24,786
But our major goals were to ensure natural music flow,

177
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,148
musical flow in the game.

178
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:31,491
What that means, roughly, for transitions between cues,

179
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,892
we wanted to have.

180
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:40,018
as little amount of fading as possible, as little cross-fades, fade-ins, fade-outs as

181
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:47,844
possible, and go more towards on-the-grid transitions, so on-the-beat, on-the-bar transitions

182
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:50,286
from one cue to another, not cross-fades.

183
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:57,551
What that meant for the music systems, it meant that we would prioritize that music

184
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:06,176
flow idea over gameplay feedback or responsiveness of the systems as weird as that may sound.

185
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:09,840
Also, preventing interruptions of the music

186
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,760
as much as possible.

187
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,584
You know how you can get tutorial screens that

188
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:16,065
would pause the music.

189
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:16,746
We didn't want that.

190
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:18,227
We wanted the music to play through that.

191
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:21,610
That also goes for loading screens, for cinematics,

192
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:25,214
ins and outs, and all that sort of cases.

193
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:27,015
Have the music play through that.

194
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:30,170
And to prevent starting and stopping,

195
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,632
constant starting and stopping of the music

196
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:36,496
as much as possible, especially for the comeback music,

197
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:39,439
where that tends to happen a lot in open world games.

198
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,363
You would get into fight scenarios.

199
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:45,225
The music would start, and then you

200
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:46,987
finish the fight really quickly, and the music

201
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:47,988
stops immediately.

202
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:49,069
We didn't want that.

203
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:59,516
Which leads me to a gang forum question about how we worked, me and Austin, for asset integration in the game.

204
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:03,397
And specifically Austin's involvement in that.

205
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:12,239
Basically, Austin didn't have any direct role in the actual implementation of the music in the game.

206
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:18,923
But it did have a very important influence on it, because from all the discussions we had at the very beginning about

207
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,565
exactly that, the musical flow, that

208
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:26,629
influenced how, you know, my style of integration and editing of the music in the game.

209
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,833
Yeah, just to quickly jump on that. I flew up to their offices in Quebec in January,

210
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:35,135
you know, a year and change ago.

211
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:42,156
to kick off the project and I, you know, he pulled up his sort of working document of

212
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:50,503
the plans for the score, you know, the, you know, not so much a cue sheet yet as it was

213
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:55,067
just kind of like a breakdown of systems and outline of kind of what the plan was going

214
00:14:55,087 --> 00:15:01,533
to be, which was taken from, I think, previous titles and then, you know, molded and shaped

215
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:02,734
based on where you were planning on.

216
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:10,700
But what was so great is that on titles like this, it's not that common that one of the

217
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,824
first questions from he and Lydia was, and here's what we're planning, what do you think?

218
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:19,267
And I said, oh, I get to have an opinion.

219
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,569
That's usually not a problem.

220
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:29,154
There's one part of all the pitch thing that I skipped over, because this could last for

221
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:29,575
three hours.

222
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:30,616
And it will.

223
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:31,496
We are locking the doors.

224
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,283
It is that we really wanted to have Austin's input from,

225
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:38,724
you know, as early as possible, from everything

226
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:41,186
from the systems to the music direction and all that.

227
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:44,347
Sadly, for some aspects, this didn't happen.

228
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:45,608
I'll show you later.

229
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:51,031
Yeah, so the point being that I, one

230
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,092
of the first things I remember saying

231
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:55,094
is, as someone who has played pretty much all the prior AC

232
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:55,394
games.

233
00:15:56,732 --> 00:16:01,915
I was always, I always wished we had a little bit tighter control on, for example, the combat

234
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:05,476
music, and because it's such a massive pet peeve of mine when you're playing games that

235
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:12,139
have a lot of recurring sort of systemic combat that every time you sort of, even so much

236
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,421
as someone gives you a funny look, this roaring epic music comes rushing in.

237
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:18,462
And then it's like, oh, no, no, we're cool.

238
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,363
And then it suddenly has to figure out how to stop playing.

239
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:21,344
And I was just like, I hate that.

240
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:22,825
It's bad storytelling.

241
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:26,187
And so I said, can we not do that?

242
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:28,849
And he said, already planning on not doing it.

243
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:32,111
And I was like, oh, god, this is so good already.

244
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:34,302
It was so happy.

245
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:37,763
Because, yeah, an emphasis on things being musical

246
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,065
so that they can actually serve the experience

247
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:42,506
and serve the narrative, as opposed

248
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:45,387
to being just these kind of mechanical byproducts

249
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:48,708
of a very cool sort of clockwork machine that is designed.

250
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,449
It's like, that's really not the point of the music,

251
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:52,970
even though we do want it to be pretty reactive.

252
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,852
So yeah, when it came to integration and Wwise,

253
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:59,213
that was all taking place up at your office

254
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,654
while I was in Los Angeles.

255
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:01,974
But.

256
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,001
But they were very, very open to my saying, you know,

257
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,542
can we do this, can we do that, can we do that,

258
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,904
and constantly offering my two cents.

259
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:13,706
Yeah, even though all the music was driven, well,

260
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:17,749
for the open world part, driven by music systems,

261
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:20,871
we didn't want to be slaves to that in the sense

262
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:24,333
that we wanted to see all the possible game plays

263
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:26,554
and side activities and combat, all the systems

264
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:27,295
in the open world.

265
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:32,946
Not as distinct, separate chunks of gameplay,

266
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,348
but are they all interconnected together

267
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:36,568
and what that means for the music.

268
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:40,691
So yeah.

269
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:42,632
So getting back to that.

270
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:48,696
So for the music systems, what we want to do

271
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,238
is predict the player's intentions

272
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,739
and score their stories.

273
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,360
And it goes back to what I just said, basically.

274
00:17:55,677 --> 00:18:07,487
And only if it's worth scoring. What that means is if you go in a back alley and fight a low level guy and get done with it in 5 seconds, maybe that's not worth having music over.

275
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:13,211
Compared to fighting 7 high level guys and being in a very tense situation.

276
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:16,674
That's it.

277
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,537
I thought of it as this very kind of...

278
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:27,688
subtly judgmental aspect to the score, where it's like some very easily picked off enemy

279
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:32,571
comes wandering up to you and the music looks at him and says, you're not really worth my

280
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,234
time. Yeah, you know, if, you know, trying to find

281
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:41,818
out if the player is going on a killing spree for half an hour or just, you know, killing

282
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:48,823
that one guy and going on his way was basically the core of what we were trying to solve as

283
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:49,743
a problem in the music system.

284
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:50,883
Exactly.

285
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:52,524
Just a brief word.

286
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:56,606
I kind of obviously already touched on this, so I can blast through this.

287
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:02,810
But just for me, a big thing on starting any project is to try to define as rigorously

288
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,172
as I can for myself some kind of sense of musical vocabulary.

289
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:13,357
And I think Jason Graves mentioned this beautifully in his Evolve talk the other day, where he

290
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:13,577
was...

291
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:17,560
Because I have the same mentality, which is how can I sort of fence off...

292
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:28,205
The first thing I will do is I will try to restrict myself as much as possible and restrict myself as tightly as possible so that things start to intuitively have this sense of that feels like syndicate and that doesn't.

293
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:35,488
The more I restrict options for myself the more things can have that quality.

294
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,350
If it was just everything in the kitchen sink approach, then I would have to restrict myself to the minimum.

295
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,553
then nothing would intuitively feel right or wrong quite as easily.

296
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:46,218
And I really always try to make every project have kind of its own little musical universe.

297
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:51,603
So like I said in this one, a kind of modernized 19th century chamber music approach.

298
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,508
And the reason I liked that was not because of the flourishing of chamber music in the 19th century,

299
00:19:55,588 --> 00:19:57,910
though as kind of a cool benefit that is true.

300
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:00,891
The idea was something that felt light on its feet,

301
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:02,411
something that felt like an assassin,

302
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,932
something that could easily turn corners,

303
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:06,733
as opposed to the kind of big lumbering dinosaur.

304
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,773
Emotionally significant, though it is,

305
00:20:10,414 --> 00:20:13,835
there's something kind of large and lumbering

306
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,295
about an orchestral approach that just didn't seem right.

307
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:17,936
I thought the way they move,

308
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:22,017
the way that the game's rhythm sort of plays out.

309
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:23,217
This game...

310
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:29,700
The Quebec studio was really working really hard to make this game feel really fresh and

311
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:35,904
really kind of like AC, you know, rethought all over again and to really kind of re-inspire

312
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:39,726
people to be excited about Assassin's Creed.

313
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:44,708
And so there was a snappiness to it that I was just loving and I said that's what the

314
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:46,729
music needs to kind of reflect.

315
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,131
We don't want to go the big melodramatic kind of direction.

316
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:56,116
heavy percussion, heavy synths, that sort of thing, and wanted to do, to try to be a

317
00:20:56,176 --> 00:21:02,760
little bit more musically intimate, with the caveat being that when we're recording chamber

318
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,264
music and we're pushing right in on these musicians, it's actually way more visceral,

319
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:13,408
because you're getting bow strings inches away from the mic, and so it feels in this

320
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:14,929
tactile way right in your face.

321
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:22,994
And so one of the things I'm going to get to more in a bit,

322
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:27,155
though, was also evolving that orchestrational palette

323
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:28,976
through the course of the game as well.

324
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:34,297
So fencing off as small of a kind of lawn musical playground

325
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:37,037
for myself as I could, but giving myself latitude

326
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:39,678
so that it wasn't just this one thing for the entire 30

327
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:41,618
hours of the game or so.

328
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,358
I'd just like to add that.

329
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:50,339
What you just talked about, how being smaller ensembles,

330
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,661
you get more the textures of the individual instruments.

331
00:21:54,302 --> 00:21:57,485
That turned out to be a really great contrast

332
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:59,887
with how London, Victorian London,

333
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:03,670
being such a busy place filled with noise,

334
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,294
with all the action in there, was a very nice contrast.

335
00:22:10,015 --> 00:22:12,237
That turned out to be a really cool aspect of this score.

336
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:19,258
Really quickly just about this concept of themes, because of the sprawling nature of

337
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:23,419
the narratives of these games, it's very tempting to assume that this kind of intense

338
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,780
leitmotif approach would be the way to go, and especially considering that we have sort

339
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,641
of three or four principal characters in the game.

340
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:35,322
You have Jacob and Evie, and then their kind of assassin cohort who they meet in London,

341
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:37,042
and then of course there's the main villain.

342
00:22:37,782 --> 00:22:43,067
And I said, you know, I actually don't think, I mean, I love writing themes conceptually,

343
00:22:43,107 --> 00:22:46,790
but I do think it's generally an overused concept because it creates this crutch where

344
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,734
you don't know what to do from a psychoanalytic standpoint, so you just play the theme of

345
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:52,755
whoever's on screen.

346
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:57,199
And my attitude to that is, well, but I see them on screen, so what are you trying to

347
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:57,760
remind me of?

348
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,402
It's the same reason why period music is redundant.

349
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:08,666
And so I said, furthermore, Jacob and Evie are not, from a musical standpoint, a good

350
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:11,117
They are not really different characters.

351
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:19,785
The salient interesting quality was that it was all about them as a single sibling unit,

352
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:23,509
their relationship with each other and the kind of tension that goes through in the resolution.

353
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:27,793
And so it's kind of like they're two sides of a single coin and I wanted to make just

354
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:31,096
a single theme that was preoccupied with that dynamic.

355
00:23:31,836 --> 00:23:32,277
And so...

356
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,921
That said, the game lets you toggle back and forth between the two characters.

357
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:42,283
And so I said I would, and you know there's missions where you play as one or the other

358
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:45,964
that are very central to the narrative, and then there's, and in the open world you could

359
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:47,265
just freely go back and forth.

360
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:52,140
And so I said I'd love to find some kind of subtle way to delineate them, even if it's

361
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,221
just because I think it's fun.

362
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:57,285
And so it was all about casting soloists.

363
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:02,009
And I apparently like wild theatrical soloists.

364
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:09,956
So on the left is Sandy Cameron, who's a violinist that actually, she's been on tour

365
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:13,979
with Danny Elfman, and that's a shot from her Edward Scissorhands bit on his show.

366
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:20,284
And I was in the audience during the first performance of that, and this person came

367
00:24:20,364 --> 00:24:24,067
out and just played the living hell out of this solo, and I thought, I don't know who

368
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,170
that is, but I need to find them and work with them on something.

369
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,892
And then it was very shortly thereafter that Syndicate came into my life, and I thought,

370
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:30,933
done!

371
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:37,979
And so I said, what if Jacob, the brother, is associated with these featured violin solos?

372
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:44,905
And then Tina, who I have worked with for many years, she's the featured soloist on Journey and many other things,

373
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:52,711
I thought that we can make the sound of her solos that of Evie.

374
00:24:52,791 --> 00:25:02,618
And so the premise being that the score will kind of have these modular solos that can be switched in and out, even in real time, based on who you're playing as.

375
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:06,561
Also, violin and cello weren't random choices.

376
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:07,641
Basically, they...

377
00:25:08,222 --> 00:25:12,742
They run parallel in terms of characteristics with the personalities of the characters.

378
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:17,403
Jacob being more like an upbeat type of character and Evie being more grounded.

379
00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:24,525
And that's how it turned out to be violin the more spry instrument and cello the more deeper voice.

380
00:25:24,845 --> 00:25:34,927
Yeah, and also I did like, it wasn't a central driving motivation, but I did like the idea that there was a slight playing against sort of gender stereotypes.

381
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:37,347
I was like, I was like, it's sort of.

382
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:40,643
Because that was one of the first things a few people asked me.

383
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:42,544
He's like, oh, it's interesting that, you know.

384
00:25:42,564 --> 00:25:43,164
That's unexpected.

385
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:44,625
Yeah, that Evie's the cello.

386
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:45,786
And I was like, really?

387
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:47,447
Well, why not?

388
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:48,647
Yeah, I thought it was.

389
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:53,890
But I kind of, when I realized that apparently it did, I thought, well, actually I like that.

390
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,552
So here's, sorry, this started straight away.

391
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:04,635
This is just a demonstration of some of the systems in the game and how they play back

392
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,456
differently based on which solo.

393
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:08,903
Well, essentially, exactly what I just said.

394
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:11,224
Hold on, let me just.

395
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:14,046
So yeah, it's the same set of music,

396
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:15,767
but in a different instrument.

397
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:15,967
Yeah.

398
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,228
And I think it's in three.

399
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:18,548
I just heard it and I thought,

400
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:20,149
all right, let's see if these are direct,

401
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,251
I can't hear the sound if it's in direct.

402
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,752
Oh yeah, it's still in the same.

403
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,052
P Shit.

404
00:26:24,172 --> 00:26:26,073
Now this is very interesting to watch.

405
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:28,955
I normally have never seen him play a real double bass,

406
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:30,596
but this is completely surreal.

407
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:32,077
This is also going to be awesome.

408
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:32,397
Yeah.

409
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:44,367
The car is ready.

410
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:20,301
It's a very simple, you know, incredibly simple, from a musical standpoint, demonstration of that.

411
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:23,223
But obviously it's effectively the same cue recorded two different ways.

412
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:29,428
So, just a quick word also on the kind of macro structure.

413
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,031
And I'm going to pick up my pace here.

414
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:37,694
I mentioned this earlier that it was important to me

415
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:40,214
that the music have a broad evolution.

416
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:42,215
And that was, I think, one of the big changes

417
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:46,676
from the initial documentation of Christians on plans.

418
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,237
Instead of saying, okay, we need just a giant bank

419
00:27:49,277 --> 00:27:50,777
of combat music, for example, I said,

420
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:52,318
well, what if instead of a giant...

421
00:27:53,038 --> 00:28:16,853
In the beginning, we were working with a small bank of combat music that we gradually work our way through as the player makes their way through the narrative, so that even in the open world, the music is reflective of where you are in the overall progression, and that way we can be reducing the amount of repetition, because we're taking music, kind of putting it on the table, and then relatively quickly taking it back off the table.

422
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:19,314
And I can actually communicate a story arc.

423
00:28:20,235 --> 00:28:26,960
Through purely orchestration and things like that, you know by manipulating the overall palette as things go along.

424
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,401
So even in the open world.

425
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:29,581
Even in the open world.

426
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:30,322
Not just in the story.

427
00:28:30,382 --> 00:28:30,842
Exactly.

428
00:28:30,902 --> 00:28:38,448
Like if you're just wandering the city of London and just enjoying, you know, exploring or side quests or whatever,

429
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,670
the music will reflect your overall progression within the game.

430
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:50,085
Despite the fact that you're not actually engaged in the narrative in that moment, which was important to me because storytelling is, you know, of such paramount importance.

431
00:28:50,926 --> 00:28:55,608
And yet an open world game kind of pushes against the traditional constructs of storytelling.

432
00:28:56,008 --> 00:29:00,009
And so I said I want to have a system superimposed over the overall music.

433
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,711
And so I just wanted to play you a quick example of the way I was kind of...

434
00:29:04,031 --> 00:29:06,772
Starting the score, like these are little snippets from the combat music.

435
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:18,695
This is just a little mp3 that we'll play, you know, a bit from the beginning of the game, a bit from the middle of the game, a bit from later in the game, and you'll hear, you know, it starts off where, like, combat music is literally just two violins sort of shredding with each other.

436
00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:23,396
Again, that's, you know, the open world combat music, not the mission combat music.

437
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:27,077
Yes, yeah, there's a whole other, there's a whole other thing there that we're, like, not even really going to get into.

438
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:29,478
But yeah, so you'll hear it.

439
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:32,461
And then I flesh it out to the full string ensemble.

440
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,963
You know, by the time we reach the middle again, I start adding in woodwinds.

441
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:38,686
Which was one of those, I was like, surely they're not going to go for this.

442
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:41,688
I'm like, I want flutes as my combat.

443
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:44,550
And no one said anything.

444
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:52,437
And then I ditched the winds by the end, and it migrates into chamber brass and strings.

445
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:53,698
So here's just kind of a taste of...

446
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:10,903
And,well, I went to parody a creepy audio I found on Google.

447
00:30:11,283 --> 00:30:16,625
If you're wondering what happened, have a look at my last video!

448
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:17,906
More creepy audio!

449
00:30:17,926 --> 00:30:20,267
A fan made a video called School of the Apes,

450
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:25,049
and made a parody of a video by Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.

451
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:27,270

00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:11,584
slow

507
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:11,824
slow

508
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:12,104
slow

509
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:12,265
slow

510
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:12,465
slow

511
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:12,685
slow

512
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:12,865
slow

513
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:12,985
slow

514
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:13,186
slow

515
00:31:13,226 --> 00:31:13,426
slow

516
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:13,586
slow

517
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:13,726
slow

518
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:13,967
slow

519
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:14,207
slow

520
00:31:14,447 --> 00:31:14,607
slow

521
00:31:14,627 --> 00:31:14,728
slow

522
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:14,848
slow

523
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:14,988
slow

524
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:15,108
slow

525
00:31:15,128 --> 00:31:15,308
slow

526
00:31:18,282 --> 00:31:24,668
You can hear, at least particularly for the composers in here, that the actual harmonic language was also evolving in there.

527
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:32,235
The idea that it starts off very simple and very kind of plain in a way, and by the end it can get actually quite a bit...

528
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:36,117
It's a little bit thornier than 19th century music ever actually got.

529
00:31:36,137 --> 00:31:42,820
I called it, the way I described it was, I want to go back in time and abduct Mendelssohn,

530
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,262
but bring him to like the mid-20th century, hang out with Bartok for a few days, and then I'll send him back.

531
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:52,504
And so that's kind of a taste in that.

532
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:59,944
All right. Getting a little bit into the combat music system. You know, we won't go

533
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:05,326
over everything, but that one's interesting because it's by far the most complex dynamic

534
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:11,469
music system in the game. So it was built based on my experience working on the music

535
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:15,450
systems on Assassin's Creed 3 and Black Flag and on their DLCs.

536
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:22,556
And they had all these cool ideas in there, like the notion of having different states

537
00:32:22,736 --> 00:32:26,800
in a combat scenario, like are you hiding from the enemies, are you being chased, that

538
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,763
would have different music cues for each of those scenarios.

539
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:35,067
Intensity levels based on the number of enemies you're fighting, is it a small patrol or are

540
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:38,410
you being ambushed by 10 guys, that would have different cues.

541
00:32:40,112 --> 00:32:43,174
Also your health level, are you about to die, stuff like that.

542
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:49,559
And location based variation of the combat music in Black Flag, the music, the combat

543
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:53,861
music would be different based on which island you were on.

544
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:55,602
So that was all good.

545
00:32:56,703 --> 00:33:00,926
Which leads me to our goals for the combat music in Syndicate.

546
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:04,388
We want to score the player's combat scenario.

547
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:07,170
You know, tell, score a story in the combat.

548
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:09,118
Predict his intentions.

549
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:14,601
Is he on a killing spree like I said earlier or is he just fighting one weak dude and it's

550
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:15,641
over in a few seconds.

551
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,122
Have variety.

552
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:22,904
Keep the data streamlined for the combat music system which was much harder than it sounds.

553
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:29,527
And you know, stay focused on keeping the musical flow as good as possible.

554
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:34,760
And this was the first version of the combat system, the chart.

555
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,743
And you can see there's a problem there.

556
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:39,026
Pretty obviously.

557
00:33:39,046 --> 00:33:39,426
Yeah.

558
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:41,088
It's very complex.

559
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:44,032
What I ended up doing is just adding my own ideas

560
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:46,695
to the existing concepts from the previous games.

561
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:51,755
You know, it's an exponential increase in complexity.

562
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:54,656
There were a lot of transition cases,

563
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:57,597
but possible transition cases, which

564
00:33:57,677 --> 00:34:00,938
means a lot more potential musical flow problems, which

565
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:04,500
we were trying to avoid, and a lot of music

566
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,861
to produce, which is another set of problems.

567
00:34:09,802 --> 00:34:11,442
And this is what we ended up with, roughly.

568
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:21,796
iteration of playing the game, we realized that we didn't need all those states and the

569
00:34:21,836 --> 00:34:26,563
music being very dynamic, it shifts around a lot, there's a lot of stuff going on.

570
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:32,509
But it's actually doing the bulk of the work that we wanted the system to do.

571
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,453
And it was doing it better just by playing on its own.

572
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:42,379
There would be all these little accidents, happy accidents happening as you were playing,

573
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:43,520
fighting guys.

574
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,846
The music loop would play and you would get the impression that it would react to what

575
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:52,248
you were actually doing in the game, where really it was just...

576
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,430
doing its thing and playing, there's no system involved.

577
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,150
So that was a really interesting side effect

578
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,891
of the music being very complex.

579
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,451
And that's such a recurring motif,

580
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:03,352
I feel like, every year at GDC.

581
00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:06,393
Inevitably, we set out to design a really reactive system,

582
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:08,613
and then we discovered the power of happy accidents

583
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,214
and realized it doesn't need to be as reactive as we thought.

584
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:13,935
And so I feel like there's this dichotomy

585
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:18,976
of the adaptive versus non-adaptive music.

586
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,337
And I would actually argue that it's more that

587
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:25,600
It's a spectrum of the degrees of adaptivity of the music.

588
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:28,743
And that we're, as an industry in general, we're kind of

589
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:33,148
sort of zeroing in broadly on what that happy medium is.

590
00:35:33,488 --> 00:35:37,312
Musicality and playing out over a linear space

591
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:40,895
for the sake of musicality, versus tight

592
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:43,377
marriage to the player experience.

593
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,851
You know, and as music designers, audio designers,

594
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,171
all that, we're technical people.

595
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:51,693
It becomes very easy to fall into the trap of making

596
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,674
this huge, really complex, cool system.

597
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:58,976
And it's actually making your life harder, not easier.

598
00:35:59,016 --> 00:36:00,696
And not even serving the game.

599
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:09,970
A couple of mechanics from the combat music system, threat, threat level, threat values,

600
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:16,413
those are, you know, they determine the intensity of the music level, the intensity level of

601
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:17,174
the music that's playing.

602
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:22,177
It's a sum of values assigned to game elements and variables,

603
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:26,060
like what type of enemy you're fighting at the moment.

604
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,782
Are they weak archetypes or strong archetypes?

605
00:36:28,822 --> 00:36:31,084
They'll have different values and have different influence

606
00:36:31,164 --> 00:36:32,845
on the intensity level of the music.

607
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:37,929
Also, your player level versus the enemy level.

608
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:41,167
will change its value.

609
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:44,190
So if you're of a much higher level than the enemy,

610
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,873
you'll have a smaller value, so less influence

611
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:49,216
on the total threat level.

612
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:53,301
So less influence on the intensity level of the music.

613
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,901
Next, there's the cool down state.

614
00:36:57,861 --> 00:37:00,642
That replaces what used to be a victory cue when

615
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:01,882
you finished a fight.

616
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:05,504
It's actually a slow transition back to silence

617
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:09,065
or to the next combat.

618
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:12,786
It's a one-shot cue of music about 20 seconds long.

619
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:21,471
That leads me to the idea of chains. If you get into another fight before the cooldown,

620
00:37:22,172 --> 00:37:27,478
you know, the 20 second cooldown ends, you get into another different set of music. That's

621
00:37:27,518 --> 00:37:29,139
called the second chain.

622
00:37:30,401 --> 00:37:33,604
And that's our mean to have variety in the combat music

623
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:37,007
through four long combat scenarios,

624
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:38,908
where the player would get into multiple fights

625
00:37:38,948 --> 00:37:39,709
in quick succession.

626
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,612
Which is very organic to the way the game is designed,

627
00:37:42,632 --> 00:37:44,854
because it's so easy to create a.

628
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:49,058
It's a train of enemies where you think you're out of it and you go running and you bring

629
00:37:49,098 --> 00:37:49,578
a lot more.

630
00:37:49,618 --> 00:37:55,123
So the cool down kicks in and you end up bringing a rain of hell down on yourself and the music

631
00:37:55,283 --> 00:38:00,107
is ready to go to kick back in as opposed to the system starting over.

632
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:07,293
And that came from the idea of trying to tell a story and think how all the game events

633
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:08,174
are interconnected.

634
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:09,855
There's a single fight event.

635
00:38:11,717 --> 00:38:16,562
You know, in a movie, if you have someone fighting this group of people, then fighting

636
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:20,105
that other group of people, then that other group of people, it would be scored and, you

637
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:22,328
know, there would be a progression there.

638
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:24,190
So that was our mean to try and achieve that.

639
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:27,268
Next, there's the character switch.

640
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:29,489
So what we just talked about, how if you're

641
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:33,012
playing as Jacob or Evie, you would get the violin or cello

642
00:38:33,112 --> 00:38:33,532
solos.

643
00:38:33,592 --> 00:38:36,574
There are actually different parts of the music.

644
00:38:37,995 --> 00:38:40,397
And that's another way to achieve variety.

645
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:43,039
Also, the game progression sets.

646
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,741
You heard an example earlier, how if you're early in the game,

647
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:49,423
you'll get one set of combat music.

648
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:51,425
If you're late in the game, you'll

649
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:52,285
get another set of combat music.

650
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:57,068
set of combat music with all the involved parts.

651
00:38:57,108 --> 00:38:59,670
So different cool downs, different everything,

652
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,070
basically.

653
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:02,432
So here's an example.

654
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:03,513
Here's a look at that.

655
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:34,340
I'm back, man!

656
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,863
God, you lack a face!

657
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:43,274
And you can see also I couldn't resist the temptation and when you're creating cooldowns

658
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:48,080
for the higher intensities, later chains, it would almost always be a scenario like

659
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,585
this where it's at the culmination of kind of a recurring and revamping.

660
00:40:54,708 --> 00:41:01,492
combat scenario and so I just to me there was just something irresistibly fun about having these like authentic cadences that that as you're leaving

661
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:02,913
It's you know, no no no no no

662
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:08,736
Boom boom because you're like clearly walking away from this thing. That was a lot bigger than whereas the other ones tended to drift out

663
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:08,996
more

664
00:41:09,757 --> 00:41:13,259
subtly, which was just me kind of applying a general nerdiness to

665
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,601
To you know the way the game would actually would actually play out

666
00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:23,625
So looking back at the result for the combat system,

667
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:30,193
main takeaway I got from all this is, like I said earlier,

668
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:33,176
all the little happy accidents that happen.

669
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:40,605
where you let the music do its thing instead of trying to have a system that's leading

670
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,607
forward all the music.

671
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:47,353
And that happens if your music is very dynamic and all that.

672
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:53,500
Not necessarily for different styles of game music.

673
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:59,936
But it makes me wonder, like that's an open-ended question,

674
00:42:01,238 --> 00:42:03,782
as music designers, we tend to want to control,

675
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:07,467
in a very micro way, the music.

676
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:09,470
Is that really always the right way?

677
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:13,524
It depends on the type of music, but in this case,

678
00:42:13,884 --> 00:42:14,424
definitely not.

679
00:42:15,305 --> 00:42:19,309
And there's a lot of things to improve in that combat system.

680
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,132
Sadly, most of that system was in place

681
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:25,013
before Austin became involved, and that

682
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:26,355
was a production imperative.

683
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:30,318
Next time, I'd definitely like to have the composer more

684
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:32,159
involved from earlier on.

685
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,303
There is weird behavior sometimes. It kind of has a mind of its own with all the little

686
00:42:38,363 --> 00:42:44,846
moving parts involved. It's not, you know, Skynet levels of awareness, but it does weird

687
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:50,469
stuff sometimes. It doesn't take allies into account in your fight scenarios and they do

688
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:56,272
speed combat, they speed up combat a lot. So you do get sometimes what we were trying

689
00:42:56,292 --> 00:43:00,375
to avoid, which is me starting and stopping in quick succession, sadly.

690
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:07,477
You know, basing the threat level on the player's damage

691
00:43:07,537 --> 00:43:10,598
output instead of his level relative to the enemy's level

692
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:14,840
would have been probably a better statistic

693
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,481
to base the threat level on, because it's a more direct.

694
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:26,084
A reflection of its combat effectiveness, basically.

695
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:30,166
A better handling of many quick game events happening,

696
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:30,887
quick succession.

697
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:36,690
And there are some music cues that play very rarely because

698
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,931
of how the system is built.

699
00:43:38,651 --> 00:43:39,732
That could have been managed better.

700
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:46,689
In other words, some of the downstream high-intensity chains end up becoming almost like musical

701
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,190
Easter eggs.

702
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:47,911
Low-intensity.

703
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:50,737
Low-intensity downstream chain.

704
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:51,498
Yeah, exactly.

705
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:52,199
Because they can end up...

706
00:43:52,993 --> 00:43:57,275
been quite hard to trigger because you have to basically be in a long-running low-intensity

707
00:43:57,315 --> 00:44:01,156
battle or combat situation which is actually kind of rare.

708
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:07,878
We're going to actually skip this because we don't want to lose out on time for questions.

709
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,499
Yeah, we'd really like if you have questions.

710
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:13,060
But basically, yeah, just the long and short of it is there's a whole system in place for

711
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,661
one of these big, you know, one of the big classic AC tropes is the reach high point

712
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,022
which is where you go up to the top and you do your leap of faith.

713
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:23,024
Not a terribly elaborate system, but there is a system there.

714
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:25,005
So...

715
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:28,287
There... and moving on.

716
00:44:29,468 --> 00:44:30,169
And moving on.

717
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,733
It'll be... we'll find a way to put that out there.

718
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:42,700
I'd like to quickly go over this because exploration music, it's a kind of hot topic for the

719
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:49,003
Assassin's Creed music fans. Rooftops music was our solution for that. Basically, it's

720
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:51,604
exploration music that's triggered when you um...

721
00:44:52,285 --> 00:44:58,393
You hang on the rooftops area, it's based on your elevation in the game world and that

722
00:44:58,434 --> 00:44:59,795
triggers the music for exploration.

723
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:02,059
Why only on rooftops?

724
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,164
Basically that was to avoid cluttering the audio mix at the street level.

725
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:09,289
We had a concern from the very beginning of the production.

726
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:15,371
about how this game would end up being very busy audio-wise,

727
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:17,192
because London is such a busy city.

728
00:45:17,272 --> 00:45:18,333
We had carriages.

729
00:45:18,653 --> 00:45:19,333
We had trains.

730
00:45:19,373 --> 00:45:23,555
We had thugs screaming at you from the other side

731
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,335
of the street and all that.

732
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:28,357
We didn't want to add more noise to that, so rooftops.

733
00:45:28,597 --> 00:45:33,022
Also, my theory that explorer type players, they will tend to

734
00:45:33,343 --> 00:45:36,547
climb up, they will tend to go on the rooftops to watch the

735
00:45:36,607 --> 00:45:40,152
sunset, the sunrise, to look at that train crossing the bridge

736
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:43,376
all over there. And that seemed like the better place to get the

737
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,599
most bang for our buck for the exploration music.

738
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,002
And, you know, it's a simple system, really.

739
00:45:49,222 --> 00:45:52,044
It checks for what district you're in, what hour is it,

740
00:45:52,405 --> 00:45:53,986
and it picks the appropriate track for that.

741
00:45:54,006 --> 00:45:55,948
There's day variation and night variation.

742
00:45:56,468 --> 00:45:59,231
And also your game progression will trigger or not

743
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,614
vocal tracks, depending on your game progression.

744
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:08,329
Yeah, because I said I want to have these soprano solos that are singing in English

745
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:09,950
text derived from Nam Tate's...

746
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,170
Speaking of Easter eggs.

747
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:19,132
Yes, libretto from the Purcell opera Dido and Aeneas, but I, you know, with my own melody

748
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:22,553
but those texts, and I said, and I can kind of comment on what's going on.

749
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,294
In English, you know, I said there's so many of the kind of ethereal vocal solos.

750
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:32,196
I said, I like the idea that, you know, you go up on the roof and you're looking out over the city

751
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:36,317
and this kind of wistful music comes in and then the soprano sings right at you, you know,

752
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,258
peace and I are strangers grown.

753
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:40,218
And it's like, oh, that...

754
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,650
I kind of, that's a bummer.

755
00:46:44,492 --> 00:46:46,054
But I was like, I like that.

756
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:49,758
And they were, again, such a joy working with Christian and Lydia,

757
00:46:49,778 --> 00:46:51,120
they were totally on board with that.

758
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,465
So it's a simple system, but it's one that is checking a lot of variables.

759
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,161
As side missions and side activities,

760
00:46:58,621 --> 00:47:01,364
I'll only say about that we ended up

761
00:47:02,245 --> 00:47:05,228
using that game progression idea for the side missions.

762
00:47:05,588 --> 00:47:08,991
The 1,000 story stuff, all the investigations and stuff,

763
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:10,813
it's generic tracks.

764
00:47:11,213 --> 00:47:13,275
They're not composed specifically for the missions,

765
00:47:13,836 --> 00:47:17,559
but they change depending on your game progression.

766
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,541
If you're in sequence eight versus if you're

767
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:21,143
in sequence four, you'll get different music.

768
00:47:22,844 --> 00:47:29,707
Yeah, so that turned out to be a cool idea applied to a more generic situation, and you know that could be explored further in the future

769
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:34,070
Yeah, exactly so in other words be you know because there were so many side missions

770
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,671
I couldn't write you know I wrote over three hours of music

771
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:40,012
but I could have doubled it and still not been able to cover everything and

772
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:41,293
But there would be you know

773
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:47,456
Cues that are reused for a lot of different side missions except that depending on when in the game you do it it triggers different

774
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:50,257
Music so that it's in line with the overall macro progression

775
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:53,961
In a single playthrough it's difficult to perceive because you only do it once.

776
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:55,543
Which is actually the idea.

777
00:47:55,783 --> 00:47:59,047
It should just feel like it's organically chasing whatever you're doing, whatever your

778
00:47:59,087 --> 00:47:59,528
story is.

779
00:47:59,888 --> 00:48:00,228
Exactly.

780
00:48:00,248 --> 00:48:06,515
A quick side note about source music, music in the world, the street bands and all that

781
00:48:06,536 --> 00:48:06,716
stuff.

782
00:48:07,736 --> 00:48:12,179
We wanted each district of the city to have a distinct, detailed musical life to them.

783
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:18,483
So we defined a list of songs from the era and different band configurations that would

784
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,264
fit the mood and type of each district.

785
00:48:21,344 --> 00:48:26,588
So you'll get more folk type bands in Lambeth, you'll get work songs in Southwark, you'll

786
00:48:26,608 --> 00:48:32,131
get music all singers on the Strand, you'll get brass bands in the parks of Westminster.

787
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:39,881
There's even details like passerby's walking about bands

788
00:48:40,381 --> 00:48:42,705
and they'll pick up the songs that the band's playing

789
00:48:42,765 --> 00:48:44,026
and start humming it to themselves.

790
00:48:45,328 --> 00:48:45,929
That's really cool.

791
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:49,731
It turned out really cool and we almost didn't get it.

792
00:48:51,112 --> 00:48:53,872
Which leads me to district themes in the score.

793
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:59,033
We asked ourselves what we could do to take the source music

794
00:48:59,093 --> 00:48:59,754
aspect further.

795
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:01,934
You know, our black flag at the Sea Shanties,

796
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:03,574
and that turned out to be a great success.

797
00:49:03,795 --> 00:49:06,895
But we didn't want to copy what was done before.

798
00:49:06,915 --> 00:49:09,716
We wanted to have our own little thing.

799
00:49:10,396 --> 00:49:15,940
So, that's how we came to the district themes, which are popular songs from the era and they

800
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,441
act as themes for each of the city's districts.

801
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:20,142
Each one of them have their own song.

802
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:26,046
And that's used for the rooftops music, the reach eye point music, the side activities,

803
00:49:26,406 --> 00:49:27,707
and of course the source music.

804
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:31,329
The bands and the street musicians actually play those songs too.

805
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,331
Yeah, so the idea is that you hear someone...

806
00:49:35,212 --> 00:49:41,817
The game is about a man on the street playing a folk song. These were researched, authenticated, period authentic songs.

807
00:49:42,257 --> 00:49:49,563
And then as you go up on the rooftop, the score actually picks up this thing and puts it through the filter of the actual score.

808
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:56,528
which was, to me, a really wonderful way to mix up what I was doing.

809
00:49:57,489 --> 00:50:02,250
I thought of this as Lydia, the audio director's big brainchild, because she's from London.

810
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:08,893
She was very preoccupied with really carefully choosing these songs that had a lot of personality.

811
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:14,320
you know, particular to the area of the city that we were looking at.

812
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,122
And I was invited to participate in the selection process, which was really wonderful,

813
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:23,065
because I was looking at them from the angle of, compositionally, what will I do with this tune?

814
00:50:23,165 --> 00:50:24,705
Yeah, exactly.

815
00:50:25,066 --> 00:50:26,766
And so here's just kind of an example of that.

816
00:51:06,953 --> 00:51:10,517
Champagne Charlie is me name.

817
00:51:10,577 --> 00:51:13,800
Champagne Charlie is me name.

818
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,264
Good Freddy game at night, me boys.

819
00:51:17,564 --> 00:51:19,666
Good Freddy game at night.

820
00:51:45,524 --> 00:51:50,265
You won't like it if I come over there!

821
00:52:22,463 --> 00:52:24,505
So you get the idea, these little melodic fragments

822
00:52:24,565 --> 00:52:26,386
that you end up hearing performed a lot.

823
00:52:26,426 --> 00:52:28,188
There's a lot of musicians in the city.

824
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:31,832
In quick succession, it seems very obvious.

825
00:52:31,892 --> 00:52:34,434
But actually, some of them are really more subtle,

826
00:52:34,474 --> 00:52:36,816
like the Champagne Charlie one was not

827
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:39,859
the vocal line doing the Champagne Charlie melody.

828
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:42,782
It was the actual string counterpart.

829
00:52:42,922 --> 00:52:46,204
And that one was actually particularly tricky, because the melody is so bouncy.

830
00:52:46,765 --> 00:52:50,007
By the way, you're all going away with that in your head.

831
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,868
Yeah, it is. It took me a long time to get that out of my system.

832
00:52:53,549 --> 00:52:56,050
That's why, of course, when I was orchestrating it, it's very dramatic.

833
00:53:00,653 --> 00:53:02,074
So, in the last sort of like...

834
00:53:03,108 --> 00:53:06,355
Amazingly fun thing to do on this was the murder ballads.

835
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:14,431
So these three dashing Aussies are a group from Melbourne called Tripod.

836
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:20,848
And I had just done a show with them about a year ago called This Gaming Life.

837
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:25,710
We did a two-hour production with the Melbourne Symphony of songs, like a cabaret show with

838
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:26,451
full orchestra.

839
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:29,392
And I was madly in love with working with these guys.

840
00:53:29,552 --> 00:53:33,754
And Lydia brought up the idea of, okay, there's going to be all this source music throughout

841
00:53:33,774 --> 00:53:34,115
the game.

842
00:53:34,215 --> 00:53:40,698
What if there are original songs kind of tucked away inside there that we're passing off as

843
00:53:41,058 --> 00:53:42,679
other period songs?

844
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:48,161
But they're about the events that the citizenry is witnessing throughout London.

845
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:52,183
So, you know, as an assassin, you take down some high-profile public figure,

846
00:53:52,223 --> 00:53:56,385
and then shortly thereafter, as you're just walking through the city,

847
00:53:56,405 --> 00:54:00,147
you hear someone singing about that public figure being assassinated.

848
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:00,847
It's like, wait a minute...

849
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:09,065
And so we said, let's write these songs to kind of tuck into the game to just flesh out

850
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:10,306
the world even more.

851
00:54:10,426 --> 00:54:12,767
And they're actually kind of remarkably difficult to find.

852
00:54:13,908 --> 00:54:17,431
But it's a wonderful, you know, I got a lot of messages on Twitter and things from people

853
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:19,333
who happened on it and were like, oh, wow.

854
00:54:19,373 --> 00:54:22,695
There's a thread on Reddit of people looking for the murder balance.

855
00:54:22,715 --> 00:54:24,016
So here's...

856
00:54:24,056 --> 00:54:24,197
Here's...

857
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:30,606
Today we brag a different kind of prey

858
00:54:31,487 --> 00:54:36,788
Here at a bugle call, we're feasting on a lord

859
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:41,669
Today we brag a different kind of prey

860
00:54:41,749 --> 00:54:45,530
Perl Attaway is one of your targets

861
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:49,371
Hark the horses, steer the wheels

862
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:53,051
And embrace this cold delay

863
00:54:54,364 --> 00:55:01,347
I am undone, the sun has gone, all the pain's gone

864
00:55:01,447 --> 00:55:06,569
Those who fall for something better

865
00:55:06,629 --> 00:55:10,391
Those who talk about how they lived

866
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:15,773
Loved ones take a long before their work was done

867
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:19,574
Underground, underground

868
00:55:19,674 --> 00:55:22,396
Leave them behind

869
00:55:25,307 --> 00:55:26,828
So that was a little bit on that.

870
00:55:27,389 --> 00:55:30,311
Just one incredibly quick word here

871
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:33,933
was just that the Murder Bowels, by the way,

872
00:55:33,973 --> 00:55:37,376
was the most fun time I've had in terms

873
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:41,619
of the only time in my career as my deliverable requirement,

874
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,461
been sheet music, which was pretty awesome.

875
00:55:46,082 --> 00:55:48,824
But we recorded the score at Abbey Road.

876
00:55:50,065 --> 00:55:55,249
I can get into the one question we're going to have time for and subsequently out in the

877
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:59,191
hallway as the case may be, on to this whole process.

878
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:03,935
But the standard, you know, create mock-ups, send them to them, do my whole prep process

879
00:56:03,975 --> 00:56:07,758
and then off we went to Abbey Road and flew through huge volumes of music.

880
00:56:09,173 --> 00:56:14,495
And then just want to make one final note, I am often advocating for the value of being

881
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:22,799
divisive. And I definitely practice what I preach on this game. Because this has been

882
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:28,381
the recurring motif amongst long-running AC fans. If you look at the top and bottom comments

883
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:33,303
from just one of the random YouTube videos, basically this is the worst score ever written

884
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:38,005
and also the best score ever written. And I'm not going to get into that. I'm going to

885
00:56:39,176 --> 00:56:43,157
And I'm actually okay with that.

886
00:56:43,437 --> 00:56:47,538
I like that we kind of challenged people, and some people completely loved it and embraced

887
00:56:47,598 --> 00:56:47,638
it.

888
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:52,100
And we knew we're making such an about face from the previous AC games that there's going

889
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,321
to be some that don't like it, or in this case, dear God, no, I hate, hate, hate, hate!

890
00:56:56,921 --> 00:57:00,404
This, Mr. Wintery, coming over to discuss this.

891
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,625
You've got to challenge people.

892
00:57:01,805 --> 00:57:08,830
Yeah, so anyway, I just thought it was valuable to shine a light on the fact that we didn't think we would please everyone, and we were correct.

893
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:17,477
And so anyway, we literally do have only a couple minutes, but there's a microphone right here.

894
00:57:17,497 --> 00:57:23,341
The housekeeping note, don't forget about doing your evaluations when they show up on your phone.

895
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,243
But any questions?

896
00:57:28,495 --> 00:57:30,077
Yes, Mr. Domenico.

897
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:31,298
Thank you for this.

898
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:35,083
I really enjoyed Black Flag and I can't wait to play this game.

899
00:57:36,805 --> 00:57:42,913
Were you challenged by the fact that you knew that you had to create these varying levels

900
00:57:42,933 --> 00:57:46,317
of intensity when you were composing or did you do that after the fact?

901
00:57:46,892 --> 00:57:51,913
Oh, for sure. It was designed from the ground up with that system in mind. It was definitely not like write a piece.

902
00:57:51,933 --> 00:57:56,535
Because they're distinct cues. They're not like cue with added drums or something like that.

903
00:57:56,875 --> 00:58:01,656
It's definitely completely distinct music. And it created some challenges for him as well.

904
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:04,857
Because I would say, okay, I think that maybe it's going to be a faster tempo.

905
00:58:05,077 --> 00:58:12,580
So he's having to figure out transitions where there's a pretty massive tempo change happening within a cue basically.

906
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,620
And things like that.

907
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,903
Barely no layering. It's all distinct cues.

908
00:58:18,644 --> 00:58:25,630
Yeah, the layering is pretty subtle. And the layering is mainly, I would say, the biggest feature of the layering is actually the soloists.

909
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:28,172
The violin versus the cello sort of decision.

910
00:58:28,192 --> 00:58:30,534
Awesome. Yeah, that's great. Thank you.

911
00:58:30,614 --> 00:58:31,014
Thanks, man.

912
00:58:32,615 --> 00:58:34,997
Hi. Thanks for the talk, by the way. That was great.

913
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:41,827
So you kind of skimmed over this at the end, but did you create mockups during the process?

914
00:58:42,007 --> 00:58:49,276
And if so, how did you overcome the fact that, I mean, it's a lot more difficult to do effective

915
00:58:49,336 --> 00:58:51,178
mockups for chamber ensembles?

916
00:58:51,725 --> 00:58:53,868
So I overcame that by being really lucky.

917
00:58:54,769 --> 00:59:00,876
Because I was working, you know, Christian, you know, you get the sense probably that he's very technically savvy.

918
00:59:01,236 --> 00:59:05,020
What you don't know is he's also an incredible musician himself.

919
00:59:05,601 --> 00:59:10,647
And so, there, the sort of leaps of faith, not to make a C pun.

920
00:59:11,408 --> 00:59:18,232
Uh, that are required, um, in, in, because I basically said early on, uh, I'm going to

921
00:59:18,272 --> 00:59:22,235
send you mockups and they're going to be god awful because I'm going to be using all solo

922
00:59:22,255 --> 00:59:27,639
string samples and so, and they're going to phase if ever I have them in unison and it's

923
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:28,679
just going to be an ugly mess.

924
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,702
And he and Lydia both were like, that's fine.

925
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:37,586
And honestly, I basically did no revisions of the entire score.

926
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:41,349
Like, the first combat cue, we moved quickly away

927
00:59:41,429 --> 00:59:44,652
from this very figurative, like, box style, you know,

928
00:59:44,672 --> 00:59:47,714
da-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da-da, to the more waltzing idea.

929
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:50,917
And once we locked in from that, it basically got no pushback

930
00:59:51,117 --> 00:59:53,919
on any cue of even minor changes,

931
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:57,582
and including reactions that were the classic situation

932
00:59:57,642 --> 00:59:58,543
of, you know.

933
00:59:59,043 --> 01:00:01,903
getting a note and realizing, oh, they actually like the cue, but they don't like the mockup.

934
01:00:02,244 --> 01:00:04,004
I was very lucky. I didn't deal with any of that.

935
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:13,286
There was this thing in this project about trust and being able to hear further than the mockups.

936
01:00:13,486 --> 01:00:16,687
Hearing what they're going to sound in the end.

937
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:21,608
It wasn't always easy, but the fact that the... no, really.

938
01:00:22,048 --> 01:00:23,368
And the fact that the pitch...

939
01:00:24,168 --> 01:00:24,468
No, really.

940
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,166
No, there really wasn't any way to make those mock-ups sound even close, because it was

941
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:38,174
so much based on the musician's interpretation and the actual emotion they would put into

942
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:38,294
it.

943
01:00:38,995 --> 01:00:45,141
And the pitch being live helped a lot to extrapolate from the mock-ups.

944
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:52,203
That is how I bought that trust. When they said, will you send us your pitch, I did an out of

945
01:00:52,263 --> 01:00:56,584
pocket recording session of the full scale production of the score as I was envisioning it,

946
01:00:56,844 --> 01:01:02,085
so that way I could say, here's a mock up of this, here's the final, before we've even gotten

947
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:07,007
started, so you can hear the trajectory between those. Once they heard that, the mock ups became

948
01:01:07,047 --> 01:01:10,907
less of an issue, because they could always go back and listen to the recording I had done

949
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:15,208
before we even started on the score and say, ah, so that's the place we're headed.

950
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:18,390
So then you make the mockup extra bad on that first one.

951
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:22,533
I needed no help making the mockup extra bad.

952
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,394
I assure you.

953
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:26,395
All right.

954
01:01:26,515 --> 01:01:27,355
I think we are probably...

955
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,376
Thank you.

956
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:29,797
If you want to...

957
01:01:29,817 --> 01:01:33,579
Did you have one last question and I'll answer it as we're clearing out?

958
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:34,840
No.

959
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,540
No?

960
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,961
I'm inviting you, but you've got to go right now.

961
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:39,286
Thank you.

962
01:01:39,326 --> 01:01:42,028
It's actually related to the previous question.

963
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:45,371
In film production, you have the film.

964
01:01:45,391 --> 01:01:46,011
It is finished.

965
01:01:46,031 --> 01:01:46,952
Then you write the music.

966
01:01:46,972 --> 01:01:48,414
Then you go to the recording session.

967
01:01:48,434 --> 01:01:50,175
And it's pretty much a streamlined process.

968
01:01:50,515 --> 01:01:54,819
But in this case, especially when doing mock-ups

969
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:57,181
was really difficult, but you still probably

970
01:01:57,201 --> 01:02:01,265
had to deliver stuff to be approved by Ubisoft

971
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:04,408
or whatever at different stages, and that the game is constantly

972
01:02:04,468 --> 01:02:06,610
evolving, adding new content, et cetera.

973
01:02:07,163 --> 01:02:09,405
How do you handle that production process?

974
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:13,008
At what time do you choose to record the instrumentalist, etc.?

975
01:02:13,048 --> 01:02:14,008
Yeah, absolutely.

976
01:02:14,028 --> 01:02:14,649
It's a great question.

977
01:02:14,669 --> 01:02:17,611
I'm going to give an incredibly succinct answer so we can clear out of here for these guys.

978
01:02:17,671 --> 01:02:23,356
But the basic answer is I said to them, what is the absolute latest date that I can get

979
01:02:23,396 --> 01:02:24,096
you the recordings?

980
01:02:24,136 --> 01:02:28,780
Because I do not want to put myself in a position of having to music edit the hell out of these

981
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,102
recordings if something doesn't work quite right.

982
01:02:31,962 --> 01:02:40,005
But also, there were certain aspects of the score, like there were a bunch of cues that required only solo violin, for example, like, you know, a single spawn cue or something like that.

983
01:02:40,025 --> 01:02:43,967
And I was like, those I can do whenever I can do those, and those are easy to redo.

984
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:46,148
But when I go to London, that's a one-shot deal.

985
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:56,851
And so I just pushed it as late as possible, and we worked together to say, you know, I don't want to be dropping a giant amount of music on him so that it gets screwed in the implementation, so it can't be too close to the end.

986
01:02:57,412 --> 01:02:59,172
And so, but that was basically the answer.

987
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:01,053
It's just deliver as late as possible.

988
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:03,734
And again, they were very trusting that that was going to be okay.

989
01:03:04,254 --> 01:03:09,497
And they were even willing to, when the initial announcement came out of the game, you know,

990
01:03:09,677 --> 01:03:12,838
like E3 and things like that, you know, the instinct was, well, we should record some

991
01:03:12,878 --> 01:03:14,179
of this so we're putting our best face forward.

992
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,140
And I said, I wouldn't, I said, I'd rather put mockups in the, in the E3.

993
01:03:20,241 --> 01:03:24,963
All of our effort and all of our budget towards the final result.

994
01:03:24,983 --> 01:03:30,244
I've been on other projects where they front loaded recording sessions for the sake of their PR.

995
01:03:30,784 --> 01:03:33,885
And it actually hurts the game in my opinion.

996
01:03:34,045 --> 01:03:35,146
Anyway, thank you all so much.
