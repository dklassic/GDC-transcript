1
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:17,671
Hello and welcome. I've been a huge follower of GDC over YouTube for two years, yet I'm

2
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:21,772
finally here to make a contribution myself as well. I hope you find it interesting.

3
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:28,714
In this session, we're going to discuss why team size matters in game development.

4
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:32,446
And I plan on sharing real-life examples with you from Veloxia,

5
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:34,427
which I believe you will find very useful.

6
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,629
Since the mobile gaming went through the roof recently,

7
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,611
the competition is now quite fierce,

8
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:43,133
and we believe in Darwin's theory, which applies here too.

9
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:46,496
It is not the strongest of the developers that survives,

10
00:00:46,936 --> 00:00:48,117
nor the most intelligent.

11
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:50,459
It is the one most adaptable to change, of course.

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,982
I'm sure many of you must have heard of Beezus 2 Pizza Rule.

13
00:00:55,758 --> 00:00:58,803
A principle implemented for the early days of Amazon.

14
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:04,011
So the rule is basically a guideline to determine how many people should work on the same problem

15
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:07,596
or product in our case. According to the rule,

16
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:10,801
every team should be small enough to be fed by two large pizzas.

17
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:13,939
A few of my teammates, though, this

18
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:18,080
might result in a team of one person, but never mind.

19
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:22,121
Turns out this helps with people feeling way more engaged

20
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,322
and spreading higher responsibility

21
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:27,283
across the team leads to a much higher sense of autonomy.

22
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:31,765
Learning from one of the top business people in the world,

23
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:35,086
the cluster structure is a modified implementation

24
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:36,146
of this rule, in fact.

25
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:39,588
While supported with additional self-determination,

26
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:39,968
of course.

27
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:46,214
So the structure basically encourages executors, meaning the teammates, to make decisions by

28
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:52,577
themselves and for themselves. This induces decision making faster among the team by enabling

29
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:59,840
people who own the products and decide on the destiny of the product by themselves.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,202
Also, a small team for every product leads to a much higher ownership as well.

31
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:12,881
This session will probably be very interesting for any professional in the gaming industry who has a say in production and project management,

32
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:16,923
especially the ones struggling with efficiency and productivity,

33
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:20,785
while scaling the product portfolio and expanding their teams, perhaps.

34
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:29,289
So, today I would like to begin by providing you with a quick background information about myself and Veloxia.

35
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,211
Then we're going to have a brief look at the enterprise architecture models in general.

36
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:39,493
to make sure that all of us can benchmark cluster structure properly against the other options

37
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:46,700
available. Afterwards we're going to dive into the cluster structure, perhaps discuss its ups and downs

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,787
and having a system like that. Later we will talk about how to implement such a structure and

39
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:59,272
finally we'll take a look at how this model impacted Velocity all over since the integration of it.

40
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:10,335
My name is Tugay. I'm the co-founding CEO of Eloxio. I'm a management engineer by education

41
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:15,576
coming from a very multidisciplinary and project-oriented background. During college

42
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:20,497
years I did many internships and extracurricular activities which later on allowed me to experience

43
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:26,658
different areas such as management consulting, strategy and perhaps investment finance. Also

44
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:31,279
during my exchange year in Sweden I was very interested in behavioral economics and psychological

45
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:31,599
design.

46
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,562
Gaming was particularly interesting to me even before Veloxia, and as the industry as a whole

47
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:42,926
is highly data-oriented and has endless possibilities to apply my experiences

48
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:49,551
and versatile skills. As you can imagine, I'm mostly involved in any process that isn't directly

49
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:55,356
related to programming. However, I spent most of my time working with an incredibly talented

50
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:59,639
team of game designers, product people, and marketing professions on a daily basis.

51
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:07,137
Veloxia is a mobile gaming technologies company based in Istanbul, Turkey.

52
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:14,719
We make games in short, but our intense engineering culture helps us generate competitive advantage in certain fields.

53
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:20,280
And we are really serious about being experience-oriented and we praise data-driven design.

54
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:26,862
Our journey started back in 2019 and currently right at our second year in the industry,

55
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:31,343
we have just closed a fundraising round and became a VC-backed company.

56
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,581
Total equity raised $4 million so far.

57
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:39,683
We look forward to growing further in our international teams.

58
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:45,305
So I highly encourage you to check out the opportunities at job.veluxia.co.

59
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:51,547
By the way, Veluxia is a female co-founded, highly diverse,

60
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:56,069
and we take inclusivity in design very seriously.

61
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:02,143
Our teams are spread across three different continents and as of today we consist of three

62
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:08,746
clusters and one cluster independent team. Let me talk to you about our first product a little

63
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:14,129
bit for starters. As the genre made the perfect fit with our modeling and behavioral design

64
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:19,192
experience, Veloxy started by delivering mobile games in strategy and simulation genres.

65
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:22,673
Space Colony Idle is the first game we developed and launched.

66
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:25,016
And it has over a million downloads.

67
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,096
The team has always remained of five people.

68
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:30,497
And we have just started further scaling the product

69
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,658
by expanding our marketing activities.

70
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:35,238
With the know-how created over the last two years,

71
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:37,499
we are now working on two new idle games

72
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:41,219
to utilize our idle know-how further and scale our product

73
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,080
portfolio as well.

74
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,121
So here comes the exciting snake peak.

75
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:48,841
Our latest cluster, our largest cluster,

76
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,102
is working on a mobile product.

77
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:56,834
It has very easy to adopt core game mechanics, but the aim for gameplay that is easy to learn,

78
00:05:56,874 --> 00:06:03,077
but very difficult to master in fact. So the art direction is quite stylized I would say,

79
00:06:03,117 --> 00:06:09,501
but one can also perhaps call it semi-realistic fantasy. Here you can see a few examples of our

80
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:15,504
characters and unique mechanics. I would say the game is positioned somewhere between brawlers and

81
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:18,445
mobas in the complexity spectrum.

82
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:23,825
and we plan on enriching the gameplay via extensive and unique social features.

83
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:31,150
Last but not least, our experimental idea cluster is working on unique action and puzzle games.

84
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,454
The possibilities within these genres are truly endless and this cluster is freely exploring

85
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:43,218
around, reaching further to find possibilities and opportunities with the constraints of mobile.

86
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:48,615
Finding inspiration from simplifying complex mechanics is the heart and soul of this cluster's

87
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:57,298
processes. Here are some of the games we have developed. I would say without a proper integration

88
00:06:57,318 --> 00:07:01,899
of the cluster structure, it would have never been possible to have a clear cluster work

89
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,921
structure like this that has teammates from Istanbul and New York.

90
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:11,373
Let's talk a little bit about the enterprise architecture. I'd like to provide you

91
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:17,935
a basis to be able to benchmark the cluster structure more accurately.

92
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:24,336
So the textbook definition for an enterprise architecture is a discipline that is concerned

93
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:30,598
with the structures and behaviors of a business, especially the roles and processes. Traditional

94
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:35,780
organizations typically follow one of the four structures, either functional, divisional,

95
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,440
matrix, or flats.

96
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:40,699
However, with the rise of the digital marketplace,

97
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,380
decentralized team-based organizational models

98
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,861
are disrupting all the conventional ones as well.

99
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:50,182
So it's not only the economies that are towards decentralization,

100
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:53,363
but the societal mindset is also shifting towards there.

101
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:57,764
And nowadays people are starting to find decentralized structures

102
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,744
way more intuitive.

103
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,205
Can you imagine how much the pandemic must have contributed to this change?

104
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:13,643
So when you look at the sub elements of an enterprise architecture, which come together to shape up the whole thing,

105
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:20,365
it perhaps mainly consists of jobs, departments, processes, and communication structured in a rational manner.

106
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:27,188
Well, the guidelines defined for each of these elements help you build up the architecture for your enterprise.

107
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:32,689
Perhaps a typical example of displaying this is the good old organizational structure.

108
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:33,110
Yay.

109
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,021
As a former strategy consultant, I like to perceive this from a microeconomics perspective.

110
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:48,123
At its very essence, I think this is nothing more than just applying one of the most basic theories,

111
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:53,404
which is about the most efficient way of allocating resources to meet the predefined goals.

112
00:08:55,784 --> 00:09:00,465
That's that. Now we can dive into our very main topic, cluster structure itself.

113
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:05,538
The essence of the cluster structure is building up internal teams of designers,

114
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:10,642
developers, and artists who can deliver games without needing any help from any other entity

115
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:17,468
within the firm. Thereby, the cluster structure, the cluster itself has the biggest say on the

116
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:26,195
game's destiny. This especially helps to avoid top-down decision making and to produce higher

117
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,717
quality products stemming from collective ownership.

118
00:09:30,422 --> 00:09:34,485
Because each sub-team is focused on one different game, we call them clusters.

119
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:41,371
And the functions that are needed after the game has been launched, such as LiveOps,

120
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:46,775
marketing, and backends and optimization, all that are handled by a cluster-independent team

121
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:51,539
that is always available at the cluster service when needed, like a group of consultants in the

122
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:57,804
center of the firm. This method has been implemented by many firms in gaming industry,

123
00:09:58,184 --> 00:09:59,565
Supercell to name one perhaps.

124
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:06,717
The structure also allowed Veloxia to meet its business targets and KPIs successfully

125
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:12,558
since the integration. Now that the gaming market is getting more and more fragmented over time,

126
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,939
this should make a very impactful lecture for many of us. As the name suggests,

127
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:23,160
cluster-independent teams work on functions that are platform and infrastructure dependent,

128
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,581
that are indifferent for separate games in separate clusters. Good examples here would be

129
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:36,486
Engineering, marketing, data teams which are centralized as well within the firm,

130
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:43,387
kind of like serving all clusters and adapt for their continuously changing needs and requirements.

131
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:52,289
Yes, advantages. Oh, a lot of them. So here are the three main benefits of having a fragmented

132
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:58,351
product portfolio. One, it enables delivering prototypes rapidly and frequently, helping to

133
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,011
keep up with the new...

134
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:02,519
in a mobile market.

135
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,582
Two, expanding certain parts of the teams

136
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:09,304
when products are scaling reduces the efficiency loss

137
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:12,546
by having to always rush within the development pipeline.

138
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:16,809
Three, keeping a large portion of the team remain unbiased

139
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,790
because they work on different products

140
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:21,752
who also have a good grasp on the overall company vision,

141
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:24,354
eventually creating a great testing group

142
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:26,336
who are much less biased,

143
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:28,677
but they can still look from a user's perspective.

144
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:36,381
Decentralized teams mean decentralized innovation and creativity is unleashed with higher autonomy.

145
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:41,185
This way, dedicated people know a lot better what products and features to focus on

146
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:43,988
without getting constantly disturbed by other products,

147
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:47,091
which they spend just a tiny little bit of their time on.

148
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:52,876
Also, work by large teams tend to be on more recent and popular ideas.

149
00:11:55,002 --> 00:12:00,064
While small teams reach further into the past, finding inspiration in more obscure prior

150
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:01,225
ideas and possibilities.

151
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:07,807
Feel more room in zero judgment zone, where they can question interesting and weird ideas

152
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:12,009
which afterwards can turn into fantastic ones.

153
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:15,870
TLDR, too many cooks spoil the broth.

154
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:22,353
When there are too many voices involved in decision-making, innovation goes out the door.

155
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,682
Fever but laser focused inputs create better outputs.

156
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:34,605
Small teams perform much better on know-how sharing. The connections are stronger since

157
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,987
there are less and people are more open to learning as everyone has a higher ownership

158
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:46,510
on their domains. Additionally, different teams work on different kinds of genres and projects,

159
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,992
developing a know-how on distinct fields as well.

160
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:55,929
Since our team collaboration is fully remote and online, as you would guess,

161
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,715
and people are also presumably way more isolated than ever, the number of online meetings happening

162
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:07,759
within a day is so much more frequent than compared to the office times where we had

163
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,164
only offline meetings. One way to make sure that this situation doesn't create information

164
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:17,588
pollution and inefficiency within your organization is to establish a culture.

165
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:23,866
We hope they are not adding value.

166
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:25,187
There we go.

167
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:29,369
This becomes super simple with the cluster structure

168
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,791
because the meetings are already classified

169
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,173
and communications are way more clear by definition.

170
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:39,135
Also, similarity builds unity amongst the teams

171
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:42,257
as they internally focus on the same product

172
00:13:42,277 --> 00:13:46,779
from different aspects rather than different people

173
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:49,821
focusing on different aspects of various products at a time.

174
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:56,553
Lastly, when blended with the right cultural attitude, autonomy gives people a higher sense

175
00:13:56,593 --> 00:14:01,998
of ownership and allows everyone to take more end-to-end responsibilities in all parts of the

176
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:06,722
processes. Eventually, everyone contributes to the game design more acutely as well,

177
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:10,686
and basically decisions are made faster by the executors themselves.

178
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:16,031
Of course, the cluster structure is not all roses and it has some trade-offs as well.

179
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:23,512
For example, utilizing the expertise can become a challenge during the phase of scaling when you don't have many experts on your team.

180
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:28,634
Presumably, you would end up having that person cluster independent for some time.

181
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,954
Learning the application might become unavoidable.

182
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:45,677
The cluster structure makes teams of people with similar job descriptions separate from each other by assigning them on different products compared with the other enterprise architecture models that are available.

183
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:51,457
There are some workarounds to this but still it is something to be cautious about.

184
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:58,104
Also, because the output gets fragmented compared with a very commercial enterprise

185
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:01,128
architecture where people are expected to work on different products

186
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:04,411
depending on the size and urgency of the needs.

187
00:15:06,257 --> 00:15:12,243
This might possibly feel the teammates feeling dissatisfied as projects can become everlasting

188
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:17,808
and their expertise is focused on a specific product for a longer period of time. If not

189
00:15:17,848 --> 00:15:23,413
planned well, it might become difficult to suddenly expand to team when the demand increases

190
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:30,059
on a certain game and production is suddenly intensified because the product was originally

191
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,000
built by a few people.

192
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:38,921
So until established well, this model might feel a little on the assertive side and even inefficient

193
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:44,604
in certain instances. However, when positioned and planned well and integration is completely done,

194
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:51,668
this is for the greater good. This perhaps is the only efficient way game companies can

195
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:58,971
successfully grow. So now you know about the cluster structure, but how on earth can you

196
00:15:58,991 --> 00:15:59,532
implement it?

197
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:06,235
As a people scheme, cluster structure highly depends on people, functions, or the firm.

198
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:13,562
Hiring should prioritize who are adaptable and able to work cross-functionally.

199
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:21,429
And in order to maintain the self-responsible company culture, training becomes significantly

200
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:21,829
crucial.

201
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:29,594
One great example here perhaps would be Netflix, because they do a great job on training everyone

202
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:34,123
in the firm about how the company makes money and what behaviors will drive its success.

203
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:41,431
Lastly, talented people perform the best when they are given a proper space where they can

204
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,992
share their conflicts and thoughts. So I would say periodic evaluations are also very crucial

205
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:55,694
in terms of exchanging reflections on performance extensively, defining

206
00:16:56,855 --> 00:17:02,596
their transparent practice here would help everyone speak up latest at the quarterly interview.

207
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:06,812
where they have a chance to share ideas and thoughts.

208
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:13,835
And perhaps this is eventually creating an open space for critics towards the leadership as well.

209
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:19,297
So people are set and at the right positions, but how do they operate?

210
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,480
Periodic meetings play a significant role in keeping the team in close touch.

211
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,261
We have three types of periodic meetings in Veloxio.

212
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:28,641
All-hands meetings.

213
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,012
where the whole team is present and everyone's updated about what other clusters are working on.

214
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:39,535
Departmental meetings where all artists, engineers, and designers gather together

215
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:44,977
with their peers to share practices and exchange know-how, eventually reduced applicant learning.

216
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:49,579
And most frequent of all, cluster meetings which happen on a daily basis.

217
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,501
Thoughts and updates are shared openly, making sure everyone's on the same page

218
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:57,202
about the decisions made with their cluster mates.

219
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,500
A seamless and practical CI-CD pipeline

220
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,440
lays in the core of a systematic approach

221
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,061
to game development, eliminating redundancies

222
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,201
as much as possible.

223
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,161
Muda is the Japanese word for repetitive work

224
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:12,762
and having to always do certain tasks which

225
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,082
don't have a direct value add.

226
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:17,303
This method ensures the muda is kept at minimum

227
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,384
when systematic approach is applied in game development.

228
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:22,824
Having an automated internal distribution

229
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:24,665
reduces wait times for developers,

230
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,025
also provides an easier access to all testers.

231
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:37,250
This way, we even have implemented a one feature, one build rule for the times when RapidQA becomes

232
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:43,954
necessary. Having an internal RapidQA system helps identify problems and bugs much sooner

233
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:49,477
so that the developers can fix them right away. This way, fatal failures on production are also

234
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:55,581
much less likely to occur. Integration of art assets and merging builds are foolproof processes

235
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:57,682
when certain guidelines are properly followed.

236
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:02,949
However, very time-consuming when you map the development process within the company.

237
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,511
So it becomes a responsibility for the engineers and technical artists to

238
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:11,753
build an automation system for all the repetitive processes within the firm.

239
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:18,176
This might go without saying, but creating various communication channels to ensure people can both

240
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:25,739
communicate easily and perhaps follow their daily tasks with an automated pipeline is also very

241
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:26,080
crucial.

242
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:31,867
Agile project management tools can be easily combined with each cluster specifically to

243
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:37,052
visualize their prerequisites and enable a more clear roadmap for projects as a whole.

244
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:44,821
Lastly, I would like to discuss a real-life situation. How did cluster structure impacted

245
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:49,806
Veloxia? For starters, cluster structure helped us a lot.

246
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:56,158
on not to get stuck in one game genre for a long time and it let us analyze the market

247
00:19:56,198 --> 00:20:01,639
opportunities without sharp constraints. This way we were able to build teams which can operate

248
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:09,261
independently, eventually driving the founder independent valuation much higher. Additionally,

249
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:15,243
this structure let us create a collective knowledge base which further enables and inspires

250
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,644
people to focus on self-development and higher collaboration.

251
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:25,957
The teams formed under Veloxia have diverse experiences and have been successfully working

252
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:33,183
collaboratively despite different time zones. Cluster structure requires people to have

253
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:38,907
cross-functional approach in certain parts of the workflows. This way, our multidisciplinary

254
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:43,330
problem-solving muscles have gotten a lot stronger. Veloxia has successfully developed

255
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,794
five different titles within the structure. Of course, the solid project management methodology

256
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,275
was crucial to achieve this as well.

257
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:56,091
The integration process itself is a huge challenge as the team doesn't grow suddenly,

258
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,153
yet it is more of a process management.

259
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:03,556
Anyhow, although the results are of high importance,

260
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,798
we know that the success story is focused on journey and not on the destination.

261
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,643
You might want to take a look at the links for further information.

262
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:26,567
Thank you very much. I would be very happy to get in touch with any of you, so feel free to drop me an email.
