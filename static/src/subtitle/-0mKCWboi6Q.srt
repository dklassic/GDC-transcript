1
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,129
Well, hi everybody.

2
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:15,710
We are the Beezark Company.

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,691
We're located in Los Angeles, and I'm Adam Beezark, the company founder.

4
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,772
I'm Lex Rhodes, I'm a creative coordinator.

5
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,493
And I'm Vaughn Hannon, the creative technologist.

6
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:31,840
And what we are not, is we are not a game developer.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,164
We're actually designers and producers of real-world attractions,

8
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:46,372
spectacular rides, shows, and attractions for theme parks, museums, world's fairs, and big immersive experiences.

9
00:00:46,912 --> 00:01:02,197
And we've done a number of these, been involved in a lot of high-end projects around the world for folks like Disney and Universal, and for big museum experiences or visitor centers like Kennedy Space Center and Independence Hall in Philadelphia.

10
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:09,082
And the reason we're here today is because even though we're in industries that are really very different,

11
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:15,647
we keep finding that our world of physical experiences and your world of game design

12
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:20,170
are much more closely related than we might have thought or that you may have realized.

13
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,772
And that's what we'd like to talk about today.

14
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:28,196
The relationship between gaming design and themed entertainment design.

15
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,978
Because really, when it comes right down to it, we are all...

16
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:40,382
Storytelling siblings. We're related closely. We are not identical twins. We're fraternal twins.

17
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:44,344
There are similarities and differences, but that's kind of what we think is interesting

18
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:49,746
to look into today because we think it will be of interest to you guys. So let's start off just

19
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:54,948
by talking about what do we say when we talk about themed entertainment? What is it?

20
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,544
Yeah, and theme entertainment is a big category.

21
00:01:58,584 --> 00:01:59,644
It's not just theme parks.

22
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:02,246
It's not just the two big names that we hear a lot.

23
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:06,408
It includes a whole range of immersive destination-based experiences.

24
00:02:07,592 --> 00:02:12,456
It's about placemaking, it's about transporting the guest, it's about escape, and those things

25
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:13,917
probably sound a little familiar.

26
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:19,501
And as we'll discuss in a little bit, there are things that are very theme entertainment

27
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,122
and there are things that are very video game.

28
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:26,426
And there's this weird land where things overlap and you end up with things like escape rooms

29
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,687
and arcades with singing mice and pizza.

30
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:36,413
That said, let's talk about where video games and themed entertainment have traditionally

31
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:36,653
lived.

32
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:48,458
Many years ago, Michael Eisner, who was then the head of Disney, drew this famous chart that has been used by entertainment designers for decades ever since.

33
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:51,220
He sort of divided the world up into four kinds of entertainment.

34
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:56,626
There is entertainment that people consume at home by themselves.

35
00:02:57,146 --> 00:03:00,930
There is entertainment you consume at home socially in a group.

36
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:16,032
Then, out in the real world, outside your home, there's entertainment you consume alone at a destination, such as taking a walk in the forest, and there's entertainment that you consume in a group at a destination.

37
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:20,154
And video games have always tended to occupy those first two squares

38
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:24,617
because they tend to be based out of the home, unless you're at an arcade.

39
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:31,300
And traditionally, theme parks have tended to occupy this sort of bottom right quadrant,

40
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,502
the experiences that you have to leave your home for,

41
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:37,183
but that you typically do with friends and family.

42
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:41,406
So we tend to be about making memories with friends and family together.

43
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:45,308
Today, obviously, those lines are blurring, and that's one of the things we find interesting.

44
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:52,256
Yeah, home alone or otherwise, our two worlds have different strengths and weaknesses.

45
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:56,899
And of course we all play to our strengths as often as we can, and we also embrace our limitations.

46
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:02,341
Often we need to get a user from here to there. We know it, they know it.

47
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,723
We put them on a track and wish them luck.

48
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:12,406
Our job then is to surprise them and to hit them with all the tricks that we have to challenge and delight them.

49
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:22,312
And that's why we want them to be surprising, but they are inevitable.

50
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:29,298
And along the inevitable paths, among some of the surprises, we're going to make promises to the guests.

51
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:34,836
And storytelling and world building is full of surprises and full of promises.

52
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:39,779
And many of them are small and incidental, but some of them are big and wet.

53
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,080
And the players have expectations.

54
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:46,163
As our stories unfold, we are obligated to keep our promises.

55
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:49,384
If we build a waterfall, there best be something behind it.

56
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:53,207
By the way, that looks like a video game, but that's a real-world destination.

57
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:56,428
That is Volcano Bay at Universal Studios, right?

58
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:02,289
And it's really interesting to look at the histories of both of these different industries.

59
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,350
A lot of the first theme park designers came from the world of animation.

60
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,872
They were very much story first, designing media purely in service of story.

61
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:15,594
And then you look at video games and you see an industry that arose very largely out of technology.

62
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:18,955
And so you'd guess that theme parks would be designed stories first,

63
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:21,516
games would be designed mechanics first, systems first.

64
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:25,137
But everyone in this room knows that it's not quite so simple.

65
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:26,938
You can even just take, for example,

66
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:31,131
The case of two rides, Indiana Jones Adventure and Countdown to Extinction.

67
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:36,673
For Indy, the Imagineers got to start with this story, this action archaeology adventure,

68
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:42,296
and R&D goes and develops the perfect ride system to tell that story and to hit those emotional

69
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:47,279
goals of, you know, what is Indiana Jones? And so they come up with the enhanced motion vehicles,

70
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,742
the EMVs, and, you know, put those two together, it results in the ride that you know today.

71
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,899
But for Countdown to Extinction, it was the other way around.

72
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,283
They already had the EMVs and were tasked with skinning that ride system

73
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:00,964
with this new dinosaur story.

74
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:03,486
And it results in a much different ride.

75
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:07,630
These are two industries that have a unique understanding

76
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,712
of that interrelation between story and systems

77
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,494
and trying to make them play nice together.

78
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:17,258
It's a complicated and squiggly thing where every project is

79
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:20,120
going to have different priorities and demand a slightly different process.

80
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:28,456
So these worlds are pretty similar, and we have, over the years, learned a lot from each other,

81
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:35,460
and we've borrowed from each other, and we figure it's not stealing, if you're related. It's learning.

82
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:41,063
And so we're pretty interested in the things we can learn from the world of game design,

83
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:44,746
and in some cases already have done to adapt ourselves into game design.

84
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:50,469
We kind of use this word immersive.

85
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:54,153
differently in our world than in game design.

86
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:59,155
The game world talks about immersive in terms of getting in that flow state

87
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:01,315
where you're so into the game that the rest of the world

88
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,476
disappears and you sort of lose yourself in the rhythm of the gameplay.

89
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,256
We literally mean immersion in a physical world.

90
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:11,437
We mean designing spaces and scenery that creates a new space that is all around you

91
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,838
and immersing you in it.

92
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:14,938
And we talk about...

93
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:22,741
Good show, in terms like good show and bad show, as being the things that keep you in that story or break the story for you.

94
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:30,503
If it's bad show, if a trash can looks too modern, if you're in a period location.

95
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:35,965
Those are things you guys deal with as well, but we have to deal with it in a physical world and move stuff around until it works.

96
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:41,671
And in our world, immersion goes a long way back.

97
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:45,615
Disney has been building immersion for decades.

98
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:50,279
The Haunted Mansion ride, one of our favorite rides, was built over 50 years ago.

99
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,967
And it created, it used a vehicle system that very carefully points each viewer at exactly what...

100
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:03,011
The designers want you to see it functions as a movie camera in their eyes.

101
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:09,977
But you could argue that it was arguably the very first ever first person camera controller, as if it was a game.

102
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:17,323
And in modern gameplay, we use sticks to control our body and head motion.

103
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:21,046
Disney was doing it with egg-shaped vehicles 50 years ago.

104
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:26,070
And land design and level design are great.

105
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,001
Very similar in many ways.

106
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:32,405
They're all about providing environmental cues that support the story and provide tools

107
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,346
for implicit navigation throughout.

108
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:39,670
Here I pulled up maps of New Orleans Square at Disneyland and the Isle of Armor from Pokemon

109
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,411
Sword and Shield.

110
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:46,196
These make a nice comparison because they're both relatively self-contained spaces but

111
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,697
freely explorable in 3D space.

112
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:53,441
So when you make a land or a level for that matter, you always start with your main path.

113
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:57,486
The purpose of this is to connect the major set pieces of the area.

114
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:01,770
It's a relatively quick and expedient way of getting through the space,

115
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:04,854
but it's also highly scenic since you have a lot of control,

116
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,256
really tight control over the sight lines in this path.

117
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:12,955
Then of course you have these ancillary detour paths that reward curiosity,

118
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:17,439
allow you to investigate fun little nooks and cubbies just off of the main path.

119
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,424
These paths let you stray a little bit, get a little bit lost, but they almost always,

120
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:26,408
you can see here, they almost always loop back to the familiar, to the main path,

121
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:29,771
rather than, you know, get you too uncomfortable.

122
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:31,032
It's all about striking that

123
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:35,829
Perfect amount, just the right amount of discomfort so that it feels exciting and adventurous.

124
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,271
We sometimes talk about the idea of getting safely lost, right?

125
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:43,234
You want to get just lost enough to get excited, but know you can always find your way back.

126
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:47,856
And then even in these examples you can see they both have fast travel options.

127
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:51,119
You've got the Disneyland Railroad, you've got the train, you've got flying options.

128
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,942
And you have completely alternative locomotion options where you can actually take to the seas,

129
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:59,684
cross the water, and pursue those far-off landmarks.

130
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:05,046
There's another intuitive navigation tool that theme park designers specifically have

131
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:07,588
a goofy word for, and that's weenies.

132
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:13,492
A weenie is a large, eye-catching set piece, something like Sleeping Beauty Castle, that's

133
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:17,875
visible from a great distance away, and it draws people through a space.

134
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:22,959
Walt Disney coined the term describing how you can guide guests through space in the

135
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:26,962
same way that he would lure his pet poodle from one room to the other with a hot dog.

136
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:33,917
So if you've ever thought to yourself, wow, theme parks seem to have a lot of giant fake

137
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:36,598
mountains in them, it's because they're excellent weenies.

138
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:42,321
They're also really popular in games, partially for their use as a navigational tool, but

139
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:47,583
also because that triangular shape is really excellent at concealing far off landmarks

140
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:50,984
and then slowly revealing them as you move around the base of the mountain, which is

141
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:51,385
really fun.

142
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,904
So this kind of connection between placemaking and gameplay goes way, way, way back.

143
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:06,308
If you go back as far as the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, the World's Columbian Exposition,

144
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:16,855
one of the great sort of created events in American history, it was a world of different

145
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:20,578
places from the very elegant to the very sort of folksy.

146
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:29,382
But it also included some of the very first carnival games where you could actually step right up and take your chances and try to win a cupid doll.

147
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:34,925
And over the years, theme parks have picked that up more and more.

148
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:43,650
The very first bits of gameplay in theme park design started in the, arguably, in the 90s, I guess you could say.

149
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,733
Disney did a terrific experiment in the 90s of a freestanding game.

150
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:54,620
It was a location called Disney Quest that was filled with both off-the-shelf games,

151
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,644
but also original games that they spent millions designing.

152
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:02,790
And then, after building two of them, never built another one.

153
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:08,878
But it led to a lot of other development in the sort of crossing over between game and theme parks.

154
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:16,121
So in the theme park world, Disney installed a drive-thru shooting gallery.

155
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:23,324
Disney installed, created an attraction shooting gallery, Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters,

156
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:29,486
where you're fired at little green men. And since then, others have followed suit.

157
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:33,208
The Six Flags parks have their Justice League Battle for Metropolis,

158
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:35,208
which are very elaborate, where there's a combination of...

159
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:38,330
Live media around you and shooting gallery.

160
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:42,633
And just this month at Disney's California Adventure,

161
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:48,237
the new Avengers Campus has an attraction called Web Slingers where you can fly with Spider-Man and

162
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:52,279
without even any weapon in your hand, you can just use your hands to

163
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,141
shoot webs at little robots that you're trying to catch.

164
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:03,404
This kind of storytelling has broadened out and gameplay has taken on many different forms now in theme parks.

165
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:10,507
These are using storytelling techniques from the world of RPGs and tabletop games.

166
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:18,089
We're starting to see character-based storylines and quests that you can actually play as a guest in a park

167
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:24,311
by interacting either with the environment or with live actors who are in character who are there for you to play with and talk to.

168
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:31,736
Evermore Park in Utah is amazing. It's essentially an entire theme park that is a big D&D LARP game

169
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:39,020
where you can take on a character, go on quests, meet wizards, and have experiences and challenges all day long

170
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,803
and come back and they'll remember who you are and you can continue the quest you started the last time.

171
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:50,550
These things aren't rides. These are real living worlds and story worlds where guests can have

172
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,195
real agency and real input in the world really change and really make a difference.

173
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,679
And some of the very biggest theme parks, Disney and Universal, are now

174
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,704
Starting to include gaming layers that are deeply woven into the design of the entire land,

175
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:09,367
where that actually affects the architecture and the rides and the pieces of the land,

176
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:16,173
where you have special apps that you control or a wristband that you can let you play and interact with the land.

177
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:20,596
And when we're doing that in big theme parks, it's happening.

178
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:26,890
It has to happen at very high scale because you're handling tens of thousands of people a day through these things.

179
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:32,273
So one of the big challenges is trying to figure out how to weave these into rides and live performance

180
00:14:32,494 --> 00:14:35,836
and these app layers and these little mini games that we go through.

181
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:36,916
And it's not easy.

182
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:42,199
So one of the things that we keep asking is, how can we make it even better?

183
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:48,543
How can we steal more from each other and learn how to improve what we do by studying what you do and vice versa?

184
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:55,307
Yeah, and earlier we alluded to the strengths and weaknesses in both of our industries,

185
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:56,828
themed entertainment and video game design.

186
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:07,516
You know, the big weaknesses in our world happen to be some of the best strengths in the video game world.

187
00:15:08,337 --> 00:15:13,761
We have a bunch of people together so we can do big spectacles and multi-sensory experiences,

188
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,883
and they're highly social because everybody's in the same space.

189
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,886
But it's really hard to do those individualized experiences,

190
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:24,370
maintain persistence and progression and guest agency

191
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,951
when you have to worry about things like Adam was saying,

192
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,914
throughput and getting a million people through a space in an hour.

193
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:35,179
Because that's what it boils down to in these physical spaces

194
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:37,100
is throughput, throughput, throughput.

195
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,301
How do we get all these people through

196
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:41,224
and how do we get as many people into the experience as possible?

197
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:47,046
So how do you, you know, is it possible to individualize those experiences?

198
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:56,251
There's been attempts with VR and those offer very real headaches and also very operational headaches.

199
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:01,593
And they actually don't individualize the experience all that much.

200
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:04,194
Everybody's kind of doing the same thing.

201
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:09,196
In a VR coaster, for example, you're all having the same experience.

202
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:16,323
It might feel like it's individual to you, but everybody's experiencing the exact same thing.

203
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:28,436
One of the best examples that I think provided individualization was Alien Encounter in Disney World in the Magic Kingdom,

204
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,780
where you were in a theater, a round theater, and...

205
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:40,586
If you haven't been on it, an alien shows up, gets loose, and then everybody has the experience of this alien's running around and it feels like it's right behind you.

206
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:43,333
It's of course right behind everybody. You're all having that same experience again.

207
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:47,476
But it feels very individual and extra terrifying.

208
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:52,038
So, in that case, it was put everybody in the dark and just use audio,

209
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:56,360
and shake their seats a little bit, and then you can have that experience.

210
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,642
But it's a big challenge to individualize an experience

211
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,444
in a place like a theme park or other destination.

212
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:09,146
And I don't think we have it perfectly solved yet.

213
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:12,762
You know, I think there's room for doing some more.

214
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:21,091
Exploring guest versus guest type of experiences where, you know, things can be truly random.

215
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:24,213
Even in video games, things aren't truly, you know, you have a very similar experience.

216
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:28,194
Oh, I did this, I did this, I won this quest, I ran into this person, and I fought this boss.

217
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:31,555
Oversimplified, but it's kind of the same thing, right?

218
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:33,836
We're like, oh yeah, I did that, and this is how it went for me.

219
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:38,938
So, things get truly random when you get into MMOs and you get other humans involved,

220
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:43,380
and now you're like, oh, this last night, this crazy thing happened because so-and-so did this to me.

221
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:49,201
and or challenge me to something and now you have all these new experiences that pop up that not

222
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:54,686
everybody can have and then it's truly individual and I think we can get there.

223
00:17:57,288 --> 00:18:01,511
And then you've got other challenges like like persistence like in a video game you literally

224
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:06,095
have a save file your progress is saved your individual impact on the world whether you're

225
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:10,578
building things or destroying things that data gets stored and it carries over to the next time

226
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:12,220
you visit that world but in a park.

227
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:21,908
It's really hard to feel like you have an impact or a mark on that world, whether it's just in terms of story or literal environment, because it has to be scrubbed clean for the next guest.

228
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:24,390
Everyone is expecting the same experience.

229
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:30,195
And so it's really hard to figure out where are opportunities to give guests that feeling of persistence.

230
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:34,900
Knott's Berry Farm has a seasonal immersive experience called Ghost Town Alive.

231
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,146
where one of the really cool things that they do is they print an hourly newspaper.

232
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:39,806
Oh yeah.

233
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:44,192
So as guests, you know, they go on adventures, they have escapades throughout the area.

234
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:49,480
Those are recorded, you know, whether good or bad, whether you're a hero or a bandit.

235
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,894
Those are going to get recorded in the newspaper, and that's kind of, at least over the course of a day,

236
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:57,915
maybe we could go for a longer time period in future experiences, but over the course of that day,

237
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:02,796
you do see your impact on the world, and it's physically recorded in that space, which is pretty cool.

238
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:04,916
You get to see your name in the paper and take that home with you.

239
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,317
Yeah, and it's a great souvenir, too.

240
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:09,677
Yeah, and along those lines, with persistence,

241
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:17,919
it's kind of the same thing as how do you track progression for individuals in a park experience or in a location-based experience.

242
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:25,385
It's a lot of times, you know, folks want to say that they want to gamify an experience,

243
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:29,386
and I think a lot of us are like, oh, no.

244
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:30,747
Another shooting gallery.

245
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:31,747
Right, another shooting gallery.

246
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:32,647
That's it.

247
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:39,970
And, you know, they want all of the things from the video game world, but they don't.

248
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,296
Then they realize how tricky that is and all those challenges that we're talking about.

249
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,798
And then they're like, oh, never mind. Let's just make a shooting gallery.

250
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:54,504
So, progression is also part of individualization where you want to be able to track your score.

251
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:58,407
You want to be able to track your progress through whatever experiences you're having in the park.

252
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:03,271
And it's starting to happen.

253
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:05,513
It happened a little bit when Disney did Virtual Magic Kingdom.

254
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:06,514
That opened in 2005.

255
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:08,755
It was an online thing.

256
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:11,588
It feels like a million years ago.

257
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:16,693
But you could go to the parks and actually fulfill quests that would then give you digital

258
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:18,074
goods in the Virtual Magic Kingdom.

259
00:20:18,554 --> 00:20:20,115
So you had a little bit of...

260
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:27,355
It's a little bit of individualization, a little bit of progression, and you could go

261
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:29,416
back and do another quest and get more stuff.

262
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:33,818
And then those digital goods were only available to people who had done the things in the park,

263
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:35,759
so you couldn't get them any other way, which is great.

264
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:44,622
Super Nintendo World just opened in Universal in Osaka, and they built a secret game that

265
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:45,883
you can only get to if you complete...

266
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:53,148
If you find the five keys throughout the rest of the world, and they have... it's a watch.

267
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:58,767
based on a watch-like wristband thing that keeps track of your progression so you know

268
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:03,350
who got the five keys and you have to unlock the queue to this attraction by tapping your

269
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,893
wrist. And then you can play the game that nobody else can play unless they've completed

270
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:11,736
the thing. So there's a little bit happening there, being able to track your progress and

271
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:17,079
do things. And then Disney again also did, of course, with Galaxy's Edge.

272
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:24,324
You can use the app to start creating a little bit of a character for yourself

273
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:29,348
and tracking your progress as that character and choose a side or be a scoundrel, which is the most fun.

274
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:38,177
They've integrated that into the land really nicely so that there's multiple things to do.

275
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:42,538
The attractions also tie into the game and into the app.

276
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:47,080
So this stuff is starting to happen, but it's still a challenge.

277
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:54,102
It's still tricky to provide this on the scale necessary for a park.

278
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:57,823
I think one of the questions that we struggle with in the theme park world is

279
00:21:58,123 --> 00:21:59,883
we always want everybody to have a great time.

280
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:03,706
Games are all about failing your way to success.

281
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:04,486
So...

282
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:05,627
Just like real life.

283
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:06,208
Right?

284
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:12,672
So, do you think it's possible for us to get to a place where there can be failure in a theme park?

285
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,794
Or is that going to make little kids cry and parents unhappy?

286
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:21,819
Yeah, it's a really interesting question, because failure can play so many different roles in games.

287
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,822
There's, you know, using failure as stakes.

288
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:30,165
When you play a game, when you're engaging with a game, you're kind of investing time and energy.

289
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:35,399
in the name of advancement and progress, and failure kind of reclaims some of that progress

290
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,479
and resets you a little bit.

291
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,721
If you want to call it the threat of failure, it kind of adds a lot of tension and suspense

292
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:43,301
to a gameplay experience.

293
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,062
There's also failure as a proving ground.

294
00:22:46,142 --> 00:22:51,403
The idea that the harder something is to achieve, the better it's going to feel when you ultimately

295
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:53,784
do win, after all those different attempts.

296
00:22:55,224 --> 00:23:04,046
Failure is comedy. Failure can actually be really funny, especially if you can create an environment where guests or players, they aren't shamed for messing up, but they're actually applauded.

297
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:10,888
If you can reinforce that, failure can be really funny. And on top of all of that, failure can just be narratively interesting.

298
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:21,951
If you make sure that you provide interesting narrative content, whether someone succeeds or fails, you know, there's just as much story to find at either end, then that's just branching narrative.

299
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:25,775
And those are just two different interesting options that people can pursue.

300
00:23:27,315 --> 00:23:32,837
And obviously, some of these different uses of failure are more applicable to a parks environment than others.

301
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,958
Really, it comes down to a problem of crowds and a problem of lines.

302
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:44,580
Because when you don't have that instant reset, it makes it harder for it to be fun, to kind of re-tackle that challenge after suffering a failure.

303
00:23:46,586 --> 00:24:01,032
Yeah, and failure is part of one of the other big challenges that we have, which is guest agency, giving guests true choices and true freedoms to do things that affect their experiences and also affect the other things we've been talking about, persistence and progression.

304
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:10,115
So, you know, giving users a choice makes a great experience, but we're limited by annoying things like physics and how much we can do.

305
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:13,356
Curse you, laws of physics.

306
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:15,397
So we haven't found our way around that yet.

307
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:16,465
We're working on it.

308
00:24:17,445 --> 00:24:22,587
Our best efforts so far are kind of the illusion of agency, not real guest agency or not real

309
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:23,927
player agency like you would have in a game.

310
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:30,549
Like the wands in Diagon Alley, you feel like you, the individual, are having this experience

311
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:35,411
and you, I'm sorry, the wizard, you the wizard are having this experience and causing something

312
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:41,993
to happen, but it's you and the 20 wizards waiting in line behind you.

313
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:47,137
watching the other wizard do work magic and then you wait for your turn to do the exact same magic.

314
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:50,580
Exactly right, yes. And so that kind of takes a little bit of the magic out of it.

315
00:24:50,760 --> 00:25:00,769
And, you know, it's you choosing to affect the environment, but it's a very prefab version of guest agency.

316
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:05,954
Right, and what in a single player game environment would be like a delightful little surprise that you stumble upon

317
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:09,317
is now, it's not much different than a carnival game that you wait in line for.

318
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:10,619
Right, exactly.

319
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:15,064
So, we could go on about this stuff all day, but the other thing that we really wanted

320
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:20,731
to cover with you guys is the connections, the professional connections between our worlds.

321
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:26,358
That there's an awful lot of crossover between our business and the game design business.

322
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:39,120
We hire game designers all the time to be part of our design teams because we feel, as Lex said, that if you know how to design a game level, you pretty much know how to design a land in a theme park with a few adjustments.

323
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,961
So it's really worth knowing about it.

324
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:49,022
So let's talk a little bit about professional opportunities that game designers can find in our world of physical experiences.

325
00:25:49,622 --> 00:25:54,063
Yeah, my first job before working at the Beezart company was actually in the games industry.

326
00:25:55,339 --> 00:26:01,282
The day-to-day skills that you find yourself using in either industry and either job are remarkably similar.

327
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:07,684
Things from working with custom story technology, creating responsive and interactive worlds,

328
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,046
communicating with sometimes huge multidisciplinary teams,

329
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:16,428
understanding guest flow as it pertains to emergent and environmental storytelling,

330
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:20,930
just creating a backdrop for people to make their own characters and make their own stories.

331
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,811
And obviously it varies depending on...

332
00:26:23,227 --> 00:26:31,809
You're disciplined, but yet your skills are more transferable than you might think as a game designer who might be interested in the world of themed entertainment.

333
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:37,610
And to be honest, a lot of modern media-based theme park rides are...

334
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:42,451
They're using the game engines that you're familiar with. They're using Unity. They're using Unreal.

335
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:47,392
And in addition, a lot now have app layers, companion apps that we were talking about, where...

336
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:49,352
Yeah, they just... they need game developers.

337
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:53,013
It's a craft you already know, just in a theme park environment.

338
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:58,549
And one of the things that you may not know if you haven't really looked into this industry

339
00:26:58,729 --> 00:27:01,151
is it's more than just the mouse, right?

340
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:02,533
It's more than just Disney.

341
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:06,176
Disney certainly created the themed entertainment industry as we know it.

342
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:10,761
Then along came Universal over the years and other large companies have done it.

343
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:16,547
But what people don't necessarily realize is that that has led to a broad...

344
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:24,211
of immersive theme park-like experiences in other places around the world.

345
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:29,293
So we've worked on things for Epcot, big fireworks shows for Epcot,

346
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:33,695
but we've also worked on Space Shuttle Atlantis at Space Station.

347
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:40,037
Kennedy Space Center. We've been able to create immersive Halloween parties for the White House.

348
00:27:40,378 --> 00:27:46,160
We've worked with helping theme parks in Asia and the Middle East expanding their ideas. We've worked

349
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,882
with the Lego theme parks who are learning to tell the story of how to make a plastic brick

350
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:56,483
into something fun that you want to hang out with and play all day and experience. So there are a

351
00:27:56,623 --> 00:28:02,325
lot of these different opportunities growing and not just opportunities but companies.

352
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:05,467
Right, yeah, there's a lot of folks involved.

353
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,189
As we said, it's more than theme parks,

354
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:14,131
and it's more than the two big names that everybody thinks of when you think of theme parks.

355
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,252
And as with any creative endeavor,

356
00:28:16,672 --> 00:28:20,394
there are multiple parties who are all working together to make everything happen.

357
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:25,617
Designers, technicians, programmers, artists, writers, and yes, even managers are needed

358
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:28,538
to make these things happen.

359
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:30,039
Somebody has to organize the whole thing.

360
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:41,644
There's so many different little and big companies involved in many of the attractions that you've been on,

361
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:44,585
or shows that you've seen, or museums that you've visited that you don't.

362
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:49,328
You may not necessarily think about who did all the things and who thought about how it

363
00:28:49,368 --> 00:28:49,808
all came together.

364
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:56,530
And there are also a couple of large professional trade organizations for our industry.

365
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:04,312
There's the IAAPA, which holds a huge conference every year in Orlando, of course, where 30

366
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:06,452
to 50,000 professionals come together.

367
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:11,513
You can learn a lot about our industry in that big conference, and they have other ones

368
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:11,933
around the world.

369
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:20,100
And the Themed Entertainment Association, the TEA, is designed literally for companies like us who are the creators and designers of theme parks.

370
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:27,046
And it involves career advice and workshops and behind-the-scenes tours and a lot of professional networking.

371
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:29,709
So it's a great way if you're interested in learning about this business, you can.

372
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,152
And I think our takeaway here is that...

373
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:42,900
This business, this world of immersive experiences, is something that game designers would be well advised to pay attention to for a couple of reasons.

374
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:50,086
One is, you may find that this is a nice little side hustle for you.

375
00:29:50,166 --> 00:30:01,576
That if you're a professional game designer, you may find yourself tagged, as we sometimes do, being brought in to help design a level or add to the gameplay in an attraction or otherwise advise or help out with an attraction.

376
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:18,983
You also may find it's an industry that you really want to stay in, because it's a really fun, interesting industry full of curious, renaissance people who know about everything from animatronics to magic to architecture to graphics, and people who come into this world often find they don't want to leave.

377
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:33,053
But another reason you would be well advised to start learning about our world is because you, as a game designer, may find someday that your game is being adapted into a theme park attraction or experience.

378
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:34,434
And when that happens...

379
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:41,876
You'll want to know some of the rules of the road so that you can help the people adapting your attraction make it the best it can be.

380
00:30:42,636 --> 00:30:49,697
So this is what we wanted you to understand, that as storytelling siblings, you should know about us.

381
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:56,638
This could be a fun little side hustle for you. You might end up with a whole career in theme parks,

382
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:59,579
or you might end up licensing your game to an attraction.

383
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,239
And we think it's well worth looking into.

384
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:02,319
Bye!

385
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:07,993
That's not the end of our presentation today.

386
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:12,034
This is our false ending. Like any good ride or any good game,

387
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:17,317
we have a surprise ending. The boss level. And let's take you there right now.

388
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:23,053
And here we are, our surprise is we are going to undertake

389
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:26,074
a little demonstration of how we work on these sort of things

390
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:31,636
by putting together a sort of a sample brainstorming session

391
00:31:32,196 --> 00:31:34,257
or a charrette as we love to call it

392
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:35,278
in the theme park business,

393
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:40,019
where we will demonstrate how we sort of work

394
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:43,480
with a game developer to sort of tease out

395
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,562
the very first ideas about how to create an attraction

396
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:47,982
based on a great gaming IP.

397
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:52,500
And we're also being joined by our senior creative director, Baz.

398
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:54,001
Hi.

399
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:57,164
Who is the only person who's actually at our office today.

400
00:31:58,024 --> 00:32:00,987
And we have brought with us,

401
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,989
we're very excited to welcome a special guest

402
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,933
from one of our very favorite game companies

403
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:10,755
who we've worked with in the past from Ubisoft.

404
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:13,037
Please welcome our pal, Mathilde Presson.

405
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:15,359
Mathilde, do you want to come up to the mic?

406
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:15,819
Hi, everyone.

407
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:16,920
Thanks for having me.

408
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,641
Excited.

409
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:22,296
So you want to say a little bit, Hai, about what your role is at Ubisoft?

410
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:23,636
Sure. My pleasure.

411
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:28,900
So I have been with Ubisoft for the last six years at different roles.

412
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:36,905
And right now my responsibility is to help Ubisoft grow in the world of location-based entertainment or themed entertainment.

413
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:37,766
So essentially.

414
00:32:38,328 --> 00:32:42,650
theme parks, family entertainment centers, other types of attractions and experiences.

415
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:48,334
So it's about finding the right partners for Ubisoft to lean on in the physical world.

416
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:53,237
So theme park operators, developers, owners, and the right creative partners as well,

417
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:55,238
which these are Adam and the team.

418
00:32:55,778 --> 00:32:59,360
You know, we've worked, we've done some work together in the past and are, you know,

419
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:05,063
good friends and I think, you know, good creative collaboration.

420
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:05,844
And so that's.

421
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:12,384
That's kind of how we bring our brands to the world of theme parks and theme entertainment.

422
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:17,087
Before we start, this is a disclaimer for all game designers and fans out there.

423
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:22,751
We are not designing a real Ubisoft ride. We're going to design a pretend one today.

424
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:30,496
So today we're going to do a Zoom charrette brainstorm and we've brought our handy dandy whiteboard.

425
00:33:31,197 --> 00:33:33,718
We will talk about a couple of different things today.

426
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:38,501
We will talk about, you know, sort of the type of attraction we want to create.

427
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:43,405
We'll work with Matilda in picking what IP game we want to go with,

428
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:45,586
and then try to figure out some ideas about how to get it there.

429
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:50,169
Our hypothetical theme park developer will say has told us

430
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:55,072
that they're developing a big major new theme park on the scale,

431
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:58,854
let's say it's on the really big scale, like a Disney or a Universal type park.

432
00:33:58,934 --> 00:33:59,415
Very big.

433
00:33:59,962 --> 00:34:01,883
High budget, big spectacular things.

434
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:04,144
So anything goes, they're open to any idea.

435
00:34:04,284 --> 00:34:09,087
Since you are the IP holder today, we're going to let you pick.

436
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:13,569
Which one do you think we should make our game or make our ride around today?

437
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:21,053
We're talking, you know, big, ambitious project, Universal or Disney scale.

438
00:34:21,073 --> 00:34:24,655
I would love to go with Assassin's Creed.

439
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:31,020
We love it. Plus, I think I had Assassin's Creed in the betting pool, so I win.

440
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:43,286
What is the heart and soul of Assassin's Creed? So tell us what you know about the property that you think is just important for us to understand about the game, and then we'll talk about how it can be physicalized.

441
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:47,388
Sure. I think if you don't mind, I'd love to share a few visuals, a few slides.

442
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:54,312
So, you know, as I was saying, it's not only one of Ubisoft's most popular IPs, so it's very...

443
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:56,917
Commercially, it has a lot of success,

444
00:34:56,957 --> 00:35:00,478
but it's also an incredibly rich creative universe

445
00:35:00,518 --> 00:35:03,559
and one that for me is perfectly fit

446
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,619
for the theme entertainment industry.

447
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,120
You know, at its core, Assassin's Creed is about

448
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:13,862
immersing people in history and giving them the tools

449
00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:16,742
to create their own epic adventures within it.

450
00:35:16,842 --> 00:35:19,163
So it has a very strong sense of place.

451
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:22,044
You're experiencing all those, you know,

452
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:28,754
incredibly historically accurate past environments to explore the city to create your own story and

453
00:35:29,234 --> 00:35:35,436
epic adventure and I think that is very something that translates very nicely. So very quickly going

454
00:35:35,476 --> 00:35:41,078
back to some of the key story pillars Assassin's Creed is about an ancient war that two factions

455
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:45,400
have been fighting over centuries and centuries and on the one hand you've got

456
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,862
the Templars that are a monastic turned military order turned

457
00:35:50,534 --> 00:35:58,458
corporate giant that are essentially convinced that order and control is to be valued over

458
00:35:58,518 --> 00:36:01,000
freedom of the individuals.

459
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,062
And on the other hand, you've got the assassins that are a rebel faction, a brotherhood, that

460
00:36:06,102 --> 00:36:09,444
think that progress is brought about by free will.

461
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:14,967
So those two factions have been fighting over centuries, and the Templars in present day

462
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:19,759
So the corporate giant that now the Templars have taken the form of,

463
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:24,181
which is a company called Abstergo Industries, created a machine called the Animus.

464
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:29,203
And the Animus has the power to read people's genetic memory

465
00:36:29,744 --> 00:36:33,886
by reading a blood sample and displaying moments of life

466
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:37,107
of their ancestors in present day, in real life.

467
00:36:38,148 --> 00:36:42,550
And so they created that technology because they were looking for.

468
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:50,033
An ancient artifact called the Apple of Eden that had the power of imposing their vision of control and order on the world.

469
00:36:50,753 --> 00:36:58,338
And so they're looking in present day for the descendant of the person who hit that Apple of Eden centuries and centuries ago.

470
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:04,041
So it is thanks to that machine, the Animus, that we are traveling from present to past.

471
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:07,825
Which also I think is something interesting for us to keep in mind.

472
00:37:07,845 --> 00:37:10,206
Could the Animus be some sort of portal?

473
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:12,367
What does it look like in real life?

474
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:15,689
How do we transition from present day theme park,

475
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:19,371
wherever we are, to the past Assassin's Creed world?

476
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:23,954
It is thanks to the Animus, again, that we have been exploring

477
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:26,255
all those key moments in history.

478
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:30,438
Going from Italy during the Renaissance to

479
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:33,600
18th century Caribbean and the Golden Age of Piracy.

480
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:39,028
to the French Revolution in Paris, to ancient Egypt, and now more recently,

481
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:41,009
Britain, during the Vikings invasion.

482
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:46,232
So really what is key to the brand is being able to explore all those key

483
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:49,674
moments in human history, and, you know, we could build around a new one that

484
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,035
hasn't been explored yet in the game.

485
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:52,456
So that's something that, that we can do.

486
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:53,397
For our attraction, you mean?

487
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:54,297
Exactly.

488
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:54,778
Yeah.

489
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:58,680
And that could be also something very interesting, because then gamers who

490
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,942
have been immersed in this or that world at home.

491
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:07,259
are going to get to experience something new in the themed entertainment world.

492
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,140
Now, there are a few things, a few key words that I think reflect very well

493
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,040
what the essence of the brand is that I think I'd like us to use as guidelines

494
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,381
today or guiding principles.

495
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:22,662
And the number one thing is that it's a brand that's cunning,

496
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:27,943
meaning it's physically, but also very intellectually stimulating.

497
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:32,263
Becoming a master assassin is about, you know, mastering the art of

498
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:39,999
concealing your intentions, of deciphering clues, of being fast and precise in movement and action.

499
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:46,127
It's just majestic. So there's something very elegant and very cunning within the brand,

500
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:52,014
that we should keep in mind. It's a brand that's epic. Assassin's Creed is about

501
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:56,174
allowing people to live adventures that are larger than life,

502
00:38:56,714 --> 00:39:02,036
meaning iconic characters and being a part of those big events,

503
00:39:02,457 --> 00:39:03,557
turning points in history.

504
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:07,279
And it's, you know, whatever experience we're going to design,

505
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:09,040
it has to have that epicness to it.

506
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,461
It's a brand that's very much about exploration.

507
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:16,563
We're giving you those open world, past environments for you to explore.

508
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:22,894
horizontally and vertically, whether it's buildings or here, it's a cliff or a boat

509
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:23,375
mat.

510
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:28,019
Assassin's Creed is about exploring what's around you, looking at what's around you,

511
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:33,865
and then just getting the chance to go through a window or jump from balcony to another,

512
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:38,329
percoring across cities, have different points of views on the world that we're giving you

513
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,151
to experience.

514
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:40,852
So that's Assassin's Creed.

515
00:39:41,552 --> 00:39:44,993
Escapism and exploration are also very key to the brand.

516
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:50,395
And then the environments that we're creating with this brand are incredibly historically

517
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:54,616
accurate and authentic. It's an entertainment experience, but it's also an educational

518
00:39:54,656 --> 00:40:02,079
experience in the end. We've had teachers telling their kids in high school to play Assassin's Creed

519
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,661
just to get immersed in Paris during the French Revolution. We really spent a lot of time and

520
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:10,222
effort trying to recreate the most accurate and historically accurate.

521
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:13,042
cities in the world.

522
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:18,043
And whatever we design, if we use a character for mystery

523
00:40:18,163 --> 00:40:22,664
or refer to an event that truly happened, we have to make sure that we

524
00:40:22,864 --> 00:40:24,804
you know, we do that in a very authentic way.

525
00:40:25,265 --> 00:40:28,425
With this brand, we're essentially filling the blanks of human history,

526
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:33,086
you know, taking what is known and creating around building around it,

527
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:34,947
building a story around it.

528
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:38,407
And then and then finally, one of the last attributes.

529
00:40:39,048 --> 00:40:40,288
Last but not least, it's.

530
00:40:41,082 --> 00:40:44,784
It's a brand that's about belonging to a fraternal clan

531
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:46,786
and fighting for the greater good.

532
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:49,128
So it's a brand that's very idealist,

533
00:40:49,248 --> 00:40:50,349
that's very optimistic.

534
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:52,730
So it has a very positive impact

535
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,553
on whoever is playing the game.

536
00:40:55,593 --> 00:41:00,496
And I also think that that's something we should aim for

537
00:41:00,636 --> 00:41:02,978
as a takeaway for anyone who's going through

538
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:05,440
the Assassin's Creed experience in a theme park.

539
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,461
In an attraction.

540
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:12,185
One of the things we've been doing while you were talking, we started capturing some of these

541
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:16,527
keywords as you're going, just to get the stuff that gets us excited.

542
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:22,390
Oh, who wrote that? Verticality equals freedom. That's right. You really do get to fly like an

543
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:22,950
eagle, right?

544
00:41:23,591 --> 00:41:28,295
Let's push over here a little bit and we can talk some more about what are some of the things that

545
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:34,020
that make the game fun? What are the pieces of gameplay that like you would really feel like

546
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:41,407
you have to experience for it to in the real world for it to feel like it's a like it's a

547
00:41:41,607 --> 00:41:46,551
really an Assassin's Creed experience? You know to me what makes it really

548
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:51,235
really perfect for themed entertainment and for designing what we want to design today is

549
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:57,778
is really the exploration aspect. When we do studies of what people like to do within the game,

550
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:04,302
explore the open world is you know always come comes back as you know first or second

551
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:12,006
motivator. Then there of course the leap of faith. The leap of faith is really a really one of them.

552
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:15,922
That's sort of the emotional high point of the game.

553
00:42:15,942 --> 00:42:16,982
That's the payoff.

554
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:19,604
And that's something we can't really do in real life.

555
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:25,046
So how, you know, is there a way that we could translate this in the physical world in a theme park experience?

556
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:29,688
Well, you know, here are the main things that you do in the game that you love.

557
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:32,889
Right? You run across rooftops.

558
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:34,890
You're leaping parkour style.

559
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,811
You get into that incredible leap where you fall.

560
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:42,598
500 feet into a place, a stack, right?

561
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:49,861
The, and the, I mean, you could do it as a coaster,

562
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:51,642
you know, as a, as a coaster ride.

563
00:42:52,622 --> 00:42:56,824
Coasters are interesting because they're super thrilling.

564
00:42:57,064 --> 00:42:58,705
They have real genuine physical thrills.

565
00:42:58,765 --> 00:43:01,086
You're actually being hurled around at high speed.

566
00:43:01,686 --> 00:43:05,968
The, the sort of downside to a coaster is,

567
00:43:06,776 --> 00:43:09,717
It's got a big vehicle and a big track and you see where you're going.

568
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:13,859
There's no surprises in a coaster because the track is showing you exactly where you're about to go.

569
00:43:14,499 --> 00:43:21,502
So you can have amazing drops, but it's sort of hard to bury the track in the in historic

570
00:43:22,022 --> 00:43:25,804
revolutionary France. So we could you certainly could do it.

571
00:43:26,344 --> 00:43:27,785
But I wonder if there's other ways we can.

572
00:43:28,285 --> 00:43:31,628
get there. One of our rules in these brainstorms is there's no bad ideas.

573
00:43:31,668 --> 00:43:34,550
So if you guys like a coaster, let's go for a coaster.

574
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,672
Let's just throw out different possibilities. But I, but it's,

575
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:42,556
it seems like there may be other interesting sort of more theatrical ways to

576
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:46,198
give you that real sense of dropping,

577
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,621
of dropping and climbing and leaping and traveling.

578
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:54,724
And it's also not physically engaged in the same way. So is there, you know,

579
00:43:54,784 --> 00:43:56,005
is there something in between?

580
00:43:56,924 --> 00:44:01,126
Also, coasters tend to be big group experiences because you've got 20 or 30 people on a coaster.

581
00:44:01,546 --> 00:44:04,008
I wonder if we can make this feel like a smaller experience where it's

582
00:44:04,568 --> 00:44:07,749
just one person at a time or just a couple of people at a time.

583
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:13,272
We are running into two of our big challenges, right, which is guest agency and individualization.

584
00:44:14,742 --> 00:44:18,024
These are things that we don't do well.

585
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:22,366
So yeah, this is going to get interesting to see how we can make this work.

586
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:29,291
Especially adapting a game IP that's already interactive and already satisfies that promise.

587
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:32,973
You know, you just don't want to, in adapting it to a real world experience,

588
00:44:32,993 --> 00:44:37,916
the last thing you want to do is have it fall short of something that you can already have at home.

589
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,718
The leap of faith and parkouring.

590
00:44:41,863 --> 00:44:44,305
Both are iconic.

591
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:47,306
If we don't incorporate those in some way,

592
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:51,048
we're not delivering on guest expectations.

593
00:44:51,728 --> 00:44:55,309
You can look at, say, what Shanghai did,

594
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:57,310
Shanghai Disney did with their challenge trail.

595
00:44:58,091 --> 00:44:59,071
Oh, that is cool.

596
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:00,732
Does anybody have some pictures of that?

597
00:45:00,812 --> 00:45:01,572
Lex, can you find that?

598
00:45:02,092 --> 00:45:03,313
Yeah, I actually have one over

599
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,594
on the other side of the whiteboard.

600
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:05,054
I'll grab it.

601
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:06,494
All right, hang on.

602
00:45:07,135 --> 00:45:07,595
Bring it over.

603
00:45:07,995 --> 00:45:09,056
Let's talk about that for a second,

604
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:09,736
because that is one of the...

605
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,301
one of the most engaging experiences we've seen in a while.

606
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:22,504
It's basically like a rock climbing course but done in a Disney way so it's safe, it ensures

607
00:45:22,564 --> 00:45:29,267
success but it gives people, it doesn't really fake the process of like scaling a mountain,

608
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,788
it just does it in a nice protected.

609
00:45:33,081 --> 00:45:35,762
And, you know, borderline organized way.

610
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:39,742
There's still, there's still choice involved that you can like switch from

611
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:43,303
a, an easy track to a difficult track at certain checkpoints.

612
00:45:44,423 --> 00:45:45,323
Um, there it is.

613
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,644
That's a nice picture of it.

614
00:45:47,104 --> 00:45:49,324
So you certainly could start with something like that.

615
00:45:49,344 --> 00:45:52,885
You could start with a city and let people climb over it in this

616
00:45:52,985 --> 00:45:57,486
harnessed way, but sort of find ways maybe even to go inside and outside

617
00:45:57,526 --> 00:45:59,306
of buildings or climb over stuff.

618
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:00,367
Um.

619
00:46:01,938 --> 00:46:06,941
And that would be that would be really fun. And what I like about it, too, is it's it can become

620
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:12,984
sort of systemic. It's not a linear experience. You can, depending on the challenges, you can

621
00:46:13,044 --> 00:46:18,807
choose the hard path, the medium path, the easy path. And then this way, the experience that you

622
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:23,049
are going to live through it is never going to be the same. You know, there's a replayability,

623
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:29,593
repeatability with that idea that I like very much. That's very, you know,

624
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:32,269
It's pretty interesting.

625
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,371
So that's certainly one way we could come at it.

626
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:38,734
It's weird, it's elaborate, but it's low tech.

627
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:40,756
It's not super high tech.

628
00:46:41,136 --> 00:46:42,797
That particular version is outdoors.

629
00:46:42,837 --> 00:46:46,560
There's no film or media or special effects involved.

630
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,681
What you see is what you get, right?

631
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:49,363
You're actually climbing real rocks.

632
00:46:50,262 --> 00:46:52,263
We might be able to take that to another level.

633
00:46:52,303 --> 00:46:55,945
We might be able to go into indoor spaces where there's

634
00:46:55,985 --> 00:46:56,926
lighting and special effects.

635
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:59,767
So you could have more.

636
00:47:01,428 --> 00:47:04,490
You could add people coming at you,

637
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,711
warriors coming at you in projection around you,

638
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,973
and so on, to make it more theatrical and dynamic.

639
00:47:10,153 --> 00:47:11,493
We could try some of that.

640
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:13,230
Or maybe you're at...

641
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:18,954
It could be so fun to have live performers in full costume as these characters.

642
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:23,757
Like trained stunt performers that you can do little time trials and challenges against.

643
00:47:23,837 --> 00:47:27,059
Where either they're teaching you how to do it or yeah, you're challenging them

644
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:29,981
to, you know, see who can get to the end faster.

645
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:34,504
And by the way, we're breaking about 50 theme park rules right now, but I really like it.

646
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:39,407
So like you almost never see live performers in an attraction.

647
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:44,327
because they're considered too expensive, honestly.

648
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:46,808
But I don't think that's necessarily true.

649
00:47:46,848 --> 00:47:49,668
I think we can find ways to work within that,

650
00:47:49,788 --> 00:47:53,469
if you can make an experience that really is powerful,

651
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:55,390
that really has some great live performance.

652
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,730
We can do some pretty great stuff with media

653
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,511
where you've got a doorway and there's a, you know,

654
00:48:03,836 --> 00:48:05,416
A Templar on the other side of the doorway.

655
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:07,377
And they can be pretty believable looking.

656
00:48:07,437 --> 00:48:09,297
This one is wearing a very attractive dress, I see.

657
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:12,418
But they can be, you know, you can be on one side of it

658
00:48:13,078 --> 00:48:17,599
on your challenge trail and these Templars and threats

659
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:20,980
can be appearing in, I'm trying this really well,

660
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,161
can be appearing, you know, in portals or windows

661
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:28,701
that let us see people just outside who are coming after us.

662
00:48:29,142 --> 00:48:30,902
We can do a lot of stuff with

663
00:48:32,925 --> 00:48:41,714
With dimensional projection on trans screen or Pepper's Ghost that makes it look like they're really in the space with you.

664
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:47,539
So that when we do need a real live person, it's almost indistinguishable from the ones who are part of the media.

665
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:49,961
And you can really mix it up in a really interesting way.

666
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:54,258
The thing we're always saying is, you know, you want to design things that are fun to play,

667
00:48:54,278 --> 00:48:58,061
but also fun to watch. And so if you have, if you're able to incorporate them in a way

668
00:48:58,441 --> 00:49:02,784
that kind of creates a show, not only for the people, you know, going through the attraction,

669
00:49:02,804 --> 00:49:06,347
but also for people down below on the path who are watching this unfold.

670
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:11,210
So this actually gives me an idea that I think our creative technologist is going to hate me for.

671
00:49:13,832 --> 00:49:14,832
But I think it's worth mentioning.

672
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:20,376
So, you know, Assassin's Creed is about being slow when you have to, but being

673
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:23,918
like magically swift and agile when you need to.

674
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:27,160
And then I think about some of the stuff I've seen at IAPA the past couple of

675
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:34,785
years, where, uh, some people are incorporating electric motors into the

676
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:39,929
sleds on zip lines and trails where you can actually power people along a path.

677
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:49,553
That's super interesting. So you're thinking if we motorize this or power this,

678
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:54,775
could you power a portion of it? Have part of it be open to your,

679
00:49:56,996 --> 00:50:02,178
under your own steam and other parts of it where the ride or the motor kind of takes over?

680
00:50:02,816 --> 00:50:06,397
This is the point in the charrette where Vaughn usually tells me I'm nuts.

681
00:50:06,657 --> 00:50:09,518
No, I think it's not me you have to worry about, it's the lawyers.

682
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,161
It becomes very similar to kind of like an e-bike, right?

683
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:20,342
Where you have more of a powered assist than something that's fully powered.

684
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:24,744
So it may be that you can keep using your own locomotion,

685
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:28,125
but you get to go a little faster because there is an electric motor that's kind of assisting you.

686
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:34,036
Super interesting and I'd love to be able to do your leap of faith.

687
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:38,844
Where when you finally get to that, that can be.

688
00:50:40,426 --> 00:50:45,313
That can be media so you could do a combination of real scenery that you're running over.

689
00:50:46,944 --> 00:51:01,317
You know, as you as you sort of go up the hill, your feet may actually be touching the scenery as you go over it or just above it as you're sort of floating over the rooftops and climbing higher and higher until you get to a big jump.

690
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:11,226
And then maybe that can that motorized winch like actually descend you drop you down into the space into a big.

691
00:51:12,784 --> 00:51:16,946
I'm thinking back to, you know, the, the notion of verticality and how

692
00:51:17,006 --> 00:51:20,388
important the accuracy of the historic cities are.

693
00:51:21,008 --> 00:51:26,251
So before you go off the leap of faith, you really kind of have to give people

694
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:31,814
that like perfect vista from the highest point, you're going to want to be able

695
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:33,195
to do some kind of a projection psych.

696
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:35,136
You're going to want to be able to do something like this.

697
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:41,053
I do think you're right that that that moment of pause before the leap is so

698
00:51:41,133 --> 00:51:43,574
important to kind of convey. It's that bird like, you know,

699
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:48,895
moment of being perched and then getting up the courage before you go for it.

700
00:51:49,015 --> 00:51:52,476
Yeah. If you're just running and you don't have that pause, it won't feel,

701
00:51:52,496 --> 00:51:53,516
it won't feel quite right.

702
00:51:54,136 --> 00:51:55,296
Since we're motorizing this, right.

703
00:51:55,336 --> 00:51:58,357
You want to be able to like get people to jump and then hold that,

704
00:51:59,017 --> 00:52:01,978
hold that moment like right before the drop gets severe.

705
00:52:02,604 --> 00:52:09,549
Vertigo is really actually one of the easier sensations to simulate with with media like this so that could be really effective

706
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:13,912
Oh, the challenge will be to do this in a very seamless way

707
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:21,458
um hardware wise is the harness enough does do we need to like orient people's bodies in the sense

708
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:26,942
um that they that they're actually looking up and then falling down how you know, how can we

709
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:30,885
How can we make that work? So I've been getting super excited about

710
00:52:31,393 --> 00:52:34,955
The moments of looking down at rooftops and down at drops below you.

711
00:52:34,995 --> 00:52:35,375
But you're right.

712
00:52:35,415 --> 00:52:40,538
At some point you need to look up at a tower and you don't want to have

713
00:52:41,938 --> 00:52:45,120
the track, the overhead track in your view.

714
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:52,663
This is the most far out flavor of theme park design where we're designing

715
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,584
a brand new prototype ride system.

716
00:52:54,664 --> 00:52:55,064
Normally.

717
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:59,676
You got to be one of the big boys to do this, but this is our made up, right?

718
00:52:59,736 --> 00:53:00,677
We can do anything we want.

719
00:53:00,737 --> 00:53:06,482
So in this, in this system, we're talking about maybe some kind of a system where

720
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:09,264
you've got a track, you've got a motorized thing.

721
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:13,508
Maybe there's, uh, you know, sort of a rotating arm.

722
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:16,551
So you can look with the track or you can look away from it.

723
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:20,434
So you can look up, you can look down and it can be.

724
00:53:21,453 --> 00:53:23,635
running at very controlled motor speeds,

725
00:53:23,815 --> 00:53:27,458
or it can release its grip on the track

726
00:53:27,998 --> 00:53:29,759
and descend at gravity speed,

727
00:53:29,779 --> 00:53:32,822
so you can get some real sense of acceleration.

728
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,944
And there's a number of ride systems

729
00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:36,825
that sort of get you closer.

730
00:53:36,865 --> 00:53:38,486
Is that a bungee setup you're drawing there?

731
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:42,309
Well, I'm just wondering if there were two lines,

732
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:43,070
so there's two tracks,

733
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:43,830
so you don't have the problem

734
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:45,212
of the center track being right above you.

735
00:53:46,112 --> 00:53:47,854
We could keep the tracks further apart,

736
00:53:47,874 --> 00:53:49,695
and that would let you look up and out

737
00:53:49,715 --> 00:53:50,596
and give you the vistas.

738
00:53:51,415 --> 00:53:52,596
And would give you stability.

739
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:53,637
Right.

740
00:53:53,657 --> 00:53:58,341
And you actually just program the tracks further apart

741
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,123
or together, which actually causes that sense of rotation.

742
00:54:01,623 --> 00:54:05,086
And just speed up one piece and slowly the other piece.

743
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:07,989
Yeah, and you could also get some up and down

744
00:54:08,029 --> 00:54:09,330
by just moving the tracks closer together.

745
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,934
And I was actually just thinking about how would you

746
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:15,815
handle doing the drop?

747
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:19,859
You can have the sleds from the support tracks.

748
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:30,171
cross over into the next zone, lock that off, and then drop the entire assembly down to recreate the leap of faith.

749
00:54:30,591 --> 00:54:31,651
To do the actual fall, right?

750
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:39,333
So this way you would keep the whole first section of what we were talking about, the agency, the walking and recording yourself

751
00:54:39,813 --> 00:54:46,274
until you get to the point where you're being motorized, the leap of faith is being motorized.

752
00:54:46,514 --> 00:54:48,455
I like that idea. I think that's very cool.

753
00:54:49,055 --> 00:54:54,518
Would you have to end up with a leap of faith? Or what about, you know, how would it work for the

754
00:54:55,538 --> 00:54:58,960
chickens out there who don't want to do it? Is there another track?

755
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,062
You want to have branches that respect people's level of engagement. You want to give people the

756
00:55:04,082 --> 00:55:10,225
opportunity to push into uncomfortable spaces, but not force them into them. And you always want to

757
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:16,268
give them an off-ramp. So I'm always seeing like a chicken track that people can always find their

758
00:55:16,288 --> 00:55:16,688
way to get back.

759
00:55:18,909 --> 00:55:21,512
an excellent story reason to give people a way out as well.

760
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:21,672
Right?

761
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:24,395
They could opt to follow somebody through the city

762
00:55:24,975 --> 00:55:27,938
at the street level instead of going up the rooftop.

763
00:55:27,979 --> 00:55:28,139
Right?

764
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:30,641
And that would be perfectly plausible

765
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,023
without feeling like you're chickening out.

766
00:55:32,043 --> 00:55:33,845
We don't want to ever like make you feel like

767
00:55:35,947 --> 00:55:36,868
you've done something terrible

768
00:55:37,288 --> 00:55:40,692
or you're not worthy of the big experience.

769
00:55:40,893 --> 00:55:45,980
You how do you feel about introducing this as an element of reward in a theme park?

770
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:48,864
Could the leap of faith be a reward or would that be

771
00:55:48,884 --> 00:55:55,073
would that create you know too many people be disappointed that they don't get access to it?

772
00:55:55,365 --> 00:55:59,628
Traditionally in theme parks, it's all about throughput and trying to get as many people

773
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:01,389
as possible to have the experience as you can.

774
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:11,677
Can we find ways to make it personal and exclusive and have an aspirational, something that only

775
00:56:11,697 --> 00:56:12,578
a few people earn?

776
00:56:12,618 --> 00:56:15,080
That's a really interesting possibility.

777
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,301
What do you guys think about that?

778
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:23,526
The important bit is to make sure everybody knows that it can be done, that it is a reward.

779
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:26,809
And it's not terribly hard to achieve.

780
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,191
Well, it sounds like we've got just a staggering amount of fun stuff to begin with.

781
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:35,033
And this is, by the way, exactly how a first brainstorm goes.

782
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:38,114
We don't necessarily have all of our problems solved, but we've got a lot of

783
00:56:38,174 --> 00:56:41,155
great ideas that we can dig into and boil down.

784
00:56:41,175 --> 00:56:44,597
So what's, what, what were our favorite things that you heard today, Matilda,

785
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:47,798
you just shout them out and we'll shout out anything that we.

786
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:50,499
Uh, I love the idea that we're taking.

787
00:56:51,127 --> 00:56:55,129
you know, a format of an attraction that is existing and then enhancing it into something

788
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:57,509
that is more groundbreaking.

789
00:56:57,529 --> 00:57:02,011
I like the idea that we're exploring verticality because this is key to Assassin's Creed.

790
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:08,913
I like the idea that we're, you know, creating a version of a ride that is not necessarily

791
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:09,314
linear.

792
00:57:09,334 --> 00:57:11,154
I like that it's physically engaging.

793
00:57:11,914 --> 00:57:16,396
Essentially it's putting you in the shoes of what an assassin would do and if that's

794
00:57:16,456 --> 00:57:17,816
not what you want to feel.

795
00:57:18,427 --> 00:57:22,369
like in the real world for an attraction based on Assassin's Creed, then I don't know what is.

796
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:27,311
So I think just in this process, we automatically gravitated towards what's most important for us

797
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:30,553
in making this ride, which is to capture the physical sensation of

798
00:57:32,814 --> 00:57:38,717
being free and flying through these worlds and the ability to soar like an eagle and to

799
00:57:39,137 --> 00:57:43,039
and eventually to deliver the leap of faith, which is undoubtedly how it's got to

800
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,901
it's got you have to end with that has to be the payoff. Right.

801
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:47,121
But yeah, thank you so much. I.

802
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:52,865
I think we've done a great job of capturing the essence of the brand and creating something that is new.

803
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:55,126
And that's really exciting for us as a company.

804
00:57:55,166 --> 00:58:03,249
Thanks again to our team here at BeesArc, to Lex, Yvonne, and Baz on our brainstorming team,

805
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:08,091
to Mathilde from Ubisoft, and to all of you for sitting in and joining us.

806
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:11,012
This is our version of Storytelling Siblings,

807
00:58:11,332 --> 00:58:16,294
how we love the connection between the world of games and the world of live attractions.

808
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:17,154
And we hope you'll all come.

809
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,675
Play with us in this world sometime.

810
00:58:19,256 --> 00:58:19,677
Thanks all.
