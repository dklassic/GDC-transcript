1
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,757
All right, everybody ready?

2
00:00:09,758 --> 00:00:10,218
Welcome.

3
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,740
Please silence your cell phones.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,442
And yeah, I think we're ready to get started.

5
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,644
So there's going to be a talk on how

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,826
we created the prototype for Edith Finch

7
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:25,489
and then how those evolved into the broader game itself.

8
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,251
And this is the team at one snapshot.

9
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:32,834
We started the game with three people on the team

10
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:35,355
and then grew to about 15 and then tapered off.

11
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:41,547
towards the end. So it's sort of a medium-sized team, not too small, but certainly not AAA.

12
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:47,831
The game itself, for those who don't know or spent a while, is a collection of short

13
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:54,996
stories and each of the short stories has a totally different game mechanic, different

14
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:59,239
from the rest of the stories in the game, but then also hopefully different from anything

15
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:04,442
else players have ever experienced. The game is an attempt to...

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:12,439
try to keep players in this kind of beginner's mind of never quite understanding what it is that

17
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:16,725
the game is about so they're always kind of feel like they're discovering new things as they move

18
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:21,731
forward. So we did a lot of prototypes for each of these stories and each of the prototypes also

19
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,812
had the constraint that

20
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:26,515
there are no tutorials in the game because the game is about this sense of

21
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:30,137
discovery so we wanted to create things that people had never seen before but

22
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:38,241
also things that were discoverable that people could learn how to progress by

23
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:46,125
playing the game and instead of focusing on traditional goals like challenge this

24
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:51,287
game is focused on evoking a feeling and in that case it's the feeling of the

25
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:51,728
sublime

26
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:55,780
talk about in a minute. Here's a quick trailer.

27
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,378
Cool.

28
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:21,340
All right, so that's the game, and in this talk I'll be beginning with the kind of high

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,940
level approach to what, how we approach.

30
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:48,904
the overall design for emotions and then talk about how we figure out which emotions we're

31
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:53,709
going to be focusing on in the particular game we're making and then get into the nuts and bolts

32
00:02:53,969 --> 00:03:00,235
of actually making those prototypes to try to evoke those feelings. All of these kind of tie into

33
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:05,908
the problem of how do you make something when you yourself are kind of a little unsure about it,

34
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:11,355
which is part of the appeal as a developer, that we're making things that we ourselves

35
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:13,017
are kind of actively exploring.

36
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:18,570
The games that we make tend to be themselves about a sense of exploration because that's

37
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,174
kind of what the game development process for us is like. The development process of Edith Finch,

38
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:29,339
it's kind of a worst-case scenario of going in blind, but hopefully a lot of these things

39
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:34,743
will seem somewhat familiar for games you might be working on where there are at least, you know,

40
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:40,068
a few aspects that are not very well sussed out. But hopefully you know a little bit more about

41
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,850
your game than we did when we started making it.

42
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:51,306
So, starting off, just to give you kind of a philosophical perspective, my sense of the

43
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:57,150
way that the games work and stories and emotion and the difficulty there is that it really

44
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,713
boils down to attention and what you can expect players to be focused on.

45
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:07,897
And it's difficult in games because there are a lot of things that are going on compared

46
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:12,460
to a play where people are generally like pretty much sitting or going to the bathroom.

47
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,906
one of those two things for the duration of the performance.

48
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:21,108
But in games, the problem isn't just your game,

49
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:24,189
it's every other game that players have experienced

50
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,570
coming into it in their lifetime has kind of trained them

51
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,392
to approach the experience of the game often as a life or death situation.

52
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:37,733
Usually, you know, if you stand in one spot for too long

53
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:40,954
you will be destroyed in a lot of games and genres.

54
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,503
or you will lose or whatever it is.

55
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:46,625
So players aren't used to taking their time.

56
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:49,606
They're not used to stopping to take a breath.

57
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:51,907
They actually have to be encouraged to do those things.

58
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:57,530
So we try to create a space that evokes that feeling

59
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,791
and kind of encourages them to approach it differently

60
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,272
than they would a more traditional game.

61
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,093
So this is kind of our.

62
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:12,367
high-level plan of attack which is you know that we start off by you know not

63
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:16,428
giving them hopefully too many distracting toys I mean we try to balance

64
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:19,448
it there are times in the game where you become like a giant tentacle monster

65
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:24,309
eating sailors but those are not the same moments where we're trying to you

66
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:30,010
know get you to pay a lot of attention to a specific area you know alternate

67
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,391
these very small scenes with broader sillier moments

68
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:43,333
And then, yeah, in a nutshell, what we are trying to do is to create interesting spaces

69
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,834
and tools to explore those spaces.

70
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:49,877
And those tools are the gameplay prototypes that we'll be talking about a little bit later.

71
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:58,424
And instead of relying on an explicit story and, you know, setting up character and conflict

72
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:00,545
and plot in words or dialogue.

73
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:04,848
We try to do as much as we can just with the environment itself.

74
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:11,690
Ideally it's something that, you know, it's like a silent film where you don't need any audio or text in the beginning.

75
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:19,653
Just the experience of being in that space already gets you to ask questions as a player

76
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:23,874
and wonder what might be happening and get you into the mood of it.

77
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:26,275
And it's a lot easier and more reliable.

78
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:29,189
because players don't have to pay attention to context.

79
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:32,871
It's something that they can absorb through osmosis.

80
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:37,934
And instead of starting, again, with a written,

81
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:43,258
more didactic story, we start with a very broad goal

82
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:45,899
of evoking a certain kind of feeling.

83
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,001
And what we found is that when we start with something

84
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:51,623
that is a little more open-ended like that,

85
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,645
even though there's a lot more uncertainty,

86
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:58,526
it's something that actually has a good chance of making it to the finish line,

87
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:03,008
because games tend to go through a lot of changes as you realize

88
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,449
how many of your initially sound seeming ideas

89
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,550
aren't going to work for a number of reasons.

90
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:13,032
Hold on to a little bit of uncertainty and you bring it with you

91
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:20,434
You know that that gives you enough room to actually preserve the original intent even though

92
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:24,014
What ends up at the end is not what you would have expected

93
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:28,535
But it is you know, if it's something like a feeling there's a good chance that that's gonna

94
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:35,636
Carry through in the case of Edith Finch the game began as a way for me to

95
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:43,572
explore a particular moment that I had in my own childhood when I was scuba diving as a teenager and

96
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:51,675
saw the bottom of the ocean sloping away into like a seemingly infinite darkness and that moment where something was simultaneously

97
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,075
very beautiful, but also

98
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,096
unsettling

99
00:07:55,076 --> 00:08:01,198
Which in a word is like the sublime in this moment where you you feel you know the transcendent beauty of the universe

100
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:02,999
But also you yourself, you know

101
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:06,334
acknowledged to be very small and a fragile part of that.

102
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:09,156
And so this game was trying to explore that.

103
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:12,978
Initially it began by literally remaking

104
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,960
that teenage scuba diving experience, more or less.

105
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:18,262
And then I just was way too gamey

106
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:22,945
and didn't actually feel like what was in my head.

107
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:25,746
And so it went off in a obviously very,

108
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:27,127
very different tangent.

109
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:32,571
And then once we have a better understanding of,

110
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:37,814
particular feeling, which is the next thing I'll talk about, then we move on to making prototypes

111
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:42,476
because those prototypes are the most difficult part of the whole process and have the most

112
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:50,720
kind of emergent complexity and changes that arise out of the process of making them. Story comes in,

113
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,562
like we begin with the best effort in the very start of like, yeah, okay, we think...

114
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:59,008
these are the characters and this is roughly what's going to happen.

115
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,130
It's going to be a story of a family, for example, in this case.

116
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,292
We knew that it was going to be centered around Edith.

117
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:12,400
But we found a lot easier for us to rewrite everything once we had the

118
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,743
experiences, which is like a classic chicken inning problem.

119
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:18,725
But we would.

120
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:24,071
have people play the game as it existed in a more or less complete prototype and then

121
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:29,577
ask them about how it felt to play the game and then write more to that experience. So instead of

122
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:36,363
trying to make an experience that tracked with the story, we just adjusted the story to track

123
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:43,711
better with what the prototype was that we had made. Okay, next up is finding that.

124
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:47,019
feeling, in this case, we started with a sense of sublime,

125
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,980
but it had to get a little bit more detailed.

126
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,502
And then the challenges of, once you have that idea,

127
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:55,903
how do you communicate that to the rest of the team?

128
00:09:57,184 --> 00:10:00,265
So, for game development purposes,

129
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:03,247
I think it's helpful to boil down things

130
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:07,188
into a couple of very concrete ideas.

131
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,810
Ideally, in the case of Eat the Sandwich,

132
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,531
we had three words, sublime, intimate, and murky,

133
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:13,872
and the hope was that.

134
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:20,370
These were feelings that anybody on the team could look to for inspiration for how to do

135
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,776
whatever it was that they were engaged in that day. So, you know, the lighting artists, you know,

136
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:30,582
might be working on, like, the fog or, you know, an animator might be working on jump animation,

137
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:33,625
whatever it is that they could look and say, like, oh, is there a way that I can make this

138
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:35,327
a little bit more intimate or more murky?

139
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:40,224
And even before anything has actually been checked into Perforce,

140
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:45,449
people have this collective sense of, you know, what this might feel like.

141
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:46,690
And there's going to be divergences.

142
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,673
But that's part of the appeal also, when you have something that is

143
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:54,496
powerful and specific, but also a little bit open-ended.

144
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:58,339
It provides a space for everybody else to

145
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:01,009
contribute their own perspective on these things,

146
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,551
and add to the richness of the game

147
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,373
without hopefully pulling too much in opposite directions.

148
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:13,238
And then once you've settled in on the feeling,

149
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:16,040
I think it's really helpful to try

150
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,422
to find as many really good examples of that

151
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,904
in other mediums as a way for you

152
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:26,167
to almost play the game in your head years before you ship it.

153
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:38,656
In our case, there was a genre of literature called weird fiction that, like Neil Gaiman and H.P. Lovecraft and a bunch of other folks have written really good stories about the sublime.

154
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:45,882
And a lot of weird fiction deals with the challenges of being in a universe that is stranger than you can possibly imagine.

155
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:55,229
And so those were really useful tools for us to kind of imagine what it would feel like to play the game by reading it.

156
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:01,001
Also, soundtracks are great because people have already done the work of saying, you know,

157
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,563
what does it feel like for this, you know, like in the case of Edith Finch,

158
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:07,964
things like Donnie Darko or Under the Skin, you know,

159
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:12,686
movies that were tonally kind of in that ballpark, what might that sound like?

160
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:17,308
And so for a lot of the project, I just had a couple of those soundtracks,

161
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:22,290
like on repeat, and it was a way of kind of getting into this alternate headspace

162
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,891
and kind of dreaming in that place.

163
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:24,911
Also...

164
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:30,583
Just printing out a whole bunch of references was really helpful and sticking them up all over the office

165
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:36,425
uh kind of engaging the visual part of your brain, which i'll talk about a little bit later and then uh

166
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:45,328
Similarly updating your windows or macintosh desktop background is a nice thing just to kind of like put it right in the middle of your face

167
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:49,990
Uh, so like here's the uh, the game that we're working on next

168
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,970
Uh, that's a little

169
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:53,511
preview

170
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:54,891
um

171
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,771
Okay

172
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:59,582
And, oh, we're out.

173
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:01,023
OK.

174
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:05,584
And OK, here's our first mood board.

175
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:10,025
This was, I don't know, maybe like three or four months

176
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:12,566
into development of the project, when we still

177
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:14,987
thought there would be magic and combat,

178
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,207
and I don't know, like Edith was going to take words

179
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:19,508
and put them together and make spells.

180
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:21,689
This is like a nightmare.

181
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:23,309
It's a totally different game.

182
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:24,950
It had a different name.

183
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:30,837
It never would have shipped but this is what it would have looked like and actually looks kind of like a game

184
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:35,060
We did shit called waterman to be defense. And I think it's just like the power of

185
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,041
having these

186
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:41,163
Specific but somewhat open-ended

187
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:45,725
Tonal goals, so we didn't ship a story about a microscope, you know

188
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:52,048
But there is a lot of underwater elements and certainly the the forest in those lighting conditions are things that are not

189
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:54,350
Too far away from from what we did ship

190
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:58,927
And then next I'm going to show a Greenlight trailer

191
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:01,389
that we made, I think about like four months in,

192
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:06,713
that is kind of a moving version of this mood board.

193
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:09,655
None of these things actually shipped,

194
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:14,578
but they're kind of what we were imagining the game.

195
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:15,939
I don't know, maybe some of those books.

196
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,767
I think some of those books might have been in the game.

197
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:20,949
You can see it's a little more haunted housey

198
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:23,571
than the real game, but there is still

199
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:27,114
a sense of this very large house that you'll be exploring.

200
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:30,516
And a little bit of underwater stuff

201
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:33,038
still clinging to that original scuba diving inspiration.

202
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,901
Here's an invisible dog

203
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:37,342
that we thought would be a good idea.

204
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:41,305
We went back and forth a lot on how puzzly

205
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:44,648
the game would be, and for various reasons.

206
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:49,820
I think, you know, the game could have had more of those kind of delightful physical interactions,

207
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,563
but they're just really hard and they weren't where our heart was when it came down to it.

208
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:59,587
But this is really weird. We had an underwater sequence in the shipping game,

209
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:04,331
you know, like an underwater house that we completely forgot about for several years,

210
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:09,915
but it was there four months in. We had this underwater house and I think it just speaks to...

211
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:15,153
The game being about this combination of civilized and natural spaces.

212
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:18,315
This also did not actually ship.

213
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,537
But it's a nice idea.

214
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,501
And so yeah, what you're looking for, or what we're looking for,

215
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:29,785
is a sense of where you're going, but I don't think you really want a map.

216
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:32,267
I mean, the producers probably want a map.

217
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:36,611
It would be easier to work with, but it's really hard to make maps, for one.

218
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,333
And they quickly become inaccurate.

219
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:41,115
and need to be maintained.

220
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:43,717
And, you know, I think it's easier and it's more fun

221
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:46,438
to just pick a direction.

222
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:50,640
And it also puts you into places where you can't predict

223
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,041
where you're going to be, which I think is part of

224
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,223
what made Edith Finch such a strange experience,

225
00:15:57,263 --> 00:15:59,284
is that we could not have expected

226
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:00,404
that that's where we would end up.

227
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,065
We only kind of found our way there

228
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:04,326
because we set off in a direction

229
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:07,788
and just kept marching for a lot of years.

230
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:15,522
Okay, but trying to balance this with the practical needs of making a video game. It's not all

231
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:19,525
you know, there's like layers of abstraction and confusion and

232
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:21,826
We'll figure it out later

233
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:24,908
We're always trying to find things that we can

234
00:16:25,477 --> 00:16:30,519
put a stake in the ground on and say, you know, even though we're operating in this sea of

235
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:39,482
unknown and this morass of poor decisions and, you know, shaky ideas, we can still pull out

236
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:44,664
a few things that we can have certainty about or just like feel somewhat confident about. And for

237
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:50,967
us, looking at things like weird fiction, this literary genre, and other experiences that evoke

238
00:16:50,987 --> 00:16:54,408
the sublime, you know, I think it became obvious that for whatever reason,

239
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,352
they tend to involve natural spaces.

240
00:16:57,612 --> 00:17:01,293
People feel a sense of the sublime most often

241
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:04,014
in places like the forest or the beach.

242
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:06,995
And so yeah, we should probably be setting stories

243
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:09,076
in those spaces where we can.

244
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:12,437
So it gave us a way to focus

245
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:15,018
of all the potential prototypes we might do,

246
00:17:16,058 --> 00:17:18,159
maybe we can try some of those at the beach.

247
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:21,260
Similarly with weird fiction,

248
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,320
a lot of the stories are very short.

249
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:30,268
and a lot of them involve very explicit narrators, people that are telling the story, writing it down,

250
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:36,149
often several layers deep, where someone is telling a story to somebody else, and that's a way of

251
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,811
emphasizing that you're never getting the full truth, you're just getting a perspective on it,

252
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:48,813
and making the universe that much more obviously unknowable to you. So that was something that we

253
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:52,153
took wholesale for Edith Finch, and there was about...

254
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:58,083
like a year or so of us or me particularly like wrestling with like what does this sublime mean

255
00:17:58,103 --> 00:18:04,707
uh like how do we make that concrete and eventually kind of giving up and saying

256
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:10,650
i don't really know how to do that but i do know how to do overwhelmed and that's pretty close

257
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:16,914
so i think overwhelmed became something that's easier like if an animator is making you know

258
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,555
like a walk cycle or whatever like you can

259
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:20,505
visualize that a little better.

260
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:23,326
And it's not exactly what we set out to make.

261
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:25,347
It's not as aspirational as Sublime,

262
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:27,548
but it's something that's a lot easier

263
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:31,310
for to actually make a concrete version of it.

264
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:36,532
And yeah, so next just talking about how,

265
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:40,654
once there's this idea of this feeling that you have,

266
00:18:40,714 --> 00:18:42,315
how do you communicate that with everybody else?

267
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:45,629
People like to ask for documents,

268
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,531
like written descriptions of how this thing will work,

269
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:51,932
knowing that, of course, these things are gonna change.

270
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:56,154
And people kinda read them, they forget about them,

271
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:58,055
the documents become stale,

272
00:18:58,515 --> 00:18:59,936
they're somewhat limited utility,

273
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:01,977
but it does help to write them,

274
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:03,858
probably just for your own benefit.

275
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:06,839
And then also, later on in development,

276
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,860
a lot of people will come onto the project,

277
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,541
like various contractors or,

278
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:13,654
You might have someone who's only going to be there

279
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:16,876
for a couple of weeks doing shrubbery or whatever it is

280
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:19,598
that that week you really need someone to do.

281
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:21,839
And so having the corpus of documents,

282
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,660
actually, even if it's not super helpful for communicating

283
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,262
the original idea, is good to just have around

284
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:28,603
for people that come on late.

285
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:32,305
But I think what works better is to try

286
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,226
to communicate to everybody in the language

287
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:35,647
that they're most comfortable with.

288
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:38,925
which unfortunately is different for every single person on the team

289
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,506
because everybody is a snowflake.

290
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:42,908
But, you know, kind of broadly speaking,

291
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:48,232
like artists tend to prefer like a more visual way of describing something.

292
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:50,995
So like a collection of screenshots or, you know, reference photos

293
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:55,278
might make the idea of, you know, like your beach prototype

294
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:58,581
a bit clearer where the artist really wants to know things like,

295
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:00,362
oh, like how wet is it, what time of day,

296
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:02,644
you know, that you might not even be thinking about,

297
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:03,785
but your reference photos.

298
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:07,330
will have some concrete version of that.

299
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,071
Programmers tend to like feature lists.

300
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:13,176
But everybody has their own thing

301
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:15,458
that they're most concerned about.

302
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,720
So in terms of communicating, a lot of it

303
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,403
just boils down to talking individually

304
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:22,465
to everybody on the team where that's possible.

305
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:27,076
And in our case, that even extended to task tracking,

306
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:30,098
where every single department by the end of the game

307
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:31,739
ended up with their own kind of different

308
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,902
task tracking tool, because they had different ideas

309
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:37,584
about how much work they wanted,

310
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:39,386
like how described it should be.

311
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,568
And so rather than having one monolithic

312
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,489
task tracking tool that nobody really liked,

313
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,451
because we were a very small team,

314
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:47,753
it actually was easier for us to say like,

315
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,634
okay, you guys can just work in Google Docs,

316
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:51,756
and we can use JIRA, and we can use,

317
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:55,025
the bug tracking tool and whatever, which seems insane.

318
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:57,446
But that's part of the, like one of the nice things

319
00:20:57,486 --> 00:20:58,987
about being a small team is that you can do

320
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,948
kind of insane things and it's only insane

321
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:02,389
for like six of you.

322
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:04,790
It's not like 60 or 600.

323
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:06,932
So you can mitigate that a little bit.

324
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:10,994
And then in terms of communicating to everybody else,

325
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:17,058
nothing beats like a prototype or anything that is moving.

326
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:19,740
A lot of it feels like an optical illusion

327
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,880
where you can look at something

328
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:24,059
And you swear, like, oh yeah, that's really, that's a hole.

329
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,140
But then you move a little bit, and you're just like, oh, no,

330
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,361
it's just a painting of a hole.

331
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:29,622
But it only works if the camera's

332
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:31,003
in one particular perspective.

333
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:33,625
And that's kind of what a moving prototype does,

334
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:36,606
is it gives you a different perspective on the problem.

335
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:41,969
And it lets you ask more painful questions

336
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:45,831
than you might otherwise if it was a series of reference

337
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:46,612
photos or whatever.

338
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:55,015
Ideally, any kind of moving object is a great place for discussions and ends up solving

339
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:59,619
a lot of questions or raising questions that wouldn't have been raised otherwise.

340
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:05,565
And it's not enough to just communicate initially what the emotional goal is of something.

341
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:09,169
It also is incumbent on you to communicate that.

342
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:12,297
every time it changes, which is like all of the time,

343
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:17,098
for very good reasons, but often kind of complicated reasons

344
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:19,299
of like, oh, well, players were getting confused

345
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,279
about this thing, so even though we really liked it,

346
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,060
we kind of had to remove it or move it over here,

347
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,221
and it's hard to tell everybody

348
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:29,081
every time something changes,

349
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,642
so what we found was helpful

350
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:34,383
were a couple of kind of best practices, like team.

351
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:39,505
traditions. Like every Friday we would have a show and tell where we would walk

352
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:43,807
around to each person's desk and the whole team would you know kind of look

353
00:22:43,827 --> 00:22:46,708
at whatever they're working on and then people would give like a one to two

354
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:51,731
minute spiel and show things off which is also really nice for people to brag

355
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,512
about what they're working on because often if you know an artist

356
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:57,100
is making some really complicated prop,

357
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,901
they could spend a week or two on it,

358
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,882
and it just goes into the asset folder

359
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:02,682
and in the background and nobody really notices it.

360
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:04,023
Even though it's very pretty,

361
00:23:04,643 --> 00:23:08,285
it gives everybody a chance to kind of clap for them.

362
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:13,147
And also, it's a very explicit demonstration of like,

363
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:16,228
oh, that's funny, you're making props

364
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:17,909
for this Egypt level or whatever.

365
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:20,190
I had no idea we were gonna do an Egypt level.

366
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,471
And it just surfaces a lot of things

367
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:24,412
that might otherwise go under the radar.

368
00:23:25,223 --> 00:23:30,887
It's been my experience on both of the games we've made, which I think turned out pretty well overall,

369
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,250
but there are phases in development where a lot of people don't play the game,

370
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,493
even though they may like it or they may hate it or whatever,

371
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:41,815
there's just long stretches of game go by where people...

372
00:23:42,684 --> 00:23:48,888
get very busy on whatever, you know, their part of the game is and don't actually play the rest of

373
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:54,732
the game, so it can be helpful to force them to do that. And we used to have these dog fooding

374
00:23:54,772 --> 00:24:00,716
sessions where the team would eat its own dog food and for an hour or two everybody would play the

375
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:06,120
game themselves like at their desks and then we would have a meeting usually afterwards and

376
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,364
sometimes we would generate tasks. Often we would just chat about it and it sounds really stupid but

377
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:18,445
just having everybody play the game was a really good way of communicating what had

378
00:24:18,485 --> 00:24:21,827
changed about the game and what we were working on.

379
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:28,232
Also, similarly, getting everybody together to watch a playtest can be a good way to communicate

380
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:28,592
things out.

381
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:29,813
I mean, ideally people would know.

382
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,053
that you would add to this level or change this thing

383
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:35,255
before they see somebody actually playing it,

384
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,017
but that's a good kind of last stop for,

385
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:39,538
oh yeah, now that thing exists,

386
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,580
because I see it now, it's live.

387
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:45,784
And similarly, showing for the publisher,

388
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:48,086
they'll ask you to demo at various conventions.

389
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:52,550
That's a good place to get people in front of other players,

390
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,972
and especially later on in development.

391
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:56,756
you can get kind of jaded to the game

392
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:58,056
because you've been seeing it so long,

393
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:02,379
and getting a chance to see how happy new players are

394
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:04,880
with the things that you yourself have gotten very tired of

395
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,141
can be inspirational.

396
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:11,944
Also, even though there are a lot of times

397
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,445
where in our development process,

398
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,186
we have no idea what's going on,

399
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:20,589
we do have phases where we can make lists of like,

400
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:21,469
oh yeah, we need like,

401
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,244
300 things done, like for the art team.

402
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:25,905
I was like, I hear like 300 problems.

403
00:25:26,486 --> 00:25:29,508
And it feels really good to make that list

404
00:25:29,648 --> 00:25:33,211
and then see it go away and actually like chip away at it.

405
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,432
There's something that's very empowering

406
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:38,355
about crossing things off and seeing things get completed,

407
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:41,197
which when you're working on something

408
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:43,218
where you have this kind of broad direction,

409
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:47,462
but not a very specific roadmap for how to get there,

410
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:49,283
you don't have a lot of those opportunities.

411
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:49,663
So.

412
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:52,928
we would take advantage of things like E3, for example,

413
00:25:52,948 --> 00:25:55,971
or any time we had a big milestone build,

414
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:59,815
to turn that into this kind of smaller phase of certainty.

415
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:06,182
And rather than use the already really cumbersome, overloaded

416
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:07,963
task tracking tools that we all had,

417
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,405
that we'd been working with forever,

418
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:11,447
it was surprisingly powerful just

419
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:13,289
to open up a new document.

420
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:17,363
and say, all right, here's just the 200 items

421
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,124
that we're going to make today, and we're

422
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,024
going to see them all be done a week from now.

423
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:26,286
And we're just trying to balance the certainty and uncertainty.

424
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,207
OK, moving on to prototyping.

425
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:33,087
So once you have this sense of, OK, this

426
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:34,668
is going to be an interesting space to explore.

427
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:39,754
that creates a problem because there's so many ways to potentially explore it.

428
00:26:40,194 --> 00:26:43,156
And the prototypes are where the rubber meets the road,

429
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:47,879
and they're a way for the ideas to actually start talking back to you,

430
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:53,382
and to work with them in a very tangible way,

431
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:58,125
and to discover things often through repeated failure.

432
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:01,827
And in terms of what you're looking for, I think for us...

433
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:05,686
because we were venturing into these places

434
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:07,747
that we really had no idea like how,

435
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:11,388
like how a game about short stories, for example,

436
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:16,410
could work, by making a few of these examples

437
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,950
and then watching a bunch of people play it,

438
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:20,391
we kind of developed our own internal sense

439
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:22,292
of how these things would fit together.

440
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:26,834
And over time, there's a way in which the game itself

441
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:29,295
starts to kind of talk back to you.

442
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:36,774
Or another way of looking at it is that you've already made a lot of decisions intentionally or unintentionally,

443
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:39,996
and now you start to see the repercussions of those decisions.

444
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:43,999
And a lot of times those can be actually positive moments.

445
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,882
Like for us, two of the things that we discovered,

446
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:51,464
it wasn't that we planned these things, but just in watching playtests

447
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:55,387
that really changed the way the game ultimately feels.

448
00:27:55,939 --> 00:28:04,366
were, when we saw playtests, we found that a lot of players would get very focused on

449
00:28:04,626 --> 00:28:05,907
whatever their objective was.

450
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:09,870
That's kind of a traditional player behavior that is a little bit frustrating when you

451
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,833
might want them to open up and take their time and take a breath, but because it's

452
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:19,634
so ingrained in players to follow instructions,

453
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:22,656
we ended up making a number of stories

454
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:25,197
that are kind of about that process

455
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:28,038
of what happens when you get so focused on something

456
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,080
that you ignore everything else that's going on in your life

457
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,382
just because that's what we saw a lot of players

458
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,403
kind of were headed towards without us even pushing them.

459
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:48,017
We also had a very garden variety design problem of most games are about trying to prevent your death.

460
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:53,799
How do you make a game where death is inevitable but players don't feel like that's a sign of failure?

461
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,182
So we tried to make those moments feel a little more positive and in doing that,

462
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:05,865
we created these strange moments where players would march happily towards their death,

463
00:29:06,305 --> 00:29:07,165
which is something that...

464
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,780
we hadn't experienced ourselves in any other games

465
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,241
and felt like a very canonical Finchian moment for us.

466
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,041
So that became something that we found

467
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:20,862
in a couple of stories and really emphasized.

468
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:22,722
So it started as us just trying to solve

469
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:26,023
a particular problem and then ended up being something

470
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:29,144
that was more interesting and that we put more love into

471
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:31,685
than we'd expected.

472
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:35,085
Okay, jumping into some nuts and bolts,

473
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,226
prototyping tips from the trenches.

474
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:46,963
The first suggestion I have is 3x5 index cards are a really good way when you're dealing with a lot of ideas

475
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:53,029
To try to get other parts of your brain involved. So like a lot of this talk is really just about dealing

476
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:58,374
with this combination of complexity and confusion and the unknown,

477
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:03,419
and these note cards are one way that I personally have found really helpful.

478
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:09,065
Just drawing really, really crappy visual representations of whatever is...

479
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:16,388
Here I think it's like motifs in the game trying to figure out like what are the primary and what are secondary and what are bad

480
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:17,849
and

481
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:23,170
By making them visual it engages this other part of your brain

482
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:27,811
That is enormous like a huge part of our brain is dedicated to visual processing

483
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:32,453
But if it's something that you know, it's just in a tech document or in your head

484
00:30:33,173 --> 00:30:35,153
There's a limit to what that part of your brain can work on

485
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:40,291
like 7 plus or minus 2 is about the things you can keep in your head at any given time

486
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:44,034
but if you put it out into the world in some way

487
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,637
you can think about a few more things which is helpful

488
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:51,740
when you have a game that's about, in this case, like 13 different family members

489
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,262
here's another version of that

490
00:30:55,402 --> 00:31:00,625
in a spreadsheet form where I looked at this document like pretty much every day

491
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:05,787
for the last two years of the project. It's just a really terse summary of all

492
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:11,089
the different stories and what the order is and some of the different you know

493
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:14,231
values here like the gender of the story and trying to balance those things out

494
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:15,791
and just trying to kind of wrap my head around

495
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:19,080
what this whole game was going to feel like.

496
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,444
And obviously these pictures don't really look like the stories,

497
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:26,208
but they're enough of a shorthand that you can kind of imagine

498
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:30,412
what a whole game's worth might feel like and run through it in your head,

499
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,554
just by making it more visual.

500
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,658
Also, just a note about the brain.

501
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:40,593
I think it's really helpful to write down all of your ideas because if you don't,

502
00:31:40,993 --> 00:31:42,814
then your brain tends to hold on to them.

503
00:31:42,954 --> 00:31:46,295
I think your brain is like a second grader who's got their hand up

504
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:48,836
and really wants to tell you the answer.

505
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:51,137
But if you don't call on that second grader,

506
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:54,039
then eventually they just shut down.

507
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,320
I found a lot of the times a solution for

508
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,942
a problem would come when I was in the shower or doing something else.

509
00:32:01,637 --> 00:32:02,978
and not really thinking about it actively.

510
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:04,859
But the only way you get to that point, I think,

511
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:08,240
is if you reward your brain by saying, yeah, I'm listening to you.

512
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:09,621
I'm writing these things down.

513
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:12,363
Even these ideas don't seem like they're that great,

514
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:15,184
there's a power of just getting it out of your head also.

515
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:18,485
So even if it's not a great idea, it makes space

516
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:22,367
for something that might be coming up next that could be great.

517
00:32:23,348 --> 00:32:25,749
Also, even though game development is very collaborative,

518
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:28,010
I think early on, when you're making prototypes,

519
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,571
it can be really useful to just.

520
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:32,339
do everything on your own,

521
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,000
because as soon as you involve anyone else,

522
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,942
there's just like a lot of complexity that you're borrowing

523
00:32:37,362 --> 00:32:40,524
that can be really helpful if it's something very technical

524
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:42,666
that are difficult or, you know,

525
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,287
that you really don't know how to do,

526
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:47,589
but often you can get a lot of the way there

527
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,750
just knowing a little bit about a couple of programs,

528
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,312
like on Edith Finch, it's like a 3D modeling tool,

529
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:56,574
like a very basic knowledge of Unity,

530
00:32:56,994 --> 00:32:58,715
and some Photoshop is enough to get

531
00:32:59,387 --> 00:33:02,708
a lot of questions answered positively or negatively

532
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:05,609
before you go out to somebody else.

533
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,070
And then there's, you know, beyond that,

534
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,531
tons of things in game development

535
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:10,692
that you could be learning that are really useful

536
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:13,173
for making prototypes.

537
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,154
Also, when we make prototypes,

538
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:19,415
the very last phase is actually making the prototype itself.

539
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:24,698
A lot of time is spent kind of in the,

540
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:27,959
I don't know, like the phases where you're dreaming

541
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,080
about it in different ways.

542
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:35,484
So just like downloading a whole bunch of images and finding reference is a really great way of

543
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:41,392
getting your brain kind of spinning on possibilities, particularly with reference

544
00:33:41,432 --> 00:33:43,014
photos of real world things.

545
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,290
If you're doing a father-daughter camping trip in the 1970s,

546
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,172
you might stumble across an image of,

547
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:52,134
oh right, they had different kinds of cans

548
00:33:52,194 --> 00:33:53,554
for opening soda back then,

549
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:55,236
with little peel tabs and stuff

550
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:57,197
that you just wouldn't normally think about.

551
00:33:57,557 --> 00:34:01,920
But finding references can give you a lot of free ideas

552
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,663
and help you to think of things in different ways.

553
00:34:06,563 --> 00:34:09,445
We also did a lot of work in Unity,

554
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,247
even though the game itself was made in Unreal.

555
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:18,696
it's I think kind of nice to work in a completely different space because there's a lot

556
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:23,920
less pressure in some ways like it you know it's going to look really shitty if you did all of the

557
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,423
art and yet it actually like you know this particular case of the prototype for the swing

558
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:33,766
set story you know starts to get to a point where you can ask some you know valid troubling

559
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:36,668
questions about should this story have hands for example.

560
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,261
Should the rope be bending at all?

561
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:43,022
Should that rope instead be a chain?

562
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:45,682
A lot of questions that once you start

563
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:49,563
to get things moving at all, rear the ugly head

564
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:52,644
that might not have been visible

565
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:53,924
if you were just on a whiteboard.

566
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:56,565
And then the last thing we do is in-engine prototypes

567
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:58,445
because they're a little bit more heavyweight.

568
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:01,346
Okay, critically damped springs.

569
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:06,758
That's a one-dimensional mathy sort of value

570
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:10,200
for how you move something, basically like a real spring

571
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,583
that we used everywhere.

572
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:17,165
And particularly on cameras, places

573
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:19,186
where you want really smooth motion,

574
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:22,589
they're things that worked really well for prototyping

575
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:23,710
because they're so simple.

576
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,730
So I'll just talk.

577
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:28,178
really briefly about them, but here you can see on the top,

578
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:30,779
it's a box moving, you can see at the very end,

579
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,860
it just kind of clunks like that,

580
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,342
but a spring is just this tiny little piece of code,

581
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:40,224
and it feels much more expensive, much more magical.

582
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:43,446
And the other great thing about springs

583
00:35:43,686 --> 00:35:45,387
is that they're really easy to tune

584
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:46,727
because there's only two values,

585
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:48,488
like how springy they are,

586
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:52,010
and then whether or not they overshoot their target.

587
00:35:53,046 --> 00:35:54,907
So even though they look really nice,

588
00:35:55,408 --> 00:35:59,511
they are also really easy to adjust for designers

589
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,173
later on in the process.

590
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:06,397
And here's an example of taking just like a raw input,

591
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,719
like if you have the analog stick moving around.

592
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:10,721
Sometimes you want that snappiness,

593
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:13,703
but often it feels better if there's a little bit

594
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:17,407
of a delay, particularly with cameras.

595
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:20,009
So here's an example.

596
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:23,680
I think PowerPoint is a little slow there.

597
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,620
But yeah, so on the left, it's just what you get

598
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:27,761
if you listen to the stick.

599
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:29,702
And you say, OK, oh, they moved left.

600
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:29,982
Great.

601
00:36:30,182 --> 00:36:32,282
Moved the camera left that fast.

602
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:35,163
And you see a lot of Unity trailers

603
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:37,824
for games with cameras that look just like that.

604
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,265
They're very jerky.

605
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,466
And these springs are so simple.

606
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,086
They're just a couple lines of code,

607
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:46,827
and they start to feel much more like a finished product.

608
00:36:47,382 --> 00:36:48,682
And it doesn't have to be this floaty.

609
00:36:49,303 --> 00:36:52,264
This is closer to the Edith Finch floaty camera

610
00:36:52,284 --> 00:36:53,045
that I personally like.

611
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:56,247
But the nice thing about springs is that there's two values

612
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:57,447
and you can tune those knobs.

613
00:36:58,288 --> 00:37:00,529
And because we're making so many different prototypes,

614
00:37:01,129 --> 00:37:04,311
tools like these springs were really useful

615
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:06,332
because we could drop them into all kinds

616
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:08,293
of different scenarios and then still have something

617
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:11,375
that we could easily adjust the feel of.

618
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:15,157
And then music is another thing that.

619
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:19,569
was surprisingly useful for the prototypes that we made.

620
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:24,391
Partly because composers are really good at evoking feeling.

621
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:29,513
They are professionally obligated to listen to people,

622
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:32,975
ask them for something to be 20% more whimsical,

623
00:37:33,355 --> 00:37:35,195
and then have a cogent response to that.

624
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:38,797
They're much more professional than game developers in that way.

625
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,959
So our composer was really helpful when we had problems in certain stories

626
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:45,020
where it's like, yeah, it's close, but it's not.

627
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:53,378
quite there. It was a very surgical level of tuning at that point. And it's also

628
00:37:53,418 --> 00:37:59,259
something that is very practical to adjust later on, like as the door begins

629
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,940
to close and you get closer and closer to shipping, there's a lot of things that

630
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,360
you can no longer change. And everyone agrees that yeah, the game would be a lot

631
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,341
better if we could, you know, get rid of this thing or that or whatever, but like

632
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:14,342
we can't for memory reasons or, you know, because it's in this sensitive area.

633
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:17,883
But music is one of the things that's almost free, usually.

634
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:19,363
I mean, there's a little bit of streaming cost.

635
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,485
But in terms of technical complexity, it's very low.

636
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,106
And yet it has a very significant emotional impact.

637
00:38:26,506 --> 00:38:29,187
So for us, there were a few stories, like Swing said,

638
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:35,390
Gus's, Calvin's story, that made a really big impact on

639
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,150
and came in late.

640
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:39,172
But I think it's especially true for Gregory's story.

641
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:47,264
where we had four different gameplay programmers try to work on it and it just never felt right.

642
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:53,549
Like it felt too clunky and we got very focused on the mechanical aspects of it and it's a difficult

643
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:58,973
problem. Like you're doing kind of 3D platforming in a space where the camera is fixed, you're

644
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:02,235
Gregory in the scene like you're a baby, it's very hard to judge depth.

645
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:06,241
And so we spent a lot of time adjusting that and thinking about what should we be doing

646
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,202
and why does this not feel whimsical.

647
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:13,766
And I think the best answer, I mean, there were a lot of legitimate gameplay fixes that

648
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:18,788
came in that helped a lot, but in terms of the emotional feel of that story, just adding

649
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:23,911
the waltz of the flowers got us a lot of the way there.

650
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,702
Something that felt, you know, like people have associations with ballet

651
00:39:29,502 --> 00:39:35,064
Put us into the right mindset of being this kind of balletic frog jumping around a tub

652
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:44,708
Okay, playtests are a really nice phase because it's a way of moving out of this kind of forest of the unknown

653
00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:47,649
into a place of a lot of

654
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,250
practical and tractable

655
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,851
solutions and fixes so there are a lot of things that

656
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:58,483
don't have clear answers in the design process and you can stay up very late wondering like,

657
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:03,226
oh man, there's so many different ways we could do that. But on the other side, there are a lot

658
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:10,251
of issues that are quite amenable to just brute forcing, like pathing I think is a great example

659
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:11,312
of that, of if players...

660
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:15,445
you know, tend to... like you want them to go, say, right down a hallway,

661
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:16,646
but they keep going left,

662
00:40:17,046 --> 00:40:19,467
then it's something that you can just do a bunch of playtests

663
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:22,289
and keep making little adjustments to that.

664
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:24,630
Like, oh, maybe make this, you know, a little bit brighter,

665
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,832
maybe add a little bit of motion, or, you know, however many revolutions it takes.

666
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:31,933
If you just keep doing more playtesting, it's like turning the crank.

667
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:37,312
and things eventually get better, and it's really kind of comforting that there are phases

668
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:42,274
and aspects of development that are amenable to that because again a lot of times we spend

669
00:40:42,714 --> 00:40:49,717
floundering in places that are very murky, but playtests are a great place to just kind of not

670
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:53,939
worry about these problems. Like they may be legitimate issues like pathing and you know

671
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:56,940
people getting confused about something, but there's something that you can...

672
00:40:57,578 --> 00:41:01,339
just work hard enough on and it will eventually solve itself.

673
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,400
A few sort of specific takeaways.

674
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,061
When people who are playing get frustrated,

675
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:10,542
often they will have an idea about why they got frustrated

676
00:41:10,562 --> 00:41:12,983
and they'll have suggestions for what you should change

677
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:13,503
about your game.

678
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:15,383
Generally it's a bad idea to listen to them

679
00:41:15,503 --> 00:41:17,144
because they're unaware of.

680
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:19,366
what has led them to that state.

681
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:23,089
Often we would see players who would get very frustrated

682
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:25,612
if they, for example, if they're playing Molly's story

683
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,954
and they didn't catch any owls.

684
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:30,656
So they spent 20 minutes flying around

685
00:41:31,037 --> 00:41:33,719
trying to catch, as the owl trying to catch the rabbit.

686
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:38,202
And then they would complain about the next sequence of the game when you become a shark.

687
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,564
It's like, oh, the shark sequence is really boring.

688
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:46,788
It's like, well, it's only boring because you exhausted yourself in this sequence right before it.

689
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:50,110
But people usually aren't aware enough about that.

690
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,234
So, yeah, it's useful to listen to that they are upset,

691
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:59,697
but not usually helpful to listen to why they think they're upset.

692
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:05,444
In a first person game, it's also really helpful to look at where their camera is pointing.

693
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:11,027
You can kind of mind read a bit there and get a sense of what they're concerned about

694
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:12,528
or what they think is important in the scene.

695
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:16,650
Repeating anything tends to be kind of a death knell.

696
00:42:17,191 --> 00:42:22,034
I don't think of any genre where doing something a second time is going to pay off, but that's

697
00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:24,275
kind of the last step of desperate players.

698
00:42:25,516 --> 00:42:29,098
And then sometimes people have a lot of trouble with the game.

699
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:31,248
And it's because they're very dumb.

700
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:36,189
And it's kind of heartbreaking when you watch them play,

701
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,930
and like one of our play tests, someone spent,

702
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:42,071
I think like 20 minutes on the downstairs of the house,

703
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:44,631
a sequence that usually takes maybe two or three minutes.

704
00:42:45,692 --> 00:42:47,992
They went upstairs, they missed the part

705
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:49,873
they were supposed to go, they went downstairs,

706
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:51,233
they went upstairs again, downstairs,

707
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:53,934
and I think like the fourth time they found

708
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:54,794
the thing they were supposed to.

709
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:58,557
and I thought they'd be really upset, but they, whoops,

710
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,878
sorry, I was getting ahead of myself,

711
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:03,879
but they're actually really proud of themselves.

712
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:06,120
Oh yeah, no, I found my way through it.

713
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,821
And I think, you know, there are a lot of people out there

714
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:11,462
that just have trouble with life,

715
00:43:12,302 --> 00:43:16,864
and your game is like the latest manifestation of that,

716
00:43:17,404 --> 00:43:18,684
but it's not your fault.

717
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:22,026
So, you know, it takes a little bit of,

718
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:26,426
you know, detachment to say, like, okay, what's my bad?

719
00:43:26,866 --> 00:43:28,547
And what's just, like, their fault?

720
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:32,030
But if they're having a lot of trouble

721
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,351
and they're not upset about it,

722
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:35,132
that's not necessarily a bad thing.

723
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,274
That just might be, like, how they go through life.

724
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:42,638
So that, you know, takes an expert's eye to suss out.

725
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:49,403
And then we would alternate our playtests between doing kind of functional tests where we have one person

726
00:43:49,884 --> 00:43:55,709
playthrough with more what we called focus tests where we would have like up to five or ten people

727
00:43:56,149 --> 00:43:58,331
Play at any given time and those were really useful

728
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:06,238
I think for testing different things like the one person test was really good for very specific mechanical issues of like what might be confusing

729
00:44:07,121 --> 00:44:12,013
to a player where the larger tests were really good for more subjective, like how does it

730
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:12,735
kind of feel?

731
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:15,381
Do these things make sense from a narrative standpoint?

732
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:19,851
So doing a mix of those playtests worked well.

733
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:24,095
And I think about five players is probably as much as you need after that diminishing returns.

734
00:44:24,835 --> 00:44:30,981
Something that was also really helpful for us was doing batches of playtests at conferences like GDC

735
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:36,666
where you've got thousands of game developers from all over the world who were here for one week

736
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:39,848
and you can, you know, call them up ahead of time.

737
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:42,342
And a lot of people are really happy because they're already

738
00:44:42,382 --> 00:44:44,764
in town to come by your hotel room.

739
00:44:44,844 --> 00:44:46,905
So I think last year or the year before, we

740
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:52,068
had maybe 10 or 15 playtests with tons of really great game

741
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:56,651
developers in a single week that would have been very difficult

742
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,493
if we'd had to organize it in Los Angeles in the normal way.

743
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:04,036
And then just a note on frustration in particular

744
00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:07,778
is something that we focused on a lot with our playtests

745
00:45:07,979 --> 00:45:08,479
because.

746
00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:15,915
I think more than anything else, frustration kind of unravels all of the good work that you might be doing elsewhere.

747
00:45:16,355 --> 00:45:20,338
It's like the scene in The Matrix when Neo wakes up in this amniotic fluid.

748
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,961
It just completely rips you out of this world.

749
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:28,745
And it's something that can be difficult to get players back into.

750
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:35,151
So our fixes for that, a couple of them, where it was possible, things like dynamic difficulty.

751
00:45:35,171 --> 00:45:37,773
The owl was a case of that, where some players...

752
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,162
had a lot of trouble catching the rabbits.

753
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:43,803
And so if players failed a couple of times,

754
00:45:44,264 --> 00:45:48,965
then the radius of acceptable triggering

755
00:45:49,305 --> 00:45:50,345
got larger and larger.

756
00:45:50,365 --> 00:45:53,867
And that's something where we wanted to preserve,

757
00:45:54,147 --> 00:45:56,988
we didn't wanna make it too easy for all of the players,

758
00:45:57,008 --> 00:45:58,488
because I think some players really like

759
00:45:58,588 --> 00:45:59,788
to have a little bit of challenge,

760
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:02,029
and there certainly isn't that much of an Edith Finch.

761
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:04,390
So the places where we had challenge existing,

762
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,590
we kind of wanted to hold onto that.

763
00:46:06,071 --> 00:46:11,575
But there are some players that would spend 30 or 40 minutes, potentially, on those sections

764
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,737
that just felt like, wow, that was a terrible experience.

765
00:46:14,377 --> 00:46:18,180
Let's try to help the people that are having trouble without hurting the people that are

766
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:18,761
doing just fine.

767
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:20,322
So dynamic difficulty was a way to do that.

768
00:46:21,923 --> 00:46:28,168
There are a few places where there were two ways or more that made sense.

769
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:28,709
For example...

770
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:32,563
When players come to a ladder that's below them

771
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:38,448
They might press forward on the stick because they want to go like forward and down the ladder

772
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:43,853
Or it might make sense in their head to press down on the stick because they're going down a ladder

773
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:45,795
either of those kind of works

774
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:50,004
but what we ended up doing was supporting both of them.

775
00:46:50,124 --> 00:46:51,444
So when you get close enough to the ladder,

776
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:53,245
whatever direction you press,

777
00:46:53,325 --> 00:46:55,086
we assume you want to go down the ladder.

778
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:58,888
So we just adjust the kind of controls

779
00:46:58,948 --> 00:47:00,369
to conform to what players expect

780
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:01,910
and then everyone gets the experience of,

781
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,371
oh yeah, I just sort of expected it would work like that

782
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:08,073
and it did, rather than 50% kind of thinking it would work

783
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:10,694
and then being surprised that it works the other way.

784
00:47:10,754 --> 00:47:13,096
So if there's no reason it has to work one way,

785
00:47:13,116 --> 00:47:14,837
it can be nice to just,

786
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,875
Let it work the way that players imagine that it should.

787
00:47:18,656 --> 00:47:21,462
And then, even though there are some people that struggle,

788
00:47:21,742 --> 00:47:23,205
and I think it's fair to just say,

789
00:47:23,225 --> 00:47:25,208
like, ah, it's fine, you can struggle.

790
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,932
There are times where.

791
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,434
people will struggle and then never get through it.

792
00:47:32,535 --> 00:47:36,298
Places like, actually even in something as simple as the swing set story,

793
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:38,140
most players figure out,

794
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,022
okay, if I move my right stick, like that'll move my right leg,

795
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:42,263
and the left stick will move my left leg.

796
00:47:42,763 --> 00:47:45,025
But some players just never figured that out,

797
00:47:45,105 --> 00:47:47,888
because they got the feedback of moving one of the legs.

798
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:52,469
and they just got so focused on that leg that they never thought of moving the other leg.

799
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:57,250
So the fix for us was to, after I think it's like a minute or two,

800
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:03,692
we eventually spawned some little letters that swirl around the leg that you haven't moved

801
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:06,573
just to try to get people to kick that other leg.

802
00:48:07,253 --> 00:48:12,414
And I think that's something that, you know, it seems really stupid when you watch someone not figure it out

803
00:48:12,554 --> 00:48:14,435
when so many other people have had no trouble with it,

804
00:48:14,815 --> 00:48:16,615
but it's the kind of thing where...

805
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,863
everybody has those moments.

806
00:48:18,903 --> 00:48:20,584
I don't think you have to be too much of an outlier.

807
00:48:20,604 --> 00:48:23,485
But there are places where about 5% of the time,

808
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:26,006
people would just, not because they were necessarily

809
00:48:26,026 --> 00:48:28,207
being dumb, but it just didn't click with them.

810
00:48:28,808 --> 00:48:32,909
And for a game like Edith Finch, if you have 13 stories

811
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:36,011
or whatever, 5% failure rate on any of those stories

812
00:48:36,071 --> 00:48:37,811
is still, that's gonna add up over time.

813
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:40,252
So we tried to find places where if there was gonna be

814
00:48:40,613 --> 00:48:42,353
some kind of hard failure where people would get

815
00:48:42,493 --> 00:48:46,335
really, really stuck, we would lend a helping hand

816
00:48:46,535 --> 00:48:47,035
if they spent.

817
00:48:47,488 --> 00:48:49,289
a minute or two without moving forward.

818
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:51,050
And it's one of those cases too where

819
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,650
most people will never see that,

820
00:48:52,711 --> 00:48:53,631
and it won't bother them that,

821
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:55,712
oh, you're offering this little hint for something

822
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:56,652
when I could have figured it out.

823
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:59,033
But after a minute or two of not figuring out

824
00:48:59,073 --> 00:48:59,913
something very obvious,

825
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:04,415
just throwing them a bone helped move things along.

826
00:49:04,435 --> 00:49:07,056
And then the last tip is,

827
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:09,257
kind of part and parcel of this,

828
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:12,058
the difficulty of working with things

829
00:49:12,078 --> 00:49:13,158
that you don't understand,

830
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:14,659
is that it can be,

831
00:49:15,546 --> 00:49:20,409
Really effective to change a lot of things at the end when you do understand them

832
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:26,532
So I think at the end of the project you're at this point where you know

833
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:33,036
You've been struggling and suddenly things are kind of clear and you also have the ability to affect the changes you want

834
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:34,957
But there's not a whole lot of time

835
00:49:34,977 --> 00:49:39,980
Although hopefully by this point you do have a sense of what are the things that you can change without?

836
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,081
Breaking everything else so you can be a little bit more surgical

837
00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:46,020
Also, even though we did make a lot of changes,

838
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,281
it's a kind of rolling phase on the project

839
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,402
where as you get closer and closer,

840
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:54,484
then the scope of things that you can make changes to

841
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:55,624
does get smaller over time.

842
00:49:56,084 --> 00:49:58,866
But I just want to jump into a couple of specific cases

843
00:49:59,146 --> 00:50:01,207
of places where I think the game really benefited

844
00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:04,008
from the team continuing to be open

845
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:06,029
to embracing those kind of changes.

846
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:12,432
One of the bigger changes was a week before we did our final dialogue recording,

847
00:50:12,892 --> 00:50:18,695
we did our last pass on Edith VO and rewrote a huge chunk,

848
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:21,116
nearly half, I think, or more of what's in the game.

849
00:50:21,556 --> 00:50:24,378
Because we finally understood, kind of at a macro level,

850
00:50:25,178 --> 00:50:29,620
what the concerns were and what players were confused about.

851
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:31,641
And a lot of it came down to very simple things,

852
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:33,703
like just adding mom and uncle and like...

853
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:38,356
being very clear about the familial relationships.

854
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:42,239
So we changed a whole lot of dialogue

855
00:50:42,259 --> 00:50:44,080
in small ways at the end.

856
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:47,403
And we also, not quite at the very end,

857
00:50:47,463 --> 00:50:49,864
but a few months before we finished the game,

858
00:50:50,545 --> 00:50:51,605
we did our last bedroom.

859
00:50:51,665 --> 00:50:53,867
So we kind of worked in stages from the ground floor,

860
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:54,848
working up to the top,

861
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:59,631
and, or nearly last bedroom for Lewis's room.

862
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:02,133
And we decided to make him

863
00:51:03,401 --> 00:51:07,504
little bit more of a caricature like he's more of an overt archetype. He's

864
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:12,768
very much like a pothead and we had resisted doing that on earlier bedrooms

865
00:51:12,848 --> 00:51:14,329
because we really wanted these

866
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,047
family members to feel like distinct, real human beings and didn't want them to feel in any way

867
00:51:21,107 --> 00:51:27,393
cartoonish. But by the end, what we realized is that in order to understand someone, like if the

868
00:51:27,413 --> 00:51:33,619
challenge is understanding them from their bedroom, then a regular person generally would fail that.

869
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,645
Like I know my bedroom is not that expressive of who I am, and there's like a few details, but...

870
00:51:39,134 --> 00:51:46,059
It's nowhere near what Edith Finch needed to be in order for players to cruise through and in like a minute or two

871
00:51:46,499 --> 00:51:49,762
You know pull out a couple of high-level details about who that character was

872
00:51:50,742 --> 00:51:54,886
So for the very last bedroom, we finally realized like oh, right

873
00:51:54,906 --> 00:51:56,347
This is what we should have been doing the whole time

874
00:51:56,787 --> 00:51:59,269
And then we went back and redid every single other bedroom

875
00:51:59,989 --> 00:52:01,791
And a lot of the characters, like Barbara for example,

876
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:04,234
went from being just an actor,

877
00:52:04,294 --> 00:52:05,876
like someone who liked performing,

878
00:52:06,217 --> 00:52:07,718
to being a child star,

879
00:52:07,819 --> 00:52:09,981
which is like the more caricatured version of that,

880
00:52:10,342 --> 00:52:14,427
but also a lot easier to design that bedroom for

881
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:16,389
and have people understand immediately

882
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:18,732
who that character was.

883
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,363
And then, appropriately, the last thing to talk about

884
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:27,727
is the ending of the game, which took up a good year or so

885
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:31,109
of my life making terrible prototypes,

886
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:34,752
things that did seem promising,

887
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:35,872
and then just didn't coalesce.

888
00:52:36,293 --> 00:52:39,775
And we realized after a while that the problem was

889
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:42,197
essentially we were trying to write the last episode

890
00:52:42,237 --> 00:52:43,078
of The Twilight Zone.

891
00:52:43,478 --> 00:52:47,041
Like we had created all of these weird, bespoke,

892
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:48,281
unique stories.

893
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,678
and then we wanted something at the end that would kind of summarize all that

894
00:52:52,698 --> 00:52:56,023
and put a bow on it and that just doesn't really exist like

895
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:00,380
The last episode of Twilight Zone is called The Bewitching Pool, and it's terrible.

896
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:02,941
It doesn't really answer anything.

897
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:06,182
But that was the problem we had,

898
00:53:06,863 --> 00:53:10,004
and the solution for us ended up coming when

899
00:53:10,484 --> 00:53:12,905
we just kind of randomly had a request

900
00:53:13,445 --> 00:53:16,286
from our friend Jenova to come by and play the game

901
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:18,766
because he had a friend in town and didn't have anything to do with him

902
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,407
that weekend or that afternoon.

903
00:53:21,227 --> 00:53:22,268
So they came by and...

904
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,311
They played the game, I don't think there was an ending at that point,

905
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:30,074
but we talked about this problem that we had and then one of them said,

906
00:53:30,114 --> 00:53:32,416
well, you know, there's like a lot of death in this game.

907
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:35,638
What if, you know, the ending was something about a birth?

908
00:53:36,259 --> 00:53:37,520
It's like, oh, yeah.

909
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:40,828
that actually might work.

910
00:53:41,908 --> 00:53:45,210
And part of me was a little frustrated at that point,

911
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,591
because it's like, well, how did they see these things?

912
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:50,633
Who are these amazing people that

913
00:53:50,673 --> 00:53:52,894
can solve our problems for us?

914
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:56,876
And I think that the miracle here

915
00:53:56,996 --> 00:53:59,977
is really what it's like to be at the end of something.

916
00:54:00,178 --> 00:54:02,539
You go through all these confusing phases,

917
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:03,199
but

918
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,442
in the last stretch, you actually start to kind of,

919
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:10,525
like there are enough pieces there that someone can come in

920
00:54:11,226 --> 00:54:15,449
and ideally it would be you, but sometimes it's not enough

921
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:17,971
for you to make that, like you can't see it,

922
00:54:17,991 --> 00:54:19,892
you're too close to it, but someone else

923
00:54:20,853 --> 00:54:24,316
who's not been there for several years staring at it,

924
00:54:24,856 --> 00:54:26,918
it becomes immediately obvious that oh yeah,

925
00:54:27,058 --> 00:54:27,939
all these pieces are there.

926
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:32,142
So yeah, I think there's this kind of miraculous phase

927
00:54:32,322 --> 00:54:33,243
at the end of project.

928
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:38,812
where even if you've been working in the dark for years,

929
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:43,013
it helps to be flexible just a little bit longer,

930
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:45,454
and Edith Finch benefited a huge amount from that.

931
00:54:46,374 --> 00:54:50,015
It is really difficult on everybody to remain flexible

932
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:54,877
throughout that process, so huge thanks to everybody

933
00:54:55,037 --> 00:54:57,077
on the team for putting up with all that

934
00:54:57,317 --> 00:55:00,418
and being excited most of the time to keep

935
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:07,282
making those changes. It's also pretty rough on publishers, so thank you to all of our publisher

936
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:13,686
friends. And thanks to the press too. It's been amazing with Edith Finch to see that even a year

937
00:55:13,766 --> 00:55:18,609
after the game came out, people are writing articles on Edith's gloves. There's a whole

938
00:55:18,689 --> 00:55:23,933
article just on her gloves, and that level of detail has been really surprising and wonderful.

939
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:27,635
And then thanks obviously to everybody who's played the game and...

940
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,825
and really open themselves up to it and had very emotional experiences with the game that are,

941
00:55:33,845 --> 00:55:37,329
you know, it's a very collaborative effort on the part of the game developer and the player.

942
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:39,431
I mean, it only really works when people are coming to the game,

943
00:55:39,451 --> 00:55:42,875
you know, and being emotionally open to it, and we sincerely appreciate it.

944
00:55:43,543 --> 00:55:46,485
And then we're also in the very, very early stages

945
00:55:46,766 --> 00:55:49,869
on our next game, which is going to be super animation focused.

946
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:53,012
So if there's anybody out there who's an animator or an animation

947
00:55:53,032 --> 00:55:56,955
programmer or knows good people of those type,

948
00:55:57,236 --> 00:55:58,897
definitely let them know that we're looking.

949
00:55:59,518 --> 00:56:02,241
And I think we've got a few minutes left for QA.

950
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:04,243
So if there's any questions.

951
00:56:12,137 --> 00:56:14,039
Hey, great talk, thank you very much.

952
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,564
I had a question about your development process.

953
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:26,574
It seems very iterative and explorative and obviously no one has unlimited time and money

954
00:56:26,614 --> 00:56:27,355
to make a video game.

955
00:56:28,356 --> 00:56:29,117
So I've been wondering...

956
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,290
You talked a lot about exploring and prototyping.

957
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:36,033
Do you have any tips for when you have to stop

958
00:56:36,213 --> 00:56:38,274
and just execute on a plan?

959
00:56:39,255 --> 00:56:40,556
Or did you just time box it?

960
00:56:40,596 --> 00:56:41,937
Like, what's your technique there?

961
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:44,819
Yeah, I mean, our technique was to rely on our publisher

962
00:56:44,919 --> 00:56:45,720
to set milestones.

963
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,421
I mean, working with them.

964
00:56:47,942 --> 00:57:00,302
But I think that was one of the really useful aspects of that relationship that we would have things like E3 or like that green light trailer I showed for example was that was a publisher deciding I mean we we talked to them about the scheduling but

965
00:57:01,093 --> 00:57:02,914
I think it is really helpful to have milestones,

966
00:57:03,235 --> 00:57:05,396
and it would be very difficult if you didn't have

967
00:57:05,436 --> 00:57:07,438
a publisher forcing you to those milestones,

968
00:57:07,878 --> 00:57:10,240
but that kind of discipline would be really useful

969
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,183
just to say, okay, we're gonna show at this conference

970
00:57:13,223 --> 00:57:13,823
or do whatever.

971
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:16,685
Nothing really, I mean, it's kind of like the miracle

972
00:57:16,705 --> 00:57:17,486
at the end of the project.

973
00:57:17,546 --> 00:57:19,007
It's like that for every milestone,

974
00:57:19,428 --> 00:57:21,810
when you have this big goal, it gets everybody

975
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:25,473
kind of together working on achieving some nugget of it.

976
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:27,294
But yeah, I think it just comes down to,

977
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:30,336
you need little bits of crisis.

978
00:57:30,975 --> 00:57:34,939
to bring everything together and get all of the check-ins

979
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:37,562
submitted and integrated together,

980
00:57:37,582 --> 00:57:39,243
because otherwise you'd never ship.

981
00:57:39,343 --> 00:57:42,206
But yeah, look for any way you can add little bits of crises.

982
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:42,766
All right.

983
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:43,207
Thank you.

984
00:57:44,588 --> 00:57:47,671
So as a publisher, that terrified me.

985
00:57:48,191 --> 00:57:49,933
Looking at the talk, I'm like, oh, that's cool.

986
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:51,955
Every team uses their own tracking.

987
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,256
And it was just terrifying.

988
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:57,470
While the end product was amazing, was there sort of,

989
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,051
like you say there was milestones,

990
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:01,073
but was there elements of crisis as well where,

991
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:05,916
because it was not really formalized and kind of rough

992
00:58:06,036 --> 00:58:09,399
and kind of very sort of a humanistic process,

993
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:12,001
so was there elements of terror or,

994
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:14,183
was there bad parts of it as well, I guess?

995
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,244
Yeah, I mean there were definitely moments

996
00:58:16,384 --> 00:58:19,387
where the publisher was very concerned,

997
00:58:19,727 --> 00:58:22,089
both of the publishers, but I think,

998
00:58:23,859 --> 00:58:28,363
It's not like we were working in a vacuum and just kind of like in the dark the whole time.

999
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:32,487
Every week we would have new cool things that would come out of it.

1000
00:58:33,168 --> 00:58:37,532
So we could show the publisher, hey, we thought it was going to take us this long and we would have this thing,

1001
00:58:37,872 --> 00:58:40,675
but instead it's taking us this long and we have this other really cool thing.

1002
00:58:41,075 --> 00:58:44,038
So, yeah, I guess to answer your question, we...

1003
00:58:45,712 --> 00:58:51,556
We didn't always hit all of our milestones, but we did always find interesting things along the way.

1004
00:58:51,616 --> 00:58:55,938
And so I think that was somewhat comforting to the publisher to say like,

1005
00:58:56,018 --> 00:59:01,842
okay, well, it does feel like good progress is being made and it's not very predictable.

1006
00:59:02,242 --> 00:59:05,043
But the publishers also kind of understood going in that that was...

1007
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:09,782
part of the development process and kind of like what they were interested in making also.

1008
00:59:09,802 --> 00:59:13,486
It was like they had signed up to publish a game that nobody really understood.

1009
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:17,609
That's part of what was appealing about that, but that would not have worked if we were doing

1010
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:21,552
a Halo sequel or whatever, where there were much more

1011
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:22,693
fixed ideas.

1012
00:59:23,574 --> 00:59:28,198
Sorry, is there in the back?

1013
00:59:28,658 --> 00:59:31,921
Oh, you. Oh me? Okay, sorry.

1014
00:59:31,981 --> 00:59:32,882
Sorry about that.

1015
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:39,430
So you talked about your mood boards a lot and that kind of interests me and I was wondering

1016
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:44,194
how much they evolved throughout the project and or were they just kind of like a were they like

1017
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:49,138
your base of like it was like a stone for you guys or was it more fluid?

1018
00:59:49,759 --> 00:59:54,083
Uh we didn't continue to make mood boards per se I think that was an early phase like it takes

1019
00:59:54,843 --> 00:59:59,648
a while you know to put all those things together and look at them but we did something very similar

1020
00:59:59,848 --> 01:00:02,570
where like Chris our level designer would put together

1021
01:00:03,053 --> 01:00:07,376
you know, like a couple pages of a bunch of different photos and ideas and

1022
01:00:07,436 --> 01:00:11,999
references for, you know, kind of like what a middle school girl might make for

1023
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:16,783
a crush, or just like all these cool ideas about a thing and put them

1024
01:00:16,843 --> 01:00:21,166
together a little bit more structured in Chris's defense. But yeah, so they weren't

1025
01:00:21,186 --> 01:00:25,649
like mood boards per se, but they were kind of in that vein when they were

1026
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:29,292
really helpful when design needed to communicate something to art was usually

1027
01:00:29,372 --> 01:00:30,493
where they would come into play.

1028
01:00:30,903 --> 01:00:34,005
Okay, so the mood boards were more like, I mean, what you started with then?

1029
01:00:34,265 --> 01:00:38,407
Yeah, yeah, that was more like, what is this feeling that we're thinking about?

1030
01:00:38,447 --> 01:00:41,829
Like, what are the kind of tent poles that we think are important here?

1031
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:47,253
But we didn't keep making them in the same way that we didn't keep making, like, a game design document for the whole game.

1032
01:00:47,273 --> 01:00:52,316
That was something like, initially you take a pass at it, and then the game itself becomes the document eventually.

1033
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:53,256
Awesome, thank you.

1034
01:00:53,436 --> 01:00:53,576
Sure.

1035
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:55,117
Hi.

1036
01:00:56,078 --> 01:00:58,779
So in a game like this that it's very...

1037
01:00:59,944 --> 01:01:04,928
abstract and with a lot of feeling-based design ideas.

1038
01:01:05,148 --> 01:01:09,212
How do you manage to balance keeping the vision

1039
01:01:09,352 --> 01:01:11,034
that you have as a creative director

1040
01:01:11,194 --> 01:01:15,258
and not micromanaging the team and giving some freedom

1041
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,780
to the team to develop their own ideas?

1042
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,081
Oh yeah, I don't know if I have.

1043
01:01:19,181 --> 01:01:20,643
That's not really a question that I can answer

1044
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:25,147
one way or the other, but I feel like the attempt

1045
01:01:25,675 --> 01:01:30,036
was to try to define things, I guess,

1046
01:01:30,757 --> 01:01:34,898
in very specific kind of directions of like,

1047
01:01:34,978 --> 01:01:36,759
okay, we want it to feel like this,

1048
01:01:36,879 --> 01:01:38,419
but not necessarily prescribed.

1049
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:39,820
This is how we get there.

1050
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,700
But, you know, to leave things open.

1051
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,401
Like, I think coming up with three words

1052
01:01:43,481 --> 01:01:44,841
is a good example of a place where,

1053
01:01:44,861 --> 01:01:47,402
you know, you can be specific about what you're looking for,

1054
01:01:47,962 --> 01:01:49,683
but, you know, not being too prescriptive.

1055
01:01:49,723 --> 01:01:50,763
And I guess that just, you know,

1056
01:01:50,803 --> 01:01:54,145
comes down to really like defining the task and...

1057
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,241
hopefully leaving enough room there.

1058
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:59,061
But I mean, I think as a creative director,

1059
01:01:59,081 --> 01:02:00,642
one of the things that I've struggled a lot with

1060
01:02:00,722 --> 01:02:02,282
is people that don't want that freedom.

1061
01:02:02,482 --> 01:02:04,263
Like that's, I think it's easier

1062
01:02:04,323 --> 01:02:06,163
when people really are excited

1063
01:02:06,303 --> 01:02:08,384
about putting their own stamp on something,

1064
01:02:08,484 --> 01:02:11,024
like assuming that they understand what the goals are.

1065
01:02:11,404 --> 01:02:13,285
But I think a lot of times people on the team,

1066
01:02:13,545 --> 01:02:14,725
especially in our art department,

1067
01:02:15,445 --> 01:02:17,986
they really just wanted to be told what to make,

1068
01:02:18,046 --> 01:02:19,066
which is quite surprising.

1069
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:23,007
So I think more so than like the challenge of...

1070
01:02:23,779 --> 01:02:31,261
Giving people creative freedom. It's the challenge of understanding. What kind of freedom people really want and then giving that to them

1071
01:02:32,601 --> 01:02:32,902
Thank you

1072
01:02:33,222 --> 01:02:36,443
In the back hi

1073
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:41,324
So you said don't give them the gun right?

1074
01:02:43,483 --> 01:02:48,525
And I understand that part of the feeling that you're trying to evoke, you said, is

1075
01:02:48,925 --> 01:02:53,307
sort of being overwhelmed and so you're constantly presenting these new gameplay ideas to the

1076
01:02:53,347 --> 01:02:55,608
player, and that helps you tell the story.

1077
01:02:56,328 --> 01:03:05,852
So how deep and complex of a mechanic could you present before you'd say it starts to

1078
01:03:06,192 --> 01:03:08,653
distract from your ability to tell a story?

1079
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:15,245
Yeah, it's a good question, I guess.

1080
01:03:15,345 --> 01:03:19,109
Because I noticed it was part of your design philosophy, but it was also part of your emotional message.

1081
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:24,074
So it's like when you design another thing with another emotional message, can you make deeper mechanics?

1082
01:03:24,955 --> 01:03:25,936
Or will you lose your player?

1083
01:03:26,396 --> 01:03:32,223
Yeah, I mean we tended to, for our prototypes, settle on fairly simple mechanics.

1084
01:03:32,263 --> 01:03:35,306
In some ways, you know, like they feel embarrassingly simple.

1085
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:42,814
And, you know, like Lewis is a good example of a mechanic that initially was very complicated

1086
01:03:42,894 --> 01:03:46,556
when we were on the whiteboard describing how fish chopping should work,

1087
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,498
and there was going to be a boss who was going to come around,

1088
01:03:49,518 --> 01:03:52,580
and there were going to be fish that you didn't want to chop, and fish that you did.

1089
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:59,484
And what we found was just like in playtesting it, the player's focus was so divided.

1090
01:03:59,584 --> 01:04:02,706
So in that particular story, there just wasn't a lot of...

1091
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:09,765
bandwidth. So I guess, you know, in answer to the question, we just would like try something and then we would see how much

1092
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:14,749
emotional kind of headspace the player had and trying to be conscious of

1093
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:20,133
the things that are taking from that stockpile. Like there's like a limited amount of

1094
01:04:20,793 --> 01:04:26,157
emotional attention that a player can give and on Edith Finch one of the things we were surprised about was when we would do the

1095
01:04:26,217 --> 01:04:31,561
longer play tests, the people playing the game, you know, beginning to end, that when they came into a story

1096
01:04:32,094 --> 01:04:33,094
they weren't even really fresh.

1097
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:35,555
Like, they were still thinking about the story before

1098
01:04:35,615 --> 01:04:36,656
and the story before that.

1099
01:04:36,996 --> 01:04:40,577
And so, you know, in testing them in isolation,

1100
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:42,258
we would have a different experience from someone,

1101
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:43,438
you know, playing it all the way through.

1102
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:47,760
So, like, in our case, we tried to encourage players

1103
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,341
to stop after stories.

1104
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:50,901
Like, we would open the family tree,

1105
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:52,382
and Edith would talk a little bit

1106
01:04:52,442 --> 01:04:53,542
and, you know, do a little drawing,

1107
01:04:54,022 --> 01:04:56,924
just as a way of getting some of that attention back,

1108
01:04:57,964 --> 01:04:59,885
because the stories for a lot of players

1109
01:04:59,925 --> 01:05:01,405
are kind of emotionally draining.

1110
01:05:02,446 --> 01:05:04,648
So it wasn't that we were like designing

1111
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:08,711
like complicated things to a certain level of complexity

1112
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,091
that we thought would be appropriate for the game.

1113
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:11,733
It was more like just being...

1114
01:05:11,753 --> 01:05:12,673
Like an emotion budget.

1115
01:05:13,093 --> 01:05:16,316
Yeah, yeah, like taking the temperature in playtests

1116
01:05:16,476 --> 01:05:18,797
and trying to figure out what kind of made sense.

1117
01:05:18,997 --> 01:05:20,538
And in our case, it's kind of embarrassing

1118
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:24,621
how simple we could make things and get away with it

1119
01:05:24,661 --> 01:05:26,543
where no one complains that fish chopping

1120
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:27,943
needed to be more complicated

1121
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,065
because it's not really about the fish chopping.

1122
01:05:31,283 --> 01:05:35,025
that is getting you to something else and you're thinking about all these other things

1123
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:37,566
and our job is to kind of set the table for you

1124
01:05:37,586 --> 01:05:41,168
in this game anyway, that it was more about

1125
01:05:41,928 --> 01:05:44,930
this context and creating that than it was about

1126
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,931
digging really deeply into a particular mechanic.

1127
01:05:49,072 --> 01:05:50,132
Okay, thank you so much.

1128
01:05:50,152 --> 01:05:55,975
Hi, thanks for a great talk and for making a game where fish shopping is the central mechanic.

1129
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:56,856
You're welcome.

1130
01:05:56,896 --> 01:05:58,357
That was amazing, I love that sequence.

1131
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,498
So my question is...

1132
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:04,502
Was there any prototype that you really, really loved,

1133
01:06:04,562 --> 01:06:06,163
but that didn't make it into the game

1134
01:06:06,203 --> 01:06:07,164
because it didn't fit?

1135
01:06:08,384 --> 01:06:11,206
Um, there wasn't anything that I'm heartbroken about.

1136
01:06:11,226 --> 01:06:14,268
I mean, there are stories that we tried really hard on,

1137
01:06:14,469 --> 01:06:16,230
like a story where you lean back

1138
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:17,891
and then look at the world upside down

1139
01:06:17,931 --> 01:06:19,112
and things fall away from the earth,

1140
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:21,253
where we spent a long time.

1141
01:06:21,373 --> 01:06:24,115
But I think we got really good after a while,

1142
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:28,818
painful lessons of realizing what we as a team did well

1143
01:06:29,098 --> 01:06:30,860
and what was just kind of like...

1144
01:06:31,353 --> 01:06:36,635
I think there are some stories that work right away, and it feels like you're bicycling downhill.

1145
01:06:37,056 --> 01:06:41,538
And then other stories, even though they may seem really cool, you just find even after,

1146
01:06:41,558 --> 01:06:45,700
you know, a couple of days of prototyping, it's like you're pedaling uphill. And you're like,

1147
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,361
wow, this is really fun, but I don't know if I want to keep pedaling for six months.

1148
01:06:49,342 --> 01:06:52,563
So nothing that is like, oh, if only we had time. I mean,

1149
01:06:53,044 --> 01:06:57,386
Lewis's story and Gregory's story almost got cut. So those would have been like, oh, man.

1150
01:06:58,376 --> 01:07:00,058
Yeah, I really wish we had these stories.

1151
01:07:00,439 --> 01:07:01,981
You wouldn't believe what we had.

1152
01:07:02,341 --> 01:07:04,884
But no, nothing that I regret too much.

1153
01:07:05,785 --> 01:07:06,085
Thank you.

1154
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:06,486
Sure.

1155
01:07:07,147 --> 01:07:08,789
OK, last question, I think.

1156
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:13,935
I really loved what you said about discovering

1157
01:07:13,975 --> 01:07:16,478
what the game wants to be through the prototyping process.

1158
01:07:17,232 --> 01:07:23,573
I'm curious if you had any situations where in early prototyping you had sort of like variations

1159
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:28,954
on a theme like different prototypes that tested well that fit within the overarching story but

1160
01:07:29,014 --> 01:07:33,575
were like directly in competition with one another that sort of like pulled it in different directions

1161
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:38,976
but felt equally compelling to you as designers and if you had that situation do you have any

1162
01:07:39,016 --> 01:07:44,698
best practices for kind of like sifting through the data and figuring out what to up-res?

1163
01:07:45,485 --> 01:07:52,210
Yeah, I don't think we had any prototypes where we liked both of them and they were like competing with each other.

1164
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:56,673
Usually it was more the case of like, like the pedaling downhill thing.

1165
01:07:56,693 --> 01:08:01,396
I'm like, oh, well, this is clearly like a story that we should be doing more of.

1166
01:08:01,576 --> 01:08:03,798
And this other one, you know, is really frustrating.

1167
01:08:03,978 --> 01:08:06,380
But I mean, certainly looking back on the original design,

1168
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:09,702
it seems crazy that we would have spells or combat or things like that.

1169
01:08:09,742 --> 01:08:12,204
But we never really got that far into it.

1170
01:08:12,244 --> 01:08:12,444
I think.

1171
01:08:13,158 --> 01:08:16,619
we just kept, you know, we made this pile of ideas

1172
01:08:16,639 --> 01:08:20,900
and then we would take the most interesting idea off the top of it for the next prototype.

1173
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:25,201
So we just kept, you know, kind of sorting that pile

1174
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:28,442
and if we had been making prototypes from the middle of the pile or the bottom,

1175
01:08:28,822 --> 01:08:31,242
you know, like the spellcasting ideas that we had,

1176
01:08:31,282 --> 01:08:34,523
like I'm sure we would have run into, you know, more conflictory stuff.

1177
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:39,604
But I think just the evolutionary process of what should we work on next

1178
01:08:40,084 --> 01:08:41,425
was enough to weed out...

1179
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:48,318
a lot of the conflicting ideas. We also, early on, like our first two prototypes, like the large ones,

1180
01:08:48,398 --> 01:08:53,124
ended up being the largest, most complicated stories we have in the game. Molly's story and

1181
01:08:53,144 --> 01:08:59,491
Lewis's story. So in terms of like how we prototype things, we kind of made stories that we really

1182
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:00,432
liked, but...

1183
01:09:00,962 --> 01:09:06,806
were in hindsight like insane that it would not just be like one mechanic but oh my god there's

1184
01:09:06,826 --> 01:09:11,368
like five different animals that you get to be in this story and you know these like stories

1185
01:09:11,388 --> 01:09:15,871
that were combinations where we kind of got away from that from a production standpoint but I mean

1186
01:09:15,891 --> 01:09:20,633
it's nice that we had them because we could take those and eventually ship them but we could only

1187
01:09:20,653 --> 01:09:24,415
do that because we'd started them really early and we had years and years to keep working on

1188
01:09:24,435 --> 01:09:26,397
those stories we couldn't have continued to make

1189
01:09:27,015 --> 01:09:29,857
Prototypes like that so in that way like they were successful

1190
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:34,660
We like those stories, but they were all the cautionary tales of like let us never do this again

1191
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:39,323
We can you know we have space for two of these in our hearts, but that is all

1192
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:40,824
Thank you

1193
01:09:40,845 --> 01:09:43,686
All right, I think that
