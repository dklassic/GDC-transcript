1
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:08,707
All right, everybody ready?

2
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:10,148
Welcome.

3
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:12,690
Please silence your cell phones.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,392
And yeah, I think we're ready to get started.

5
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:18,595
So there's going to be talk on how

6
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,777
we created the prototype for Edith Finch

7
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:25,420
and then how those evolved into the broader game itself.

8
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:29,183
And this is the team at one snapshot.

9
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:32,786
We started the game with three people on the team

10
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,248
and then grew to about 15 and then tapered off.

11
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:42,661
Towards the end, so it's sort of a medium-sized team, not too small, but certainly not AAA.

12
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:48,185
The game itself, for those who don't know or it's been a while, is a collection of short stories.

13
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:54,250
And each of the short stories has a totally different game mechanic,

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,295
different from the rest of the stories in the game, but then also hopefully different from anything else players have ever experienced.

15
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:04,378
The game is an attempt to...

16
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:22,745
Try to keep players in this kind of beginners mind of never quite understanding what it is that the game is about. So they're always going to feel like they're discovering new things as they move forward. So we did a lot of prototype for each of these stories and each of the prototypes also had the constraint that.

17
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:27,085
There are no tutorials in the game, because the game is about this sense of discovery.

18
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:33,068
So we wanted to create things that people had never seen before, but also things that were discoverable.

19
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:38,831
That people could learn how to progress by playing the game.

20
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:48,757
And instead of focusing on traditional goals, like a challenge, this game is focused on evoking a feeling.

21
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,678
In that case, it's the feeling of the sublime.

22
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:55,726
talk about in a minute. Here's a quick trailer.

23
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:36,712
Alright. So, that's the game, and in this talk I'll be beginning with the kind of high-level

24
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,976
approach to how we approach

25
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:57,425
The overall design for emotions and then talk about how we figure out which emotions we're going to be focusing on in the particular game we're making and then get into the nuts and bolts of actually making those prototypes that try to evoke those feelings.

26
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,167
All of these kind of tie into.

27
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:13,049
The problem of how do you make something when you yourself are kind of a little unsure about it, which is part of the appeal as a developer that we're making things that we ourselves are kind of actively exploring and.

28
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:18,119
The games that we make tend to be themselves about a sense of exploration,

29
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,921
because that's kind of what the game development process for us is like.

30
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:27,707
The development process of Edith Finch is kind of a worst-case scenario of going in blind,

31
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:33,452
but hopefully a lot of these things will seem somewhat familiar for games you might be working on,

32
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:37,615
where there are at least a few aspects that are not very well sussed out.

33
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:42,780
But hopefully you know a little bit more about your game than we did when we started making it.

34
00:03:43,854 --> 00:03:48,297
So starting off, just to give you kind of a philosophical perspective,

35
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:55,481
my sense of the way that the games work and stories and emotion and the difficulty there

36
00:03:55,761 --> 00:04:02,646
is that it really boils down to attention and what you can expect players to be focused on.

37
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:07,329
And it's difficult in games because there are a lot of things that are going on

38
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:12,392
compared to a play where people are generally like pretty much sitting or going to the bathroom.

39
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:15,856
One of those two things for the duration of the performance.

40
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:21,037
But in games, the problem isn't just your game,

41
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:25,759
it's every other game that players have experienced coming into it in their lifetime

42
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:33,321
has kind of trained them to approach the experience of the game often as a life-or-death situation.

43
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,682
Usually, you know, if you stand in one spot for too long,

44
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:40,903
you will be destroyed in a lot of games and genres.

45
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:42,456
or you will lose or whatever it is.

46
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:46,578
So players aren't used to taking their time.

47
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:49,559
They're not used to stopping to take a breath.

48
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,860
They actually have to be encouraged to do those things.

49
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,462
So we try to create a space that evokes that feeling

50
00:04:57,522 --> 00:05:00,743
and kind of encourages them to approach it differently

51
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:03,205
than they would a more traditional game.

52
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:04,805
So this is kind of our...

53
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:15,200
high-level plan of attack, which is that we start off by not giving them, hopefully, too many distracting toys.

54
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,561
I mean, we try to balance it. There are times in the game where you become a giant tentacle monster eating sailors.

55
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:28,262
But those are not the same moments where we're trying to get you to pay a lot of attention to a specific area.

56
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:34,323
We alternate these very small scenes with broader, sillier moments.

57
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:45,766
And then, yeah, in a nutshell, what we are trying to do is to create interesting spaces and tools to explore those spaces.

58
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:49,829
And those tools are the gameplay prototypes that we'll be talking about a little bit later.

59
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:56,956
And instead of relying on an explicit story and, you know, setting up...

60
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:04,804
Character and conflict and plot, in words, dialogue, we try to do as much as we can just with the environment itself.

61
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:11,665
Ideally it's something that, you know, it's like a silent film where you don't need any audio or text in the beginning.

62
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:21,587
Just the experience of being in that space already gets you to ask questions as a player and wonder like what might be happening

63
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:26,208
and get you into the the mood of it and it's a lot easier and more reliable.

64
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,804
Because players don't have to pay attention to context, it's something that they can absorb through osmosis.

65
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:39,809
And instead of starting, again, with a written, more didactic story,

66
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:45,853
we start with a very broad goal of evoking a certain kind of feeling.

67
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:49,435
And what we found is that when we start with something that is...

68
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:55,490
a little more open-ended like that, even though there's a lot more uncertainty, it's something

69
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,374
that actually has a good chance of making it to the finish line, because games tend to go through

70
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:07,521
a lot of changes as you realize how many of your initially sound seeming ideas aren't going to

71
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,242
work for a number of reasons. But when you...

72
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:12,982
hold on to a little bit of uncertainty and you bring it with you,

73
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:20,364
you know, that gives you enough room to actually preserve the original intent even though

74
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:26,806
what ends up at the end is not what you would have expected, but it is, you know, if it's something like a feeling,

75
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:32,228
there's a good chance that that's gonna carry through. In the case of Eda Finch, the game began as

76
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:35,569
a way for me to

77
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:43,522
explore a particular moment that I had in my own childhood when I was scuba diving as a teenager and

78
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:51,626
saw the bottom of the ocean sloping away into like a seemingly infinite darkness and that moment where something was simultaneously

79
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:53,007
very beautiful, but also

80
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:54,027
unsettling

81
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,989
Which in a word is like the sublime in this moment where you you feel

82
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,951
You know the transcendent beauty of the universe, but also you yourself, you know

83
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:10,048
Acknowledged to be very small and a fragile part of that and so this game was trying to explore that initially it began

84
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:11,749
You know by literally

85
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:15,891
Remaking that teenage scuba diving experience more or less

86
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:20,694
And then I just like it was way too gamey and didn't actually feel like

87
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:27,057
What was in my head and so it went off in a obviously very very different tangent

88
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:32,500
and then once we have a better understanding of

89
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,086
that particular feeling, which is the next thing I'll talk about.

90
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,769
Then we move on to making prototypes,

91
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:41,012
because those prototypes are the most difficult part of the whole process

92
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:44,915
and have the most emergent complexity

93
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:48,839
and changes that arise out of the process of making them.

94
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,143
Story comes in, like we begin with the best effort

95
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,525
at the very start of like, yeah, okay, we think...

96
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,941
These are the characters and this is roughly what's going to happen.

97
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:01,082
It's going to be a story of a family, for example, in this case.

98
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,244
We knew that it was going to be centered around Edith.

99
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:13,031
But we found it a lot easier for us to rewrite everything once we had the experiences,

100
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,692
which is like a classic chicken-eating problem.

101
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:18,655
But we would...

102
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,643
have people play the game as it existed in a more or less complete prototype,

103
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:26,265
and then ask them about how it felt to play the game,

104
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:28,507
and then write more to that experience.

105
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:33,832
So instead of trying to make an experience that tracked with the story,

106
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:39,336
we just adjusted the story to track better with what the prototype was that we had made.

107
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:43,640
Okay, next up is finding that.

108
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:48,930
feeling in this case, you know, we started with a sense of sublime, but it, you know, had to get a little bit more detailed.

109
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,834
And then the challenges of, you know, once you have that idea, how do you communicate that to the rest of the team?

110
00:09:57,115 --> 00:10:03,898
So, for game development purposes, I think it's helpful to boil down things into

111
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:10,822
a couple of very concrete ideas. Ideally, in the case of Edith and Angelique, we had three words,

112
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:13,824
sublime, intimate, and murky. And the hope was that

113
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:23,523
These were feelings that anybody on the team could look to for inspiration for how to do whatever it was that they were engaged in that day.

114
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:35,276
So, you know, the lighting artists, you know, might be working on like the fog or, you know, an animator might be working on jump animation, whatever it is that they could look and say like, oh, is there a way that I can make this a little bit more intimate or more murky?

115
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,171
And even before anything has actually been checked into Perforce,

116
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:45,392
people have this collective sense of what this might feel like,

117
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:46,632
and there's going to be divergences.

118
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:49,293
But that's part of the appeal also,

119
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:52,954
when you have something that is powerful and specific,

120
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:54,434
but also a little bit open-ended.

121
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:58,255
It provides a space for everybody else to...

122
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:03,489
contribute their own perspective on these things and add to the richness of the game

123
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:07,330
without hopefully pulling too much in opposite directions.

124
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:15,233
And then once you've kind of settled in on the feeling, I think it's really helpful to

125
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:21,915
try to find as many really good examples of that in other mediums, kind of as a way for you to

126
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:26,117
almost like play the game in your head years before you ship it.

127
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:38,598
In our case, there was a genre of literature called weird fiction that, like Neil Gaiman and H.P. Lovecraft and a bunch of other folks have written really good stories about the sublime.

128
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:45,820
And a lot of weird fiction deals with the challenges of being in a universe that is stranger than you can possibly imagine.

129
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:55,142
And so those were really useful tools for us to, you know, kind of imagine what it would feel like to play the game by reading it.

130
00:11:55,712 --> 00:12:00,293
Also, soundtracks are great because people have already done the work of saying,

131
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:04,494
you know, what does it feel like for this, you know, like in the case of Edith Finch,

132
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:10,456
things like Donnie Darko or Under the Skin, you know, movies that were tonally in that ballpark.

133
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:17,238
What might that sound like? And so for a lot of the project, I just had a couple of those soundtracks,

134
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,240
like on repeat, and it was a way of kind of getting into this alternate headspace

135
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,821
and kind of dreaming in that place.

136
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:24,841
Also...

137
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:30,512
Just printing out a whole bunch of references was really helpful and sticking them up all over the office.

138
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:34,974
Engaging the visual part of your brain, which I'll talk about a little bit later.

139
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:42,436
And then similarly, updating your Windows or Macintosh desktop background is a nice thing.

140
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,277
Just to kind of put it right in the middle of your face.

141
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:49,939
So here's the game that we're working on next.

142
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,360
That's a little preview.

143
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,532
And, oh, we're out.

144
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:00,952
OK.

145
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,513
And, OK, here's our first mood board.

146
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,953
This was, I don't know, maybe like three or four months

147
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:12,514
into development of the project, when we still

148
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:14,934
thought there would be magic and combat.

149
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:17,155
And I don't know, like Edith was going to take words

150
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:19,455
and put them together and make spells.

151
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:21,595
This is like a nightmare.

152
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:23,236
It was a totally different game.

153
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:24,876
It had a different name.

154
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,809
It never would have shipped, but this is what it would have looked like.

155
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:32,531
And it actually looks kind of like a game we did ship, called Watermans of Edith Finch.

156
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:39,474
And I think it's just like the power of having these, you know, kind of specific but

157
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:46,078
somewhat open-ended tonal goals. So we didn't ship a story about a microscope, you know, but

158
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:51,201
there is a lot of underwater elements and certainly the forest in those lighting conditions are

159
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:54,302
things that are not too far away from from what we did ship.

160
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:58,857
And then next I'm going to show a green light trailer

161
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:01,339
that we made, I think about four months in,

162
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,664
that is kind of a moving version of this mood board.

163
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:09,606
None of these things actually shipped,

164
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:14,530
but they're what we were imagining the game.

165
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,872
I don't know, maybe some of those books.

166
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:18,720
I think some of those books might have been in the game.

167
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,042
You can see it's a little more haunted housey than the real game,

168
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:27,046
but there is still a sense of this very large house that you'll be exploring.

169
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:32,991
And a little bit of underwater stuff still clinging to that original scuba diving inspiration.

170
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:37,294
Here's an invisible dog that we thought would be a good idea.

171
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:44,580
We went back and forth a lot on how puzzly the game would be, and for various reasons.

172
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,753
The game could have had more of those delightful physical interactions,

173
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:53,515
but they're just really hard and they weren't where our heart was when it came down to it.

174
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:59,520
But this is really weird. We had an underwater sequence in the shipping game,

175
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,263
an underwater house that we completely forgot about for several years,

176
00:15:04,324 --> 00:15:07,966
but it was there. Four months in, we had this underwater house,

177
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,647
and I think it just speaks to...

178
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:15,102
The game being about this combination of civilized and natural spaces.

179
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:18,265
This also did not actually ship.

180
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:20,487
But it's a nice idea.

181
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:24,450
And so yeah, what you're looking for, or what we're looking for,

182
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:29,715
is a sense of where you're going, but I don't think you really want a map.

183
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:33,898
I mean, the producers probably want a map. It would be easier to work with.

184
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:36,540
But it's really hard to make maps, for one.

185
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:39,283
And they quickly become inaccurate.

186
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:41,068
and need to be maintained.

187
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:46,390
And it's easier and it's more fun to just pick a direction.

188
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,571
And it also puts you into places where you can't predict

189
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:51,772
where you're going to be, which I

190
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:56,673
think is part of what made Edith Finch such a strange

191
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:59,594
experience, is that we could not have expected that that's

192
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:00,355
where we would end up.

193
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:03,676
We only found our way there because we set off

194
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:07,737
in a direction and just kept marching for a lot of years.

195
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:24,840
OK, but try to balance this with the practical needs of making a video game. It's not all, you know, there's like layers of abstraction and confusion and we'll figure it out later. We're always trying to find things that we can.

196
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:31,652
put a stake in the ground on and say, you know, even though we're operating in this sea of unknown

197
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:40,075
and this morass of poor decisions and, you know, shaky ideas, we can still pull out a few things

198
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:45,957
that we can have certainty about or just like feel somewhat confident about. And for us, looking at

199
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:51,500
things like weird fiction, this literary genre, and other experiences that evoke the sublime,

200
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,341
you know, I think it became obvious that for whatever reason...

201
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:57,285
They tend to involve natural spaces.

202
00:16:57,565 --> 00:17:01,227
People feel a sense of the sublime most often

203
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:03,969
in places like the forest or the beach.

204
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:06,930
And so, yeah, we should probably be setting stories

205
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,031
in those spaces where we can.

206
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:14,354
So it gave us a way to focus of all the potential prototypes

207
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:14,955
we might do.

208
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:18,096
Maybe we can try some of those at the beach.

209
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:22,619
Similarly, with weird fiction, a lot of the stories

210
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:23,259
are very short.

211
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:30,214
And a lot of them involve very explicit narrators, people that are telling the story, writing it down,

212
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:34,355
often several layers deep, where someone is telling a story to somebody else.

213
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:41,317
And that's a way of emphasizing that you're never getting the full truth,

214
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:46,378
you're just getting a perspective on it, and making the universe that much more obviously

215
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:50,039
unknowable to you. So that was something that we took wholesale for Edith Finch.

216
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:52,100
And there's about...

217
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:58,020
I think a year or so of us, or me, particularly, like wrestling with like, what does a sublime mean?

218
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,101
Like, how do we make that concrete?

219
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,642
And eventually kind of giving up and saying,

220
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:09,144
I don't really know how to do that, but I do know how to do overwhelmed.

221
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:10,585
And that's pretty close.

222
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:15,126
So I think overwhelmed became something that's easier.

223
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:18,488
Like if an animator is making, you know, like a walk cycle or whatever, like you can...

224
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:25,276
Visualize that a little better and it's not exactly what we set out to make it's not as aspirational as sublime

225
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:27,956
But it's something that's a lot easier for

226
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:31,238
You know to actually make a concrete version of it

227
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:33,458
and

228
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,479
Yes, the next is talking about how?

229
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,181
Once there's this idea of this, you know feeling that you have how do you communicate that with everybody else and

230
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:49,495
People like to ask for documents, written descriptions of how this thing will work,

231
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:51,822
knowing that, of course, these things are going to change.

232
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:54,628
Many people kind of read them.

233
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:56,069
They forget about them.

234
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:57,971
The documents become stale.

235
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,773
There are some limited utility, but it

236
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:03,776
does help to write them, partly just for your own benefit.

237
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,259
And then also, later on in development, a lot of people

238
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,321
will come on to the project, like various contractors.

239
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,124
Or you might have someone who's only

240
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:16,246
going to be there for a couple of weeks doing shrubbery

241
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:19,569
or whatever it is that that week you really need someone to do.

242
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:21,791
And so having the corpus of documents,

243
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:22,552
actually, even if.

244
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,291
It's not super helpful for communicating the original idea.

245
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,533
It is good to just have around for people that come on late.

246
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:33,377
But I think what works better is to try to communicate to everybody

247
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:35,579
in the language that they're most comfortable with.

248
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,857
Which, unfortunately, is different for every single person on the team,

249
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:40,458
because everybody is a snowflake.

250
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,840
But, you know, kind of broadly speaking,

251
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,164
like artists tend to prefer like a more visual way of describing something.

252
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:50,945
So like a collection of screenshots or, you know, reference photos

253
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:56,249
might make the idea of, you know, like your beach prototype a bit clearer.

254
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:58,510
Where the artist really wants to know things like,

255
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:00,312
oh, like how wet is it, what time of day,

256
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:02,593
you know, that you might not even be thinking about.

257
00:20:02,713 --> 00:20:03,714
But your reference photos.

258
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,579
We'll have some concrete version of that.

259
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,002
Programmers tend to like feature lists.

260
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:13,127
But everybody has their own thing

261
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:15,389
that they're most concerned about.

262
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,652
So in terms of communicating, a lot of it

263
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:20,335
just boils down to talking individually

264
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:22,398
to everybody on the team where that's possible.

265
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:27,008
And in our case, that even extended to task tracking,

266
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:30,030
where every single department by the end of the game

267
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,332
ended up with their own kind of different task tracking tool,

268
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:37,515
because they had different ideas about how much work they wanted,

269
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:39,336
like how described it should be.

270
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:42,379
And so rather than having one monolithic task tracking tool

271
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,381
that nobody really liked, because we were a very small team,

272
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,682
it actually was easier for us to say, like,

273
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:49,564
OK, you guys can just work in Google Docs,

274
00:20:49,704 --> 00:20:51,685
and we can use Jira, and we can use

275
00:20:52,112 --> 00:21:20,833
The bug tracking tool and whatever, which seems insane, but that's part of the like one of the nice things about being a small team is that you can do kind of insane things and it's only insane for like six of you. It's not like 60 or 600 so you can mitigate that a little bit. And then in terms of communicating to everybody else. Nothing beats like a prototype or anything that is moving. A lot of it feels like an optical illusion where you can look at something.

276
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,992
And you swear, like, oh yeah, that's really, that's a hole.

277
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,073
But then you move a little bit, and you're just like, oh, no,

278
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:27,294
it's just a painting of a hole.

279
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,555
But it only works if the camera's

280
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:30,956
in one particular perspective.

281
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,557
And that's kind of what a moving prototype does,

282
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:36,559
is it gives you a different perspective on the problem.

283
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:41,922
And it lets you ask more painful questions

284
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:45,764
than you might otherwise if it was a series of reference

285
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:46,544
photos or whatever.

286
00:21:47,377 --> 00:21:54,938
Ideally, any kind of moving object is a great place for discussions and ends up solving

287
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:59,579
a lot of questions or raising questions that wouldn't have been raised otherwise.

288
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,501
And it's not enough to just communicate initially what the emotional goal is of something.

289
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:09,102
It also is incumbent on you to communicate that.

290
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:12,246
every time it changes, which is like all of the time,

291
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:17,048
for very good reasons, but often kind of complicated reasons.

292
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:20,330
Of like, oh well players were getting confused about this thing, so even

293
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,391
though we really liked it, we kind of had to remove it or move it

294
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:27,933
over here, and it's hard to tell everybody every

295
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:31,794
time something changes. So what we found was helpful were a

296
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,315
couple of kind of best practices like team

297
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,536
Traditions like every Friday.

298
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:39,097
We would have show-and-tell where we

299
00:22:39,117 --> 00:22:40,457
would walk around to each person's

300
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:42,798
desk and the whole team would

301
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:44,678
kind of whatever they're working on

302
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:46,419
and then people would give like a one

303
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,259
to two minute spiel

304
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
and show things off which is also

305
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,661
really nice for people to brag

306
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:52,561
about what they're working on

307
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,442
because often if you know an artist.

308
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:57,030
is making some really complicated prop.

309
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,851
They could spend a week or two on it,

310
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,492
and it just goes into the asset folder in the background,

311
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:02,633
and nobody really notices it.

312
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,074
Even though it's very pretty, it gives everybody a chance

313
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,236
to kind of clap for them.

314
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:13,578
And also, it's a very explicit demonstration of like, oh,

315
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:14,559
that's funny.

316
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,861
You're making props for this Egypt level or whatever.

317
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:20,142
I had no idea we were going to do an Egypt level.

318
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,403
And it just surfaces a lot of things

319
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,344
that might otherwise go under the radar.

320
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:27,877
It's been my experience on both of the games we've made,

321
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:30,839
which I think turned out pretty well overall.

322
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:35,201
But there are phases in development where a lot of people don't play the game,

323
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:38,443
even though they may like it or they may hate it or whatever.

324
00:23:38,843 --> 00:23:41,765
There's just long stretches of time that can go by where people...

325
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:49,151
get very busy on whatever, you know, their part of the game is and don't actually play the rest of the game.

326
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:55,113
So it can be helpful to force them to do that. And we used to have these dog fooding sessions

327
00:23:55,173 --> 00:24:00,974
where the team would eat its own dog food and for an hour or two everybody would play the game

328
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:06,415
themselves like at their desks and then we would have a meeting usually afterwards and sometimes

329
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:11,297
we would generate tasks. Often we would just chat about it and it sounds really stupid but

330
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:21,777
Just having everybody play the game was a really good way of communicating what had changed about the game and what we were working on.

331
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:28,601
Also, similarly, getting everybody together to watch a playtest can be a good way to communicate things out.

332
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:29,762
Ideally, people would know.

333
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:32,985
that you would add to this level or change this thing

334
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:35,207
before they see somebody actually playing it.

335
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,490
But that's a good kind of last stop for, oh yeah,

336
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,892
now that thing exists because I see it now.

337
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:41,513
It's live.

338
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,737
And similarly, showing for the publisher,

339
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:48,019
they'll ask you to demo at various conventions.

340
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,541
That's a good place to get people

341
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:52,482
in front of other players.

342
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:54,925
And especially later on in development.

343
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:59,410
You can get kind of jaded to the game because you've been seeing it so long and getting a chance to see

344
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:07,074
how happy new players are with the things that you yourself have gotten very tired of can be inspirational.

345
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:14,598
Also, even though there are a lot of times where in our development process we have no idea what's

346
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:21,422
going on, we do have phases where we can make lists of like, oh yeah, we need like

347
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:24,174
300 things done, like for the art team.

348
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:25,855
I was like, oh, you hear like 300 problems?

349
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:29,438
And it feels really good to make that list

350
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:33,141
and then see it go away and to actually chip away at it.

351
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:35,363
There's something that's very empowering

352
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:38,306
about crossing things off and seeing things get completed,

353
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,128
which when you're working on something

354
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:43,170
where you have this kind of broad direction

355
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,394
but not a very specific roadmap for how to get there,

356
00:25:47,794 --> 00:25:49,235
you don't have a lot of those opportunities.

357
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:49,616
So.

358
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:52,900
We would take advantage of things like E3, for example,

359
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,923
or any time we had a big milestone build,

360
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:59,767
to turn that into this kind of smaller phase of certainty.

361
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:06,134
And rather than use the already really cumbersome, overloaded

362
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:07,916
task tracking tools that we all had,

363
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:09,337
that we'd been working with forever,

364
00:26:09,838 --> 00:26:11,400
it was surprisingly powerful just

365
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,242
to open up a new document.

366
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:17,293
and say, all right, here's just 200 items

367
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:18,734
that we're going to make today.

368
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:21,955
And we're going to see them all be done a week from now.

369
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:26,237
And we're just trying to balance the certainty and uncertainty.

370
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:30,138
OK, moving on to prototyping.

371
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:32,860
So once you have this sense of, OK,

372
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,620
this is going to be an interesting space to explore.

373
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:39,706
That creates a problem because there's so many ways to potentially explore it.

374
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:43,108
And the prototypes are where the rubber meets the road.

375
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:47,810
And they're a way for the ideas to actually start talking back to you

376
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,313
and to work with them in a very tangible way

377
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:58,075
and to discover things often through repeated failure.

378
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,756
And in terms of what you're looking for, I think for us...

379
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:07,135
Because we were venturing into these places that we really had no idea,

380
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:12,177
like how a game about short stories, for example, could work,

381
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:17,878
by making a few of these examples and then watching a bunch of people play it,

382
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:22,239
we kind of developed our own internal sense of how these things would fit together.

383
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:29,241
And over time, there's a way in which the game itself starts to kind of talk back to you.

384
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,843
Or another way of looking at it is that you've already made a lot of decisions intentionally

385
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:39,946
or unintentionally, and now you start to see the repercussions of those decisions.

386
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:43,949
And a lot of times, those can be actually positive moments.

387
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:49,893
Like for us, two of the things that we discovered, it wasn't that we planned these things,

388
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:55,316
but just in watching play tests that really changed the way the game ultimately feels.

389
00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:05,858
When we saw playtests, we found that a lot of players would get very focused on whatever their objective was.

390
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:13,084
That's kind of a traditional player behavior that is a little bit frustrating when you might want them to open up and take their time and take a breath.

391
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,766
But because it's...

392
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:19,565
So ingrained in players to follow instructions,

393
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:22,587
we ended up making a number of stories

394
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:26,290
that are about that process of what happens

395
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,971
when you get so focused on something

396
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:31,034
that you ignore everything else that's going on in your life.

397
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:35,337
Just because that's what we saw a lot of players

398
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:39,380
kind of were headed towards without us even pushing them.

399
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:44,164
We also had a very kind of garden variety design problem

400
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:44,484
of...

401
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:47,956
Most games are about trying to prevent your death.

402
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:50,718
How do you make a game where death is inevitable,

403
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,741
but players don't feel like that's a sign of failure?

404
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:57,745
So we tried to make those moments feel a little more positive,

405
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:01,749
and in doing that, we created these strange moments

406
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:05,813
where players would march happily towards their death,

407
00:29:06,254 --> 00:29:07,114
which is something that...

408
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,729
We hadn't experienced ourselves in any other games

409
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,191
and felt like a very canonical Finchian moment for us.

410
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:19,012
So that became something that we found in a couple of stories

411
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:20,793
and really emphasized.

412
00:29:20,853 --> 00:29:23,914
So it started as us just trying to solve a particular problem

413
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:25,975
and then ended up being something

414
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,096
that was more interesting and that we put more love into

415
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:31,616
than we'd expected.

416
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:35,018
OK, jumping into some nuts and bolts,

417
00:29:35,498 --> 00:29:37,158
prototyping tips from the trenches.

418
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:49,735
The first suggestion I have is 3x5 index cards are a really good way when you're dealing with a lot of ideas to try to get other parts of your brain involved.

419
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:52,979
So like a lot of this talk is really just about dealing.

420
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:59,146
with this combination of complexity and confusion and the unknown.

421
00:29:59,386 --> 00:30:03,351
These note cards are one way that I personally have found really helpful

422
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:08,997
just drawing really, really crappy visual representations of whatever is...

423
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:16,341
Here I think it's like motifs in the game trying to figure out like what are the primary and what are secondary and what are bad

424
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:17,781
and

425
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:20,842
by making them visual it

426
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:27,744
Engages this other part of your brain that is enormous like a huge part of our brain is dedicated to visual processing

427
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:32,405
But if it's something that you know, it's just in a tech document or in your head

428
00:30:33,105 --> 00:30:35,106
There's a limit to what that part of your brain can work on

429
00:30:35,514 --> 00:30:40,239
Like 7 plus or minus 2 is about the things you can keep in your head at any given time.

430
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,786
But if you put it out into the world in some way, you can think about a few more things.

431
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:51,692
Which is helpful when you have a game that's about, in this case, 13 different family members.

432
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:54,195
Here's another version of that.

433
00:30:55,335 --> 00:31:02,637
In a spreadsheet form where I looked at this document like pretty much every day for the last two years of the project.

434
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:11,700
It's just a really terse summary of all the different stories and what the order is and some of the different values here,

435
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,741
like the gender of the story and trying to balance those things out and just trying to kind of wrap my head around.

436
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,012
what this whole game was going to feel like.

437
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:22,395
And obviously these pictures don't really look like the stories,

438
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:26,159
but they're enough of a shorthand that you can kind of imagine

439
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,342
what a whole game's worth might feel like and run through it in your head,

440
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,484
just by making it more visual.

441
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:35,607
Also, just a note about the brain.

442
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,522
I think it's really helpful to write down all of your ideas because if you don't,

443
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,743
then your brain tends to hold on to them.

444
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:46,245
I think your brain is like a second grader who's got their hand up

445
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:48,766
and really wants to tell you the answer,

446
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,067
but if you don't call on that second grader,

447
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,008
then eventually they just shut down.

448
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:58,670
And what I found a lot of the times a solution for a problem

449
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,871
would come when I was in the shower or doing something else.

450
00:32:01,573 --> 00:32:02,933
and not really thinking about it actively.

451
00:32:02,973 --> 00:32:04,794
But the only way you get to that point, I think,

452
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:08,175
is if you reward your brain by saying, yeah, I'm listening to you.

453
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:09,556
I'm writing these things down.

454
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:12,297
Even these ideas don't seem like they're that great.

455
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:15,118
There's a power of just getting it out of your head also.

456
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,419
So even if it's not a great idea, it makes space

457
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,301
for something that might be coming up next that could be great.

458
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:25,702
Also, even though game development is very collaborative,

459
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,943
I think early on when you're making prototypes,

460
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:29,523
it can be really useful to just.

461
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,953
Do everything on your own, because as soon as you involve anyone else,

462
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,895
there's just like a lot of complexity that you're borrowing

463
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:40,478
that can be really helpful if it's something very technical

464
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:44,241
that are difficult or, you know, that you really don't know how to do.

465
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:47,503
But often you can get a lot of the way there

466
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:51,826
just knowing a little bit about a couple of programs, like on Edith Finch,

467
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:56,509
it's like a 3D modeling tool, like a very basic knowledge of Unity,

468
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,651
and some Photoshop is enough to get...

469
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:05,539
A lot of questions answered positively or negatively before you go out to somebody else.

470
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:09,241
And then there's, you know, beyond that, tons of things in game development that you could be learning

471
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:13,124
that are really useful for making prototypes.

472
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:19,347
Also, when we make prototypes, the very last phase is actually making the prototype itself.

473
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:29,012
A lot of time is spent kind of in the phases where you're dreaming about it in different ways.

474
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:43,247
So just like downloading a whole bunch of images and finding reference is a really great way of getting your brain kind of spinning on possibilities, particularly with reference photos of real world things like

475
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,222
If you're doing a father-daughter camping trip in the 1970s,

476
00:33:47,463 --> 00:33:49,123
you might stumble across an image of,

477
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:52,065
like, oh, right, they had different kinds of cans

478
00:33:52,145 --> 00:33:55,167
for opening soda back then with little peel tabs and stuff

479
00:33:55,187 --> 00:33:57,128
that you just wouldn't normally think about.

480
00:33:57,508 --> 00:34:01,851
But finding references can give you a lot of free ideas

481
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:05,613
and help you to think of things in different ways.

482
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:09,395
We also did a lot of work in Unity,

483
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:12,176
even though the game itself was made in Unreal.

484
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:17,727
It's, I think, kind of nice to work in a completely different space,

485
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,169
because there's a lot less pressure in some ways.

486
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:24,171
Like, you know that it's going to look really shitty if you did all of the art,

487
00:34:24,551 --> 00:34:28,914
and yet, it actually, like, you know, in this particular case of the prototype for the swing set story,

488
00:34:29,274 --> 00:34:34,256
you know, starts to get to a point where you can ask some, you know, valid, troubling questions

489
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:36,598
about should this story have hands, for example.

490
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:41,194
Should the rope be bending at all?

491
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:42,955
Should that rope instead be a chain?

492
00:34:42,975 --> 00:34:46,496
A lot of questions that once you start to get things moving

493
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:52,578
at all, rear the ugly head that might not have been visible

494
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:53,859
if you were just on a whiteboard.

495
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:56,500
And then the last thing we do is in-engine prototypes

496
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,380
because they're a little bit more heavyweight.

497
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,282
OK, Critically Damped Springs.

498
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:08,510
That's a one-dimensional mathy sort of value for how you move something,

499
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:14,534
like basically like a real spring that we used everywhere.

500
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:19,116
And particularly on cameras, places where you want really smooth motion,

501
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:23,679
there are things that worked really well for prototyping because they're so simple.

502
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:24,680
So I'll just talk.

503
00:35:25,048 --> 00:35:26,189
Really briefly about them,

504
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,090
but here you can see like on the top.

505
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,711
This is just like it's a box moving and see at the very end.

506
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:32,771
It just kind of clunks like that,

507
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:38,914
but a spring is just this tiny little piece of code and it feels much more expensive,

508
00:35:39,294 --> 00:35:40,074
much more magical.

509
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:47,292
And the other great thing about springs is that they're really easy to tune because there's only two values like how

510
00:35:47,652 --> 00:35:51,996
Springy they are and then whether or not they overshoot their target

511
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:56,259
So even though they look really nice. They are also

512
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,063
Really easy to adjust for designers later on in the process

513
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:06,340
And here's an example of taking just a raw input,

514
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
like if you have the analog stick moving around.

515
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,661
Sometimes you want that snappiness,

516
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,782
but often it feels better if there's a little bit of a delay,

517
00:36:15,682 --> 00:36:17,322
particularly with cameras.

518
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:20,103
So here's an example.

519
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:23,624
PowerPoint is a little slow there.

520
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,584
But yeah, so on the left, it's just what you get

521
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:27,665
if you listen to the stick.

522
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:29,623
And you say, OK, oh, they moved left.

523
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:29,903
Great.

524
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:32,204
Moved the camera left that fast.

525
00:36:32,945 --> 00:36:35,106
And you see a lot of Unity trailers

526
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:37,747
for games with cameras that look just like that.

527
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:39,208
They're very jerky.

528
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:42,389
And these springs are so simple.

529
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,030
They're just a couple lines of code,

530
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:46,852
and they start to feel much more like a finished product.

531
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:48,633
And it doesn't have to be this floaty.

532
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:52,215
This is closer to the Edith Finch floaty camera

533
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:52,995
that I personally like.

534
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:56,197
But the nice thing about springs is that there's two values,

535
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:57,357
and you can tune those knobs.

536
00:36:58,242 --> 00:37:00,464
And because we were making so many different prototypes,

537
00:37:01,064 --> 00:37:04,265
tools like these springs were really useful

538
00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:07,267
because we could drop them into all kinds of different scenarios

539
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:11,309
and then still have something that we could easily adjust the feel of.

540
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,432
And then music is another thing that was surprisingly useful

541
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,513
for the prototypes that we made,

542
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:20,914
partly because...

543
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:24,319
Composers are really good at evoking feeling.

544
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,442
They are professionally obligated to listen to people,

545
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:32,903
ask them for something to be 20% more whimsical,

546
00:37:33,283 --> 00:37:35,124
and then have a cogent response to that.

547
00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:38,126
They're much more professional than game developers

548
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:38,746
in that way.

549
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:41,227
So our composer was really helpful

550
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:43,548
when we had problems in certain stories where it's like,

551
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:44,969
it's close, but it's not.

552
00:37:45,308 --> 00:37:46,189
It's not quite there.

553
00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:51,730
It was a very surgical level of tuning at that point.

554
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,131
And it's also something that is very practical to adjust later on.

555
00:37:57,311 --> 00:38:01,692
Like, as the door begins to close and you get closer and closer to shipping,

556
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,092
there's a lot of things that you can no longer change.

557
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:06,593
And everyone agrees that, yeah, the game would be a lot better

558
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:09,934
if we could, you know, get rid of this thing or that or whatever,

559
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,174
but, like, we can't for memory reasons or, you know,

560
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:14,275
in this sensitive area.

561
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:17,815
But music is one of the things that's almost free, usually.

562
00:38:17,835 --> 00:38:19,295
I mean, there's a little bit of streaming cost.

563
00:38:19,395 --> 00:38:22,436
But in terms of technical complexity, it's very low.

564
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:26,037
And yet, it has a very significant emotional impact.

565
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:31,279
So for us, there were a few stories, like Swing said, Calvin's story,

566
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:36,080
that that made a really big impact on and came in late.

567
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,101
But I think it's especially true for Gregory's story.

568
00:38:39,591 --> 00:38:44,133
Where we had four different gameplay programmers try to work on it.

569
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:47,215
And it just never felt right.

570
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:48,835
Like it felt too clunky.

571
00:38:49,135 --> 00:38:52,457
And we got very focused on the mechanical aspects of it.

572
00:38:52,717 --> 00:38:53,818
And it's a difficult problem.

573
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:58,460
Like you're doing kind of 3D platforming in a space where the camera is fixed.

574
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,521
You're Gregory in the scene like you're a baby.

575
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:02,182
It's very hard to judge depth.

576
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:06,176
And so we spent a lot of time adjusting that and thinking about what should we be doing

577
00:39:06,216 --> 00:39:08,136
and why does this not feel whimsical.

578
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:13,698
And I think the best answer, I mean, there were a lot of legitimate gameplay fixes that

579
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:18,739
came in that helped a lot, but in terms of the emotional feel of that story, just adding

580
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,841
the waltz of the flowers got us a lot of the way there.

581
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,631
Something that felt like people have associations with ballet,

582
00:39:29,431 --> 00:39:35,012
put us into the right mindset of being this kind of balletic frog jumping around a tub.

583
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:42,654
Okay, playtests are a really nice phase because it's a way of moving out of this

584
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:51,777
kind of forest of the unknown into a place of a lot of practical and tractable solutions and fixes.

585
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:52,797
There are a lot of things that...

586
00:39:53,395 --> 00:40:11,242
Don't have clear answers in the design process and you can stay up very late wondering like, oh man, there's so many different ways we could do that. But on the other side, there are a lot of issues that are quite amenable to just brute forcing like pathing. I think is a great example of that of if players.

587
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:16,595
You know, tend to, like you want them to go, say, right down a hallway, but they keep going left,

588
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:22,217
then it's something that you can just do a bunch of play tests and keep making little adjustments to that.

589
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:28,680
Like, oh, maybe make this, you know, a little bit brighter, maybe add a little bit of motion, or, you know, however many revolutions it takes.

590
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:34,114
If you just keep doing more playtesting, it's like turning the crank and things eventually get better.

591
00:40:34,294 --> 00:40:40,519
And it's really kind of comforting that there are phases and aspects of development that are amenable to that.

592
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:45,502
Because again, a lot of times we spend floundering in places that are very murky,

593
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:50,545
but playtests are a great place to just kind of not worry about these problems.

594
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:55,749
Like they may be legitimate issues, like pathing and people getting confused about something,

595
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:56,890
but there's something that you can...

596
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:01,273
Just work hard enough on and it will eventually solve itself.

597
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,355
A few sort of specific takeaways.

598
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:07,999
When people who are playing get frustrated,

599
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,481
often they will have an idea about why they got frustrated

600
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,443
and they'll have suggestions for what you should change about your game.

601
00:41:13,943 --> 00:41:16,806
Generally, it's a bad idea to listen to them because they're unaware of...

602
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,309
What has led them to that state?

603
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:27,900
Often, we would see players who would get very frustrated if they, for example, if they're playing Molly's story and they didn't catch any owls.

604
00:41:28,261 --> 00:41:32,266
So they spent 20 minutes flying around as the owl trying to catch the rabbits.

605
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:38,132
And then they would complain about the next sequence of the game when you become a shark.

606
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:40,494
It's like, oh, the shark sequence is really boring.

607
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:46,739
It's like, well, it's only boring because you exhausted yourself in this sequence right before it.

608
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,062
But people usually aren't aware enough about that.

609
00:41:50,142 --> 00:41:55,186
So, yes, it's useful to listen to that they are upset,

610
00:41:55,706 --> 00:41:59,650
but not usually helpful to listen to why they think they're upset.

611
00:42:00,974 --> 00:42:05,397
In a first-person game, it's also really helpful to look at where their camera is pointing.

612
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:10,980
You can kind of mind read a bit there and get a sense of what they're concerned about

613
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,481
or what they think is important in the scene.

614
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:16,583
Repeating anything tends to be kind of a death knell.

615
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:21,386
I don't think of any genre where doing something a second time is going to pay off,

616
00:42:21,526 --> 00:42:24,207
but that's kind of the last step of desperate players.

617
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:29,030
And then sometimes people have a lot of trouble with the game.

618
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,160
And it's because they're very dumb.

619
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,141
And it's kind of heartbreaking when you watch them play.

620
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:39,402
And one of our play tests, someone spent, I think,

621
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:42,023
like 20 minutes on the downstairs of the house,

622
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:44,584
a sequence that usually takes maybe two or three minutes.

623
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:46,984
They went upstairs.

624
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:48,685
They missed the part they were supposed to go.

625
00:42:48,705 --> 00:42:49,805
They went downstairs.

626
00:42:49,825 --> 00:42:51,166
They went upstairs again, downstairs.

627
00:42:51,466 --> 00:42:54,206
And I think the fourth time they found the thing they

628
00:42:54,226 --> 00:42:54,727
were supposed to.

629
00:42:55,488 --> 00:42:58,509
And I thought they were really upset, but they, oops,

630
00:42:58,529 --> 00:43:03,831
sorry, getting ahead of myself, but they're actually really proud of themselves.

631
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:09,292
Oh yeah, no, I found my way through it. And I think, you know, there are a lot of

632
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:11,413
people out there that just have trouble with life,

633
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:16,794
and your game is like the latest manifestation of that,

634
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:21,955
but it's not your fault. So, you know, it takes a little bit of

635
00:43:23,776 --> 00:43:28,500
Detachment to say, OK, what's my bad and what's just their fault?

636
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,962
But if they're having a lot of trouble

637
00:43:32,122 --> 00:43:34,404
and they're not upset about it, that's not necessarily

638
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:35,065
a bad thing.

639
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,206
That just might be how they go through life.

640
00:43:38,207 --> 00:43:42,570
So that takes an expert's eye to suss out.

641
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:49,336
And then we would alternate our playtests between doing kind of functional tests where we have one person

642
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:55,641
playthrough with more what we called focus tests where we would have like up to five or ten people

643
00:43:56,101 --> 00:44:00,285
play at any given time and those were really useful I think for testing different things like the

644
00:44:00,645 --> 00:44:06,170
one-person test was really good for very specific mechanical issues of like what might be confusing

645
00:44:07,054 --> 00:44:11,262
to a player where the larger tests were really good for more subjective, like,

646
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:15,311
how does it kind of feel? Do these things make sense from a narrative standpoint?

647
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,783
So doing a mix of those playtests worked well.

648
00:44:19,943 --> 00:44:24,026
And I think about five players is probably as much as you need after those diminishing returns.

649
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:30,911
Something that was also really helpful for us was doing batches of playtests at conferences like GDC

650
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:36,595
where you've got thousands of game developers from all over the world who were here for one week

651
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,778
and you can, you know, call them up ahead of time.

652
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:42,755
And a lot of people are really happy because they're already in town

653
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:44,716
to come by your hotel room.

654
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:46,838
So I think last year or the year before, we

655
00:44:47,378 --> 00:44:52,541
had maybe 10 or 15 playtests with tons of really great game developers

656
00:44:54,022 --> 00:44:56,584
in a single week that would have been very difficult

657
00:44:56,724 --> 00:44:59,426
if we'd had to organize it in Los Angeles in the normal way.

658
00:45:00,787 --> 00:45:03,969
And then just a note on frustration in particular

659
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:07,731
is something that we focused on a lot with our playtests

660
00:45:07,911 --> 00:45:08,411
because.

661
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:15,847
I think more than anything else, frustration kind of unravels all of the good work that you might be doing elsewhere.

662
00:45:16,288 --> 00:45:20,271
It's like the scene in The Matrix when Neo wakes up in this amniotic fluid.

663
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:22,893
It just completely rips you out of this world.

664
00:45:24,114 --> 00:45:28,678
And it's something that can be difficult to get players back into.

665
00:45:29,138 --> 00:45:35,063
So our fixes for that, a couple of them, where it was possible, things like dynamic difficulty,

666
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:37,705
maybe Owl was a case of that, where some players...

667
00:45:38,137 --> 00:45:40,098
had a lot of trouble catching the rabbits.

668
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:43,758
And so if players failed a couple of times,

669
00:45:44,198 --> 00:45:48,899
then the radius of acceptable triggering

670
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:50,280
got larger and larger.

671
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,800
And that's something where we wanted to preserve.

672
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,941
We didn't want to make it too easy for all of the players,

673
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:58,141
because I think some players really

674
00:45:58,221 --> 00:45:59,742
like to have a little bit of challenge.

675
00:45:59,902 --> 00:46:01,962
And there certainly isn't that much of it in Edith Finch.

676
00:46:02,062 --> 00:46:04,343
So the places where we had challenge existing,

677
00:46:04,363 --> 00:46:05,523
we wanted to hold onto that.

678
00:46:06,003 --> 00:46:12,188
But there are some players that would spend 30 or 40 minutes, potentially, on those sections that just felt like,

679
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:13,669
wow, that was a terrible experience.

680
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:18,693
Let's try to help the people that are having trouble without hurting the people that are doing just fine.

681
00:46:18,753 --> 00:46:20,275
So dynamic difficulty was a way to do that.

682
00:46:21,856 --> 00:46:27,921
There are a few places where there were two ways or more that kind of made sense.

683
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:28,641
Like, for example...

684
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,495
When players come to a ladder that's below them,

685
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:35,217
they might press forward on the stick

686
00:46:35,657 --> 00:46:38,399
because they want to go, like, forward and down the ladder,

687
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,621
or it might make sense in their head to press down on the stick

688
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:43,783
because they're going down a ladder.

689
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:45,664
Either of those kind of work.

690
00:46:46,214 --> 00:46:49,936
But what we ended up doing was supporting both of them.

691
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:51,396
So when you get close enough to the ladder,

692
00:46:51,816 --> 00:46:53,857
whatever direction you press, we assume

693
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:55,038
you want to go down the ladder.

694
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:59,460
So we just adjust the controls to conform

695
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,300
to what players expect.

696
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,561
And then everyone gets the experience of, oh, yeah,

697
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:05,022
I just sort of expected it would work like that, and it did,

698
00:47:05,702 --> 00:47:08,023
rather than 50% thinking it would work

699
00:47:08,103 --> 00:47:10,644
and then being surprised that it works the other way.

700
00:47:10,684 --> 00:47:13,025
So if there's no reason it has to work one way,

701
00:47:13,045 --> 00:47:14,766
it can be nice to just.

702
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,824
the way that players imagine that it should.

703
00:47:18,606 --> 00:47:21,391
And then even though there are some people that struggle,

704
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:23,294
and I think it's fair to just say like,

705
00:47:23,515 --> 00:47:25,158
ah, it's fine, you can struggle.

706
00:47:25,899 --> 00:47:26,881
There are times where...

707
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:31,366
People will struggle and then never get through it.

708
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:36,228
Places like, actually even in something as simple as the swing set story,

709
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,089
most players figure out,

710
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:40,951
okay if I move my right stick, like that'll move my right leg,

711
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:42,191
and the left stick will move my left leg.

712
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:44,952
But some players just never figure that out,

713
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:47,814
because they got the feedback of moving one of the legs.

714
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:52,416
And they just got so focused on that leg that they never thought of moving the other leg.

715
00:47:52,796 --> 00:47:57,177
So the fix for us was to, after I think it's like a minute or two,

716
00:47:57,638 --> 00:48:03,640
we eventually spawn some little letters that swirl around the leg that you haven't moved

717
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,521
just to try to get people to kick that other leg.

718
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:12,343
And I think that's something that, you know, it seems really stupid when you watch someone not figure it out

719
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:14,384
when so many other people have had no trouble with it.

720
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:16,545
But it's the kind of thing where...

721
00:48:17,555 --> 00:48:18,816
Everybody has those moments.

722
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:20,516
I don't think you have to be too much of an outlier.

723
00:48:20,536 --> 00:48:23,437
But there are places where, like, about 5% of the time,

724
00:48:23,877 --> 00:48:25,938
people would just, you know, not because they were necessarily

725
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:28,139
being dumb, but it just didn't click with them.

726
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,200
And for a game like Edith Finch, you know,

727
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,300
if you have 13 stories or whatever,

728
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,941
like 5% failure rate on any of those stories,

729
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:37,742
it's still, that's going to add up over time.

730
00:48:37,822 --> 00:48:40,203
So we tried to find places where if there was going to be

731
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,723
some kind of hard failure where people would get really,

732
00:48:42,743 --> 00:48:46,264
really stuck, you know, we would lend a helping hand

733
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:46,965
if they spent.

734
00:48:47,518 --> 00:49:01,863
Minute or two without moving forward and then some of those cases to where most people will never see that and it won't bother them that you're offering this little hint for something when I could have figured it out but after a minute or two of not figuring out something very obvious just throwing them a bone.

735
00:49:01,883 --> 00:49:09,206
Helped move things along and then the last tip is kind of part and parcel of this.

736
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:14,608
The difficulty of working with things that you don't understand is that it can be.

737
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:20,339
really effective to change a lot of things at the end when you do understand them.

738
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,463
So I think at the end of the project you're at this point where you know

739
00:49:26,483 --> 00:49:29,845
you've been struggling and suddenly things are kind of clear and

740
00:49:29,905 --> 00:49:34,909
you also have the ability to affect the changes you want, but there's not a whole lot of time.

741
00:49:35,009 --> 00:49:39,912
Although hopefully by this point you do have a sense of what are the things that you can change without

742
00:49:40,472 --> 00:49:43,034
breaking everything else so you can be a little bit more surgical.

743
00:49:43,932 --> 00:49:51,334
Also, even though we did make a lot of changes, it's a kind of rolling phase on the project where as you get closer and closer,

744
00:49:51,454 --> 00:49:55,575
then the scope of things that you can make changes to does get smaller over time.

745
00:49:56,035 --> 00:50:05,978
But I just want to jump into a couple of specific cases of places where I think the game really benefited from the team continuing to be open to embracing those kind of changes.

746
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:12,381
One of the bigger changes was a week before we did our final dialogue recording,

747
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:18,625
we did our last pass on Edith VO and rewrote a huge chunk,

748
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:21,067
nearly half I think or more, of what's in the game.

749
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:24,329
Because we finally understood, kind of at a macro level,

750
00:50:25,129 --> 00:50:29,592
what the concerns were and what players were confused about.

751
00:50:29,812 --> 00:50:31,574
And a lot of it came down to very simple things,

752
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,175
like just adding mom and uncle,

753
00:50:33,415 --> 00:50:33,635
and like...

754
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,289
being very clear about the familial relationships.

755
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,912
So we changed a whole lot of dialogue in small ways

756
00:50:43,432 --> 00:50:48,376
at the end. And we also, not quite at the very end, but a few months before

757
00:50:49,136 --> 00:50:52,899
we finished the game, we did our last bedroom. So we kind of worked in stages

758
00:50:52,979 --> 00:50:54,780
from the ground floor working up to the top,

759
00:50:55,321 --> 00:51:01,845
and or like almost nearly last bedroom for Lewis's room. And we decided to make

760
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:02,065
him

761
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:09,478
character. He's more of an overt archetype. He's very much like a pothead.

762
00:51:10,038 --> 00:51:14,281
And we had resisted doing that on earlier bedrooms because we really wanted these

763
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:19,276
family members to feel like distinct, real human beings

764
00:51:19,356 --> 00:51:21,638
and didn't want them to feel in any way cartoonish.

765
00:51:22,118 --> 00:51:26,882
But, you know, by the end, what we realized is that in order to understand someone,

766
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:29,904
like, if the challenge is understanding them from their bedroom,

767
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:33,567
then a regular person generally would fail that.

768
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:37,070
Like, I know my bedroom is not that expressive of who I am.

769
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,591
I mean, there's like a few details, but...

770
00:51:39,086 --> 00:51:46,011
It's nowhere near what Edith Finch needed to be in order for players to cruise through and in like a minute or two,

771
00:51:46,452 --> 00:51:49,694
you know, pull out a couple of high-level details about who that character was.

772
00:51:50,695 --> 00:51:56,299
So, for the very last bedroom, we finally realized, like, oh, right, this is what we should have been doing the whole time.

773
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,201
And then we went back and redid every single other bedroom.

774
00:51:59,941 --> 00:52:04,167
And a lot of the characters, like Barbara for example, went from being just an actor,

775
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:09,273
like someone who liked performing, to being a child star, which is like the more character

776
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:15,741
version of that, but also a lot easier to design that bedroom for and have people understand

777
00:52:15,781 --> 00:52:18,665
immediately who that character was.

778
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:24,574
And then, appropriately, the last thing to talk about is the ending of the game,

779
00:52:25,054 --> 00:52:31,058
which took up a good year or so of my life making terrible prototypes,

780
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:35,802
things that did seem promising and then just didn't coalesce.

781
00:52:36,222 --> 00:52:40,065
And we realized after a while that the problem was essentially

782
00:52:40,105 --> 00:52:43,027
we were trying to write the last episode of The Twilight Zone.

783
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:48,231
Like, we had created all of these weird, bespoke, unique stories.

784
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:53,889
And then we wanted something at the end that would kind of summarize all that and put a bow on it.

785
00:52:53,989 --> 00:52:55,311
And that just doesn't really exist.

786
00:52:57,009 --> 00:53:00,330
The last episode of Twilight Zone is called The Bewitching Pool, and it's terrible.

787
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:02,871
It doesn't really answer anything.

788
00:53:03,592 --> 00:53:06,133
But that was the problem we had,

789
00:53:06,813 --> 00:53:09,955
and the solution for us ended up coming when

790
00:53:10,415 --> 00:53:12,836
we just kind of randomly had a request

791
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:16,237
from our friend Jenova to come by and play the game

792
00:53:16,257 --> 00:53:20,359
because he had a friend in town and didn't have anything to do with him that weekend or that afternoon.

793
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,700
So they came by and...

794
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:28,723
They played the game. I don't think there was an ending at that point, but we talked about this problem that we had.

795
00:53:28,863 --> 00:53:32,347
And then one of them said, well, you know, there's like a lot of death in this game.

796
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:35,590
What if, you know, the ending was something about a birth?

797
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:37,472
It's like, oh, yeah.

798
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:40,760
That actually might work.

799
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:45,142
And part of me was a little frustrated at that point,

800
00:53:45,162 --> 00:53:47,523
because it's like, well, how did they see these things?

801
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:52,825
Who are these amazing people that can solve our problems for us?

802
00:53:53,345 --> 00:54:00,087
And I think that the miracle here is really what it's like to be at the end of something.

803
00:54:00,127 --> 00:54:03,128
You go through all these confusing phases, but...

804
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:06,394
In the last retch, you actually start to kind of,

805
00:54:06,414 --> 00:54:10,437
like there are enough pieces there that someone can come in

806
00:54:11,157 --> 00:54:12,578
and ideally it would be you,

807
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:16,541
but sometimes it's not enough for you to make that.

808
00:54:16,761 --> 00:54:18,722
Like you can't see it, you're too close to it,

809
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:22,125
but someone else who's not been there

810
00:54:22,585 --> 00:54:24,266
for several years staring at it,

811
00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:26,348
it becomes immediately obvious that,

812
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:27,869
oh yeah, all these pieces are there.

813
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:32,091
So yeah, I think there's this kind of miraculous phase

814
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:33,192
at the end of project.

815
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:38,743
where even if you've been working in the dark for years,

816
00:54:40,384 --> 00:54:42,945
it helps to be flexible just a little bit longer

817
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:45,406
and Edith Finch benefited a huge amount from that.

818
00:54:46,307 --> 00:54:48,588
It is really difficult on everybody

819
00:54:48,728 --> 00:54:51,509
to remain flexible throughout that process.

820
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:55,891
So, huge thanks to everybody on the team

821
00:54:55,911 --> 00:54:57,032
for putting up with all that

822
00:54:57,272 --> 00:55:00,374
and being excited most of the time to keep.

823
00:55:01,454 --> 00:55:08,438
Making those changes. It's also pretty rough on publishers. So thank you to all of our publisher friends and

824
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,119
You know, thanks to the press too

825
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:14,601
It's been amazing with Edith Finch to see that even like a year after the game came out

826
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:20,964
People are writing articles on like Edith's gloves like there's a whole article just on her gloves

827
00:55:21,424 --> 00:55:25,166
And that level of detail has been really surprising and wonderful and then you know

828
00:55:25,186 --> 00:55:27,567
thanks obviously to everybody who's played the game and

829
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:53,664
And really open themselves up to it and had very emotional experiences with the game that are very collaborative effort on the part of the game developer and the player and it only really works when people are coming to the game and being emotionally open to it and we sincerely appreciate it and then we're also very very early stages on our next game which is going to be super animation focused so if there's anybody out there who's an animator or an animation programmer or

830
00:55:54,175 --> 00:55:56,876
So if anyone knows good people of this type,

831
00:55:57,156 --> 00:55:58,817
definitely let them know that we're looking.

832
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:02,138
And I think we've got a few minutes left for QA.

833
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:04,219
So if there's any questions.

834
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:12,262
Hi.

835
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:12,982
Great talk.

836
00:56:13,022 --> 00:56:13,982
Thank you very much.

837
00:56:14,683 --> 00:56:17,524
I had a question about your development process.

838
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:21,906
It seems very iterative and explorative.

839
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:27,281
Obviously, no one has unlimited time and money to make a video game.

840
00:56:28,282 --> 00:56:32,244
So I've been wondering, like, you talked a lot about exploring and prototyping.

841
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:38,208
Do you have any tips for when you have to stop and just execute on a plan?

842
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:41,870
Or did you just timebox it? Like, what's your technique there?

843
00:56:42,211 --> 00:56:45,673
Yeah, I mean, our technique was to rely on our publisher to set milestones.

844
00:56:46,193 --> 00:56:47,354
I mean, working with them.

845
00:56:47,895 --> 00:56:52,041
But I think that was one of the really useful aspects of that relationship,

846
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:55,747
that we would have things like E3, or like that Greenlight trailer I showed, for example,

847
00:56:56,308 --> 00:57:00,235
that was a publisher deciding, I mean, we talked to them about the scheduling, but...

848
00:57:01,025 --> 00:57:02,867
I think it is really helpful to have milestones.

849
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:05,829
And it would be very difficult if you didn't have a publisher

850
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:07,370
like forcing you to those milestones.

851
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:10,192
But that kind of discipline would be really useful

852
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:13,114
just to say like, OK, we're going to show at this conference

853
00:57:13,154 --> 00:57:13,754
or do whatever.

854
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:15,556
Like nothing really.

855
00:57:15,596 --> 00:57:16,636
I mean, it's kind of like the miracle

856
00:57:16,656 --> 00:57:17,437
at the end of the project.

857
00:57:17,497 --> 00:57:18,958
It's like that for every milestone.

858
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:22,961
When you have this big goal, it gets everybody kind of together

859
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:25,422
working on achieving some nugget of it.

860
00:57:25,803 --> 00:57:27,924
But yeah, I think it just comes down to you

861
00:57:27,984 --> 00:57:30,266
need little bits of crisis.

862
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:34,849
to bring everything together and get all of the check-ins

863
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,492
submitted and integrated together,

864
00:57:37,512 --> 00:57:39,174
because otherwise you'd never ship.

865
00:57:39,294 --> 00:57:42,137
But yeah, look for any way you can add little bits of crises.

866
00:57:42,477 --> 00:57:43,138
All right, thank you.

867
00:57:44,539 --> 00:57:47,603
So as a publisher, that terrified me.

868
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:49,885
Looking at the talk, I'm like, oh, that's cool.

869
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:51,887
Every team uses their own tracking.

870
00:57:52,328 --> 00:57:53,189
Just terrifying.

871
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:58,983
While the end product was amazing, was there sort of, like you say there was milestones,

872
00:57:59,023 --> 00:58:05,047
but was there elements of crisis as well where because it was like not really formalized and

873
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:10,471
kind of rough and kind of very sort of a humanistic process, so was there elements of

874
00:58:11,091 --> 00:58:16,194
terror or was there bad parts of it as well I guess? Yeah, I mean there were definitely moments

875
00:58:16,315 --> 00:58:22,038
where the publisher was very concerned, both of the publishers, but I think

876
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:28,295
It's not like we were working in a vacuum and just kind of like in the dark the whole time.

877
00:58:29,357 --> 00:58:32,419
Every week we would have new cool things that would come out of it.

878
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,464
So we could show the publisher, hey, we thought it was going to take us this long and we would have this thing,

879
00:58:37,825 --> 00:58:40,607
but instead it's taking us this long and we have this other really cool thing.

880
00:58:41,008 --> 00:58:43,970
So, yeah, I guess to answer your question, we...

881
00:58:45,662 --> 00:58:51,485
We didn't always hit all of our milestones, but we did always find interesting things along the way,

882
00:58:51,565 --> 00:58:55,888
and so I think that was somewhat comforting to the publisher to say like,

883
00:58:55,968 --> 00:59:01,792
okay, well, it does feel like good progress is being made and it's not very predictable,

884
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:07,335
but the publishers also kind of understood going in that that was part of the development process,

885
00:59:07,355 --> 00:59:09,697
and kind of like what they were interested in making also.

886
00:59:10,455 --> 00:59:13,418
They had signed up to publish a game that nobody really understood.

887
00:59:13,598 --> 00:59:15,300
That's part of what was appealing about that.

888
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,743
But that would not have worked if we were doing a Halo sequel or whatever,

889
00:59:20,664 --> 00:59:22,626
where there were much more fixed ideas.

890
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:23,546
Cool, thanks.

891
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:26,329
Sure.

892
00:59:26,349 --> 00:59:28,150
Sorry, is there in the back?

893
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:28,711
Yes.

894
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:28,851
Okay.

895
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:30,412
Oh, you.

896
00:59:30,452 --> 00:59:32,334
Oh me? Okay, sorry.

897
00:59:32,354 --> 00:59:32,814
Sorry about that.

898
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:39,363
So you talked about your mood boards a lot, and that kind of interests me, and I was wondering

899
00:59:39,883 --> 00:59:44,307
how much they evolved throughout the project, and were they just kind of like a, were they like your

900
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:49,071
base of like, it was like a stone for you guys, or was it more fluid?

901
00:59:49,091 --> 00:59:54,015
Uh, we didn't continue to make mood boards per se, I think that was an early phase, like it takes

902
00:59:54,796 --> 00:59:58,859
a while, you know, to put all those things together and look at them, but we did something

903
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,503
very similar, where like Chris, our level designer, would put together

904
01:00:02,985 --> 01:00:07,889
You know, like a couple pages of a bunch of different photos and ideas and references

905
01:00:08,329 --> 01:00:13,333
for, you know, kind of like what a middle school girl might make for a crush.

906
01:00:13,433 --> 01:00:18,977
Just like all these cool ideas about a thing and put them together a little bit more structured, in Chris's defense.

907
01:00:20,398 --> 01:00:24,121
But yeah, so they weren't like mood boards per se, but they were kind of in that vein

908
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:28,544
when they were really helpful when design needed to communicate something to art,

909
01:00:28,684 --> 01:00:30,425
was usually where they would come into play.

910
01:00:30,855 --> 01:00:33,938
Okay, so the mood boards were more like, I mean, what you started with then?

911
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:38,361
Yeah, yeah, that was more like, what is this feeling that we're thinking about?

912
01:00:38,382 --> 01:00:41,764
Like, what are the kind of tent poles that we think are important here?

913
01:00:42,645 --> 01:00:47,189
But we didn't keep making them in the same way that we didn't keep making a game design document for the whole game.

914
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:52,253
That was something like, initially you take a pass at it, and then the game itself becomes the document eventually.

915
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:53,193
Awesome, thank you.

916
01:00:53,374 --> 01:00:53,534
Sure.

917
01:00:54,855 --> 01:00:55,075
Hi.

918
01:00:56,016 --> 01:00:58,718
So in a game like this, that it's very...

919
01:00:59,887 --> 01:01:04,870
abstract and with a lot of feeling based design ideas.

920
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:11,735
How do you manage to balance keeping the vision that you have as a creative director and not like

921
01:01:12,055 --> 01:01:17,699
micromanaging the team and giving some freedom to the team to develop their own ideas?

922
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,581
Oh yeah, I don't know if I have. That's not really a question that I can answer

923
01:01:21,382 --> 01:01:23,763
one way or the other, but you know I'd say like the...

924
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:29,977
My attempt was to try to define things, I guess,

925
01:01:30,697 --> 01:01:34,841
in very specific kind of directions of like,

926
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:36,702
okay, we want it to feel like this,

927
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:38,363
but not necessarily prescribed.

928
01:01:38,464 --> 01:01:39,765
This is how we get there.

929
01:01:40,285 --> 01:01:41,646
But, you know, to leave things open.

930
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:43,367
Like I think coming up with three words

931
01:01:43,428 --> 01:01:45,349
is a good example of a place where, you know,

932
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:47,351
you can be specific about what you're looking for,

933
01:01:47,911 --> 01:01:49,632
but, you know, not being too prescriptive.

934
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:50,713
And I guess that just, you know,

935
01:01:50,753 --> 01:01:51,574
comes down to really like,

936
01:01:52,388 --> 01:01:57,190
defining the task and hopefully leaving enough room there.

937
01:01:57,331 --> 01:01:59,011
But I mean, I think as a creative director,

938
01:01:59,031 --> 01:02:00,592
one of the things that I've struggled a lot with

939
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:02,213
is people that don't want that freedom.

940
01:02:02,413 --> 01:02:06,115
Like, I think it's easier when people really are excited

941
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,336
about putting their own stamp on something,

942
01:02:08,436 --> 01:02:10,978
like assuming that they understand what the goals are.

943
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:13,239
But I think a lot of times people on the team,

944
01:02:13,499 --> 01:02:14,680
especially in our art department,

945
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,921
they really just wanted to be told what to make,

946
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:19,022
which is quite surprising.

947
01:02:19,843 --> 01:02:20,343
So I think.

948
01:02:20,934 --> 01:02:25,119
It's more so than the challenge of giving people creative freedom.

949
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:30,024
It's the challenge of understanding what kind of freedom people really want,

950
01:02:30,184 --> 01:02:31,205
and then giving that to them.

951
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:32,867
Thank you.

952
01:02:33,127 --> 01:02:33,287
Sure.

953
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:35,550
In the back.

954
01:02:36,231 --> 01:02:36,391
Hi.

955
01:02:38,073 --> 01:02:41,296
So, you said, don't give them the gun, right?

956
01:02:43,436 --> 01:02:50,198
And I understand that part of the feeling that you're trying to evoke, you said, is sort of being overwhelmed,

957
01:02:50,238 --> 01:02:55,559
and so you're constantly presenting these new gameplay ideas to the player, and that helps you tell the story.

958
01:02:56,279 --> 01:03:08,622
So how deep and complex of a mechanic could you present before you'd say it starts to distract from your ability to tell a story?

959
01:03:09,242 --> 01:03:10,663
Hmm. Um...

960
01:03:13,452 --> 01:03:15,174
Yeah, it's a good question, I guess.

961
01:03:15,294 --> 01:03:19,058
Because I noticed it was part of your design philosophy, but it was also part of your emotional message.

962
01:03:19,339 --> 01:03:24,003
So it's like when you design another thing with another emotional message, can you make deeper mechanics?

963
01:03:24,904 --> 01:03:25,865
Or will you lose your player?

964
01:03:26,346 --> 01:03:32,152
Yeah, I mean we tended to, for our prototypes, settle on fairly simple mechanics.

965
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:35,255
In some ways, you know, like they feel embarrassingly simple.

966
01:03:36,303 --> 01:03:42,767
And, you know, like Lewis is a good example of a mechanic that initially was very complicated

967
01:03:42,827 --> 01:03:46,489
when we were on the whiteboard describing how fish chopping should work.

968
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:49,431
And there was going to be a boss who was going to come around,

969
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:52,492
and there were going to be fish that you didn't want to chop and fish that you did.

970
01:03:52,512 --> 01:03:56,635
And what we found was just like in playtesting it,

971
01:03:57,435 --> 01:03:59,436
the player's focus was so divided.

972
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:02,638
So in that particular story, there just wasn't a lot of...

973
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:09,697
bandwidth. So I guess, you know, in answer to the question, we just would like try something and then we would see how much

974
01:04:10,497 --> 01:04:14,700
emotional kind of headspace the player had and trying to be conscious of

975
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:20,063
the things that are taking from that stockpile. Like there's like a limited amount of

976
01:04:20,744 --> 01:04:26,107
emotional attention that a player can give and on Edith Finch one of the things we were surprised about was when we would do the

977
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:31,510
longer play tests, the people playing the game, you know, beginning to end, that when they came into a story

978
01:04:32,043 --> 01:04:33,024
They weren't even really fresh.

979
01:04:33,484 --> 01:04:35,485
They were still thinking about the story before,

980
01:04:35,565 --> 01:04:36,605
and the story before that.

981
01:04:36,945 --> 01:04:40,487
And so in testing them in isolation,

982
01:04:40,507 --> 01:04:42,247
we would have a different experience from someone

983
01:04:42,648 --> 01:04:43,368
playing it all the way through.

984
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:47,709
So in our case, we tried to encourage players

985
01:04:47,769 --> 01:04:49,270
to stop after stories.

986
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,311
We would open the family tree, and Edith

987
01:04:51,371 --> 01:04:53,472
would talk a little bit and do a little drawing,

988
01:04:53,972 --> 01:04:56,493
just as a way of getting some of that attention

989
01:04:56,573 --> 01:04:59,814
back, because the stories for a lot of players

990
01:04:59,874 --> 01:05:01,335
are kind of emotionally draining.

991
01:05:02,396 --> 01:05:10,021
So it wasn't that we were designing complicated things to a certain level of complexity that we thought would be appropriate for the game.

992
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:11,682
It was more like just being...

993
01:05:11,702 --> 01:05:12,623
Like an emotion budget.

994
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:18,727
Yeah, yeah. Like taking the temperature in playtests and trying to figure out what kind of made sense.

995
01:05:18,927 --> 01:05:24,551
And in our case, it's kind of embarrassing how simple we could make things and get away with it.

996
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:29,994
Where no one complains that fish chopping needed to be more complicated because it's not really about the fish chopping.

997
01:05:31,215 --> 01:05:34,978
That is getting you to something else, and you're thinking about all these other things,

998
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:39,882
and our job is to kind of set the table for you, in this game anyway,

999
01:05:39,922 --> 01:05:44,885
that it was more about this context and creating that than it was about

1000
01:05:45,286 --> 01:05:47,887
digging really deeply into a particular mechanic.

1001
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,069
Okay, thank you so much.

1002
01:05:50,209 --> 01:05:50,369
Sure.

1003
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:55,893
Hi, thanks for a great talk and for making GameWare fish-shopping as a central mechanic.

1004
01:05:55,933 --> 01:05:56,814
You're welcome.

1005
01:05:56,834 --> 01:05:58,315
That was amazing. I love that sequence.

1006
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,436
So my question is...

1007
01:06:01,369 --> 01:06:04,431
Was there any prototype that you really, really loved,

1008
01:06:04,491 --> 01:06:07,093
but that didn't make it into the game because it didn't fit?

1009
01:06:09,034 --> 01:06:11,156
There wasn't anything that I'm heartbroken about.

1010
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:14,198
I mean, there are stories that we tried really hard on,

1011
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:16,960
like a story where you lean back and then look

1012
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,160
at the world upside down and things

1013
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:21,182
fall away from the earth, where we spent a long time.

1014
01:06:21,303 --> 01:06:24,064
But I think we got really good after a while,

1015
01:06:24,785 --> 01:06:28,748
painful lessons of realizing what we as a team did well

1016
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:30,789
and what was just kind of like.

1017
01:06:31,305 --> 01:06:36,587
I think there are some stories that work right away and it feels like you're bicycling downhill.

1018
01:06:36,987 --> 01:06:41,489
And then other stories, even though they may seem really cool, you just find even after,

1019
01:06:41,509 --> 01:06:44,810
you know, a couple of days of prototyping, it's like you're pedaling uphill.

1020
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:48,292
And you're like, wow, this is really fun, but I don't know if I want to keep pedaling for six months.

1021
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:51,993
So nothing that is like, oh, if only we had time.

1022
01:06:52,013 --> 01:06:54,934
I mean, Louis's story and Gregory's story almost got cut.

1023
01:06:55,254 --> 01:06:57,315
So those would have been like, oh man.

1024
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:01,913
I really wish we had these stories. You wouldn't believe what we had.

1025
01:07:02,273 --> 01:07:04,816
But no, nothing that I regret too much.

1026
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:06,017
Thank you.

1027
01:07:06,278 --> 01:07:08,180
Sure. OK, last question.

1028
01:07:10,523 --> 01:07:16,409
I really loved what you said about discovering what the game wants to be through the prototyping process.

1029
01:07:17,172 --> 01:07:23,516
I'm curious if you had any situations where in early prototyping you had sort of like variations

1030
01:07:23,576 --> 01:07:28,900
on a theme, like different prototypes that tested well, that fit within the overarching story but

1031
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,022
were like directly in competition with one another, that sort of like pulled it in different

1032
01:07:33,042 --> 01:07:37,866
directions but felt equally compelling to you as designers. And if you had that situation,

1033
01:07:38,486 --> 01:07:44,310
do you have any best practices for kind of like sifting through the data and figuring out what to

1034
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:44,730
up-rez?

1035
01:07:45,417 --> 01:07:52,162
Yeah, I don't think we had any prototypes where we liked both of them and they were like competing with each other.

1036
01:07:52,783 --> 01:07:56,605
Usually it was more the case of like, like the pedaling downhill thing.

1037
01:07:56,625 --> 01:08:01,349
I'm like, oh, well, this is clearly like a story that we should be doing more of.

1038
01:08:01,529 --> 01:08:03,730
And this other one, you know, is really frustrating.

1039
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:06,312
But I mean, certainly looking back on the original design,

1040
01:08:06,392 --> 01:08:09,635
it seems crazy that we would have spells or combat or things like that.

1041
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:12,136
But we never really got that far into it.

1042
01:08:12,196 --> 01:08:12,376
I think.

1043
01:08:13,091 --> 01:08:16,554
We just kept, you know, we made this pile of ideas

1044
01:08:16,574 --> 01:08:20,857
and then we would take the most interesting idea off the top of it for the next prototype.

1045
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:25,141
So we just kept, you know, kind of sorting that pile

1046
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:28,383
and if we had been making prototypes from the middle of the pile or the bottom,

1047
01:08:28,784 --> 01:08:31,186
you know, like the spellcasting ideas that we had,

1048
01:08:31,226 --> 01:08:34,488
like I'm sure we would have run into, you know, more conflictory stuff.

1049
01:08:34,548 --> 01:08:39,573
But I think just the evolutionary process of what should we work on next

1050
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,374
was enough to weed out...

1051
01:08:41,806 --> 01:08:43,748
A lot of the conflicting ideas.

1052
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:51,996
We also, early on, like our first two prototypes, like the large ones, ended up being the largest, most complicated stories we have in the game.

1053
01:08:52,357 --> 01:08:53,758
Molly's story and Lewis' story.

1054
01:08:54,218 --> 01:09:00,365
So in terms of like, how we prototype things, we kind of made stories that we really liked, but...

1055
01:09:00,895 --> 01:09:06,758
were in hindsight like insane that it would not just be like one mechanic but oh my god there's

1056
01:09:06,778 --> 01:09:11,301
like five different animals that you get to be in this story and you know these like stories

1057
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:15,823
that were combinations where we kind of got away from that from a production standpoint but I mean

1058
01:09:15,843 --> 01:09:20,566
it's nice that we had them because we could take those and eventually ship them but we could only

1059
01:09:20,606 --> 01:09:24,348
do that because we'd started them really early and we had years and years to keep working on

1060
01:09:24,388 --> 01:09:26,349
those stories we couldn't have continued to make

1061
01:09:26,968 --> 01:09:32,952
Prototypes like that. So in that way like they were successful. We like those stories, but they were all the cautionary tales of like

1062
01:09:33,392 --> 01:09:34,613
Let us never do this again

1063
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:39,276
We can you know, we have space for two of these in our hearts, but that is all

1064
01:09:40,377 --> 01:09:41,197
Thank you. Sure

1065
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:43,739
Alright, I think that's
