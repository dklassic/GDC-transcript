1
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:07,555
on Wednesday to our session, Rules of the Game,

2
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:10,655
five further techniques from rather clever designers.

3
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,456
I want to remind everyone to turn off your cell phones

4
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:13,836
or other noise-making devices.

5
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:16,277
Remember to fill out your evaluations after.

6
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,437
We really do appreciate the feedback in those.

7
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:20,298
And this is a session where we get

8
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:21,918
five illustrious designers to get up

9
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,058
and talk for 10 minutes each

10
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:25,779
about a rule they use in game design.

11
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:28,439
We've done this session for a number of years now.

12
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:30,380
You can go check out some of the previous editions

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,020
on The Vault.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,521
Some of them are up on YouTube as well

15
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,281
if you want to see them there.

16
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:38,683
But what do we mean by game design rules?

17
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:41,985
You know, I found that some designers are actually sort of resistant to this term,

18
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:44,267
that there being any sort of rules to game design.

19
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:47,849
My friend Daniel Cook, when we were talking about it, he said,

20
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:52,052
you know, rules are highly context-sensitive, rarely make interesting predictions for the project at hand,

21
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:53,693
and have very little analytical power.

22
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:55,193
I think he actually wrote that in an email.

23
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,553
He didn't say that in person.

24
00:00:56,633 --> 00:01:00,134
But he didn't think rules were maybe the way to be going.

25
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:04,775
And Eric Zimmerman, who authored the book Rules of Play

26
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:06,736
with Katie Salen, doesn't like rules either.

27
00:01:07,116 --> 00:01:08,956
He said, because game designers tend to be

28
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:10,217
structural analytical thinkers,

29
00:01:10,257 --> 00:01:12,037
coming up with grand sets of rules for good design

30
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:13,537
is very seductive, including for me.

31
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:16,138
Over the years, I have tried to cultivate skepticism

32
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:17,798
towards these kinds of systems.

33
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,987
So why do some people think of these rules as maybe being

34
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:23,429
too constraining on design?

35
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:26,251
Well, if we think of the digital games that a lot of us make,

36
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:29,474
the rules in them tend to be very fixed, very hard,

37
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:30,595
very fast.

38
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,597
There's only one way you can play the game,

39
00:01:32,637 --> 00:01:35,400
and the computer doesn't really take into account

40
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,242
your feelings when it decides on these rules

41
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:39,624
and decides on implementing these rules.

42
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:41,245
And you can't put the Tetris piece anywhere

43
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:42,627
but where Tetris will let you put it.

44
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:46,910
Things change a little bit in the board game space.

45
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,671
We've all heard about house rules with Monopoly, right?

46
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:50,591
Maybe you go over to a friend's house

47
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:51,732
and they play where you get all the cash

48
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:52,832
for landing on free parking.

49
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:55,233
Many other variants that allow the people

50
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:56,594
who are playing it to have a good time.

51
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:59,655
You might think chess has a more fixed rule set,

52
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:02,456
but if you might not have talked to my children about that.

53
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:06,920
When I was playing with them, I realized

54
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,902
they had worked out a very specific way to handle

55
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:11,344
when you get your pawn to the other side

56
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,365
and you get back another piece.

57
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:13,966
And I said, well, that's not really how this rule works.

58
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:15,187
And they didn't care.

59
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:21,413
And if anyone has been engaged in intense scrabble games

60
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:23,815
at friends' houses, often those have very personal rules

61
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:25,376
to keep them peaceable so they don't

62
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:26,397
turn into something like this.

63
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:31,623
You know, I find that, you know, some people get really into their Scrabble and really

64
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:32,965
into their weird set of rules for it.

65
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:36,188
I just love that this is the picture you get for Googling Scrabble fight.

66
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:41,544
But I think even more so when you move into the world of RPGs,

67
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:43,005
rules become even more malleable.

68
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,967
Like the goal of a DM is to sort of take

69
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:47,929
the players on a journey, like challenge them enough,

70
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:50,190
but not too much, not make their death arbitrary

71
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:53,753
and seem just a result of a bad die roll at the wrong time.

72
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,555
But to give them a chance, to change the rules a little bit

73
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:58,457
to help them move along in the campaign.

74
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:03,566
If we think about, too, if we move into a world of sort of art games and things like that,

75
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:07,568
this can be even more important, like in a game like Brenda Romero's Train, where,

76
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,950
you know, as you realize what the game is doing,

77
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,012
you realize that the deliberately limited rule set allows you to sort of subvert those rules

78
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,873
and try to stop what you realize you're doing.

79
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:19,690
Now, last year, Luke Muscat did a talk

80
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,731
as a member of this very session, which

81
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:22,731
I encourage you to go check out.

82
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:25,392
And he talked about, his whole point was forget rules.

83
00:03:25,432 --> 00:03:25,932
Rules don't matter.

84
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:26,733
Make goals your game.

85
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:28,353
That's what you should be giving your team, not rules,

86
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:28,914
but goals.

87
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:31,755
And he used slightly more colorful language

88
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,176
when he talked about it in the session.

89
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:37,538
So I gave my own version of this talk a few years ago

90
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:38,378
at another conference.

91
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,020
And this was where the talk was called,

92
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,801
What My Parents Taught Me About Game Design.

93
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,980
Now, my parents are not game designers.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,721
They haven't really played a lot of games, to be honest,

95
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,864
though my mom is a lifelong, to this day, baseball enthusiast.

96
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:55,667
But I use this talk as sort of looking

97
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:57,108
at how they have raised me as parents

98
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,910
and how that informed how I thought about players

99
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,311
and how you treat players in your game.

100
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:03,473
And this talk is up on YouTube if you

101
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:04,214
want to go check it out.

102
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:06,936
But I'll just give you a spoiler.

103
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,857
These were sort of the three principles that I found.

104
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,379
I extracted from how they treated me

105
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,320
and thought of how that's how I end up

106
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,561
treating my players in my games.

107
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:18,985
And I have a little bit of an addendum to this.

108
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:21,166
This is a picture that I like because it shows my dad,

109
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:23,488
but also my long flowing locks from long ago.

110
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,370
And in the last year, my dad actually passed away.

111
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:31,011
And as I was going through the process

112
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,912
of working on the eulogy and going through memorial service,

113
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:35,553
I ended up talking to a number of his students.

114
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:37,314
He was a lifelong psychology professor.

115
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:40,675
And they said that one thing he always said to them was,

116
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:42,496
are you asking the right questions?

117
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:44,656
So let me give you an example of what he meant by that

118
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,457
and how he interacted with me one time.

119
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:48,438
So he was a lifelong lover of books.

120
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:50,979
These are several of his favorite books that I now have.

121
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:55,082
And he talked about this one specific book that he gave me

122
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,043
was Powers of 10.

123
00:04:56,744 --> 00:04:59,147
So somewhere around when I was 8 or 10,

124
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,850
I had asked about the relative size of planets

125
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,551
or something like that.

126
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:03,952
I don't really remember what the question was.

127
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,274
And he didn't have the answer.

128
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:07,116
And a couple of days later, he came back with this book

129
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:07,797
and said, here you go.

130
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:09,519
And I said, what is this book?

131
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:10,760
And he's like, well, you're asking about planets.

132
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,341
It's all in there.

133
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,583
So this is a book that's, I don't know,

134
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:14,844
some of you may be familiar with it.

135
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,728
It's sort of a look at scale in the universe at large, right?

136
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:21,831
And it goes from a sort of an intergalactic scale

137
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,994
and zooms down more and more at orders of 10

138
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:27,396
as it gets closer and closer, till it finally

139
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:30,379
zooms through some guy's hand in a park in Chicago,

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,441
and then goes down to the subatomic level.

141
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,727
And again, this wasn't a book really suited to my age

142
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:37,228
at the time, but it had great pictures.

143
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:38,009
I found those cool.

144
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,770
And I've kept reading it over the years.

145
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,172
And it sort of just reframed the question.

146
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:44,493
Again, it was like, well, you're asking about size of planets,

147
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:45,634
but here I can answer that.

148
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,956
But here's this much more interesting set of questions.

149
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:50,037
This will expand how you're thinking

150
00:05:50,077 --> 00:05:52,899
about the subjects you're interested in.

151
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,481
So I appreciated that.

152
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,022
I appreciated that he challenged me that way.

153
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:58,244
And I encourage you, as you're looking at the talks we're

154
00:05:58,264 --> 00:06:01,427
going to have here today, to look at these not necessarily

155
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:03,989
as a rule you must follow, a rule that is exactly

156
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,051
the answer to your problems, but as something that just helps

157
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:08,794
you reframe a problem you may be having in game design.

158
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:11,116
It helps you do the game design work that we all

159
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:11,936
do in different ways.

160
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:12,297
Now.

161
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:17,553
I must confess my inspiration for this intro partly came from seeing Powers of X as a reference

162
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:18,995
in Sorin's talk coming up.

163
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:23,941
Aaron will also be asking you if you are asking the right questions of your players.

164
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:27,866
Later on, Stone will show you how he made a board game for a movie he was too young

165
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:31,871
to actually see, while Josh will tell you why he likes to write only half a story.

166
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,754
But first, we have Raph Koster.

167
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:38,217
Raph Koster is widely known for his work in online games,

168
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:39,538
going back to MUDs.

169
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,020
Since then, he went on to work on some

170
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,903
of the first commercial MMOs in Ultima Online, later Star Wars

171
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:45,304
Galaxy.

172
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:46,965
He now works as an independent designer

173
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:49,367
in a wide range of games, both digital and analog,

174
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:51,169
and a variety of game-related projects.

175
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:52,250
I give you Raph Koster.

176
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:02,824
Hi.

177
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:07,546
So this is like my little rule.

178
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:10,687
It doesn't really necessarily mean what it says.

179
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:16,010
This is an idea I've had more than once, right?

180
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,812
Like literally, I've now made four or five games

181
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:21,533
about trying to capture the feeling

182
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:23,053
of playing a kaleidoscope.

183
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:29,272
The thing about an idea like that is that it can really kind of go either way.

184
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:34,337
It can be about the math of kaleidoscopes, like how they tumble, or it can be about the

185
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:41,024
sensation of a kaleidoscope, like the human experience of tumbling or being lost in a

186
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:41,544
landscape.

187
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,517
I'd like to say you can start from either end, right?

188
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:48,300
I mean, have a strong idea for a game system,

189
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,862
a set of mathematical relationships,

190
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:55,227
a set of dynamics, or maybe you have a really strong narrative

191
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:58,090
or experiential idea, and that's fine.

192
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,094
Different designers often have really different tendencies,

193
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:02,454
right?

194
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,336
They'll start from one end or the other.

195
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,250
And that's perfectly fine.

196
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:12,272
Like, often board game designers start maybe with a bias towards the systems end.

197
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:17,414
And certainly AAA games often start with a bias towards the experience end,

198
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:19,855
art games, many indie games.

199
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:21,295
And we'd never say...

200
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:25,238
hey, you can reskin this Telltale game any way you want

201
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,079
and think that we still end up with anything

202
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,741
that we'd call the same game.

203
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:31,222
The experience wouldn't be intact.

204
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,584
But we'd also, we wouldn't say, hey,

205
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:35,205
let's swap out the conflict resolution

206
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:37,107
mechanic in poker either and think

207
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:38,748
that poker remains intact.

208
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,949
I mean, it changes it substantially.

209
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:46,032
Starting with either end, then, they're both super valid,

210
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:49,514
since by the time you're done, you really

211
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:52,275
kind of need to have both ideas in place.

212
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,596
You really need to have your experience and your system

213
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:55,616
idea in place.

214
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:01,298
Because after all, almost no games are purely experiences

215
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:02,759
or purely abstract.

216
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,500
It's just rarely a thing.

217
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:08,880
But starting from one end to the other

218
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,942
does have a whole bunch of implications.

219
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,044
And certainly in my experience, I've

220
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,366
found it's really important to move towards the middle

221
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:16,187
pretty quickly.

222
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:20,751
Like let's say you start from the system, which I often do,

223
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,573
especially because I'm doing a lot of tabletop work

224
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:22,993
these days.

225
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:25,916
If you don't move to the middle, you

226
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:28,418
can pretty quickly get stuck with an abstract game, which

227
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,041
FYI, abstract tabletop games are really hard to market.

228
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:35,698
You might end up with like really simplistic narrative.

229
00:09:35,738 --> 00:09:39,503
This is how you end up with, okay, so we'll provide the experience by wedging cut scenes

230
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:44,751
in between levels of something, you know, that kind of really simple way of providing

231
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,051
something.

232
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:52,273
Finding an experience or a metaphor that fits the system quickly is a better path,

233
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:57,757
even though a strong system idea can usually be skinned in a lot of ways, right?

234
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:02,420
Like, think of chess sets, for example, from Lord of the Rings to, you know,

235
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,723
I think in Theory of Fun I said chess boards designed around different types of snot, right?

236
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,084
You can play chess with all of those.

237
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:09,044
It's all good.

238
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:11,266
Well, maybe not the snot, but you know.

239
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:17,051
So if you start, though, from the narrative or experiential

240
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:20,334
end of things, there are pitfalls starting there, too,

241
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:20,934
right?

242
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:24,398
If you don't ever get around to developing a systemic core.

243
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:27,040
One of the biggest is your game's consumable,

244
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,623
and these days it might get consumed on Twitch

245
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:32,145
long before it gets played at all, right?

246
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:33,927
So that's a real risk these days.

247
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:38,853
you often have to spend disproportionately on content.

248
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:43,359
You might end up making tons of small mini games.

249
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,601
And of course, each of those is still a game

250
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:46,643
that you have to balance.

251
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:49,326
So it multiplies your testing time.

252
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:52,590
It multiplies all of the work, the system design work.

253
00:10:54,622 --> 00:11:00,425
All of these issues have to do with the fact that you can always layer missions and narrative

254
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:03,046
and static data on top of a sim, right?

255
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,807
It's really hard to go in the other direction.

256
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:12,671
Trying to add rich emergence to a game built out of data is usually somewhere between hard

257
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:13,431
and impossible.

258
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:18,533
We'll get into these development projects and think that a bunch of disparate pieces

259
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:22,755
of content will add up to a system and that just almost never happens.

260
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,978
It's just really unusual.

261
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:34,369
So this matters because game longevity, which matters to me because I want my art to live

262
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:38,894
for centuries, but also because it includes a bunch of stuff that drives revenue, if you

263
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:40,175
like eating, right?

264
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:45,718
It's driven by how much space the game can have, right?

265
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,621
And despite what we might want as creators,

266
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:52,122
a lot of the power in a game experience

267
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,724
actually comes from a loss of control, right?

268
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:58,226
It comes from letting players have the actual authority

269
00:11:58,266 --> 00:11:59,027
over the experience.

270
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:00,188
And so.

271
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:02,577
What gives that?

272
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,778
What is it that gives that core sim?

273
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,959
The three critical ingredients I end up looking for.

274
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,961
First is a space that is an interesting mathematical

275
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:13,661
or structural landscape.

276
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:17,642
And by this, I mean a physics system meets that.

277
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:19,983
Interesting relationships between objects,

278
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:23,484
like the relationships between suits and numbers and colors

279
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:26,425
and a deck of cards is an interesting landscape

280
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:27,446
of relationships.

281
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:31,526
I look for it to be simple with only a few rules,

282
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:35,347
even though it might have room for tons of data.

283
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:40,208
And what usually works is a way to have lots of kinds of data

284
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:43,048
that work on top of the same underlying sim.

285
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:46,389
And then you can stack as many separate rule systems

286
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:47,529
on the sim as you like.

287
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:50,090
So poker leverages the set of playing cards,

288
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,310
but so does blackjack, and so does go fish.

289
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,351
Pokemon leverages Pokemon types and attack types,

290
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:56,451
rich systems.

291
00:12:57,655 --> 00:13:01,120
And then lastly, I look for that set of relationships,

292
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,424
that sim, to not actually have implicit goals.

293
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:07,128
I want it to be a toy, right?

294
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,232
I want it to allow players to create their own goals

295
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:11,674
on top of the system.

296
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:15,918
It doesn't mean then that you can't layer goals on top of that, right?

297
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:17,399
You can have AI with goals.

298
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,702
It doesn't mean the game can't provide as many goals as you want.

299
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:23,084
It means the system itself doesn't imply them.

300
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:27,847
We choose them then based on the narrative or experience that we want to provide.

301
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,831
Because there's a difference between a system that all you can do is get to the other side

302
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:38,236
and a system that says, here's cool movement physics, let's build portal, right?

303
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:39,397
So.

304
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:42,903
Just some examples of how I've tried to leverage these.

305
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:46,466
Star Wars Galaxies, right, sadly departed,

306
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:50,529
was built entirely around real-time procedural terrain

307
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:52,370
that was generated around you as you walk.

308
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,373
And that sounds like it was a content tool.

309
00:13:57,707 --> 00:14:00,867
But it actually opened up all this emergent and narrative

310
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,948
gameplay because of the tools that it provided us.

311
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,489
And that was actually why I wanted it,

312
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:09,029
was for the game systems I can build on top of it.

313
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:10,690
Because we couldn't have had players

314
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,350
having massive rebel versus imperial wars

315
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,411
with destructible bases that could be built anywhere

316
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:19,952
on the map unless we had an underlying sim that provided

317
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,052
you fungible terrain.

318
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:28,429
There's this little game, happily not departed, 20 consecutive years as of September.

319
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,672
In this game we started out with a resource system that was intended to drive all the

320
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:35,092
AI.

321
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:40,555
Every object was made of abstract resource types, and all the AI in the game was designed

322
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,015
around Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

323
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,998
And this was a really cool, ambitious, crazy system that we weren't even able to ship with.

324
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:48,972
Because it broke.

325
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:53,733
But it didn't matter, because we'd set up that underlying resource model, and it was

326
00:14:53,953 --> 00:15:00,315
so powerful that even though the AI never made it out there, it unlocked everything

327
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:05,016
about things like the crafting system, which unlocked emergent things like color-coded

328
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:09,317
guild uniforms, player shops, player-driven economy, player-run cities and governments,

329
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:10,598
and all this crazy stuff.

330
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:11,414
Right?

331
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:17,826
And, of course, similar ideas are actually, you know, Minecraft uses an underlying resource

332
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:21,372
model and simple rules and look at all the amazing stuff that comes out of there, right?

333
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,722
And even in, also dearly departed,

334
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:29,282
even in really small, simple games like My Vineyard,

335
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:30,763
which is a game I did on Facebook,

336
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:32,043
you can see this idea working.

337
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:35,124
We knew what the experience we wanted was.

338
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,984
You run a vineyard, right?

339
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:37,984
I mean, pretty straightforward.

340
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:41,225
You might remember that in Facebook games back then,

341
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:43,545
the map would get bigger just by kind of growing

342
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:44,706
around the edge, right?

343
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:46,586
They'd just expand on all sides,

344
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:49,146
and objects were all one to a tile, right?

345
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:55,578
But we use this idea that, well, but the vineyard's yours,

346
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,663
so you would want to shape it.

347
00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,088
So we allowed you to carve away the forest.

348
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,943
step by step. Island Life, which was the game that immediately preceded this,

349
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:09,065
we think, we don't know, was the first Facebook game

350
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:12,387
that we know of that did this, and it allowed you to

351
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:16,650
make discovery the central idea of the game, which meant not just

352
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,752
discovering things that were hidden on the map, we did that,

353
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:23,354
but also discovering new kinds of grapes, new wine varietals,

354
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:25,035
new ways to do layout.

355
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:30,378
It made us think about placing objects at pixel granularity rather than tile granularity,

356
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:35,561
which hugely opened up the amount of play and led to crazy maps like this that just

357
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:37,582
couldn't be done in something like a farm build, right?

358
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:43,185
Huge explosions of creativity, which then led us into new features like maybe we could

359
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:49,188
have vineyard tours across all of the Napa-themed vineyards in the entire Facebook ecosystem.

360
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:50,889
And so...

361
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:57,863
It led then to having one of the highest ROIs at Playdom,

362
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,024
one of the highest retention figures at Playdom,

363
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,066
even though it didn't have anywhere near

364
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:05,529
the same size user base or daily revenue numbers, right,

365
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:07,210
as many of the other games.

366
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,093
But on a pound for pound in terms of how much we spent on it,

367
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,694
it actually was richer.

368
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:12,775
So,

369
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:19,458
Even if you begin with the idea of a particular experience you want to give players, my rule

370
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:25,880
now, my thought, my rule of thumb is the first thing you should do after that is start with

371
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,321
a sim.

372
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:32,103
I've just consistently found it to be super helpful for the eventual depth of the game.

373
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:33,484
So that's my rule.

374
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:39,646
If I have an experience I want to get across, the first thing I ask myself is how do I model

375
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,307
this experience as math?

376
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,808
And it ends up opening doors that I never expect.

377
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:46,792
That's my rule.

378
00:17:54,713 --> 00:18:00,120
you Raph. Our next speaker is known for her work on a wide range of smart fun games as

379
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,687
a teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon's Silicon Valley campus. Previously she led

380
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:11,033
design at Glass Lab and she's also the author of the Chaos Knight trilogy fantasy series.

381
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,535
I give you Erin Huffman-John.

382
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:22,452
OK.

383
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:25,015
So my name is Erin Hoffman.

384
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,058
John, I am obsessed with precision.

385
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,621
It makes me feel safe.

386
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,864
So I have a question for you.

387
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,407
How many of you come to GDC to learn?

388
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:35,490
Yeah, most of you, right?

389
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,231
That's why we're here, right?

390
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:37,073
I've got a question for you.

391
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:37,513
What's learning?

392
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:40,156
Yeah.

393
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:41,997
So you can answer this in a couple of seconds, right?

394
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,399
I would say that if you don't have a clean, fast answer to

395
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,460
this question, it is impossible for you to know

396
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,962
whether your mission to learn at GDC is successful or not.

397
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:54,265
So this is going to be my story of how I learned that

398
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:56,646
the way that I playtest and the way I think I playtest are

399
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:57,687
actually two different things.

400
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:02,150
And it also leads to my rule which is ask players the right questions.

401
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,372
So in 2011, I joined the Glass Lab.

402
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:09,394
It was a massive collaborative effort between a lot of acronyms.

403
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:16,118
So ETS, SRI, EA, Electronic Arts, IOP, the Institute of Play, all coming together to

404
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:21,462
try to bring AAA game development practices to education to create transformative database

405
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:21,782
about...

406
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:23,503
educational experiences.

407
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,564
And through the process of working in this collaboration,

408
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:29,085
I encounter people who are really masters in the art of

409
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,406
asking the right questions.

410
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:32,406
So one of our partners was ETS.

411
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:34,127
They make the SAT, more in acronyms.

412
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:38,609
And what the SAT is, is a incredibly carefully

413
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:41,050
constructed series of the right questions.

414
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,751
And we could argue about whether the SAT is good or

415
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:46,512
not, but at the end of the day, it is actually intended,

416
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:49,293
and you can Google this, to be a social leveling tool.

417
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:52,417
It means that wherever you come from, you can be measured

418
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:54,139
against the same razor as everyone else.

419
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,762
So it's intended to raise people up.

420
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,384
It might not be a great razor, because all of our razors are

421
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:00,846
flawed, but that's its purpose.

422
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:03,089
It's to achieve self-actualization, and that is

423
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:05,952
the purpose of education, is to take people and give them

424
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,455
the power to be able to become whoever they want to become.

425
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:11,831
And so in the process of creating those questions, we

426
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:14,234
have these incredibly thoughtful scientific people

427
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,577
telling us whenever we said, this is what we thought we

428
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,018
were doing, they would say, well, but have you thought

429
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:18,439
about this?

430
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,760
Because that's what science does.

431
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,921
It constantly questions.

432
00:20:21,662 --> 00:20:23,584
And at Glass Lab, we were trying to hit this incredibly

433
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:26,207
precise marker, which was to achieve a measurable

434
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:28,550
educational outcome using a video game.

435
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,912
And through the process of discovering how hard that was

436
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,834
with these people who were specialists in asking the

437
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:36,636
right questions, I realized how coarse our objectives

438
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:39,238
usually are in video games is to create fun.

439
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,380
And it might be like shooty fun, or puzzle fun, or fast

440
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,161
fun, but at the end of the day, it's fun.

441
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,363
If you want to go on a side mission, you can Google

442
00:20:46,423 --> 00:20:47,383
people having fun.

443
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:49,444
And you get lots of stock images like this, which is

444
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:50,224
really funny to me.

445
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:51,585
Because it's like, is this what we really

446
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,726
think having fun is?

447
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,207
And what's going on in the minds of each of these people?

448
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:56,327
Is it really fun?

449
00:20:56,728 --> 00:20:58,489
And that guy at the top, what's going on?

450
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,009
Like, and the relationship between them.

451
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,230
I could stare at this image for hours, but I'm not going

452
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,091
to do that, thankfully.

453
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:06,135
So we were actually given SimCity 5.

454
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:09,921
It was this beautiful game and allowed to

455
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:10,702
take it into schools.

456
00:21:10,742 --> 00:21:11,843
We had to make changes to it.

457
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:14,427
And we actually started with a bunch of the wrong questions,

458
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:15,769
because we had a lot of assumptions.

459
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,852
We thought that the question we were asking is,

460
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:19,874
here's all the stuff that SimCity can teach,

461
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:20,875
we just gotta pick a thing,

462
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:21,795
and we're gonna take it in schools,

463
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,277
it's gonna be awesome and easy, right?

464
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:25,018
Because SimCity is an educational game,

465
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:26,119
and teachers already use it.

466
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,982
But as we just started to move through each of these ideas,

467
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:31,663
we realized, oh no, that system doesn't work,

468
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,824
this one's full of misconceptions, this one's not right.

469
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,686
Finance, civil engagement, all of these things

470
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:37,827
that we think SimCity does,

471
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,208
because it feels like they do,

472
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:42,551
were not actually real when you try to look into the.

473
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:46,313
actual teaching science of how those things are taught inside of classrooms.

474
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:48,234
Which isn't to say that SimCity is bad.

475
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,276
I actually think that the people that make SimCity,

476
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:52,277
hi Stone, are wizards.

477
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:53,758
What they do is magical.

478
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:56,860
It's a game that makes you feel smart even if you're not smart.

479
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,181
You don't have to be smart in order to be good at SimCity

480
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,383
and yet it makes you feel powerfully intelligent

481
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,244
and that is a magical transformative thing.

482
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:07,926
But when you dig into each of these things, we tend to think of SimCity as like creating

483
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:09,527
a whole generation of civic planners.

484
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:14,048
But if you ask civic planners what SimCity does, they say, oh no, actually it's full

485
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:16,750
of all these misconceptions that might actually be harmful to our profession.

486
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,931
And by the way, the way that it portrays electricity is not at all right either, which of course

487
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:21,492
it's not right.

488
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:23,392
It's meant to feel right, not to be right.

489
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:25,413
And so eventually...

490
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:29,236
We landed on isolating one of the systems inside of SimCity,

491
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:31,877
the pollution system, that actually did both align

492
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:34,719
with middle school science standards and was right.

493
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,481
And we made a game out of that.

494
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,743
The way that we got to that was by stepping back and trying

495
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:41,504
to find the right question to ask.

496
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:43,786
We asked the question, how does SimCity make you feel?

497
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,628
And how does that feeling attach to something

498
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:47,669
that kids need to learn?

499
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:50,210
How can we transform them through the experience

500
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:51,151
of that feeling?

501
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:52,852
And once we started asking that question,

502
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,153
everything started getting easier.

503
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:58,374
And then we ultimately did make a game that teachers loved.

504
00:22:58,554 --> 00:22:59,834
Partly they already loved it, it's a great game.

505
00:23:00,154 --> 00:23:03,095
But also it gave them a way to bring it into classrooms in a

506
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:05,396
way that they hadn't been able to do before and it became

507
00:23:05,576 --> 00:23:06,216
quite popular.

508
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:08,777
And then we actually were trying to do data analysis to

509
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:11,458
try to actually turn SimCity into a test of sorts.

510
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:12,578
It was kind of a terrible idea.

511
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:15,039
But when you look at the data that was coming out of

512
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,819
SimCity, it was just this torrent of stuff that our

513
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:19,480
assessment experts could make no sense of

514
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,640
because it's so massive.

515
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,202
And so with our next game, we decided to start with the question at the core.

516
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:26,003
First we started with what should we teach?

517
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:29,164
We did this big meta-analysis, our learning designers attacked this, and

518
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:30,845
they eventually came up with argumentation.

519
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,506
Because it's under-taught, it's a leverage point, it's new,

520
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:34,867
teachers don't really know how to teach it.

521
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:39,249
And from there, we asked the question, what is the single most important thing we

522
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,330
could teach a sixth grader about argumentation?

523
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,652
And that question is at the heart of this game.

524
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:44,973
The mechanics are built from it.

525
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:46,774
Everything that we ask the player to do

526
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,957
is intended to perform the question of whether or not

527
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:52,279
they understand that, which means the game from its core

528
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:52,999
is built that way.

529
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,981
And then we used a pre and post test.

530
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:57,183
There's this idea, of course, from science, from education,

531
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:59,445
but it's something that you can do with a game, where you test

532
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,826
where the player is when they start,

533
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:03,088
you get them to play the game, you test to the other side.

534
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:05,009
And then you can iterate and discover

535
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,451
whether you're actually achieving your goals.

536
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:09,573
The end result was a statistically significant

537
00:24:09,653 --> 00:24:12,314
improvement in the kids' understanding of

538
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:12,995
argumentation.

539
00:24:13,015 --> 00:24:15,596
And this was also validated against an external measure.

540
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:18,858
So we had a separate test that we knew was already a valid

541
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:21,140
measurement of argumentation, stood our game up next to it,

542
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,881
and found a statistical increase.

543
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:25,102
I want to linger on that for a second, because this is the

544
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:27,644
young lady's illustrated primer, if you're familiar

545
00:24:27,724 --> 00:24:28,745
with Neil Stephenson.

546
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,887
This is the interactive object, which is infinitely

547
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,828
replicable, which can lift people up.

548
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:34,828
through education.

549
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:36,469
And I think that's a really powerful idea.

550
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:38,130
I hope that we make a lot more games this way.

551
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,831
So back to playtesting.

552
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:42,632
If you Google what you should ask when you playtest, you get

553
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:44,093
this kind of series of horrifying

554
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,093
questions from the internet.

555
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:48,034
At the end of the day, it's like, was it fun?

556
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:50,135
There's lots of variations on, was it fun?

557
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:52,156
And I have a lot of problems with that question.

558
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,238
Some better questions are things more like,

559
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:55,599
how should the player feel?

560
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,620
And these are questions that you have to ask yourself,

561
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,182
because in the process of discovering the right questions

562
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:01,242
that you need to ask players,

563
00:25:01,422 --> 00:25:03,324
you have to ask yourself the right questions

564
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:04,284
about what you're even making.

565
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:05,645
Because most of the time when we start,

566
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,386
we don't ask that question of ourselves

567
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:08,447
as precisely as we should.

568
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,013
So the usual play testing questions we tend to ask are

569
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:13,714
categorized as stupid questions and

570
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:14,615
usability questions.

571
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,896
The usability questions are actually really useful.

572
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,078
The game needs to be usable, software has to be usable.

573
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:21,860
But we ask these dumb questions about what part the

574
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,561
player likes best.

575
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:25,903
The real problem with a question like this is that

576
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:27,344
what you say is, was it fun?

577
00:25:27,724 --> 00:25:30,927
And what they hear is, please validate my existence, I might

578
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:31,888
kill myself if you don't.

579
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:35,049
They know what you're asking, and they see right through you.

580
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,489
So they're going to start gaming that question.

581
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:39,610
Binary questions are usually a bad idea with play testers

582
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,591
because they're going to try to find what you think

583
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:42,411
the right answer is.

584
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:44,572
And I would say about usability, though,

585
00:25:44,592 --> 00:25:45,792
you do have to fix the usability.

586
00:25:45,832 --> 00:25:46,993
The game has to be accessible.

587
00:25:47,053 --> 00:25:48,953
It has to be accessible to a specific audience

588
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:49,994
that you're intending to strike.

589
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:53,535
And in SimCity EDU, we actually had that problem in particular

590
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:56,116
because students of middle school age

591
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:58,556
were not necessarily the intended audience of SimCity.

592
00:25:58,576 --> 00:25:59,737
So there were a lot of adaptations

593
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:00,577
we had to make for that.

594
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,862
At the end of the day, what we were trying to do with SimCity EDU was actually, and Mars Generation 1,

595
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:10,545
a lot easier than what we have to do with commercial games because our objective was so precise

596
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:12,546
and we could just measure it and iterate against it.

597
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:16,228
What we're trying to do with video games is a lot more abstract than expressive.

598
00:26:16,248 --> 00:26:17,989
That's a hard thing to get a question around.

599
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:21,051
But I think that if you break down the idea of what fun is,

600
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:24,633
you can look at it through the lens of what specific emotions are being created.

601
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:27,395
What are the experiences that we want to evoke in a player?

602
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,516
And if you throw this sort of palette at them,

603
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:34,037
Then it gives you a razor against which to measure your intent versus what the player

604
00:26:34,077 --> 00:26:35,218
is actually experiencing.

605
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:36,718
So it gives you something testable.

606
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:39,159
We did this in Mars Generation 1 a little bit.

607
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:44,520
We mapped where the player would start emotionally and then where we wanted them to end up emotionally

608
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,601
and then we attached that to the idea of the competency itself.

609
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:51,162
So there's a transformation that we wanted to bring about that was purely emotional because

610
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:52,783
we knew that that's what games do.

611
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,643
They actually evoke feelings, all media do.

612
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:58,606
So I would say that what you do is identify the emotional

613
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:00,953
transformation that you want to bring about in the player.

614
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:03,400
And that starts with asking yourself the right questions.

615
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:06,239
The questions of what is my real intent?

616
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:08,139
What is the outcome that I want?

617
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,620
Is the intent that I have actually precise?

618
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,160
If I create these emotions,

619
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,781
is that unlike anything I've ever seen

620
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,121
or does it remind me of something else?

621
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:17,342
There's a lot of questions in that process.

622
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:19,822
Then you can actually create a pre and post test

623
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:21,583
or at least a series of survey questions

624
00:27:21,603 --> 00:27:23,303
if you don't want to think about it that scientifically

625
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:26,044
about what you're gonna ask players in order to reveal

626
00:27:26,304 --> 00:27:27,744
how will I know that they're feeling

627
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:28,585
what I want them to feel?

628
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:30,305
Because emotions are really hard to pin down.

629
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:34,648
And I would just linger on that for a moment too, to say you can use pre and post tests

630
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:38,410
in video game development. This is something that I don't think I've ever heard talked about,

631
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,632
but it's something that we can do, measuring both where they start as well as where they end up,

632
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,334
as opposed to just asking them at the end whether they liked it or not.

633
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:47,335
So again, good questions.

634
00:27:47,695 --> 00:27:49,975
What is the core emotion and the core emotional blend?

635
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:51,956
Is that blend unique?

636
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:55,497
And do my mechanics perform the feeling of that by themselves?

637
00:27:55,938 --> 00:27:57,798
If they don't, they're probably the wrong mechanics.

638
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:00,339
And then for players, what were you feeling?

639
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:01,820
What does this remind you of?

640
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,240
It's a whole little bit sideways.

641
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:04,341
It's not direct.

642
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:06,042
Because you ask a direct question, they're going to

643
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:08,303
game the question, which people who design the SAT

644
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:09,184
certainly know as well.

645
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:12,025
I would say as a warning that this can be a habit forming

646
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:12,486
process.

647
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:13,446
I hope that it is.

648
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:15,567
Because once you start to look at your game this way, with

649
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:18,409
this level of precision efficacy, it can become a

650
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:21,451
transformative process for your own development process.

651
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,732
And I would also say that it's okay to iterate the pre and

652
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:25,212
post test.

653
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:27,833
Something that I think we didn't realize was that if you

654
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:29,754
start out with the wrong questions, we thought, oh,

655
00:28:29,994 --> 00:28:30,395
we're screwed.

656
00:28:30,415 --> 00:28:30,915
That's terrible.

657
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:31,635
It's not.

658
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:34,256
Part of the process of the process of using these

659
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,857
questions is to sharpen your idea of your intent.

660
00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:38,958
So you can change the questions and then keep

661
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:39,738
working against them.

662
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:41,679
And that's it.

663
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:42,620
Thank you very much.

664
00:28:52,904 --> 00:28:55,926
Next up, we have someone who is most known for perhaps

665
00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:58,707
for his involvements with Civilizations 3 and 4.

666
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:01,569
He now runs indie studio Mohawk Games,

667
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:05,411
who shipped not that long ago Economic RTS Off-World Trading

668
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:08,432
Company and recently announced their next game is 10 Crowns.

669
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:10,873
He's also on the advisory board for this very conference,

670
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:12,274
so you can direct your complaints to him.

671
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:13,755
I give you Soren Johnson.

672
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:16,957
Thank you.

673
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:21,339
Hey, everybody.

674
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:27,125
All right, so three strikes and you're out.

675
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:30,731
This phrase is so common, it's basically an idiom.

676
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,914
Indeed, while some of our non-American friends here

677
00:29:32,994 --> 00:29:34,797
might be baffled by baseball in general,

678
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:36,740
they probably still know this rule.

679
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,341
However.

680
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:39,499
It's not actually true.

681
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,720
The batter is not out after the third strike.

682
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:44,621
It's only when the catcher catches the ball

683
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:46,442
that the batter is out.

684
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:48,723
If the catcher drops or misses the pitch,

685
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:50,864
then the batter is not out and has a chance

686
00:29:50,884 --> 00:29:51,805
to advance to first.

687
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:54,066
This almost always results in an out

688
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,766
as the catcher simply picks up the ball

689
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:56,727
and makes the easy throw.

690
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,708
But occasionally, this little-known rule

691
00:29:58,748 --> 00:30:01,629
can become a big deal, as it did in last year's final game

692
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:03,750
in the playoff series between the Chicago Cubs

693
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,931
and the Washington Nationals.

694
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:09,794
Max Scherzer threw a third strike past a swinging Javier Baez, but watch what happens.

695
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:17,879
The Nationals catcher Matt Wieters missed the ball between his legs, allowing Baez to safely

696
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,202
make it to first base. This would have been the third out of the inning. Instead, the Cubs scored

697
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:26,865
two more runs and later won the game by only one run in advance to the next round. Thus,

698
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:31,668
an obscure rule knocked the Nationals out of the playoffs. Where exactly did this rule come from?

699
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:36,156
It actually reaches back to the very first time

700
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:38,136
the rules of baseball were put down in print

701
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,817
by the German Johann Christoph Friedrich Gutsmuth.

702
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:44,958
He outlined something called English baseball, which

703
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:48,339
was a game of innings with a batter, fielders, safe bases,

704
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,359
and scoring at home plate.

705
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,820
However, there were no strikes or balls yet.

706
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,900
The pitcher stood close to the batter

707
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,141
and more or less delivered the ball as a soft lob to be hit.

708
00:30:57,641 --> 00:30:59,441
The pitcher wasn't trying to challenge the batter.

709
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:01,982
The game was about fielding the ball after it had been hit.

710
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:06,145
However, what happens when there is a terrible batter who

711
00:31:06,185 --> 00:31:06,925
can't hit anything?

712
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:09,967
In Gutsmith's game, he has special rule for this

713
00:31:09,987 --> 00:31:13,510
situation. On the third swing, the ball is automatically in

714
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,950
play, whether it's hit or not.

715
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:21,035
So the batter will run to first either after hitting the

716
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:22,556
ball or missing for the third time.

717
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:25,037
Indeed, there is no catcher to receive the ball, so the

718
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:27,139
pitcher would need to run to home plate to pick it up and

719
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:27,699
throw to first.

720
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:32,674
In 1845, the American Knickerbocker Baseball Club

721
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:34,095
writes down their rules for the game,

722
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:35,215
and some things have changed.

723
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:38,037
The pitcher is now much farther from the batter

724
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:39,958
and throws the ball horizontally,

725
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,119
which requires the new position of catcher.

726
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,361
However, they preserve the logic of the old gutsmith's rule,

727
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,023
that the ball's in play after the third miss swing,

728
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:50,024
like old legacy code lying around.

729
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:52,645
The strikeout is actually emergent gameplay

730
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:53,886
because after the third miss,

731
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,907
the ball is now technically in play,

732
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,548
and the catcher turns it into an out

733
00:31:57,728 --> 00:31:58,729
by simply catching the pitch.

734
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,541
Thus, there is no actual difference between the catcher

735
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:04,684
making it out from catching a pop-up

736
00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:06,746
and the catcher making it out from catching the pitch

737
00:32:06,906 --> 00:32:08,007
after a third missed swing.

738
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:10,270
In each case, the ball is now live,

739
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,292
and the catcher makes it out by catching the ball

740
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:13,093
before it hits the ground.

741
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:17,382
However, they had to patch the game later on because of an

742
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:19,964
unintended consequence of not taking the time to make the

743
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,106
strikeout an official rule.

744
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,888
Because the ball would be considered live after a third

745
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:27,191
strike, the possibility for a cheesy double or

746
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:28,171
triple play existed.

747
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:31,234
For example, if the bases are loaded, then the catcher can

748
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:35,858
intentionally drop the ball, pick it up again, step on home

749
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:38,481
plate for an easy out, and then throw to third, and then

750
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:39,622
onto second for two more.

751
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:45,026
Therefore, in 1887, they added a new rule so that the batter would automatically be

752
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:50,750
out if a runner was on first base and there were less than two outs.

753
00:32:51,191 --> 00:32:55,974
Thus, three strikes and you're out, the way everyone assumes baseball is played, is true,

754
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,097
but only under a very specific set of circumstances.

755
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:03,320
They opted for an ugly patch instead of just rewriting the rules to match how the game

756
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,321
was actually being played.

757
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,372
Indeed, think about the situation with Javier Baez.

758
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:10,253
There was a runner on first base.

759
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,174
So even though the catcher dropped the ball,

760
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:15,216
it should have been a strikeout, except there were two outs.

761
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:17,457
So now we're back to the original drop third strike

762
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:17,898
rule again.

763
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:18,998
Think about it.

764
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:20,319
They could have just rewritten the rule

765
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,781
so that three strikes and you're out applies at all times.

766
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:24,802
Wouldn't that be simpler, more intuitive?

767
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:27,684
Why go to the trouble of fixing the one glaring issue

768
00:33:27,724 --> 00:33:29,505
with catchers intentionally dropping the ball

769
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:31,966
and not just get rid of the old vestigial rule?

770
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:37,397
The reason is that we inherit our game design from everything

771
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:38,477
that comes before us.

772
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:40,979
Sometimes this inheritance is obvious.

773
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:44,921
Civ 6 inherited from Civ 5, which inherited from Civ 4,

774
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:45,541
and so on.

775
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:49,443
Sometimes a designer inherits from the games

776
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:50,944
he or she played as a kid.

777
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:53,925
Mario led to Braid, Myst led to The Witness.

778
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:57,564
Sometimes games inherit from themselves.

779
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,467
This is a timeline of the development of our economic RTS,

780
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:02,388
Off-Road Trading Company,

781
00:34:03,428 --> 00:34:05,650
and you might make certain development shortcuts

782
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,791
or hacks early on,

783
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:08,993
just so that you can get your prototype playable.

784
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:12,296
But then these assumptions are now baked into your design,

785
00:34:12,336 --> 00:34:13,497
whether you want them there or not.

786
00:34:13,857 --> 00:34:16,119
You have to remember that it was an accidental

787
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,040
or arbitrary choice.

788
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,245
The most common thing to inherit, however,

789
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:24,045
is game mechanics, usually from the games in the same genre.

790
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:27,186
For example, although Offroad Trading Company is an RTS,

791
00:34:27,346 --> 00:34:29,047
it's notable for being one without units.

792
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:31,928
However, we didn't start there, as we inherited

793
00:34:31,948 --> 00:34:34,989
from all the other RTSs before us, StarCraft, Age of Empires,

794
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:35,529
and so on.

795
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:39,250
Thus, we had scouts, builders, transports, pirate ships,

796
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,290
police ships, and so on.

797
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:46,990
Over time, we discovered that this inheritance was weighing the game down, forcing the player

798
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,414
to spend time wrangling units that would have been better spent playing the market.

799
00:34:50,974 --> 00:34:52,937
Slowly, we took these units out one by one.

800
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:57,321
First the transports, then the combat units, then the builders, and finally the scouts.

801
00:34:58,082 --> 00:35:01,646
The game looks like a radical break with the past, but it took us a long time to get there.

802
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:06,093
The problem is that iterative design can be a trap,

803
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:08,774
that you can no longer see those parts of your game

804
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:11,034
that are holding you back from a much better design.

805
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:12,955
It's easier to make small changes

806
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:15,556
that fix glaring issues, rather than to re-evaluate

807
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:16,416
your entire design.

808
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,557
Sometimes, a problem with a game's inheritance

809
00:35:20,657 --> 00:35:22,278
can be at the conceptual level.

810
00:35:22,918 --> 00:35:23,818
Consider Spore.

811
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:26,822
which was conceived of as a powers of 10 game

812
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,963
that went from cellular scale all the way up

813
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:29,823
to galactic scale.

814
00:35:30,223 --> 00:35:32,024
That was the hook, the point of making the game.

815
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,185
This part of the game was widely seen as a disappointment,

816
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,186
that the five disparate levels felt like

817
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:38,906
five different games duct taped together.

818
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,527
However, something interesting happened

819
00:35:41,547 --> 00:35:42,608
with the failure of Spore,

820
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:46,009
which is that it wasn't actually a failure after all.

821
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,710
This is how many people are playing Spore right now,

822
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,751
which is not bad for a 10 year old game.

823
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:56,044
In fact, check out this chart which compares Spore to the two most successful PC games

824
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:57,005
released that same year, 2008.

825
00:35:57,385 --> 00:36:03,209
Spore currently outpaces them both, and keep in mind that Spore didn't even launch on Steam.

826
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,293
What happened was that the most interesting part of the game did not come from the Power

827
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:12,716
X concept, but from the editors inside the game, especially the creature creator, which

828
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:14,858
dynamically animated the player's creations.

829
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,012
However, these editors were developed midway through the project.

830
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:22,975
Maxis started making a game about one thing and accidentally ended up making a game about

831
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:23,475
something else.

832
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:28,079
One of the big unanswered questions about Spore is what could we have done if we had

833
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:31,921
been able to ditch the powers of ten concept and refocus the game on the editors?

834
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,587
So here's a classic case study in inheriting bad design.

835
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:40,570
Creep denial is a mechanic in the original Dota

836
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,332
where you kill your own units to keep your opponent

837
00:36:43,352 --> 00:36:44,933
from getting gold and experience from them.

838
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:47,655
Indeed, creep denial is one of the focal points

839
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,856
of high level play in Dota to maximize

840
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:52,238
your experience point gain relative to your opponents

841
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:52,979
to out-level them.

842
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,180
However, it's an open question whether

843
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,681
this is actually good design.

844
00:36:57,956 --> 00:37:00,738
At the very least, creep design is accidental design,

845
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:03,039
because Dota inherited it from Warcraft III.

846
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,401
This was simply how that game handled killing your own units.

847
00:37:06,962 --> 00:37:08,603
Indeed, the fact that Warcraft III even

848
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,064
allowed killing your own units was likely an afterthought

849
00:37:11,084 --> 00:37:11,805
by the designers.

850
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:17,170
So, Dota inherited this rule because the game was literally built inside of Warcraft 3 as a

851
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:22,856
mod. Thus, MOBAs inherited a ton of design and mechanics from Warcraft 3. The original

852
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:27,100
Dota designers may have wanted many things to work differently, but they really didn't have

853
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:30,845
much of a choice given the limitations and assumptions of the Warcraft 3 editor.

854
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:40,493
Dota 2 and League of Legends, of course, inherit their design from the original Dota mod, but they made different choices about their inheritance of creep denial.

855
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:43,458
Basically, League dropped it while Dota 2 kept it.

856
00:37:45,414 --> 00:37:48,577
This is a Reddit thread on why Creep Denial is not in League.

857
00:37:48,637 --> 00:37:53,000
Don't worry about reading this, I just want to point out how a random Dota guy is trying

858
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:57,104
to explain why Creep Denial is bad for the design using the game mechanics themselves.

859
00:37:57,564 --> 00:38:01,948
This is pretty typical reasoning for something that has become part of a game design's inheritance.

860
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,231
The burden of proof is always on why it should be removed from the game, not on how it got

861
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:07,232
added in the first place.

862
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:11,355
However, I have a simpler explanation for why Creep Denial is a bad design.

863
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:18,806
I mean, come on, you want your players to be spending their time killing their own units?

864
00:38:19,406 --> 00:38:21,769
Is that really a core part of what makes MOBAs work?

865
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:24,332
The game would fall apart if you couldn't kill your own guys?

866
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:28,497
Aden perhaps sums it up better than I ever could.

867
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,233
So at some point, you have to step back as a designer

868
00:38:40,313 --> 00:38:41,755
and reevaluate your inheritance.

869
00:38:42,356 --> 00:38:44,679
Does the core gameplay survive without the feature?

870
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,202
Is the feature unintuitive, making the game harder

871
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:48,363
to understand or to pick up?

872
00:38:48,884 --> 00:38:50,285
Is there a better way for players

873
00:38:50,325 --> 00:38:51,907
to be spending their time than on this feature?

874
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:56,067
In the case of Creep Denial, the answer to all those questions suggests that the game

875
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:57,128
would be better off without it.

876
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:01,631
There is only one magical core feature to MOBAs, the one feature that cannot be dropped,

877
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:06,575
and that is taking the scope and complexity of an RTS, but focusing the player's controls

878
00:39:06,715 --> 00:39:12,400
onto just one unit, which makes the game accessible to a much larger audience by an order of magnitude.

879
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:17,604
Everything else, everything else is just accidental inheritance resulting from the game's origin

880
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:18,605
as a Warcraft 3 mod.

881
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:23,599
In fact, although League doesn't have creep denial now, they actually started with it.

882
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,542
These are League of Legends' very first patch notes, published in July 2009.

883
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:33,006
They inherited creep denial, but as you can see, you know, highlighted here, they killed it very

884
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:37,670
early. So although they got it from the original mod, they were willing to critically examine

885
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,430
their game's past.

886
00:39:40,108 --> 00:39:43,491
In contrast, here's the history of creep denial from Dota 1 to Dota 2.

887
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:47,454
You can see an awareness that creep denial might not be the best thing for the game.

888
00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:50,597
So look at, like, for instance, 6.82.

889
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:52,899
Denied creeps now give less experience.

890
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:57,563
A clear sign that they want to weaken this feature by rewarding players less for focusing

891
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:58,224
on creep denial.

892
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:02,147
However, instead of ripping it out, they're making small changes around the edges.

893
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,610
Basically, they're doing what baseball did when they patched

894
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,331
the drop third strike rule by making it not apply in certain

895
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:11,691
circumstances instead of just getting rid of the rule itself.

896
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:15,752
Remember my questions on the value of creep denial? Does the

897
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:18,233
core gameplay survive without the feature? Is the feature

898
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:20,973
unintuitive, making the game harder to understand or to pick

899
00:40:21,053 --> 00:40:23,354
up? Is there a better way for the players to be spending their

900
00:40:23,374 --> 00:40:26,535
time than on this feature? Running this exercise with the

901
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:29,735
drop third strike rule gets us to the same place. That is bad

902
00:40:29,855 --> 00:40:32,056
accidental design that is ultimately hurting baseball.

903
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,592
Now here's a comparison of the two games and some other MOBAs.

904
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,656
There are many reasons why League outpaces Dota by an order of magnitude.

905
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:45,540
An almost three-year head start is a pretty big one, but I also believe that Riot's philosophy

906
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,004
of re-examining their inheritance from the original Dota mod, which extends well beyond

907
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:52,066
just removing creep denial, is a very important piece.

908
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,152
Now, I also have thoughts about last hitting,

909
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,653
but fortunately, I don't have time for that.

910
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:03,375
I say fortunately, because Heroes of the Storm, which

911
00:41:03,415 --> 00:41:05,415
is the only one of these three to drop last hitting,

912
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:07,896
is less successful than Dota 2, let alone League.

913
00:41:08,317 --> 00:41:10,137
Thus, I can't really make an argument

914
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,658
that the market has proven that last hitting is bad design.

915
00:41:13,178 --> 00:41:14,219
Further, I don't think it would be

916
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,440
reasonable to expect Riot to experiment with dropping

917
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,400
last hitting at this point.

918
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:19,641
It's just too late.

919
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:22,024
League is one of the world's most popular games.

920
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:25,611
Indeed, they are lucky that they dropped Creep Denial so early in their development before

921
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,574
doing so might have split community opinion.

922
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,552
We don't always have the luxury of looking at the game

923
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:33,273
to prove our decisions, which is why

924
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:34,894
re-examining the game's inheritance

925
00:41:34,914 --> 00:41:36,575
is such a difficult and important issue.

926
00:41:37,256 --> 00:41:38,557
Choosing to erase your inheritance

927
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:39,638
takes real bravery.

928
00:41:40,158 --> 00:41:43,460
Sometimes you have to trust your own rational design process

929
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,261
if you see a problem.

930
00:41:44,701 --> 00:41:46,042
Sometimes you have to go with your gut.

931
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:48,604
Ultimately, you must be willing to see your history,

932
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:50,745
know how it led you to where you are today,

933
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:52,587
and then have the courage to drop the past.

934
00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:54,348
Thank you.

935
00:42:03,616 --> 00:42:06,757
Next up, our next speaker has been making RPGs

936
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:08,858
for quite some time, going all the way back to his work

937
00:42:08,918 --> 00:42:11,458
at the illustrious Black Isle Studios on Icewind Dale.

938
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,479
After a stint working near me on a gauntlet game

939
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:15,379
that we don't need to speak about,

940
00:42:15,419 --> 00:42:18,080
Josh moved on to Obsidian, working on titles like

941
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,501
Fallout, New Vegas, and the Pillars of Eternity series

942
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:23,202
with Pillars of Eternity 2, Deadfire, Shipping Soon.

943
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:24,342
I give you Josh Sawyer.

944
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:32,999
Hello.

945
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,880
By the way, if you want to deal with a nightmare of legacy

946
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,722
design, make a party-based fantasy role-playing game.

947
00:42:42,623 --> 00:42:43,043
For real.

948
00:42:44,624 --> 00:42:47,685
All right, my talk is about how I always try to give 50%,

949
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:52,568
or how I learned when to stop telling a story and let the

950
00:42:52,588 --> 00:42:53,208
player tell theirs.

951
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:59,710
If any of you have played in a D&D game,

952
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,031
or run a D&D game, or any sort of tabletop role-playing game,

953
00:43:03,071 --> 00:43:04,472
you have probably had an experience

954
00:43:05,112 --> 00:43:07,553
where your players take the story off of the rails.

955
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:10,234
A lot of computer role-playing games

956
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,895
try to emulate the tabletop role-playing game environment.

957
00:43:12,935 --> 00:43:14,276
We do this in a lot of different ways.

958
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:17,037
We can try to emulate the rules themselves.

959
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,218
We can try to emulate the aesthetics.

960
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,499
whether that's in the lore or the visuals of the game.

961
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,142
But in a lot of cases, especially at Obsidian,

962
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:26,524
what we're trying to emulate is player choice,

963
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:28,706
player choice and player consequence

964
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:30,107
within the context of a story.

965
00:43:30,467 --> 00:43:31,928
Being able to make your own character,

966
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:34,390
express that character, and have it

967
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:35,571
have an impact in the world.

968
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:41,061
In my experience, playing tabletop games and running tabletop games,

969
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:44,624
the best dungeon masters and game masters are the ones who improvise.

970
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:48,988
They construct some idea of a grand story, or maybe they just have parts of a

971
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:49,969
neat story in their mind,

972
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:53,172
and when the players screw it up, they don't fight against it.

973
00:43:53,552 --> 00:43:56,735
They let the players go, and they let the story run away,

974
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,378
and everyone has a great time. Because it's a little bit of what the dungeon master

975
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:02,760
prepared, and it's a lot of what the players brought to it as well.

976
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:08,620
in a CRPG outside of the mechanical systems, which

977
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,442
is, I think, an interesting contrast.

978
00:44:10,462 --> 00:44:11,563
Because if you look, for example,

979
00:44:11,603 --> 00:44:14,126
at a game like Divinity Original Sin 2, which

980
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:16,928
is much more oriented around the play of the game

981
00:44:16,968 --> 00:44:18,430
and experimentation with things.

982
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:21,052
versus something like Pillars of Eternity,

983
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,093
which is more traditional and sort of tabletop based,

984
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:26,136
we're not there to improvise with the gameplay content.

985
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,838
So what we have to do when we're constructing the story

986
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:32,200
is effectively try to think about a wide range of players

987
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,982
sitting across from us and imagine the types of things

988
00:44:35,002 --> 00:44:36,183
that they wanna throw back at us.

989
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,625
Ideas about what types of characters they wanna play,

990
00:44:39,465 --> 00:44:41,207
anything from the sort of equipment that they brought,

991
00:44:41,507 --> 00:44:43,088
their background, what spells they have,

992
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:45,470
what skills they have, if they wanna be an asshole,

993
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,811
if they wanna be a smart ass, all of this sort of stuff.

994
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:50,430
By the way, it's not exactly 50%.

995
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:52,111
That's just an idea.

996
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:56,295
So I'd like to talk about some of the ways at Obsidian that

997
00:44:56,335 --> 00:45:01,318
we try to step away from really being strict about how we

998
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,261
author the story and let the player bring their own sort of

999
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:05,261
ideas into it.

1000
00:45:05,822 --> 00:45:08,424
One of this is trying to eliminate as many critical

1001
00:45:08,484 --> 00:45:11,206
characters as we can from our stories, letting the player

1002
00:45:11,246 --> 00:45:12,447
kill virtually everyone.

1003
00:45:12,887 --> 00:45:14,688
Here are a few examples of this in play.

1004
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:19,850
The first is Yes Man, Eternal Yes Man from Fall at New Vegas.

1005
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:23,872
In Fall at New Vegas, you could kill every single character

1006
00:45:23,892 --> 00:45:25,812
in the world except for children.

1007
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:29,653
And there was one character who was a fall-through character.

1008
00:45:29,713 --> 00:45:30,533
His name was Yes Man.

1009
00:45:30,573 --> 00:45:31,954
He was a robot who would do literally

1010
00:45:31,974 --> 00:45:33,034
whatever you asked him to do.

1011
00:45:33,714 --> 00:45:35,935
And he was the fall-through, so he would help you

1012
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:36,995
with the independent path.

1013
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,936
And even if you pissed off every single other faction head,

1014
00:45:40,216 --> 00:45:42,677
you could still go back to Yes Man to progress the plot.

1015
00:45:43,217 --> 00:45:44,478
So we wrestled with the idea of, well,

1016
00:45:45,478 --> 00:45:48,919
if he's your fall through and he allows you to get through the plot, how are we going

1017
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:53,081
to stick to our guns and say, um, let the player kill them? Well, the lucky thing is

1018
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:57,122
that he's a robot and he's an AI that gets downloaded into other robots. So we actually

1019
00:45:57,162 --> 00:46:01,824
allowed the player to just blast Yes Man right in the face and he would die and then a minute

1020
00:46:01,864 --> 00:46:06,606
later another Securitron robot with his face would roll on up and he would say, I'm sorry,

1021
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:11,207
I must have made you really angry. I'll try not to do that again in the future. Now how

1022
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:11,788
can I help you?

1023
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:19,030
So technically we adhere to this while still allowing the player the agency to pull out whatever weapon they wanted and blowing them away

1024
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,292
And by the way, a lot of players did do this every time they'd go back to talk to yes, man

1025
00:46:23,632 --> 00:46:26,133
They get a new mission objective and they'd say hey, thank you. Thanks, man

1026
00:46:26,293 --> 00:46:30,454
Blam and they'd walk out the door and then they'd come back get a new mission objective. Thanks again. Yes, man

1027
00:46:30,494 --> 00:46:31,455
You're the best Blam

1028
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:37,657
Another example of this in play is the blood pool from pillars of eternity

1029
00:46:38,697 --> 00:46:41,198
We put a lot of effort into our companions

1030
00:46:42,955 --> 00:46:43,696
Arguably too much.

1031
00:46:44,397 --> 00:46:46,098
We write a lot of companion dialogue.

1032
00:46:46,118 --> 00:46:48,200
We spend a lot of resources on unique character art,

1033
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,982
but we don't require the player

1034
00:46:50,002 --> 00:46:51,543
to take these characters along with them.

1035
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:53,225
We don't require them individually.

1036
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:54,386
We don't require them as a group.

1037
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:56,427
You can play through these games completely by yourself

1038
00:46:56,487 --> 00:46:57,068
if you want to.

1039
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,472
Sometimes you might even really despise a companion.

1040
00:47:01,912 --> 00:47:04,655
So we added the blood pool in Pillars of Eternity.

1041
00:47:05,015 --> 00:47:06,516
It is a pool full of blood.

1042
00:47:07,137 --> 00:47:08,539
dedicated to a crazy god.

1043
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:12,323
And at the blood pool, you can sacrifice a companion that you really just don't like,

1044
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:13,604
and you can get a stat boost out of it,

1045
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:17,489
and every one of your other companions is extremely horrified by what you've just done,

1046
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:18,790
and you can do it.

1047
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:22,935
By the way, if you bring your save game into Pillars of Eternity 2 Deadfire,

1048
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,697
we remember that you did that.

1049
00:47:25,418 --> 00:47:26,139
So get ready.

1050
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:33,111
Some other stuff that we try to do is account for the weird and the funny.

1051
00:47:33,512 --> 00:47:38,215
By the way, this is a place where really we're starting to get away from the idea of system-driven design.

1052
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:43,559
This is more about, again, these like sort of weird edge cases that you come up with where, you know,

1053
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,780
how many times have you been in a tabletop game?

1054
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:48,142
I'm just assuming everyone plays a ton of tabletop games.

1055
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:51,265
And a player tries to do something really weird.

1056
00:47:51,325 --> 00:47:53,867
They have some desperate, like, they have some item

1057
00:47:53,907 --> 00:47:55,669
they try to use in some last ditch effort,

1058
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:58,411
and they manage to save the day, and it's really great.

1059
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:00,473
So we try to figure out ways to account

1060
00:48:00,493 --> 00:48:02,154
for these really weird situations.

1061
00:48:02,515 --> 00:48:04,737
It's a niche of a niche, but when players find it,

1062
00:48:05,397 --> 00:48:07,559
and we hope that a player will find one of these things

1063
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:09,561
in every playthrough, they feel really rewarded

1064
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:11,863
for just carrying some stupid crap around with them

1065
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:13,325
or picking one special background

1066
00:48:13,345 --> 00:48:14,926
that comes up in a really cool circumstance.

1067
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:18,406
One example is the corpse checker from Icewind Dale 2.

1068
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:21,327
One of our designers at the time, Damian Filetto,

1069
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:25,988
he realized that there were three quests in the game that

1070
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:28,009
required you to carry around a dead body.

1071
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,250
And we never got rid of those dead bodies.

1072
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,371
So you could be carrying around a dead man, a dead woman,

1073
00:48:34,731 --> 00:48:35,432
and a dead cat.

1074
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:38,130
They weighed a ton.

1075
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,051
There was no reason to carry these things around,

1076
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:41,891
but some players kept carrying these things around.

1077
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:43,772
So at the end of the game, there was

1078
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:45,132
a character who would start talking to you

1079
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:46,352
in the middle of his dialogue.

1080
00:48:46,372 --> 00:48:50,854
He would go, are you carrying around three dead bodies?

1081
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,114
Are you a crazy person?

1082
00:48:53,154 --> 00:48:55,255
And he would start going off, and he's like, wait a minute.

1083
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:56,695
I think maybe I've underestimated you.

1084
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,156
I don't think I really want to mess with you.

1085
00:48:58,196 --> 00:48:58,536
You know what?

1086
00:48:58,856 --> 00:48:59,996
You can just go off on your own.

1087
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:01,037
It'll be totally fine.

1088
00:49:01,097 --> 00:49:03,878
And it was just, again, this weird little niche

1089
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:06,638
thing for people who decided to carry three corpses around

1090
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:06,878
with a son.

1091
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,021
The Psycho Squad in Fallout New Vegas,

1092
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:13,562
there is a quest called Flags of Our Foul Ups

1093
00:49:14,462 --> 00:49:15,902
written by Travis Stout.

1094
00:49:16,722 --> 00:49:19,443
And there is a group of soldiers called Misfits.

1095
00:49:19,503 --> 00:49:21,503
They were horribly incompetent NCR soldiers.

1096
00:49:22,244 --> 00:49:23,984
And they were trying to get into shape.

1097
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:26,065
And you could train them.

1098
00:49:26,165 --> 00:49:27,405
You could go the normal way.

1099
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,965
You could teach them to throw a grenade,

1100
00:49:28,985 --> 00:49:30,626
teach them to shoot a gun, teach them all these things

1101
00:49:30,646 --> 00:49:32,706
that you need to know so that they weren't huge screw-ups.

1102
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:36,407
Or if you were carrying around an enormous amount of psycho

1103
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:39,308
which is a combat drug that makes you go crazy.

1104
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:41,330
You could say, you don't need to be good soldiers.

1105
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,450
Just take a bunch of this drug.

1106
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,192
And that would actually resolve the quest for you.

1107
00:49:45,272 --> 00:49:46,372
And they'd be like, wow, awesome.

1108
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:47,453
All we got to do is take this drug?

1109
00:49:47,473 --> 00:49:48,113
That's really great.

1110
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:50,434
So you would resolve the quest and go on your merry way.

1111
00:49:50,514 --> 00:49:53,696
And then at the end of the game, they actually performed really

1112
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:54,516
well in combat.

1113
00:49:54,917 --> 00:49:56,958
And then they went on a murderous spree.

1114
00:49:57,198 --> 00:49:58,859
And they wound up being hung for war crimes.

1115
00:49:59,379 --> 00:49:59,919
So this is a.

1116
00:50:01,341 --> 00:50:03,362
We always try to have these long-term payoffs

1117
00:50:03,422 --> 00:50:05,323
for these little things that the player can do,

1118
00:50:05,643 --> 00:50:08,125
in this case, carrying around, I think it was like 25 doses

1119
00:50:08,165 --> 00:50:10,326
of Psycho, which is really sort of excessive.

1120
00:50:12,587 --> 00:50:15,008
And then finally, Eric Fenstermaker's know-it-all

1121
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:17,009
nihilist from Pillars of Eternity.

1122
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,811
Eric Fenstermaker was really a champion

1123
00:50:20,091 --> 00:50:22,472
of letting the player establish their background

1124
00:50:22,592 --> 00:50:24,353
and then develop it early on in the game

1125
00:50:24,393 --> 00:50:26,554
so they could really get a sense of who they are.

1126
00:50:27,575 --> 00:50:28,795
This ties into another point that I'm

1127
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:29,716
going to go into in a second.

1128
00:50:30,156 --> 00:50:31,937
So if you took the philosopher background,

1129
00:50:32,457 --> 00:50:34,598
you could talk to this character Kalisha in the early game,

1130
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:36,479
and you could say, yeah, I'm a philosopher,

1131
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:37,780
and I believe this, or I believe that.

1132
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,740
And one of the things you could say is,

1133
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,501
like, I don't really believe in anything.

1134
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:41,782
I believe this is all an illusion.

1135
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:42,822
This is a bunch of fakery.

1136
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:44,883
And that sort of marks your character as a nihilist.

1137
00:50:44,923 --> 00:50:47,044
And it came up maybe a couple more times throughout the game.

1138
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:49,025
There's a Pillars of Eternity spoiler here.

1139
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:49,785
Sorry.

1140
00:50:50,266 --> 00:50:51,866
So at the end of the game, when it's

1141
00:50:51,946 --> 00:50:54,288
revealed that the gods are not real,

1142
00:50:54,528 --> 00:50:56,349
if you picked the nihilist background,

1143
00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:58,470
you get a special line that says, I knew it.

1144
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:04,203
Again, this is these accounting for the weird and the funny

1145
00:51:04,243 --> 00:51:05,304
things that the players pick.

1146
00:51:07,626 --> 00:51:10,969
So sometimes it's important to just ask the player why

1147
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:11,909
they're doing what they're doing.

1148
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,432
I mean, ask it narratively within the context of the game,

1149
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:16,653
not as the designer themselves.

1150
00:51:17,594 --> 00:51:18,855
So why ask the player why?

1151
00:51:18,935 --> 00:51:20,837
Because it makes them ask themselves why.

1152
00:51:20,997 --> 00:51:22,318
Why am I doing the things that I'm doing?

1153
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,811
One of the first examples is the Animancy Trial

1154
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:26,772
in Pillars of Eternity.

1155
00:51:27,232 --> 00:51:30,015
So you are given exposure to animancy,

1156
00:51:30,055 --> 00:51:31,597
which is the science of reading souls

1157
00:51:31,637 --> 00:51:33,018
within the Pillars of Eternity universe.

1158
00:51:33,899 --> 00:51:35,520
It's used for some good things.

1159
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:37,702
Very often it's used for some really bad things.

1160
00:51:38,203 --> 00:51:39,204
A lot of characters in the world

1161
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:40,185
have different opinions on it,

1162
00:51:40,325 --> 00:51:41,846
and by the time you get to this point in the game,

1163
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,668
you've really seen a lot of these examples,

1164
00:51:44,008 --> 00:51:46,070
and you're asked, because of your experiences,

1165
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,872
to testify to the Duke.

1166
00:51:48,232 --> 00:51:50,133
about what you think about animancy.

1167
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:52,573
And this is a way to really get the player to think about,

1168
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:54,473
well, you know, I've been kind of playing through the game

1169
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:55,434
and I've seen all of these things,

1170
00:51:55,454 --> 00:51:56,654
but what do I really think about it?

1171
00:51:56,954 --> 00:51:59,194
And obviously you can only account for so many opinions,

1172
00:51:59,514 --> 00:52:01,255
but it is a nice way to make the player go like,

1173
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:03,415
okay, well, I'm playing this character and I've seen this,

1174
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:04,495
so well, I think this.

1175
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:07,896
And it just helps really sort of ground the character

1176
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,077
and their understanding of who they are in this world

1177
00:52:10,177 --> 00:52:11,297
and being able to express it

1178
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:13,057
instead of just having it inside their head.

1179
00:52:14,825 --> 00:52:17,447
Another example is Arcade in Fallout New Vegas.

1180
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,988
I apologize that I don't have any credit for this art.

1181
00:52:20,028 --> 00:52:20,908
I found it on Tumblr.

1182
00:52:21,328 --> 00:52:23,449
And as you know, if you try to find the original source

1183
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:25,950
of something on Tumblr, you will never find it.

1184
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:29,972
So Arcade in Fallout New Vegas is a character

1185
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:30,972
who is pretty moral.

1186
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:32,673
He's with the followers of the apocalypse.

1187
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:36,475
And if you go to Caesar's Legion, to Caesar's camp,

1188
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:37,935
Caesar is a crazy dictator.

1189
00:52:38,476 --> 00:52:39,876
And Arcade stops you, and he's like.

1190
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,321
What in the world are we doing?

1191
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:44,601
We're accepting an invitation from a dictator

1192
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:45,502
to go over and talk to him.

1193
00:52:45,522 --> 00:52:46,422
He enslaves people.

1194
00:52:46,482 --> 00:52:48,763
He's torturing and crucifying all these people.

1195
00:52:48,803 --> 00:52:50,223
What could you possibly hope to get out

1196
00:52:50,243 --> 00:52:51,183
of talking with this guy?

1197
00:52:51,863 --> 00:52:53,844
And this conversation is partially a way

1198
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:57,765
for you to try to either mollify, arcade,

1199
00:52:57,985 --> 00:53:01,446
or to maybe just think about it yourself.

1200
00:53:01,506 --> 00:53:03,086
Like, well, what am I trying to get out of this?

1201
00:53:03,927 --> 00:53:08,570
You know, you got an invitation and so you're doing a quest, but are you doing it because you really want to hear him out?

1202
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,431
Are you doing it because you want to get some sort of advantage with him in the future?

1203
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:12,852
Do you want to get close to him?

1204
00:53:13,372 --> 00:53:17,555
This is a way again of getting the player to really think about the motivations for why they're doing what they're doing.

1205
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:22,418
By the way, there are sacrifices to doing all this crazy stuff.

1206
00:53:24,364 --> 00:53:25,145
It is a lot of work.

1207
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:28,867
We write a lot of dialogue, and a lot of that dialogue

1208
00:53:28,907 --> 00:53:31,429
comes down to making choices available to the player.

1209
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:34,211
Also, when you allow people to just kill everyone,

1210
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:35,452
you do have to handle that.

1211
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,713
It's a lot easier to just say, no, this character

1212
00:53:37,753 --> 00:53:38,354
is invulnerable.

1213
00:53:38,394 --> 00:53:39,354
You don't have to deal with them.

1214
00:53:39,855 --> 00:53:43,957
In Pillars of Maturity 2, we actually have faction heads.

1215
00:53:43,997 --> 00:53:47,079
So we have four factions, and we have multiple faction heads

1216
00:53:47,139 --> 00:53:48,400
for each faction, and we keep them

1217
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,762
separated in different scenes to prevent the killer from taking

1218
00:53:50,842 --> 00:53:53,704
or the player, sorry, the player who is a, the player.

1219
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:02,183
who is a murderer, from wiping them both out in one fell swoop.

1220
00:54:02,984 --> 00:54:05,045
So you do have to do a lot of work thinking

1221
00:54:05,085 --> 00:54:06,966
about all the contingencies for this stuff,

1222
00:54:06,986 --> 00:54:08,367
because it's not systemically driven.

1223
00:54:08,487 --> 00:54:09,587
It's all custom content.

1224
00:54:11,368 --> 00:54:14,370
If you want to make a hero's journey, goodbye.

1225
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:17,992
It's not really great if you're trying

1226
00:54:18,012 --> 00:54:19,292
to make this big emergent thing.

1227
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:22,374
It does not survive the process, because players love

1228
00:54:22,394 --> 00:54:23,775
screwing with hero's journeys.

1229
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:29,191
The scale and the scope of the impact of the choices that you make, especially if you litter the game with it,

1230
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:32,054
has to be, by its very nature, relatively small.

1231
00:54:32,454 --> 00:54:35,897
If you want it to be all over the place, it can't be earth-shattering.

1232
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:42,743
So you have to try to take solace in the fact that you have a very rich game with lots of little outcomes.

1233
00:54:43,144 --> 00:54:47,528
If you try to make massive changes at every fork in the road, it's going to take you forever.

1234
00:54:48,843 --> 00:54:51,164
Also, you need to think about the scope of player voice,

1235
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:52,044
motive, and identity.

1236
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:54,865
When you allow people to play a wide range of characters

1237
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:57,586
from beatific saints to psychotic murderers,

1238
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:01,227
your player voice is going to have to cover a range.

1239
00:55:01,547 --> 00:55:02,967
And you have to decide as an author

1240
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,348
how wide you wanna make that range be.

1241
00:55:05,828 --> 00:55:07,688
Because you can't account for everything.

1242
00:55:07,748 --> 00:55:09,149
You can't account for every single thing

1243
00:55:09,169 --> 00:55:09,909
the player can do.

1244
00:55:10,249 --> 00:55:11,369
You shouldn't try to do that.

1245
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:13,230
What you should try to do is think about it

1246
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,630
from the player's perspective.

1247
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,231
Think about the person sitting across the table

1248
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:17,871
playing D&D.

1249
00:55:18,651 --> 00:55:20,557
and what they might want to bring into the story

1250
00:55:20,597 --> 00:55:21,941
that you've created a framework for.

1251
00:55:22,984 --> 00:55:23,967
That's it, thank you very much.

1252
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,423
our fifth and final speaker behind his professional work

1253
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:40,026
going back to Maxis on things like Spore and SimCity

1254
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:40,987
as we heard earlier.

1255
00:55:41,027 --> 00:55:43,188
He also teaches classes at Carnegie Mellon

1256
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:46,291
and now is a lead designer at Riot Games.

1257
00:55:46,491 --> 00:55:48,432
And earlier today he told me that his name

1258
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:49,893
is pronounced to sound like Brandy,

1259
00:55:49,934 --> 00:55:51,495
which some of us are thinking about right now.

1260
00:55:51,555 --> 00:55:52,475
Is it being the end of the day?

1261
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:53,696
I give you Stone LaBrandy.

1262
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:01,643
All right, thank you.

1263
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:06,726
So ever since I was a kid I've been making paper games.

1264
00:56:07,026 --> 00:56:08,247
This is something I've just always done.

1265
00:56:08,267 --> 00:56:12,368
I went and saw Star Wars when I was young, super impressed by that movie,

1266
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:15,288
and immediately had to make my own board game based on Star Wars,

1267
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:18,369
where the Rebels are trying to blow up the Death Star before it rotates into position

1268
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:20,129
and kills the Rebel base.

1269
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,370
This is a game that I made based on Rollerball,

1270
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,491
which I was too young to actually see,

1271
00:56:25,531 --> 00:56:27,831
but it looked like the most awesome movie ever when I was a kid.

1272
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:29,792
And I was just like, I've got to play that game.

1273
00:56:29,812 --> 00:56:32,032
It's a futuristic death sport. How does that work?

1274
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:36,493
So, like, just looking at advertisements and reading reviews and things, I've kind of pieced

1275
00:56:36,513 --> 00:56:41,254
together my own rollerball game so that I could play it and see what that was like.

1276
00:56:42,174 --> 00:56:45,935
And for me, building these paper games, it's really just a way, like, making the rules,

1277
00:56:46,075 --> 00:56:46,895
making the pieces.

1278
00:56:47,495 --> 00:56:51,396
It's just a great way to understand the systems, the relationships between all of those systems,

1279
00:56:51,936 --> 00:56:53,397
and it's something that I still do today.

1280
00:56:53,937 --> 00:56:57,878
So it's not really probably too much of a surprise that my rule here for the day is

1281
00:56:57,918 --> 00:56:58,858
to play it on paper.

1282
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:01,459
So even though I work with digital games all the time,

1283
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:03,640
I still try to do as much on paper as possible.

1284
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:09,002
So when I gave my first GDC talk in 2009,

1285
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:10,883
it was about paper prototypes on Spore.

1286
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:13,744
I'm actually curious if anybody here was at that talk.

1287
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:14,605
Anybody?

1288
00:57:15,514 --> 00:57:16,914
Oh, actually a couple hands, surprise.

1289
00:57:16,995 --> 00:57:17,235
OK.

1290
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:18,876
So yeah, nine years ago.

1291
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:21,658
And that middle bullet point there

1292
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:23,699
was I didn't have time to actually talk about how

1293
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:24,620
to make paper prototypes.

1294
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,921
I was just talking about the ones

1295
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:27,422
that we made during that project.

1296
00:57:28,022 --> 00:57:29,123
So I'm actually nine years later going

1297
00:57:29,143 --> 00:57:31,364
to patch that little hole in that talk and fix that.

1298
00:57:31,464 --> 00:57:35,307
So by the way, this isn't up on Vault for some reason.

1299
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:36,388
I think it's too old to be on the Vault.

1300
00:57:36,968 --> 00:57:39,050
But it's up on my website at stonetronics.com

1301
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,571
if you're interested in checking that out later.

1302
00:57:41,448 --> 00:57:44,050
All right, so first of all, this is what not to do.

1303
00:57:44,731 --> 00:57:45,912
So I thought I'd get that out of the way.

1304
00:57:46,352 --> 00:57:47,312
Sometimes when people think, like,

1305
00:57:47,352 --> 00:57:50,315
I'm gonna make a paper prototype of my computer game,

1306
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:53,437
so let's make every unit, the entire campaign,

1307
00:57:53,477 --> 00:57:55,298
and add in an expansion pack while we're at it,

1308
00:57:55,378 --> 00:57:56,939
and let's just try to make this

1309
00:57:57,019 --> 00:57:59,261
the most complete thing we can possibly get.

1310
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,182
But actually, the truth is you need

1311
00:58:01,202 --> 00:58:02,524
to do the opposite of that.

1312
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:04,245
You need to make it as small as possible

1313
00:58:04,285 --> 00:58:05,887
and then make it smaller after you've figured out

1314
00:58:05,907 --> 00:58:06,768
what that small is.

1315
00:58:06,788 --> 00:58:10,011
So let me talk about four different ways that I

1316
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:11,112
kind of think about the problem.

1317
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:14,135
So first of all is state your intention.

1318
00:58:14,195 --> 00:58:16,357
Why are you even making this prototype in the first place?

1319
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:21,522
What is the key question that you're trying to answer by building this?

1320
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:22,903
And there could be a lot of reasons for this.

1321
00:58:22,923 --> 00:58:25,526
It might just be something that people on the team are asking,

1322
00:58:25,546 --> 00:58:26,587
that they're confused about.

1323
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:30,390
Might be a question that you have yourself, but the game's just not far

1324
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:34,093
enough along in development for you to be able to answer that with the game.

1325
00:58:34,233 --> 00:58:36,195
And so this might be a way of jump starting or

1326
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,237
bootstrapping the process really quickly.

1327
00:58:39,413 --> 00:58:41,733
And the second thing is, what's the scope

1328
00:58:42,134 --> 00:58:43,994
that you're going to be trying to tackle?

1329
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:45,875
Like, how much of the game are you going to try to do?

1330
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,815
And like I said, it's like the smaller is probably the better.

1331
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,996
So just one simple idea, like maybe you

1332
00:58:52,016 --> 00:58:53,937
want to know how much potions should cost

1333
00:58:53,957 --> 00:58:56,777
or how often the potion should restock in the store.

1334
00:58:57,178 --> 00:59:01,459
So very specific, very key question, part of the game,

1335
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:03,939
just to see how that might work out.

1336
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,220
Maybe you want to expand a little bit more

1337
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,040
and go for a session.

1338
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,202
session might be let's say you're doing a farming game and the the fall season's coming up and you want to know how people are

1339
00:59:12,222 --> 00:59:13,463
going to allocate resources

1340
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:18,005
So you can make a little game that kind of tests out what kind of resources you would need and how many there might be

1341
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:23,267
Now you can go out and do the full game and unlike the StarCraft example that I just gave

1342
00:59:23,687 --> 00:59:27,209
When I said the full game, it's gonna be a very narrow slice of the full game

1343
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:34,738
So in this example here, it's like maybe I'm just curious about how players will allocate skill points as they go from the beginning of the game to level 50.

1344
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:42,608
And so we're going to go through the entire game, but we're only just going to be looking at a very simple system, which is how skill points are allocated.

1345
00:59:43,618 --> 00:59:45,579
And finally, maybe you're going beyond that.

1346
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:46,759
You were just wondering about the metagame.

1347
00:59:46,779 --> 00:59:48,499
You don't really even care about the actual game.

1348
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,480
You want to know about the reward systems that happen

1349
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,022
between each game and how the player may, say if it's a deck

1350
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:57,602
building game, how they may modify their deck as new cards

1351
00:59:57,642 --> 00:59:59,823
come into the environment, their choices change, and

1352
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:00,663
their options change.

1353
01:00:02,472 --> 01:00:05,232
The third thing is really to specify the purpose.

1354
01:00:05,892 --> 01:00:07,093
Why are you making this thing?

1355
01:00:07,113 --> 01:00:08,353
What are you really trying to get out of it?

1356
01:00:09,513 --> 01:00:11,754
So one thing that's kind of common

1357
01:00:11,794 --> 01:00:13,694
is like I just want to do this mechanical simulation.

1358
01:00:13,754 --> 01:00:16,615
I can't play it yet, so I'm just going to pretend to play it.

1359
01:00:17,275 --> 01:00:18,915
And I kind of caution against this

1360
01:00:18,995 --> 01:00:21,116
because computers are really good at doing this

1361
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:22,416
and paper's terrible at doing it.

1362
01:00:22,976 --> 01:00:24,397
But it can still come into play at times.

1363
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:25,257
It still can kind of work.

1364
01:00:25,297 --> 01:00:29,298
If you're really concerned about distances, cause and effects

1365
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:30,798
relationships, things like that, you

1366
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:32,018
can kind of mock these things up.

1367
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:37,584
The opposite of that would be something very abstract, where this is something a player will never see.

1368
01:00:38,085 --> 01:00:42,810
It doesn't actually occur anywhere in the game, but it's a way for you to get information about the game

1369
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:46,955
and how the players are going to perceive the different systems from a very high level.

1370
01:00:47,455 --> 01:00:49,738
So the player may be down in the game, but you want to know everything.

1371
01:00:50,299 --> 01:00:53,763
In this case, maybe it's the relationship between monsters and weapons.

1372
01:00:55,804 --> 01:00:57,705
And maybe you're just concerned about the emotional engagement.

1373
01:00:58,005 --> 01:00:59,326
You want to know how players are going to feel,

1374
01:00:59,346 --> 01:01:01,088
how they're going to respond to certain events.

1375
01:01:01,548 --> 01:01:03,089
So say we're making a skateboarding game

1376
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:04,210
and there's a combo system.

1377
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,492
Are players going to laugh when they fail the combo?

1378
01:01:06,512 --> 01:01:07,833
Are they going to get frustrated?

1379
01:01:08,253 --> 01:01:09,894
What kind of surprises are going to occur?

1380
01:01:10,595 --> 01:01:12,616
Are they really cheering together at the same time?

1381
01:01:12,997 --> 01:01:15,098
And so you can kind of gauge the reactions in that way

1382
01:01:15,178 --> 01:01:15,779
from the players.

1383
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,982
And then the fourth thing is the time scale.

1384
01:01:20,003 --> 01:01:23,147
How relative to what the actual game will be running,

1385
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,709
what is your paper prototype?

1386
01:01:24,729 --> 01:01:25,650
How's that going to be working?

1387
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,253
And so it's a pretty common case that it's going to be

1388
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:31,556
much slower than the game that you're working on, the

1389
01:01:31,596 --> 01:01:32,557
intended time scale.

1390
01:01:33,218 --> 01:01:35,561
And this might be a case of, let's say you're working on a

1391
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:37,864
shooter game, and you want to understand player decisions

1392
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:40,467
and reactions, and how they respond to different events.

1393
01:01:40,487 --> 01:01:41,628
So you make this little card game.

1394
01:01:41,988 --> 01:01:44,752
Maybe each card takes a minute to play while people think

1395
01:01:44,792 --> 01:01:46,874
about it, but in the actual game, it's a second while they

1396
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:48,036
pull the trigger or push the button.

1397
01:01:49,494 --> 01:01:51,455
You can go real time as well.

1398
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:52,836
Again, this is a little dangerous.

1399
01:01:52,856 --> 01:01:53,936
Computers are great at this.

1400
01:01:54,497 --> 01:01:56,598
So maybe it's just better to do this in the computer.

1401
01:01:57,238 --> 01:01:59,459
But I have seen some examples where you just

1402
01:01:59,479 --> 01:02:00,680
want to test reaction time.

1403
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,081
You want to see if a player is under pressure,

1404
01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:05,923
how does that change their decision making process?

1405
01:02:06,463 --> 01:02:09,585
Are they able to still make great decisions or really

1406
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,727
crippled decisions based on the time constraints

1407
01:02:12,747 --> 01:02:13,547
that you're putting on them?

1408
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:17,810
And then it's also kind of common to do the faster, where

1409
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,792
your game is going to play out much, much faster than the

1410
01:02:20,912 --> 01:02:22,513
actual game, the video game.

1411
01:02:22,593 --> 01:02:25,675
So let's say I'm making a campaign-style game where

1412
01:02:25,695 --> 01:02:29,377
these tribes are attacking each other, and the main part

1413
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:30,477
of the game might be the battles.

1414
01:02:31,198 --> 01:02:33,099
But I'm going to just simulate those with a simple die roll,

1415
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,721
because I really want to see how the continent is used, how

1416
01:02:37,761 --> 01:02:40,403
the land is used, as the tribes start to spread out

1417
01:02:40,443 --> 01:02:41,043
across the world.

1418
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,561
All right, so those are kind of like the four things.

1419
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:46,582
Like, why am I even making this paper prototype?

1420
01:02:47,362 --> 01:02:48,983
Where is it happening in the game?

1421
01:02:49,763 --> 01:02:51,864
What's the purpose that I'm trying to get out of this?

1422
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:54,945
And then the when, like what part of the time

1423
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,026
is that really happening?

1424
01:02:56,746 --> 01:02:58,487
So those are all kind of little toy examples that I gave.

1425
01:02:58,507 --> 01:02:59,847
So let me give some real examples here.

1426
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:01,288
I'll kind of end up with five of these.

1427
01:03:02,188 --> 01:03:05,351
And this one is from when I worked at Blizzard North.

1428
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:09,455
We were on the Diablo team, but we were asked by Blizzard South

1429
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,757
and Irvine if we could come up with a card game that would

1430
01:03:11,777 --> 01:03:12,978
appear in World of Warcraft.

1431
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:15,621
And the idea would be that you would kill a monster in World

1432
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:17,442
of Warcraft, and it might drop a trading card.

1433
01:03:17,723 --> 01:03:19,284
And if you collect enough of these cards, you could build a

1434
01:03:19,324 --> 01:03:21,206
deck, and then you would go into a tavern, and you would

1435
01:03:21,226 --> 01:03:23,428
play this tavern game inside of World of Warcraft.

1436
01:03:24,129 --> 01:03:24,489
Never got.

1437
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:26,170
Picked up they ran out of time to do it

1438
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:32,536
But that didn't stop us from making hundreds of these cards and playing this game at lunch pretty much every day for a couple a couple

1439
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:32,836
months

1440
01:03:34,137 --> 01:03:37,140
So for this one the intention is just mentioned. It's like what would that card game be?

1441
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,221
How could you play it in a tavern inside of WoW?

1442
01:03:40,162 --> 01:03:44,546
Our scope was session based that we were trying to figure out like what a session of this game would play like

1443
01:03:45,126 --> 01:03:49,710
But we're also really interested in the metagame like again how the cards would change over time as we introduced

1444
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:51,532
new factions and things into the sets

1445
01:03:52,352 --> 01:03:53,733
a very mechanical simulation.

1446
01:03:53,773 --> 01:03:55,195
It played out a little bit slower

1447
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:56,115
than what we'd expect.

1448
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:58,677
It's a card game in WoW and a card game in real life.

1449
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:00,299
So they're fairly close.

1450
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:02,760
But when the computer shuffles for you and keeps track of

1451
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:05,362
status effects and the like, the game actually would play a

1452
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,343
lot faster on the computer.

1453
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:10,352
This is another one, Never Saw the Light of Day.

1454
01:04:10,632 --> 01:04:14,956
This is from Blizzard North where we were looking for something to do besides Diablo.

1455
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:21,382
So we decided to make, pitch an idea that would be Diablo but set in the StarCraft universe.

1456
01:04:21,422 --> 01:04:23,024
So science fiction Diablo if you would.

1457
01:04:23,044 --> 01:04:23,925
We call it Starblow.

1458
01:04:24,325 --> 01:04:25,206
Not the best name.

1459
01:04:28,348 --> 01:04:30,608
So one part of that was figuring out, what are all the weapons?

1460
01:04:30,628 --> 01:04:32,349
You know, Diablo's a lot about collecting all these items.

1461
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,489
So what would these weapon sets be?

1462
01:04:33,529 --> 01:04:34,210
How would they all work?

1463
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:37,030
And so I made these little trading cards and they were outside my office.

1464
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,791
And originally they were all blank, like the two that you see in the middle.

1465
01:04:40,551 --> 01:04:44,313
But I told the artists that if you give me art, I'll put it on the card and I'll put

1466
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:46,433
your name on it as the illustrator of the card.

1467
01:04:46,453 --> 01:04:49,934
And that started this little kind of competition among the artists, like grab the cool weapons

1468
01:04:49,974 --> 01:04:53,355
and do the art for them first and get them to me so they could be on these trading cards.

1469
01:04:53,795 --> 01:04:56,758
And there's something about like, oh, you know, this could have been just a spreadsheet

1470
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:58,921
and it didn't need to be these actual trading cards.

1471
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:04,306
But making them tangible, making these things, things that actually got passed around, really

1472
01:05:04,406 --> 01:05:08,410
added a lot and got the whole team kind of involved in the idea of what these weapons

1473
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:08,811
could be.

1474
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:11,093
So the intention to get the feel for...

1475
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:15,519
The weapon sets, just a single idea, very abstract,

1476
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,843
it would never really appear anywhere in the actual game.

1477
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,728
And I said timescale none, but kind of thinking about it

1478
01:05:20,788 --> 01:05:22,570
also is kind of, it covered the whole game

1479
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,573
because we knew where every weapon was,

1480
01:05:24,614 --> 01:05:25,735
what act they would appear,

1481
01:05:25,795 --> 01:05:27,157
how they would be unlocked over time.

1482
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:30,558
This is from working at EA on the Simpsons game.

1483
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,639
And my job on that project was the lead designer

1484
01:05:33,759 --> 01:05:35,720
of what we called Living Springfield, which

1485
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,482
was the place we could run around with Homer and Marge

1486
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:39,942
and everybody.

1487
01:05:40,502 --> 01:05:41,743
And so we just kind of set this up

1488
01:05:41,783 --> 01:05:44,344
in the middle of the design pit and just kind of grew

1489
01:05:44,424 --> 01:05:45,504
this map over time.

1490
01:05:46,385 --> 01:05:52,189
to really try to figure out where all the different key locations would be within Springfield.

1491
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:55,952
So we started out with the first one was just all cardboard boxes that we cut up in yellow sticky notes,

1492
01:05:55,992 --> 01:05:59,895
and then it got cooler and cooler as we iterated throughout the course of the project.

1493
01:06:01,676 --> 01:06:05,880
Trying to figure out where the Moe's Tavern is compared to Duff Brewery, compared to Homer's Home.

1494
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:10,823
So very mechanical in that way that we really wanted it to be very precise

1495
01:06:11,464 --> 01:06:14,506
to how the map would end up being in the final game.

1496
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:21,331
And then we didn't really play like a game, but it was very fast in the sense that we could see the entire scope all at once.

1497
01:06:22,452 --> 01:06:24,652
This was from the expansion pack from Spore.

1498
01:06:25,392 --> 01:06:30,793
This is called Galactic Adventures, and by this point we knew Asorin had mentioned that it's all about the editors.

1499
01:06:31,233 --> 01:06:34,834
And so this expansion pack lets you make your own stories and games in Spore.

1500
01:06:35,254 --> 01:06:38,375
And so we knew that the editor was going to be key to this process.

1501
01:06:39,115 --> 01:06:40,355
So to mock it up really quickly,

1502
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:44,196
we just got, as you can see, just a bunch of paper, cut it up, and then we had people come in and pretend to

1503
01:06:44,236 --> 01:06:44,816
play the game.

1504
01:06:45,536 --> 01:06:47,398
And they would say, like, hey, make a story for me.

1505
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:49,801
And it's like, hey, Joe, and he's got a key.

1506
01:06:49,821 --> 01:06:51,944
And his friend Amy comes in.

1507
01:06:51,964 --> 01:06:53,986
And we would just make these cards really quick and cut

1508
01:06:54,006 --> 01:06:56,729
them out and put them on and simulate that whole process.

1509
01:06:58,325 --> 01:07:03,548
So, it was mostly a kind of a UX study to validate interactions, the session scope.

1510
01:07:04,149 --> 01:07:09,152
And originally, I think the intention was more of a mechanical purpose, but we got really

1511
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:13,155
into the emotional engagement became more important as we saw people actually, oh, look,

1512
01:07:13,175 --> 01:07:14,515
they really care about these stories.

1513
01:07:15,196 --> 01:07:18,138
How can we kind of really let people express themselves through this product?

1514
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:21,860
And fairly real-time in the beginning, it was kind of slow because we were cutting out

1515
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,282
the cards, but we actually got pretty fast as more and more people came through because

1516
01:07:25,302 --> 01:07:27,244
we already had a lot of the elements that we needed to play with.

1517
01:07:28,242 --> 01:07:29,643
And this last one is from Riot.

1518
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,164
When I very first started working at Riot,

1519
01:07:31,224 --> 01:07:33,766
I had the opportunity to pitch five different little games.

1520
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:36,048
This one, just as a disclaimer,

1521
01:07:36,108 --> 01:07:37,349
is not being worked on at Riot.

1522
01:07:37,869 --> 01:07:39,710
So the idea though,

1523
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,052
was that it would be a turn-based fighting game

1524
01:07:42,693 --> 01:07:43,493
with the champions.

1525
01:07:43,913 --> 01:07:45,655
And it looks kind of like a card game,

1526
01:07:45,675 --> 01:07:47,616
but actually each card is an action that you could take.

1527
01:07:47,676 --> 01:07:49,157
So it's more like each card is kind of a button

1528
01:07:49,177 --> 01:07:51,239
that you could push as you worked your way.

1529
01:07:51,259 --> 01:07:53,421
And I guess technically this isn't a paper prototype

1530
01:07:53,441 --> 01:07:55,142
because I laser cut it out of acrylic

1531
01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:57,564
because I was really into the laser cutter at the time.

1532
01:07:58,972 --> 01:08:01,133
So, this one, the intention was a pitch document,

1533
01:08:01,153 --> 01:08:04,855
which is why that I was justified, probably poorly,

1534
01:08:05,295 --> 01:08:06,536
that I could spend all this time on this

1535
01:08:06,576 --> 01:08:07,396
and make it look really cool,

1536
01:08:07,436 --> 01:08:09,277
but I really wanted to get people excited about it.

1537
01:08:09,297 --> 01:08:10,478
I really was like, hey, this could be like,

1538
01:08:10,498 --> 01:08:11,218
right, it's the next game,

1539
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:14,560
so I wanna do like the best forward facing pitch on that,

1540
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:15,941
that I possibly could.

1541
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:18,963
Covered the full game, very mechanical,

1542
01:08:19,123 --> 01:08:20,223
like one-to-one simulation

1543
01:08:20,243 --> 01:08:21,664
of how the game might actually play out.

1544
01:08:22,405 --> 01:08:24,506
Turned out to be like super slow timescale.

1545
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:26,647
It would take like 30 minutes to play the game,

1546
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,928
and when we finally did the first kind of Unity prototype,

1547
01:08:29,428 --> 01:08:31,169
I think we could play a game in like three minutes,

1548
01:08:31,309 --> 01:08:33,270
because there was so much stuff that the computer was

1549
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,831
doing for us that you would have to do manually in the board

1550
01:08:36,871 --> 01:08:37,031
game.

1551
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:45,942
Alright, so that's it. Some quick final thoughts here. One is always write down your goals before starting on a paper prototype.

1552
01:08:46,022 --> 01:08:50,803
Like as your first piece of paper and pencil, like write down why you're doing these things.

1553
01:08:51,164 --> 01:08:57,465
And just get that out of the way and make a statement because it's so easy to just kind of sprawl and go off in all different directions on these

1554
01:08:57,485 --> 01:09:03,286
and lose your focus because you eventually kind of really get into it as a separate project instead of just answering that one question.

1555
01:09:04,547 --> 01:09:09,611
One size doesn't fit all and that basically any one of you who is going to try to do this or maybe already does this

1556
01:09:09,991 --> 01:09:12,493
Already knows they're all unique. They're all different

1557
01:09:12,593 --> 01:09:15,095
So I gave you several different examples that kind of cover everything

1558
01:09:15,435 --> 01:09:17,757
Guaranteed your things will be different than what I showed here

1559
01:09:18,818 --> 01:09:23,741
It doesn't need to be fun. People get caught up on this all the time where like, you know, the paper prototype is not very fun

1560
01:09:23,761 --> 01:09:25,482
So therefore the game we're working is gonna suck

1561
01:09:26,283 --> 01:09:28,605
But the purpose of the paper prototype is not to be fun.

1562
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:30,727
Maybe it would be, and that's great.

1563
01:09:30,787 --> 01:09:32,848
If you can achieve that, then more power to you.

1564
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:35,571
But you wouldn't go into it saying that we're trying to

1565
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:38,733
prove the fun, because ultimately, the paper and the

1566
01:09:38,773 --> 01:09:40,635
digital version are just not the same thing.

1567
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,337
And then kind of getting to this last point, it really

1568
01:09:43,357 --> 01:09:44,398
doesn't even need to be a game.

1569
01:09:45,158 --> 01:09:46,740
You're not trying to make something where there's a

1570
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,142
winner and a loser, and it's got the whole flow that a

1571
01:09:49,182 --> 01:09:50,303
normal board game would have.

1572
01:09:50,663 --> 01:09:52,324
You're really just trying to experiment and answer

1573
01:09:52,364 --> 01:09:53,925
questions as quickly as possible.

1574
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:56,076
So that's it. Thank you very much.
