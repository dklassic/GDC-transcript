1
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:11,408
Right, right, yes, now, so this is going to be a populist post-mortem.

2
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:18,133
Little bit strange, this one, because of, you know, slight substance abuse.

3
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:23,518
Those memories of 20 years ago are slightly hazy, but, you know, we'll do what we can.

4
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:27,081
And it's really a tale of, you know...

5
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:35,661
Development born out of slightly my incompetence and slightly good luck and

6
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:40,605
part of the talk I'm going to separate it into three basic sections.

7
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:47,150
How I got to start Populous and some of the amazing things that happened to get

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,894
me there. The Populous development and we'll have a little bit of a dive into

9
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:56,791
some of the technology. I feel a bit embarrassed saying that after David Braben's Leap Talk,

10
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:04,135
which is proper assembly code and stuff like that. And then we know what happened afterwards,

11
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:12,500
and then we'll have about 20 minutes for questions. So really, let's wind back to the days before

12
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,363
Populous, because I didn't have a career at a university in the games industry.

13
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:21,272
I had a little tiny office here.

14
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:27,054
This is called, it's a street in Guildford

15
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:29,374
called Bridge Street, and I had an office

16
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:30,815
in that top window.

17
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:33,636
It looks a bit like Amityville Horror Building,

18
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:37,797
and indeed it was, because on the floor below my office,

19
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:40,277
there was this old woman called Cath.

20
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:44,699
She hadn't actually left her flat for 10 years,

21
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,280
and the screens from her hemorrhoids being dressed.

22
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,670
on a daily basis still haunt me today.

23
00:01:54,331 --> 00:02:02,574
And I had that office because I had a girlfriend whose father

24
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:04,955
suggested that I set up this business.

25
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:08,896
And the business was called Taurus Impacts.

26
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,218
And bizarrely, what this business did

27
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:16,039
was to ship baked beans to the Middle East.

28
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:22,892
That's how I started in the games industry, by shipping baked beans to the Middle East.

29
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:31,960
Now, unfortunately for me, although I make one cent per can, baked beans aren't the most

30
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,383
popular food of choice in the Middle East, surprisingly.

31
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:41,889
So it was a hand-to-mouth existence, and many times I dipped into my stash of baked beans

32
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,291
to actually feed myself.

33
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,082
And things were kind of trucking on okay.

34
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:54,105
And then the first of a sequence of unbelievably lucky

35
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:59,328
events happened, when I received a call from none

36
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,368
other than Commodore.

37
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:03,530
Now, I was a computer games fan at that time.

38
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,892
Commodore made the Commodore 64, which I played every

39
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:07,493
single day.

40
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:11,315
So when I received this call from Commodore, I was

41
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:11,976
astounded.

42
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:12,796
And they said to me.

43
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:15,722
Oh, we've heard about your company.

44
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:16,742
And I thought, really?

45
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:19,763
What, you've heard about our baked bean exporting company?

46
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:21,744
Sounds unlikely, but anyway.

47
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:23,164
I've heard about your company.

48
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,765
Would you come up and be our guest for the day?

49
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:28,165
And we'll show you around Commodore.

50
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:31,066
And we want to talk about this new piece of hardware, the

51
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:31,686
Amiga 1000.

52
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:38,208
And so they brought me up, and with my business partner,

53
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:39,188
there's Edgar at the time.

54
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:44,386
and we were shown around and shown the factory and they sat down in this big boardroom and

55
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:49,450
they said, well, you know, we're going to send you 10 Amiga 1000s, it's going to be

56
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,155
some of the first Amigas that people receive and, you know, we really want to see your

57
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,056
products on our machine.

58
00:03:57,576 --> 00:04:02,360
And that's when it dawned on me that there was another Taurus.

59
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:09,611
spelled T-O-R-U-S, that produced a networking solution, which obviously Commodore were very

60
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:14,675
keen to have on their machine. They didn't want baked beans on their machine, not in any form or

61
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:21,721
way. And that's when the first moral question came to me in this boardroom. Do I lie? Do I say,

62
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:25,263
yes, we're keen to put our products on their machine, or do I tell them the truth

63
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:31,068
and bring out my sample baked bean can from my case that I've carried up? I chose to lie.

64
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:37,947
That meant that a shipment of Amigas arrived in the next week.

65
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:38,988
We had 10 Amigas.

66
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,388
There was only three of us, so we didn't know what to do.

67
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:42,069
We sat on them.

68
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,649
We made big bookcases out of them.

69
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,590
You know, it was a generally fantastic time.

70
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,271
But they kept phoning up and saying, we want a product, we want a product.

71
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:52,332
And indeed, I did do a product.

72
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:57,373
Not a game, because at that time, Commodore were absolutely fanatical that the Amiga 1000,

73
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:00,254
despite having glitter chips and copper chips.

74
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:03,657
you know, but despite being the perfect games machine at the time,

75
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:07,800
it wasn't a games machine at all, it was a business machine that was going to take on IBM.

76
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,502
So what I did was a database program.

77
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:17,746
Now you can see from this advert my press persona of over-promising was already blossoming at that time

78
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:21,029
because this was the ultimate database for the Amiga,

79
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:25,111
that was far, far better than Ashton Tate's database at the time.

80
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,695
And, you know, that kept us going for a little while and we sold a few.

81
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:35,122
copies and it was a really hand-to-mouth existence, but we were running really, really short of

82
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:35,463
money.

83
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:41,967
And that's when the second unbelievably lucky event happened, when I was down the pub.

84
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:47,930
Now, pubs and games development back in the 80s were very important places.

85
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:52,293
They were places you went when you were bored with sitting in your office and you could

86
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,894
drink and plan and do that.

87
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:58,637
And I was down the pub at one time and a friend came up to me and said, oh, you've heard you've

88
00:05:58,677 --> 00:05:59,458
got Amigas.

89
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:04,970
A friend of mine has developed a game called Druid II Enlightenment.

90
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,673
The friend he was talking about, bizarrely, this is a bizarre circular event, was none

91
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,954
other than Simon and Dean Carter.

92
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:17,276
Now anybody that knows a fable series will know that Simon and Dean Carter, actually

93
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:22,519
Simon Carter still works with me today, they had developed this game when they were 12

94
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,780
years old and they wanted someone to convert it.

95
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:28,355
I was that person that did that conversion.

96
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,917
I knew nothing about computer games at that time.

97
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:34,920
You can see my trick of getting games to work

98
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,321
at the right frame rate, because there's a clue here,

99
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,963
by making the screen ever smaller,

100
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,685
so that if the frame rate wasn't 30 frames,

101
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,606
I'd just halve the screen, basically.

102
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:46,347
Anyway, development went on,

103
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:49,749
and Druid 2 took about six months.

104
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,070
I got paid 4,000 pounds.

105
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,022
for developing Druid 2, and that started this fascination

106
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,403
with writing games.

107
00:06:57,443 --> 00:07:00,425
It kind of gave me the confidence that, yes,

108
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:03,307
you know, maybe if I had an idea, I could write a game.

109
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:06,169
You know, the game was finished and came out,

110
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:08,751
and we renamed Taurus Impacts,

111
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,513
stop shipping baked beans to the Middle East,

112
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:14,715
and we renamed it Ball For Productions.

113
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:20,019
Now, the team at that time was principally

114
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:20,860
the people at the back.

115
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:28,848
the person on the left, your left, me in the middle, you probably didn't recognize me because

116
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:35,270
I have this stuff called hair at that point, which I endlessly look at, and then most importantly

117
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,111
the person to the right was Glenn Corpus, he was the person that had done all the graphics

118
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:40,231
on Druid 2.

119
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:43,423
Now you may notice that Les in that photograph

120
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:46,425
doesn't look like a CFO.

121
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,207
I mean, he probably will regret that photograph

122
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:52,269
the rest of his days because he thought he was doing,

123
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,731
you know, it was a funny photograph, but there you go.

124
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,832
So that was the team, that back row.

125
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:01,075
And one day, this is the actual pinnacle moment

126
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:03,697
where Populous was kind of born.

127
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,960
One day, me and Glenn had been playing Virus,

128
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,141
David Bradman's game.

129
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:12,626
Brilliant game, insanely hard, but absolutely brilliant.

130
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:17,509
And Glenn was fascinated how David had put the landscape together.

131
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,611
And he started to draw these little isometric blocks.

132
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:24,573
And I came into the office and I said,

133
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,614
oh, that's really good, send me those blocks

134
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:28,915
and I'll start playing around with them.

135
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:34,278
Now, at the time, I was smoking vast numbers of cigarettes,

136
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:35,658
I'm proud to say I still do.

137
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:41,680
drinking huge amounts of Coca-Cola and consuming vast amounts of pizzas.

138
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,022
The idea of girlfriends or social life was completely out of the question.

139
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:53,107
So, you know, I literally sat down and obsessively started working on this landscape.

140
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:57,030
And that's on my trusty Amiga 1000.

141
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,774
And that's when I really started seriously coding.

142
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:05,095
Now, Populous wasn't written in...

143
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,284
a proper man's language. It was written in a fluffy girl's dressable language. It wasn't

144
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:16,647
written in assembler code or machine code. I mean even the name, the words machine code,

145
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:23,731
it sounds, you know, hard and thrusting. It was written in fluffy girl's blousy C. And

146
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:28,935
actually I did, you know, go down the pub with David Braben and Jez San who were, you

147
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:34,358
know, proper coders and they really, well they almost laughed me out of the pub for

148
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:35,158
programming in C.

149
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,487
But there was one bizarre thing about the structure of my C code,

150
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:42,110
and here's a little kind of snippet I've simulated.

151
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,133
The whole of my code, because of my trusty monitor,

152
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:49,797
had to fit in 79 columns.

153
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:50,838
Why?

154
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:55,763
Because my monitor, if at any time a single character went on the right side,

155
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:59,066
would do a spasmodic wave dance.

156
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:06,037
So, you know, the idea of tabbing or comments, completely and utterly out of the question.

157
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:13,440
But anyway, I started coding and started playing around with, you know, creating first of all

158
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,261
this landscape.

159
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:20,444
And it was literally a landscape which was, you know, green hills that Glenn had drawn

160
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:26,786
and animating water that animated between two frames.

161
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:32,679
So the tech was simply, and very basically,

162
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:39,102
a 64 by 64 map of bytes, each of which held a block.

163
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:43,544
And a second map, which was called MapWho,

164
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:47,426
I had never really learned about linked lists.

165
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,547
That was out of the question,

166
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,928
that I knew about how to do linked lists in very advanced.

167
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,150
64 by 64 map of bytes of MapWho,

168
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:55,890
that just held.

169
00:10:56,532 --> 00:11:03,355
literally held what was on each block, and a 64 by 64 byte of something called map steps,

170
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:11,358
which we'll talk about in a few seconds, and up to an astounding number of 256 peeps or

171
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:16,360
people on the map at any one time, which was, you know, seemed like an incredible number

172
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,820
at the time.

173
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,961
So, this is the block file.

174
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:25,623
As you can see, you know, there was, you know, Glenn was pushed the limit of drawing graphics

175
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:25,883
here.

176
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,938
And you can see the tiles set across the top.

177
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,780
There were 16 basic tiles, if you include the swamp tiles.

178
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:37,362
And then it was very simple how it worked,

179
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:40,744
is that a block would either have a blank block on it

180
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:43,866
or it would have one of these houses put on top.

181
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,208
And then I had a second file called a Peeps file,

182
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,450
which contained all the pointers.

183
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:56,802
or the animation of all the people, of what they do, and the animation of all the effects,

184
00:11:57,442 --> 00:12:05,389
and our very important boss creatures, which was a feature that came in incredibly late.

185
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:12,396
Now, interesting, in my mind, and when I did finally talk to the press, I was, even in

186
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:16,780
those days, talking about, look at the expression on those people's faces.

187
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:20,976
Now, as you can see, the one pixel eye,

188
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:24,479
you could actually wink at you, which I felt

189
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,786
was a huge advance forward in facial animation.

190
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,609
And I'm sure if there had been a pixel for the mouth,

191
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,370
I would have been talking about lip syncing.

192
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:40,953
Now, let's talk about the actual game.

193
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:47,636
So this was about, I suppose it was about a month into the development of the game,

194
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:53,598
and that's when the first, really all I had was a landscape, was the green thing with

195
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:58,279
the animating mortar, and I had the ability for little people to move around the map.

196
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,380
And I had implemented...

197
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:07,153
this map step thing because I wanted the little people to move around kind of naturally and

198
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,175
exhibit signs of what I thought was curiosity.

199
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:17,460
So I had this map step array, which basically said if someone walked onto a block, one of

200
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,623
these little people walked away, it incremented map steps by one, and whenever anybody walked

201
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:28,007
around they looked for the lowest number around them so that the little people seemed to explore

202
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:28,767
the land.

203
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:30,088
Bye!

204
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:38,330
hit my first big hurdle as a programmer is that at that time there was no raising and

205
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,392
lowering land, it was just a landscape of little people moving around.

206
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:47,777
The hurdle was this, is these little people used to walk up to the shore and then try

207
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:51,140
and get over the water, but they couldn't, you know, they collided with the water.

208
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,325
Now in today's world I could have just gone on to Google and typed in wall-hugging routine

209
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:00,447
and downloaded a wall-hugging routine.

210
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:02,531
That was completely out of the question.

211
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,172
There were no books or reference books in those days.

212
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:10,113
There was literally other than, you know, highly complex academic papers.

213
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:13,534
There was really not much to inspire you for in gameplay terms.

214
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:20,056
And so after struggling with it for what seemed like an endless amount of time,

215
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:27,098
it actually was about two days, I kind of gave up and I implemented a system where

216
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,638
with a mouse, you could left-hand click.

217
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:33,427
to raise the land and right-hand click to lower the land.

218
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:39,328
So that when a little person met the coast, I could just click the land up and they would

219
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:41,169
carry on to their objective.

220
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,050
And I played around with this and I thought, this is really nice, it's really fun just

221
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,450
raising and lowering this land.

222
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:54,512
And it was only because I couldn't do the wall hugging, I just wasn't a good enough

223
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:57,092
programmer to do the wall hugging, that that...

224
00:14:57,588 --> 00:15:02,631
what was called nippling, obviously slight sexual obsession there, nippling of the landscape

225
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:08,715
came about and it was only because of that and that was really the birth of what I felt

226
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:11,616
was, you know, what is the core of populace.

227
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:20,381
So after playing around with that, the very next thing that I did was I implemented via

228
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:23,363
the RS232 lead, multiplayer.

229
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:24,443
So Glenn and I...

230
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:26,619
could play around with this.

231
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,161
And at that time, it was just a very simple

232
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:30,722
raise and lower the land.

233
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,383
And as we were playing around with it,

234
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:35,446
we realized that it was really great fun

235
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:39,369
to actually raise the land and sink Glenn's people

236
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,291
in the water and raise my people out of the water.

237
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:46,134
And that's how this core mechanic really came about.

238
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:50,717
Then using the

239
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,664
The next thing that happened is that we had all these people moving around the landscape,

240
00:15:57,684 --> 00:16:00,566
but they didn't, you know, they just constantly moved.

241
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:05,790
And there was more and more of them, so I needed to reduce the number of people down

242
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,491
on the landscape.

243
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:12,515
So we thought, very simply, very simple mechanic, if a little person was over a blank piece

244
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,217
of land, they would turn into a house.

245
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,880
We wouldn't have to, I wouldn't have to process them anymore.

246
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,421
I wouldn't have to, you know.

247
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:24,405
wind through the peep sloop, they would turn from a person into a house.

248
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:30,008
And then we realised the more land that you had, the bigger the house should be.

249
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:35,551
And so you can see here in this example, you can see that they have settled and they've

250
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:39,553
settled on a nice flat piece of land, meaning they had a hut.

251
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:48,538
And again, that gameplay was absolutely evolving, partly, almost mostly, out of the need not

252
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:49,819
to process the little people.

253
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:56,235
And then we thought to ourselves, how do we get those people out again, out of the house again?

254
00:16:56,795 --> 00:17:01,117
There was two ways that we did that. You can see the little flag here was the indicator.

255
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:08,240
The first way was to remove the land underneath them.

256
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,862
Now, bear in mind, we weren't thinking about a God game.

257
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:13,583
We didn't think you were a God at that time at all.

258
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:18,585
So you could just click the mouse underneath their house and it would raise the land up

259
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:19,946
and they would have to come out again.

260
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,962
using map steps, they would then search around for the next flat bit of land.

261
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:28,363
Or you could make their land bigger.

262
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:35,345
And slowly this game was evolving and Glenn and I would play at least a game a day of

263
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:40,586
this, and it was a huge amount of fun.

264
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:45,668
But there was a frustration, you know, it was all very well just sort of nippling up

265
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:49,889
and down and changing the landscape, but there was this feeling that you couldn't control

266
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,949
it.

267
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:52,322
the people in any formal way.

268
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:54,482
And whilst that was really, really nice,

269
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,043
it was also really frustrating.

270
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,383
And that's when we created, I think you can just see it,

271
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:00,223
there's a little anchor in the middle,

272
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,364
something called the Papal Magnet.

273
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:05,565
Quite why we came up with the name Papal Magnet,

274
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,425
I can't really remember, but it was probably alcohol-fueled.

275
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,086
And Papal Magnet, when you turn the Papal Magnet on,

276
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,127
instead of people coming out of their house

277
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,667
and finding a place to settle,

278
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,368
people would come out of their house and go towards the paper magnet.

279
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:27,471
And that means you could get lots of people in your paper magnet, and then you could turn

280
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:32,414
that mode off, and then those people would create lots and lots of houses, and it felt

281
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:33,375
really, really great.

282
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:37,957
But again, you know, we played around that with a number of days, and it was really good

283
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:40,279
fun, but they still felt there was something missing.

284
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,542
And that's when we came up with the idea of natural disasters.

285
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:47,763
Why don't we have a volcano?

286
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:48,584
Why don't we have...

287
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:56,338
an earthquake or a swamp or something called Armageddon, why don't we have all these things

288
00:18:56,478 --> 00:19:00,459
and mix them all together and allow the player to set them off?

289
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:05,841
But we didn't have a kind of currency for which the player to do that.

290
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:10,763
So we had, you know, quite a few sessions where you could just cast infinite volcanoes

291
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:16,425
and infinite amounts of earthquakes and you kind of got, the game got less fun.

292
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:17,986
And it was only when.

293
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,011
we hit upon this idea of manner.

294
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,471
Why do we do this simple mechanic?

295
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,032
If a person is moving around the landscape,

296
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:29,773
they're generating no manner at all.

297
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:33,113
But if a person is settled in a house,

298
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,834
if they have the bigger the house was,

299
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:37,714
the more manner it generated.

300
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:39,875
And that's where you can see the scale

301
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:43,256
on the top right-hand corner slowly increased.

302
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:44,216
And it increased.

303
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:50,613
by the number of houses, the number of settlements that your land had, and that triggered off

304
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:51,253
these events.

305
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:57,995
And then suddenly, what was a frustrating mechanic, flipped into a really enjoyable

306
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:58,475
mechanic.

307
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:07,217
But still, there was still this feeling, slight feeling, there was something missing.

308
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:10,438
One of the things that was missing was kind of an endgame.

309
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:11,718
There was no...

310
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:15,389
you know, you could build these colonists up and you could have this earthquake and

311
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,232
you would endlessly bombard and earthquake each other.

312
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:25,157
And that's when two very important rules, and really just about the last rules came

313
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:31,181
in, one of which was called the Knight, and that was the ability to turn your papal magnet,

314
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:35,744
which up to that point was just a way of collecting people and then spreading them out again,

315
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:40,508
into a warmongering knight that would go out and attack the opponents.

316
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:46,453
And suddenly that became a huge amount of fun because it was a race to get mana to save

317
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,014
yourself against volcanoes.

318
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:57,501
It was also a race against the clock and the opponent before they could strike out different

319
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,141
volcanoes.

320
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:04,786
And then the very last thing to come in was the Armageddon spell because our multiplayer

321
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:08,950
games were going on for hours and hours on end and there was no winning.

322
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,982
side, so we introduced this Armageddon spell which is right up the end of the of the of

323
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:20,264
the manor scale, which would literally push everyone out of their houses and they would

324
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:21,364
collide and fight.

325
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:26,747
And now we were really, really enjoying the game.

326
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:31,989
You know we thought it was pretty fantastic, mainly because it was multiplayer.

327
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:35,570
Now while all this was going on...

328
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:41,754
Glenn was working on the interface and he did a brilliant job of, you know, defining

329
00:21:41,774 --> 00:21:48,017
the book as being the map and you can see the icons round the side were the gameplay

330
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:50,838
so you could use the keyboard or you could use the icons.

331
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:57,402
It was a nightmarish programming job to get the mouse to translate from the isometric

332
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,983
view to the flat view.

333
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:04,105
I'm sure you people would do it in 10 seconds flat but this took me almost three days to

334
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:06,327
program which seemed like an insane amount of time.

335
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:10,879
We were about six months, I suppose about six months in.

336
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,221
I mean, if you take that in true coding terms,

337
00:22:14,302 --> 00:22:16,743
it was probably half that.

338
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:19,125
But we've been playing the game so much

339
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:22,828
that we haven't been doing too much programming.

340
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,790
And while all that was going on, we

341
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,032
were also doing some crazy things,

342
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:32,755
like we invented the populous Lego board game.

343
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:34,036
So you can see here.

344
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:38,275
that we had these rules, we had, you could,

345
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:41,517
depending on the number of little houses,

346
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:42,978
you had little Lego bricks,

347
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:44,519
which you could use to place down,

348
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,181
which simulated the placing down of blocks in the game,

349
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:53,444
and you could cash those Lego bricks in to build houses.

350
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:55,566
It actually was a completely rubbish game.

351
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:58,307
And it actually didn't balance the game at all.

352
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:01,209
But when we came to doing press, it was a fantastic story.

353
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:01,930
And we actually had.

354
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:04,937
We actually had Lego themselves come to see us,

355
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:07,258
but that's another story entirely.

356
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:09,679
And while this was all going on,

357
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,343
Les Edgar, the RCFO, the bloke in the funny picture,

358
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:18,224
was going out to publishers.

359
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:23,286
Now, at that time, this was 1989,

360
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:25,707
and there was a pretty much an obsession with,

361
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:30,109
as there is now, there was an obsession with shoot-'em-ups

362
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:31,710
and killing and firing.

363
00:23:32,469 --> 00:23:35,650
you know, space, a bit more advanced than Space Invaders.

364
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,030
So every publisher that Les took the game to,

365
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,471
and a variety of terribly written demos too,

366
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:44,911
you know, most publishers turned around and said,

367
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:46,792
well, we're just not interested in that.

368
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:48,892
You know, if you got them to shoot each other,

369
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:51,032
we might be interested, but, you know,

370
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:53,853
originality is not what the public wants at the moment.

371
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:56,353
They want, you know, I can't remember what the genre,

372
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:58,234
they want this, they, you know,

373
00:23:58,254 --> 00:24:00,174
they don't want, you know, something new.

374
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:05,902
And eventually, Les took Populous around to a company

375
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:10,225
that had fairly recently started up in Europe

376
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:11,365
called Electronic Arts.

377
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:15,168
And met up with someone called Mark Lewis and David Gardner.

378
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:20,331
And because they had a hole in their spring schedule,

379
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,972
they said, okay, we'll give Populous a try.

380
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,775
And we signed our publishing contract.

381
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:27,695
Now,

382
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:34,679
Unfortunately, whilst we were, you know, fanatical games designers and games players,

383
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:38,940
we were in no way fanatical contract negotiators.

384
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,101
And Electronic Arts spotted my weakness straight away.

385
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:46,702
And my weakness was this.

386
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:48,302
Go right back.

387
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:51,003
These little puppies.

388
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:54,143
So they only had to wait, you know, the one hour.

389
00:24:55,114 --> 00:24:58,255
40 minutes before my nicotine addiction kicked in in the full,

390
00:24:58,335 --> 00:25:01,017
before bringing up the most essential clause in the contract,

391
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:02,757
which was things like royalty rates,

392
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:07,660
to actually get what was a pretty atrocious contract.

393
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,361
I think our royalty rate was

394
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:16,584
10% arising to the dizzy heights of 12% after 1 million units,

395
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:19,766
and pretty much for no funding up front.

396
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:25,964
But we got the publishing contract, and then at last,

397
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:30,545
we finished the game off, and it went into testing.

398
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:36,707
Testing in those days was nothing like the testing today.

399
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:38,848
It was nowhere near as robust.

400
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:43,589
They had this 24-hour period,

401
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:46,010
which was this intensive test period,

402
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,090
which was slightly scary.

403
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,871
It's equivalent to CERT these days.

404
00:25:50,543 --> 00:25:58,328
Populous went into this CERT process and as part of that, they had to test the complete

405
00:25:58,388 --> 00:25:59,809
game from start to finish.

406
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:10,275
And interestingly, they phoned us up at about hour 19 and said, oh, well, you know, Populous

407
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:12,637
is such a big game and, you know, there's almost 500 levels.

408
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:17,766
you know, we haven't got time to play through them all, we're pretty confident that they're fine,

409
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:22,070
but could you give us a cheat to get us to

410
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,572
the last, the end game sequence?"

411
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:29,737
And that's when we realized we hadn't quite finished the game,

412
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:35,323
because we'd forgotten entirely to put any form of end game sequence.

413
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:38,986
Literally, you got to the last level and nothing happened at all.

414
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:45,360
Now we did have this thing called the Goblin Lord that came up and judged you between each level,

415
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:52,285
and after a serious design brainstorming we decide that an absolutely appropriate and

416
00:26:52,825 --> 00:26:59,009
completely emotionally engaging end of game would be for the Goblin Lord's left eyebrow to raise

417
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:05,654
three pixels and him to go, well done mortal. And this was a frantic programming effort that

418
00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:08,435
managed to get it back into SERP within a few hours.

419
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,295
And so, Populous was born.

420
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:17,276
It was born out of, really out of my inability

421
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,356
to program a certain feature.

422
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:23,057
It was born out of this fanatical play testing

423
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:26,197
that me and Glenn, that me and Glenn went through.

424
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,378
And it was born out of, you know, a passion fueled

425
00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:33,399
by cigarette, Coca-Cola, and pizzas.

426
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:35,699
But the story doesn't end there.

427
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:38,800
In fact, there's several interesting stories

428
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,120
because.

429
00:27:39,731 --> 00:27:45,494
What that enabled us to do was to be introduced to the press.

430
00:27:46,894 --> 00:27:48,855
Now, I'm a great fan of the press.

431
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:50,456
I think they're fantastic people.

432
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:52,977
They have a very hard job, and I've always admired them.

433
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:56,919
And at that time, one of the magazines that I loved the

434
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,680
most was called Ace.

435
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,042
And this journalist was going to come down.

436
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:07,164
The publishers, our publishers, had phoned us up,

437
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:07,924
and they had said,

438
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:14,423
look, we want to, we've got the AIS review, but before this journalist wants to give you his final score,

439
00:28:14,763 --> 00:28:15,985
he really wants to meet you.

440
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:21,633
And he says, he's coming down tomorrow, and you know, please make him feel welcome.

441
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:25,138
Well this, I became insanely nervous.

442
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:28,212
And so when this guy came down,

443
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:30,372
I obviously immediately wanted to ask him

444
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:31,553
what he thought of the game,

445
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:34,874
but I just didn't have the courage to do that.

446
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:39,116
So my obvious tactic was to take him down the pub.

447
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:43,057
Now, we went down the pub about 10 o'clock in the afternoon

448
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:46,098
and it wasn't till about four o'clock in the afternoon

449
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,939
I had drunk enough, 14 pints as it was,

450
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:52,200
and I had thrown up in the toilet.

451
00:28:53,988 --> 00:28:56,490
And then I thought, right, now's the time.

452
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,093
Now I'm going to ask David what the score is, what he

453
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:02,053
thought of Populous.

454
00:29:02,113 --> 00:29:05,115
So I went back into the pub, and he was sort of slightly

455
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:06,356
swaying on the seat.

456
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:10,098
And I said, David, I've got to ask you, what did you think of

457
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:10,618
Populous?

458
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:15,481
And he said, I think it's the greatest game I've ever played.

459
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:21,045
And the first thought that came into my mind was,

460
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:24,071
he must never see populace ever again.

461
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:27,854
He must have made a huge mistake.

462
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:31,617
And then that's when the next piece of luck came about,

463
00:29:31,677 --> 00:29:35,480
because fortunately the Drummond pub is a sufficient walk away

464
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,404
from the Bullfrog offices to mean that we would,

465
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,266
it would be more like a stagger with the 14 pints inside us.

466
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:46,810
Because David then challenged me to a match of populace.

467
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,751
This was insane.

468
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:50,133
I mean, God, the thought of A, that,

469
00:29:50,593 --> 00:29:52,975
he would play Populous again and then change his mind

470
00:29:52,995 --> 00:29:54,975
from it being the greatest game he'd ever played,

471
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:59,377
and B, that I was in any way capable even to see the mouse,

472
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:01,438
let alone control anything.

473
00:30:01,818 --> 00:30:05,540
So we ended up collapsed in an alleyway

474
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,141
on the way back to the office.

475
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:10,002
And to my mind, I don't think David ever played Populous

476
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:12,563
ever again, but we did get a great score.

477
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:15,444
And that was a fantastic, you know,

478
00:30:15,464 --> 00:30:18,005
it was a fantastic feeling to get that first great score.

479
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:19,786
And then.

480
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:21,847
the game was released.

481
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,689
And, you know, that was really my first game release,

482
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:30,630
and, you know, I went down the shop,

483
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,572
and I saw the game, and I started this tradition

484
00:30:35,592 --> 00:30:38,412
that I have now of going down the shop and buying a copy

485
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:40,693
and going back and playing the game as it was.

486
00:30:41,554 --> 00:30:44,134
And, you know, a fantastic feeling of accomplishment.

487
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:48,396
There was one slight snack, which I'll come onto now.

488
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:54,091
The time of release was the time when Salman Rushdie,

489
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:56,633
you're going to think, my God, where's he going to go now?

490
00:30:57,294 --> 00:31:00,657
Salman Rushdie had written the Satanic Verses,

491
00:31:01,838 --> 00:31:03,920
and he had a jihad against him.

492
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,782
Now, we were sitting in our office,

493
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:09,224
bathing in the glory of our wonderful reviews,

494
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:13,508
and you know, the fact that the game had been released,

495
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:16,971
when, I'll just skip forward to this bit,

496
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:17,331
when...

497
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:22,628
we got a phone call from the newspaper called the Daily Mail

498
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:27,452
saying were you aware because you've made a game about good and evil

499
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:30,595
that you were likely to get a jihad against you.

500
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:34,418
So all our glory about

501
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:38,061
oh we've created this game was immediately crushed.

502
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:43,806
We actually, I remember Glenn and I thinking I'm sure I saw a terrorist on the corner of the street

503
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:45,808
because you know they've got a jihad against us.

504
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,895
for doing this computer game. Bizarre though that was.

505
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:53,579
Anyway, that little thing went away and while that was going on

506
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,483
I had all these bills coming in.

507
00:31:57,963 --> 00:32:00,865
You know, although the game had been released, we,

508
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:04,549
you know, Bullfrog had no money coming in at all.

509
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:08,973
And our, you know, skillfully nicotine-fueled

510
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:13,516
contract negotiation had admitted to say that we needed money.

511
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:16,936
until nine months after the launch of the game,

512
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:19,877
because of this tricky clause that publishers used to have

513
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:21,397
called returns.

514
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:23,078
Of course, when you want a cigarette,

515
00:32:23,098 --> 00:32:24,658
you don't think about returns.

516
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:28,939
And they had to, that allowed them to offset

517
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,480
the payment of the first royalty for nine months.

518
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,841
And I had my own little house,

519
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:36,101
this was my house in a place called Avondale.

520
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:38,442
I'd brought it on my credit cards.

521
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:41,403
I'd worked out that I could pay the deposit

522
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:43,543
for the mortgage on my credit cards.

523
00:32:44,132 --> 00:32:48,694
And ever since buying it six months previously, I hadn't made a single mortgage payment on it.

524
00:32:48,714 --> 00:32:52,676
It was really an early example of subprime loans in Guildford.

525
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:59,039
And so all these bills were coming in and I was getting more and more frustrated.

526
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:05,982
And that's when the phone rang and someone called David Gardner from Electronic Arts,

527
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:11,625
phoned up and said probably the most, the worst thing he could say to me, he said,

528
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:15,391
Congratulations, Peter, you're a millionaire.

529
00:33:17,353 --> 00:33:18,354
Wasn't quite true.

530
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:21,637
I think the electronic hearts were the millionaires.

531
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:26,901
But anyway, he said, we've got a mountain of cash here.

532
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,403
He almost suggested that he was looking at it.

533
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:31,785
Mountain of cash, we're going to send it to you.

534
00:33:32,146 --> 00:33:32,926
Don't worry about it.

535
00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:35,008
This was about three weeks after release.

536
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:39,672
Well, what happened next was it took nine months.

537
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,499
for those royalties to come.

538
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:45,620
By which time I'd worked on this sneaky formula

539
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,560
of applying for new credit cards,

540
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,981
maxing those credit cards out,

541
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:52,242
and then applying for another credit card

542
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:54,602
so I could stop my house being taken away.

543
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:58,043
But the happy end of the story is that finally,

544
00:33:58,523 --> 00:33:59,623
the royalties came in,

545
00:34:01,444 --> 00:34:05,525
and they were absolutely fantastic and amazing.

546
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:13,185
And in the year of launch, Populous accounted for a third of all electronic arts revenues.

547
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:19,170
It was, you know, one of the top ten selling games of all time,

548
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,773
and it's held that position for, you know, many, many years.

549
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:29,197
It was launched in Japan, and the Japanese went absolutely insane about Populous.

550
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:30,478
You know, they had...

551
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:34,474
Populous comics and Populous dolls and Populous figurines.

552
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:37,256
They even, and we were invited over for this,

553
00:34:37,296 --> 00:34:39,178
and this was one of the most bizarre things

554
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:41,019
I think I've ever been to in my life.

555
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,543
They even hired a full symphony orchestra

556
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:50,867
to play the music and the sound effects

557
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:54,390
from Populous in a one and a half hour concert.

558
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,411
Now bearing in mind that a lot of the sound effects

559
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:59,113
in Populous were inspired by Cass Hemroy,

560
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:05,673
problems downstairs, you know, it wasn't one of the most melodic things I've ever heard.

561
00:35:06,653 --> 00:35:14,738
And eventually, you know, Populous was converted to the Archimedes, the Atari ST, to DOS, to

562
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:21,963
PC, TurboGrafx, Game Boy, NEC, SNES, Sega Mega Drive, you know, just the list went on

563
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:22,763
and on and on.

564
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:27,606
And it really did launch me and us into...

565
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:33,080
you know, properly into the games industry.

566
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:37,964
What we did was, with that success,

567
00:35:38,844 --> 00:35:42,147
was then to start expanding the company up.

568
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,991
You know, the company went from essentially

569
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:52,115
three people to six people to 12 people to 20 people.

570
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:57,259
And we started working on games like Powermonger.

571
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,581
Powermonger was a really interesting title to develop

572
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:06,661
because it was kind of obviously inspired by Populous,

573
00:36:06,702 --> 00:36:09,342
but it was much more like an RTS game.

574
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,603
It would have been a fantastic RTS game,

575
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:16,684
it hadn't been for an insanely stupid idea of mine.

576
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:20,005
And that was, okay, we'd have this landscape

577
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,185
and we could have, you can make armies

578
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:23,945
and those armies could go out and attack,

579
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:27,066
sounds very RTS-y, they could attack each other.

580
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:28,547
Again, it was multiplayer.

581
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:35,555
This was kind of even before the sort of Warcrafts and the Command and Conquers, and that was

582
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:36,015
all fine.

583
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:43,600
But the one thing that I did wrong was the way you issued commands to those armies wasn't

584
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,661
by clicking on the map.

585
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,343
No, it was by carrier pigeon.

586
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:54,187
What happened was you clicked on the map and then this little carrier pigeon would fly

587
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:54,887
over the map.

588
00:36:55,515 --> 00:37:01,918
with the order for that army, taking about ten minutes to get there, land with the order.

589
00:37:02,058 --> 00:37:02,958
I thought it was charming.

590
00:37:02,978 --> 00:37:03,879
I thought, you know, that's really...

591
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,321
But, you know, it just sapped every ounce of gameplay out of that game.

592
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:15,904
But you could shoot each other's carrier pigeons down, so it ended up like a duck shoot.

593
00:37:16,044 --> 00:37:18,365
It wasn't like a RTS game at all.

594
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:21,006
That went on to Populous 2.

595
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,411
You know, fascinatingly at that time,

596
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,312
there was a kind of shame in the industry

597
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,532
for working on sequels.

598
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:30,853
I know that sounds insane in today's world,

599
00:37:30,893 --> 00:37:32,233
but it really was.

600
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,653
You know, when journalists came to see you,

601
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:35,354
you're not working on a sequel, are you?

602
00:37:35,474 --> 00:37:36,354
If you sold out.

603
00:37:37,194 --> 00:37:38,614
And, you know, popularist too,

604
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,995
rather than me focusing on the obvious thing,

605
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:43,556
which is what people enjoyed,

606
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:46,296
and that was, you know, this little people mechanic

607
00:37:46,356 --> 00:37:47,517
and raising low in the land,

608
00:37:47,677 --> 00:37:49,657
I thought mistakenly as a designer,

609
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,018
people wanted more destructive effects.

610
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:52,798
So I think.

611
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:54,865
Populous 2 Mr. Beat then.

612
00:37:55,426 --> 00:37:59,509
Then the, you know, one of my favourite games, Syndicate,

613
00:38:00,149 --> 00:38:04,153
famous for introducing mini-guns into games

614
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:06,654
and shooting innocent bystanders.

615
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:10,237
And classically, and this shows you how the times have changed

616
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:12,099
because political correctness allowed us to

617
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:14,861
mini-gun down prams with babies in.

618
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:17,903
You know, slightly unthinkable in today's world.

619
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:21,146
Magic Carpet, Theme Park.

620
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:25,991
and the high octane which I'm sure no one's heard of.

621
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:31,293
That then led us to, it was in just after Magic Carpet

622
00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:33,294
that we sold the company to Bullfrog

623
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:36,856
and then just after I finished Dungeon Keeper

624
00:38:37,376 --> 00:38:42,318
that maybe I left, I left Electronic Arts

625
00:38:42,578 --> 00:38:43,839
and started up Lionhead.

626
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:46,160
We then went on to make Black and White

627
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,921
and Fable, blah, blah, dee, dee, dee, da, da, dee,

628
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:50,641
and all that.

629
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:55,087
And so that's the kind of story of Populous.

630
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:58,950
And if I have any conclusions, it is this.

631
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:04,335
It is, you know, sometimes there's a great way,

632
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:06,877
and there's some fantastic examples,

633
00:39:06,957 --> 00:39:09,019
Minecraft being classically one of them,

634
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,800
where games are born.

635
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:15,724
They're born out of playing them and tweaking them

636
00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:18,647
and finding out what works and what doesn't.

637
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:20,808
And Populous was a fantastic.

638
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,059
I think a fantastic example of that.

639
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:26,320
And sometimes what you think of as a solution,

640
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,301
and a problem which is insurmountable,

641
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:31,382
can often lead you to a solution

642
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:33,242
which discovers your game.

643
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:35,603
It was a wonderful classic time.

644
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:40,004
And now I think we ought to try running Populous,

645
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:42,885
because I have got it on an emulator here.

646
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:46,707
And we'll just see if this works.

647
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:48,767
Scary.

648
00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:00,714
It's off screen.

649
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:03,215
It's not a good start.

650
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:04,536
Here it is.

651
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:06,417
Here she comes.

652
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,580
There it is, the Amiga interface.

653
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,961
Wow, that's so exciting.

654
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:18,325
And there's Populous, that's started up.

655
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:33,131
This was our cheap icon, which was a little tiny screenshot.

656
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:42,338
Gosh, the tension is killing me.

657
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:49,684
There, there it is.

658
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:55,764
And one other person that should be credited is the amazing,

659
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:58,226
fantastic, incredible Ron Hubbard,

660
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:02,007
because he did the introductory music.

661
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:02,647
Let's have a...

662
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:11,551
There you are, the intro sequence.

663
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:18,835
This took me quite some time to do.

664
00:41:19,598 --> 00:41:26,580
There's a bit of a shoddy bounce for it.

665
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,121
I don't know if that's the plan.

666
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:29,221
We have to bizarrely escape out.

667
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:31,582
And we have to go back in again.

668
00:41:34,363 --> 00:41:36,183
Sorry, otherwise we have to watch the whole thing.

669
00:41:37,784 --> 00:41:42,345
So we'll have just a two minute demo,

670
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:46,266
and then we'll just open it up for any questions.

671
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:54,828
Interesting, I am still working on Populous.

672
00:41:54,928 --> 00:42:00,990
One of my hobbies at the moment is, I'm, this is purely for my own thing, if anyone's in

673
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:06,112
Electronic Arts, you, please don't sue me for doing this, but I am making, I have, I

674
00:42:06,152 --> 00:42:12,394
could show it to you, I have got a 256 player version of Populous, which is this massive

675
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:14,595
map where you've got lots of islands, it's pretty cool.

676
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,003
So here we are, here's Populous and you can see the basic mechanic that I was talking about.

677
00:42:23,104 --> 00:42:29,887
This is nippling, two lefts, one right, and you can see I'm expanding up, this is my strategy,

678
00:42:30,607 --> 00:42:37,170
is to expand up, God I feel so emotional playing this, it's amazing, expanding up the

679
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:45,935
expanding up the little house into a castle because castles

680
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:50,392
produced people about four times faster.

681
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:56,017
And while this is going on, the incredibly complex AI

682
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:59,219
over the other side of the map,

683
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,944
oh, I'm running out of mana. See, I've got to use mana to

684
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:11,208
build up. Across the other side of the map is doing exactly the same and doing a slightly better job.

685
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:15,011
Incidentally, the trees spread.

686
00:43:15,908 --> 00:43:18,950
according to life, the algorithm life.

687
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,011
So if there's two trees next to each other,

688
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:22,091
they spawn again.

689
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:24,372
No one understood why I did that.

690
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:26,173
I still don't understand why I did that.

691
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:28,294
I just had the imagination of, you know,

692
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,435
these fractal patterns spreading across.

693
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:33,056
So here we've got my house,

694
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:38,239
and I can just sprout the little villager,

695
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:38,999
and he can go off,

696
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:41,200
and you can see the map steps working now.

697
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:45,398
and then I can just build that back up to a castle, that pushes him off again

698
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:49,800
and that's the core of the gameplay of Populous.

699
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,521
Now, I have one thing to reveal, which I don't know will work,

700
00:43:55,242 --> 00:44:03,544
but I have a cheat in Populous that I used in the National Populous Championship in Japan.

701
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:12,475
And that was to put the mouse up in the top left-hand corner and type goth monk.

702
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:15,338
N-O-N-A-M-O-G.

703
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:21,443
That's exactly what happened on stage in Japan at the National Populous Championship.

704
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:25,346
It's supposed to push everybody out of the buildings.

705
00:44:26,027 --> 00:44:34,154
There was this insane competition where I was invited over to Japan and this Japanese kid...

706
00:44:34,807 --> 00:44:37,629
was literally wearing this samurai, you know,

707
00:44:37,649 --> 00:44:42,993
this samurai, you know, I will die if I don't win bandana.

708
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,775
And we had to play face to face in front of an audience

709
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:47,796
of about this big.

710
00:44:48,336 --> 00:44:50,478
And this kid was just awesome.

711
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:52,459
But I had this plan.

712
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,801
I would get to the right moment

713
00:44:55,101 --> 00:44:57,123
when the camera wasn't focusing on my mouse.

714
00:44:57,163 --> 00:44:59,625
I'd move it up to the top left and type gothmog

715
00:44:59,705 --> 00:45:01,346
and he would be ruined and annihilated.

716
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,605
exactly the same thing happened that happened now. I don't think Gothmog ever actually worked.

717
00:45:08,026 --> 00:45:13,050
Which is very sad. Anyway, that's the tale of Populous. If anyone has any questions,

718
00:45:14,151 --> 00:45:20,777
I'll just turn the... If I can remember how to do this, I can actually turn

719
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:28,564
this off. Oh no, or is it this on? Two players.

720
00:45:30,165 --> 00:45:33,727
Oh, no, it doesn't matter. I could turn the computer player on to play my side, but there you go.

721
00:45:34,147 --> 00:45:34,948
Anybody have any questions? ... ... ... ...

722
00:45:51,057 --> 00:45:54,139
... ... ... Hi, Peter. I'm Ryan from Untold Entertainment. Thanks for your talk.

723
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,522
I was watching your talk and I watched Eric Shahi's thing this morning and...

724
00:45:58,912 --> 00:46:01,153
And it struck me that these days we talk about iterative

725
00:46:01,173 --> 00:46:04,215
game development as if it's like a new thing, but you guys

726
00:46:04,235 --> 00:46:06,617
were kind of flying by the seats of your pants back when

727
00:46:06,637 --> 00:46:07,317
you were developing.

728
00:46:07,377 --> 00:46:11,099
Do you think that that's a product of its time, where

729
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,800
there's less pressure?

730
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,941
Or do you think we overthink design now with our big

731
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:16,523
Bibles and our game design documents?

732
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,664
I think we've got both existing.

733
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:21,426
I think we've got both things.

734
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:25,869
I was really struck last night in the Interbit Games Awards.

735
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:28,651
I was really struck by one thing, is that

736
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:35,368
that seemed, those people could have existed as they were, they could have existed back

737
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:39,912
in 1989 when I was developing Populous and they would have felt completely at home.

738
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:45,575
Is the way that games like Minecraft and the way that, you know, a lot of games that won

739
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:51,660
awards seem to be, have iterated, Desktop Dungeons being one of them, seem to have iterated

740
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:56,303
is through play and iteration, and that's really how Populous was born.

741
00:46:56,803 --> 00:46:58,164
And that's one spectrum.

742
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,234
That's one side of the spectrum.

743
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:03,415
And the other side of the spectrum is very

744
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:05,416
formalized development.

745
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,877
And especially nowadays, when you're dealing with motion

746
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:11,438
capture, motion capture just changes everything.

747
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:15,199
It really does change all the production, because you can't

748
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:16,500
mess around with actors.

749
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,920
It costs millions of pounds if you do.

750
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,422
And that process does formulate a

751
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:24,462
different style of game.

752
00:47:24,822 --> 00:47:27,483
I suppose the dream is, and we always have.

753
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:32,296
and this is another complete talk by the way, so I won't go into any detail, at Bullfrog,

754
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:40,943
up to, you know, even up to Fable 3, we still were slightly too iterative in the way that

755
00:47:40,963 --> 00:47:41,964
we approach games.

756
00:47:42,104 --> 00:47:51,011
We would, you know, we still thought about pillars, and these pillars were things like

757
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:57,196
in Fable 3's case were things like the ruling pillar and how it would feel to be king and

758
00:47:58,232 --> 00:48:00,153
there would be a pillar about the interface

759
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:03,115
and how wonderful it would be not to have a 2D screen

760
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:05,617
and interface and a pillar about emotion and touch.

761
00:48:06,357 --> 00:48:08,539
And then from those pillars, we would all go off

762
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:11,200
and iterate round on those pillars and experiment

763
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:16,224
and create prototypes around those pillars.

764
00:48:16,284 --> 00:48:19,186
And then about nine months before finishing the game,

765
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:21,968
bring everything together, all those things together.

766
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:25,010
every single game I've worked on,

767
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,172
there's the same thing we say.

768
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:29,153
And people in the audience,

769
00:48:29,193 --> 00:48:30,634
if you worked on Faber, you'd recognize this.

770
00:48:31,095 --> 00:48:33,677
Oh my God, the game is 20 hours long,

771
00:48:33,737 --> 00:48:34,718
we thought it was 10.

772
00:48:35,698 --> 00:48:37,640
And so we're still iterating now,

773
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,902
but unfortunately it's very, very hard

774
00:48:39,942 --> 00:48:43,104
to get drama and quality with that sort of approach.

775
00:48:43,144 --> 00:48:45,186
So at Line-M, we've really looked at that approach

776
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:46,567
and we're changing that approach now.

777
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:48,308
Any other questions?

778
00:48:50,946 --> 00:48:56,991
Hi, my name's Taylor, I'm from Electronic Arts, and I would love to see the larger multiplayer

779
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:57,992
populace that you had.

780
00:48:58,132 --> 00:48:59,673
Right, I should show it to you now.

781
00:49:02,255 --> 00:49:03,516
Not from legal, so it's all good.

782
00:49:04,377 --> 00:49:07,399
Would you want to see it now?

783
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:08,600
You really do, gosh.

784
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:17,006
Now, this is like looking into a computer.

785
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:22,134
an old man's dirty underwear drawer.

786
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:26,256
So one is we've got to compile it.

787
00:49:26,276 --> 00:49:28,798
Oh.

788
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:48,031
It's not a good start, is it?

789
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:48,691
Let's be honest.

790
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:53,510
Okay, here we go.

791
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:56,631
It's called Feed Me.

792
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:02,014
Now I've got

793
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:05,376
my PR person down here. I'm not breaking in

794
00:50:05,776 --> 00:50:09,778
PR confidentiality things, am I? Because it's not going to be, it's just a personal

795
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:11,759
project. Right, okay.

796
00:50:16,342 --> 00:50:18,223
Oh my God, it's a fatal error, you can't see it.

797
00:50:19,462 --> 00:50:23,225
We've got to fix the bug as we're talking. That's hardcore, yeah.

798
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:28,810
Here we go. Let's do it.

799
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:33,994
No, directory error. Shit.

800
00:50:37,877 --> 00:50:40,339
Come on, you're all programmers, you know how to fix this.

801
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:43,242
It must be there.

802
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:47,983
Look, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

803
00:50:48,023 --> 00:50:50,884
I'm not going to put you through this.

804
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:54,245
But actually, if I just run it, why don't I just run it

805
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:55,186
and not compile it?

806
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:56,826
No.

807
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:04,288
Oh, you see.

808
00:51:04,308 --> 00:51:06,149
Debugging.

809
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:13,351
I'm actually feeling very hot now.

810
00:51:13,631 --> 00:51:14,032
Yes!

811
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:22,060
Look at the frame rate, everybody.

812
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,161
It's atrocious.

813
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:24,702
It's about 3 frames a second.

814
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:27,744
But yeah, it does actually work.

815
00:51:28,144 --> 00:51:31,566
I haven't got Glenn here to do the lovely interface graphics,

816
00:51:31,606 --> 00:51:37,710
but it does actually work.

817
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:42,032
And you can play it across the network and all of that stuff.

818
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:45,966
There we go. Any last questions? We've got about five minutes left.

819
00:51:45,986 --> 00:51:49,348
Hi, Peter. Ben Morrow, Idle Games.

820
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,469
I've played your games since I was very, very young.

821
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:54,470
I've played lots and lots of Populous.

822
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:54,951
I know I'm on.

823
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:56,812
I got in lots of trouble, missed school.

824
00:51:58,413 --> 00:52:02,375
The question I wanted to ask, having played Fable

825
00:52:02,515 --> 00:52:05,316
and essentially realized that I'd become some kind of

826
00:52:06,337 --> 00:52:08,438
estate agent or landlord eventually,

827
00:52:08,998 --> 00:52:11,740
is whether you have any thoughts with all your experience

828
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,540
about how...

829
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:17,593
you not only create an experience that works in the beginning as players discover,

830
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:21,697
but evolves into, you know, that gives a great experience

831
00:52:21,957 --> 00:52:25,941
as the player learns higher and higher levels of what to do with the game.

832
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:29,023
Yeah, it's very interesting. It's an interesting question and

833
00:52:30,144 --> 00:52:32,446
I kind of agree with you in that there was...

834
00:52:33,147 --> 00:52:39,212
Fable III, in a way, was a hugely important game in my career because

835
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:40,753
I think it was...

836
00:52:41,873 --> 00:52:43,713
And I'll be absolutely honest with you here.

837
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:46,494
The team did a fantastic job.

838
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:47,974
They did an amazing job.

839
00:52:48,474 --> 00:52:53,456
But it was the only game, other than Populous, that was

840
00:52:53,496 --> 00:52:54,976
done in less than two years.

841
00:52:55,856 --> 00:53:00,458
And because we were bringing things together very, very

842
00:53:00,518 --> 00:53:03,538
late on, I think there was a lot of edits.

843
00:53:04,499 --> 00:53:06,299
And it was too harshly edited.

844
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,380
So the ruling section was way, way too short.

845
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,420
And things like house buying.

846
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:13,937
wasn't properly balanced.

847
00:53:14,598 --> 00:53:17,000
And what that meant was, what we've done is,

848
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:20,102
and I'm going to end up not answering your questions,

849
00:53:20,643 --> 00:53:24,045
and what we've done is really thought of a way

850
00:53:24,206 --> 00:53:27,788
that we can balance and get to what the game is

851
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:30,530
before any coding is started.

852
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:32,952
And so we've come up with this tool,

853
00:53:33,653 --> 00:53:35,715
which allows us to define

854
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:40,750
But still be very, very creative.

855
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:45,491
Every moment of game play on a minute by minute basis

856
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:50,432
before the team actually starts developing the game.

857
00:53:50,552 --> 00:53:53,913
And very interesting what that means is that you have the

858
00:53:53,993 --> 00:53:59,295
pillars that inspire this flow that you create at the start,

859
00:53:59,395 --> 00:54:01,115
and then those pillars are changed at the end.

860
00:54:01,135 --> 00:54:05,456
So I really hope this time that, and I've been talking

861
00:54:05,496 --> 00:54:08,197
about this this week, I really hope this time that

862
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:14,326
the dream that I know that I sell to people in the press

863
00:54:15,466 --> 00:54:18,627
will hopefully match the game that comes out at the end.

864
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:20,888
And because I passionately believe when I...

865
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:22,849
I'm not doing PR when I do it to the press,

866
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:24,270
I passionately believe in that.

867
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,131
Now, I'll answer your question, what was it?

868
00:54:28,171 --> 00:54:28,712
LAUGHTER

869
00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:32,053
That seemed like a rather good answer.

870
00:54:32,113 --> 00:54:33,834
Did it? Oh, well, there you go.

871
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:34,774
It was pure luck.

872
00:54:35,414 --> 00:54:36,075
Thank you very much.

873
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:40,509
Next question.

874
00:54:40,889 --> 00:54:44,131
It's kind of sad, because it seems like it's going away, at

875
00:54:44,171 --> 00:54:45,571
least in mainstream gaming.

876
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:49,994
But what motivated you to work on games that have so many

877
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:52,255
aspects of simulation?

878
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:56,957
And did you have any idea that it would be so successful?

879
00:54:56,977 --> 00:55:00,539
I think even maybe The Sims is a good example, how hard it

880
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:01,380
was to sell.

881
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,922
And then now we have three iterations of it later.

882
00:55:07,325 --> 00:55:12,588
I think it was a per... I mean there was a couple of things that I really loved.

883
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:18,992
I've always had, I still have this unbelievable passion of creating a world that seemed to live.

884
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:26,456
And, you know, that world, whether that world be, you know, something like Populous,

885
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:31,399
at the scale of Populous, or whether it be Power Monger, which was a little bit closer in,

886
00:55:31,439 --> 00:55:32,040
or whether it be...

887
00:55:32,682 --> 00:55:35,984
theme part, which was very close in, or black and white.

888
00:55:36,544 --> 00:55:40,826
These worlds, I think my fantasy is, if you set a game

889
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:44,429
in a simulation, it allows players to do stuff that I

890
00:55:44,489 --> 00:55:45,389
have never thought of.

891
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:51,473
But I still think, for me, that's a very addictive

892
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:53,254
gameplay quality.

893
00:55:54,214 --> 00:55:57,877
At the time, at Populous time, when I said that to

894
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,538
publishers, they just looked at me as if I was completely

895
00:56:00,598 --> 00:56:02,079
insane, because there wasn't anything.

896
00:56:02,627 --> 00:56:03,808
like that at the time.

897
00:56:03,868 --> 00:56:05,810
And it was really strange with Will Wright,

898
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:09,393
who is an unbelievably clever human being.

899
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:14,657
And he, Populous and SimCity came out a month,

900
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,539
within a month of each other.

901
00:56:17,479 --> 00:56:21,803
And he was thinking about simulations as well.

902
00:56:21,863 --> 00:56:25,446
So, it kind of proved I wasn't completely insane

903
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:26,087
to think of that.

904
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:27,648
And I still love that.

905
00:56:27,768 --> 00:56:31,291
I mean, what you all don't realize about Fable,

906
00:56:32,418 --> 00:56:37,740
is, and if you actually manage to, there isn't a cheat to do this, but if I had Fable here

907
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:43,762
to demonstrate, there's this incredible thing with Fable, is that in a level, you can, if

908
00:56:43,782 --> 00:56:50,844
you go into god mode and fly up, you can see people, the other side of the landscape, the

909
00:56:50,864 --> 00:56:56,346
little villages, get up in the morning, go to work, buy things from shops, go back into

910
00:56:56,386 --> 00:56:59,187
their house, cook meals for their family.

911
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,188
I was never see that, but I still love that mechanic.

912
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,654
Do you think it's going to start going away now that there's these huge checks involved?

913
00:57:08,734 --> 00:57:15,340
And you can't handcraft the player experience so well with these emergent behaviors going

914
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,361
on in the background?

915
00:57:18,963 --> 00:57:21,826
I think that simulation still exists in games.

916
00:57:22,086 --> 00:57:25,829
It's probably there in things like Call of Duty.

917
00:57:26,229 --> 00:57:30,893
But we have got an amazing spectrum of games being made now.

918
00:57:31,745 --> 00:57:34,226
You know, really, in the last two to three years,

919
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:37,506
we've got all the Facebook stuff and all the app store stuff.

920
00:57:38,007 --> 00:57:41,667
And that is an incredible place to experiment with that.

921
00:57:42,347 --> 00:57:45,808
And whilst I think that games like Farmville,

922
00:57:45,848 --> 00:57:47,248
and this is a very contentious view,

923
00:57:47,288 --> 00:57:48,849
but I think games like Farmville

924
00:57:49,389 --> 00:57:51,249
are a brilliant piece of design,

925
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,830
those sort of experiences need to evolve.

926
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,310
If I was involved in that,

927
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:57,911
I would definitely rat hole on simulation.

928
00:57:58,551 --> 00:57:59,171
Because for me,

929
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:03,512
you know, those little people in Farmville and Frontierville

930
00:58:03,572 --> 00:58:06,995
and all of those just randomly moving left and right,

931
00:58:07,055 --> 00:58:08,516
they're just missing a beat.

932
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:12,599
And that beat is that this is my little field

933
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:17,163
or my little city, and I can see that the farms I plant,

934
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:19,345
plant down have an effect on the little people.

935
00:58:19,405 --> 00:58:21,707
I think there's a wonderful, glorious thing there.

936
00:58:22,187 --> 00:58:25,310
I'm not saying that Farmville and that lot

937
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,731
are not brilliant design, by the way.

938
00:58:27,192 --> 00:58:27,952
Thank you very much.

939
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:28,453
Thank you.

940
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:33,134
I think this will have to be the last question, if I'm right.

941
00:58:33,634 --> 00:58:35,055
Yeah.

942
00:58:35,175 --> 00:58:38,498
I was a big fan of Bullfrog all throughout the 90s.

943
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:41,380
And one of the things I thought was so cool about that company

944
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,123
was the vast range of genres and gameplay styles

945
00:58:46,903 --> 00:58:47,544
that you explored.

946
00:58:47,564 --> 00:58:48,985
And this actually might share something

947
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,085
in common with the previous question.

948
00:58:50,105 --> 00:58:53,168
But one thing that seems to be quite common

949
00:58:53,428 --> 00:58:56,430
is designers who have been at it for quite a while,

950
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:59,011
they almost sort of, there seems to be this magnetic pull.

951
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:02,827
sort of eventually towards, I guess, character-driven,

952
00:59:02,947 --> 00:59:06,728
first or third person, kind of close in genres.

953
00:59:06,828 --> 00:59:08,929
And I'm wondering if you think that,

954
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:11,549
if there's something sort of inevitable about that,

955
00:59:11,609 --> 00:59:14,290
or maybe why your career has gone in that direction,

956
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:15,911
and would you ever see yourself?

957
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:19,212
Yeah, I see what you mean.

958
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:21,612
And there is, you know, I think,

959
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:24,653
you know, the industry is very cyclical.

960
00:59:25,514 --> 00:59:28,114
And a lot of this industry,

961
00:59:28,134 --> 00:59:29,175
and a lot of other industries.

962
00:59:29,582 --> 00:59:31,304
especially entertainment-led industries,

963
00:59:32,305 --> 00:59:34,867
you know, they do follow my leader an awful lot.

964
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:38,670
You know, if there's a successful science fiction film,

965
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,771
then you have a glut of science fiction films,

966
00:59:41,192 --> 00:59:42,133
same with horror films.

967
00:59:42,693 --> 00:59:44,955
And it kind of could be the same could be true

968
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,636
of the computer games industry.

969
00:59:46,736 --> 00:59:48,518
I'm a huge optimist, by the way.

970
00:59:48,538 --> 00:59:50,920
I think we're just coming to the time

971
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:54,182
with all these new input devices and the cloud

972
00:59:54,262 --> 00:59:56,184
and, you know, the ability for...

973
00:59:56,683 --> 01:00:01,385
us to get to people's friends list, I think that is really going to mean that we have

974
01:00:01,445 --> 01:00:02,865
changes in these genres.

975
01:00:03,745 --> 01:00:08,567
But at the moment, this particular phase we're in, there are a lot of first-person shooters.

976
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:13,228
I love them, by the way, I absolutely adore them, I play them an awful lot.

977
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:18,949
I think that just having a little Battlefield 3 looks just totally awesome to me, and I

978
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:19,830
can't wait to play it.

979
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:24,611
But I do feel that we as an industry, we owe it to...

980
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:28,840
the consumers and the people that play our games, whether

981
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,762
they've just come to the industry or they've been there

982
01:00:30,782 --> 01:00:34,565
a long time, to actually innovate and iterate and to be

983
01:00:34,645 --> 01:00:36,987
brave with what we present to people.

984
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:39,349
Anyway, thank you very much.

985
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:42,372
Remember your evaluation forms, and also remember to

986
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:43,173
turn off your phones.
