00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:13,499
Hello. I'm Scaff Elias. I'm here to talk about what video games can learn from collectible

2
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:25,388
card games. That's what CCG stands for. And first a little bit about who I am. I started

3
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:31,352
working on, in game design, on Magic the Gathering with Richard Garfield. We were classmates

4
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:33,614
at a university in Pennsylvania, in grad school there.

5
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:38,656
Eventually, over the years, I became senior vice president

6
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:44,781
at Watsi Hasbro throughout the years working on game design.

7
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:48,344
But sort of the unique perspective of the talk

8
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:52,027
is how business and design are intermixed

9
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:54,308
for this sort of certain class of games.

10
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:56,750
And first came to that realization in 1994,

11
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,752
I actually became the business and brand manager for Magic.

12
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:03,455
And so that was a large portion of my job there.

13
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,170
But I continued to work in design.

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,132
I co-designed or developed almost all of Wizards of the Coast's CCGs.

15
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:12,274
Not all of them, but the list is very long.

16
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:17,657
And a large part of what I did there was I designed the Protor,

17
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:20,939
the organized play system, the tournament system, leagues,

18
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:25,221
that both Magic and then eventually Pokemon used.

19
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,524
And there at Wizards after a while, because I was going back and forth

20
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,205
between design and business, it turned out that...

21
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:40,277
Really, I was, to borrow a phrase, if any of you know who the sports guy is, he's an ESPN columnist, the VP of common sense.

22
00:01:40,697 --> 00:01:44,859
That's basically what I was doing at Wizards, and I was very overworked.

23
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:52,962
So in 2004, I left Wizards of the Coast, started a company called Three Donkeys with Richard Garfield.

24
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:57,624
And it's mainly a consulting company, and we've done a lot of computer game consulting.

25
00:01:58,564 --> 00:02:03,286
And also design, we did an Xbox Live arcade game called Schizoid with a company called Torpex.

26
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:09,355
And we've also published Spectrum Answer, which is something like a collectible card

27
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:09,595
game.

28
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:12,677
You can go look at it online.

29
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:18,001
And also, we've been teaching courses at University of Washington, and I do a podcast with Richard

30
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:22,084
where a lot of the things I'll talk about here are sort of gone over in more detail.

31
00:02:22,364 --> 00:02:23,965
That's at 3donkeys.com.

32
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:30,249
So the interesting thing is, by their nature, distributed object games...

33
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:34,239
mixed design and business in an inextricable way.

34
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,680
A lot of concerns that are sort of traditionally in one field

35
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,821
turn out to not be able to stay in that field.

36
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,522
But first, a little bit about collectible card games,

37
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:45,723
for those of you who don't know.

38
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:50,544
Magic the Gathering was the first collectible card game.

39
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:55,206
And sometimes inside the video game industry,

40
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:58,907
people don't understand how large some of these properties

41
00:02:58,987 --> 00:02:59,227
were.

42
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:00,508
Magic was doing.

43
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:08,534
since 1994, so for a very long time, between $100 and $150 million wholesale.

44
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:13,599
And because of the way the distribution margins work there, the wholesale numbers,

45
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,542
that actually about translates to $375 million retail.

46
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:21,145
And actually, these numbers are sort of semi-publicly available,

47
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:25,389
and really they're probably about double what I'm printing here.

48
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:35,225
Pokemon, on the other hand, our best year there did about almost $2 billion at retail,

49
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,966
and it had several years pretty close to that.

50
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:43,127
And it's interesting, it hasn't quite gotten back to its peak, but more than 10 years later,

51
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:48,548
it's doing, you know, more than half that again.

52
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:55,029
And then Yu-Gi-Oh! is sort of the top seller all the time, and it had several years.

53
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:58,895
where it was making at retail over $3 billion a year.

54
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:01,456
Probably about three years in a row,

55
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,717
it came close to those numbers.

56
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,618
So they're actually very large properties.

57
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,521
And sort of the attitude that Richard and I take is,

58
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:12,983
you should look at all games, all the time, constantly,

59
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:15,244
because there's valuable lessons that you can learn,

60
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,145
that you can learn from them.

61
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:20,087
Especially any game that's as popular as these,

62
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:22,688
or major video games, or even basketball.

63
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:23,949
You know, you really,

64
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:27,718
Yeah, if that many people like something,

65
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,899
there's certainly some valuable lessons there.

66
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,021
So before we start, kind of a definition

67
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,642
that I want to use for distributed object games,

68
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:42,384
just because mainly the lessons from the collectible card games

69
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:44,225
apply to these sorts of things.

70
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:49,147
And one of these games sort of should

71
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:52,728
contain hundreds of semi-individually purchasable

72
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:53,128
objects.

73
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:56,652
that together constitute a large portion of the gameplay.

74
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:00,754
And semi-individually purchasable

75
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:02,335
is actually kind of important.

76
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,057
It means that I don't just pay one price.

77
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:06,838
I get a game with hundreds of objects

78
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:11,941
and then I use those throughout the course of the game.

79
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,923
That's certainly a multiple object game

80
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,163
but not necessarily distributed

81
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:19,465
where maybe the players don't own all of the objects

82
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:21,146
and they're purchasing them over time.

83
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:23,916
And these types of games are interesting.

84
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,917
They take a basic gameplay interaction,

85
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:29,199
a standard set of rules, and they use these objects

86
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:31,720
to change the gameplay in fundamental ways over time.

87
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:35,042
And that's interesting because they become

88
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,163
almost more of a hobby than a game,

89
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,745
or traditionally what you would think of as a hobby

90
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:40,826
compared to a game,

91
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:42,927
where they're taking enormous amounts of time.

92
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:44,528
People can be involved in them

93
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:46,769
for a very long period of time, several years,

94
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,690
for even an average customer.

95
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:56,915
And actually they spend a lot more money than they might with a standard game because they're putting money into it across a long time.

96
00:05:57,736 --> 00:06:03,338
These types of games are very difficult to construct and enormously difficult to construct.

97
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:05,179
They're also enormously difficult to play.

98
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:09,901
Magic the Gathering is, except for basketball, the best game I've ever played.

99
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:17,904
And if I wanted to teach someone how to play and I knew they could only play it for one day, I wouldn't teach it to them.

100
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:23,638
it wouldn't be worth their time because of the amount of difficulty there is in getting

101
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:28,442
up to speed with these things. However, on the back end, they're extremely rewarding

102
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:34,626
for both the publisher and the player as well. You almost can't have one without the other

103
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:44,134
because you get to really have almost a lifelong involvement with these types of things if

104
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:44,634
they're done right.

105
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:46,114
or at the very least several years.

106
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:48,535
So you get a very big payoff for getting into the game

107
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:49,156
in the first place.

108
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:52,698
First, a few assumptions.

109
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:54,679
One thing is that I'm only gonna talk

110
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,041
about gameplay concerns, what gameplay lessons

111
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,983
can be learned from video games from CCGs.

112
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:03,984
There's a lot of other things they could learn as well,

113
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,605
but just for the scope of the talk,

114
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,446
we'll talk, we'll concentrate on those.

115
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:12,429
And also, what type of video games can learn lessons

116
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:13,690
from collectible card games.

117
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:16,485
So I'm going to make just a few assumptions here.

118
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,106
You can relax these assumptions, and there's

119
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:21,487
a whole other interesting series of talks.

120
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,287
I could talk for a semester on this sort of thing,

121
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:24,868
but just to try and narrow the focus.

122
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,509
The first one is a repeat purchase revenue model.

123
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,291
And as I mentioned before with the distributed object games,

124
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,092
not just that the objects get parceled out over time,

125
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:38,853
but that people are making purchases over time.

126
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:41,814
Essentially, you're creating an operating system.

127
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:46,415
and providing sort of new software for it constantly

128
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:49,497
throughout the course of your project.

129
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,399
It's very difficult for players and designers,

130
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:56,762
so it needs to be built very robustly

131
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:59,383
because if there is no long-term involvement,

132
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:02,185
it's a very dubious value proposition.

133
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:04,847
Again, both for the publisher and the player.

134
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:08,349
The fact that you don't have to purchase it all at once

135
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:09,750
is a huge benefit for the player.

136
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,914
They get to try it first before they decide how involved they want to be.

137
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:25,721
And then, hopefully, ideally, they're getting rewarded at virtually any level of money they decide to input into the game.

138
00:08:27,162 --> 00:08:31,265
One thing about this is it requires actually a very large degree of sophistication in the audience.

139
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:36,749
It's very difficult to fool people for two years and several thousand dollars of their money.

140
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:47,012
This is something that's probably underrated, even for a game like Pokemon, where maybe only 20% of the people played, maybe only 10% played correctly,

141
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:52,196
those other players were extremely sophisticated about their purchases.

142
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:56,599
I shouldn't say players. Those other customers were extremely sophisticated about their purchases.

143
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,523
They knew more about Pokemon and what they were getting in their cards than, you know,

144
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:05,405
90% of the average video game player knows when he's actually buying a video game.

145
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,296
They knew the prices of the cards.

146
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:09,316
They knew what they were getting.

147
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:10,336
They knew the back history.

148
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:12,137
They were allowed to associate

149
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,337
with this enormous amount of story.

150
00:09:13,357 --> 00:09:15,277
And the reason they had this degree of sophistication

151
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:16,637
is they were watching a television show

152
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:18,958
or playing the handheld game.

153
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:21,478
And so they had actually, in some sense,

154
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,219
put in hundreds and hundreds of hours

155
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,419
of research into the brand.

156
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
And by respecting that sophistication,

157
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,601
we were able to provide them with a much better product.

158
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:39,738
Another assumption, this is a very personal bias of mine, it's limited SKUs.

159
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,821
I've seen a lot of times this sort of analysis paralysis on a part of the customer, and so

160
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:55,766
I really like it when there's very few things for them to buy, and it does imply, since

161
00:09:55,786 --> 00:09:59,608
you're selling hundreds of objects, that there's some sort of randomized selling going on.

162
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:04,168
It doesn't have to be fully random.

163
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,009
I mean, you can be creative in your product.

164
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,950
For instance, when people are purchasing new cards,

165
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,531
they could get a random set of them.

166
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:11,373
And then the next time they purchase,

167
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,995
they could get a random set that they don't already own.

168
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:16,076
You can change rarity levels.

169
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,558
You can do all sorts of things here.

170
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:19,799
It's not fully random.

171
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,761
But the limited SKUs apply some degree of randomness,

172
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,263
and that actually has some implications later on.

173
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:29,345
And another assumption is that you're planning for success.

174
00:10:31,827 --> 00:10:35,289
you are expecting your product to be around for a long time,

175
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,331
let's say at least a year of people actively supporting it,

176
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:39,892
they're actively purchasing.

177
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,814
And also you're planning for a very, very wide range

178
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:46,477
of customers in terms of the amount of skill,

179
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:48,438
in terms of the amount of free time they have,

180
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:52,480
their psychographics, the amount of money they can spend.

181
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,143
And another thing when you have a game

182
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,684
that's lasting this long is since your customers

183
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,025
come in at different entry times, that's actually,

184
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,661
That's actually another very important consideration

185
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,822
when you're trying to build these games.

186
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:08,244
So what are the implications of these assumptions?

187
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:13,848
For these games, the purchase decision of the consumer

188
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:15,289
is not made once.

189
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,811
A one-time deal heavily influenced by the marketing guys

190
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:21,533
who have put a big spend behind your initial launch.

191
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,054
They're constant decisions.

192
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,776
Absolutely throughout the course of play,

193
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:28,097
at any time, someone's able to make a purchase.

194
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:31,164
Every single game is a sales pitch.

195
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:34,245
Every single game that you have that someone plays,

196
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,666
you should be thinking of, in a way,

197
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,446
as a sales pitch to that customer

198
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,307
because they can just turn right around

199
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,587
and make another purchase decision.

200
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:45,528
And also respecting all your customers pays off

201
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,888
because you will have an enormous amount of them.

202
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:50,609
And if you start cutting off sections of that market,

203
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:55,330
pretty quickly you'll see the effect in terms of revenue.

204
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:03,620
If every game is a sales pitch, this is one thing to learn from collectible card games,

205
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:07,062
the objects actually have to be pretty easily understood.

206
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:11,964
Your audience is pretty sophisticated.

207
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:18,627
They have put a lot of thought into the game.

208
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:25,170
And they will tend to, again, over time, put a lot of thought into their purchases.

209
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,240
Clarity is very important.

210
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,464
You really need for them to understand exactly the benefit

211
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:34,304
of their purchase.

212
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:38,988
There are other ways you can somehow obfuscate to them

213
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:40,810
what the real value of these objects is,

214
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,674
but let me just say the easiest way for them to,

215
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:49,277
the easiest way for you to have them see value

216
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:51,158
in what's going on is actually give them value.

217
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,720
And clarity in what they're getting

218
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,041
is a very important thing.

219
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:56,763
Which is to say.

220
00:12:58,156 --> 00:12:59,957
So for instance, if you had objects in your game

221
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:01,719
that acted like black boxes,

222
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,142
and you were selling them Tamagotchi-like things,

223
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:07,764
maybe with some hidden characteristics,

224
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:10,105
the value of those purchases,

225
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:12,307
as it goes over time in your involvement,

226
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:16,310
is it's very hard to make a case for people over time

227
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:19,453
that they're actually getting something of value.

228
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,257
This is an important one.

229
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:35,219
It was really critical for us in producing these games that

230
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,800
lasted, I guess, Magic now is almost 20 years old,

231
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,560
18 years old.

232
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:43,081
For objects to have a clear benefit

233
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:46,522
across the different entry times and the different purchase

234
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,103
levels, as we sort of were talking about before.

235
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:56,758
The value of every purchase in terms of winning percentage ideally should only have logarithmically increasing value.

236
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,439
And the reason for this is sort of obvious.

237
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:05,861
If I came into the game five years ago and I keep buying cards and now you came into the game today

238
00:14:05,941 --> 00:14:10,002
because you just turned 13 or 14 or whatever the low end of your age range is,

239
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:15,423
if these objects that I've purchased over time all have some sort of linear value,

240
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:19,244
there's no way you can catch up as a new player, a new customer.

241
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:22,449
That's sort of the most critical case.

242
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:25,810
And then, because you don't want to cut off

243
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,811
your new customers coming in.

244
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,472
And then additionally, even two people

245
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:30,353
that have entered the game at the exact same time,

246
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:32,634
just naturally, one of them probably

247
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:33,594
will spend more than the other.

248
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:36,776
You want your players to get a benefit

249
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:38,317
for spending extra money.

250
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:41,398
That is, after all, how you make your money.

251
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:45,820
But you don't want that benefit to be too high,

252
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:47,881
because if it is, it scares away other customers.

253
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,223
solution to this? Is this logarithmically increasing value? There's a lot of ways to

254
00:14:55,263 --> 00:15:05,051
accomplish this. The easiest way is that you have some sort of slight extra benefit for

255
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:09,234
the combinatorial variety that you're able to get by purchasing a lot of objects. Each

256
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:13,537
object isn't necessarily that you purchase more powerful than the next one. Maybe they're

257
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:19,882
all of equal power, but by owning certain subsets and increasing subsets, you sort of

258
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,903
the natural tendency will be to have a curve like that.

259
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:33,548
And also, it may be useful to reduce

260
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:36,850
the amount of physical skill involved in your game.

261
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:40,592
When games have a lot of hand-eye coordination,

262
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:45,555
then you are much less in control.

263
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:46,855
It's just this extra variable.

264
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,828
in terms of the difference in your audience skill level

265
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,969
that you're not in control of.

266
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,052
And people can have very, very, very wide ranges

267
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,574
of hand-eye coordination,

268
00:15:57,955 --> 00:16:01,497
especially if you're talking about a game

269
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:05,440
that appeals to a wide age range.

270
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:08,362
And this sort of thing is sort of important

271
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:13,326
because it's really difficult for a person

272
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,087
to see the benefit of,

273
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:17,169
let's say I'm making a first-person shooter.

274
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:20,469
and this gun is 10% better than the other gun.

275
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:26,253
Well, that may only matter if I'm playing against someone

276
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:28,695
who's in the exact same skill range that I am in.

277
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,276
And that might be a very small fragment of the audience.

278
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,859
Most likely, if you gave me a gun that's 10% better

279
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,621
than another gun, I'm just gonna get killed anyway.

280
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:39,963
So the value of that purchase is very, very minimal for me.

281
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:42,444
And similarly, if you're at the top of your game,

282
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:44,906
those sorts of purchases may not matter

283
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:46,287
in 99% of the contests that you're in.

284
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:52,510
This isn't a hard and fast rule, but it's just, it's sort of critical to realize that

285
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,732
you definitely reduce the value of incremental purchases for your customers in terms of their

286
00:16:57,772 --> 00:17:01,813
win percentage, the wider part they are in skill.

287
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:13,138
Another really important lesson that we learned, and we actually, at one point when we were

288
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,819
doing magic, we were concerned about reducing randomness in the system.

289
00:17:18,482 --> 00:17:20,623
And the more we tended to do that,

290
00:17:20,683 --> 00:17:26,024
we did actually notice effects of sales essentially going

291
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:26,344
down.

292
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:30,465
For small audiences, a high degree of randomness

293
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,905
in your game is critical.

294
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:35,266
Now what's high, I mean I'm not saying that you should

295
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:37,386
be flipping coins, there needs to be skill there

296
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,767
for one object to make a difference over another one.

297
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,027
But higher than you would sort of normally think.

298
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,288
Because for a very small audience,

299
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,870
It is, you want people to be able to play against each other.

300
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,351
You want your bottom 10th percentile

301
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,651
to be able to play against your 80th percentile guy.

302
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:58,712
And without randomness, that's hard to do.

303
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:03,613
Some people think of randomness as the opposite of skill.

304
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:05,173
And that's not true.

305
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:08,314
You can perform a slight thought experiment

306
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:10,514
by considering, say, the game of chess.

307
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:14,655
We could take a game, let's call it rando chess.

308
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:16,929
where you play your game of chess,

309
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,411
and then at the end of it, you roll a six-sided die,

310
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,073
and if it's a six, the loser wins.

311
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:24,094
May not be the greatest game in the world,

312
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:26,036
but then you start to think about it,

313
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:27,357
and you say, well, is there less skill

314
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:29,738
in that game than there is in chess?

315
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:30,999
Well, no, not really.

316
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,282
Every little bit of skill that you had in chess,

317
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:35,763
you still have in that game.

318
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:38,425
Every opening you need to memorize,

319
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:41,307
all the games you need to study, they all still apply.

320
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:42,868
And even more to the point.

321
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:49,053
the exact ranking of chess players in terms of their skill in the world would be the same

322
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:54,535
if that were the game of chess. What are you losing? You're losing accuracy and skill testing.

323
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:58,917
That's the only thing you're losing. It might take more games of playing that for you to

324
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:04,239
determine what the proper rank order is, but it's still the same rank order. And still

325
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:06,060
every single skill applies, you still want to win.

326
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:09,925
So it's sort of instructive.

327
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:11,145
Obviously that's a terrible game

328
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:13,466
because the randomness that's been added to that game

329
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,587
is very overt and very unsatisfying

330
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,468
when the loser wins for the loser.

331
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,209
Although I'd still be plenty happy

332
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:21,989
if I beat Kasparov anyway,

333
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:23,550
because he might be pretty mad.

334
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,691
And so that's the sort of thing,

335
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:29,752
you shouldn't think of randomness as the enemy of skill.

336
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,913
It's just another completely separate

337
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,013
characteristic of the game.

338
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:36,034
And if that's blended into the game along the way,

339
00:19:36,154 --> 00:19:37,294
even in a game of high skill,

340
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:41,017
you get the effect that you have in poker.

341
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:48,363
So, you know, you have a very wide set of people

342
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:50,445
that are able to play with each other

343
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,386
and get positive feedback along the way

344
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:54,028
of determining who the better person is.

345
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:58,091
If I play 10 games of chess against a better person,

346
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:00,173
and I'm winning zero of them,

347
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:02,275
and maybe once I came a little bit close,

348
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:04,136
that's a very unsatisfying experience.

349
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,358
I play those 10 games of poker

350
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:08,300
against someone who's better than me.

351
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:12,746
and I win three or four of them, whatever,

352
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:14,447
figure games as some set of hands,

353
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:18,030
or one hour blocks in a 10 hour session.

354
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,232
That's actually pretty interesting for me.

355
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:21,372
That keeps me involved.

356
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:25,555
If you ask a tournament level poker player

357
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:28,177
if they would want to remove that randomness from poker

358
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,458
and have it be more skill testing,

359
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:32,240
they would have a heart attack, right?

360
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,842
The whole reason they're able to make money long term

361
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:36,303
is because the game is fun.

362
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:40,294
for people who get feedback of exactly how close they are

363
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:42,416
to that better person, of course,

364
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:44,618
they have to pay for that privilege of finding that out.

365
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,841
The other value of randomness in your game

366
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,623
is that if you have an astute audience,

367
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:54,027
it's very helpful in maintaining the discussion

368
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:57,149
about the exact value, strategic value of the cards.

369
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:00,913
When you don't have anything muddying the feedback

370
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,034
for many, many games,

371
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:05,995
people can coalesce fairly rapidly

372
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:07,636
on what the exact best cards are,

373
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:09,096
what the exact best strategy is,

374
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:11,697
before you have a chance to update and change that

375
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,058
and keep the game fresh for people.

376
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:14,478
And that's a disaster.

377
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:15,819
You don't want that to happen,

378
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,780
because again, that's a disincentive to purchase

379
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:23,262
for people that have already bought

380
00:21:24,022 --> 00:21:25,363
the elements of that strategy.

381
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:31,245
Another thing is if every game's a sales pitch,

382
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:37,689
how can you go about adding real value to the objects for your players?

383
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:43,632
And this is an interesting one. You're not trying to, through the course of this,

384
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:48,034
is sort of going to sound like, oh yeah, you're just trying to get as much money out of them as possible.

385
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:55,338
And that's true, but the best way to do that is to actually give them value for the money that they're giving you.

386
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:01,242
So it's not some sort of evil plot. It's, I want to give them something that they want to buy.

387
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:06,247
Adding real value to the objects is an interesting question.

388
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,970
One thing you can do is you can cash out the objects.

389
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:14,034
When we first started with these collectible card games,

390
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:15,795
as many of you know, there was a sort

391
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:18,737
of a thriving secondary market in the cards,

392
00:22:19,778 --> 00:22:22,801
because, specifically because, they were purchased randomly

393
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:23,481
to begin with.

394
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,543
So you didn't have all the cards you wanted.

395
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:29,046
Some people, you would get a sort of a better overall value

396
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:30,006
if you're buying them randomly.

397
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:31,768
But if you really only wanted specific things.

398
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,451
you could just buy that one card.

399
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:37,592
The people at the company hated that for a long time

400
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,933
because we felt that we should be capturing that money.

401
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:44,074
We felt that, you know, somehow this was,

402
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:45,574
we were losing out.

403
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,535
But the nice part about it is,

404
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:49,835
is it gave players the feeling that they could cash out

405
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,036
if they wanted to of the purchases that they've made.

406
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:54,097
How many do cash out?

407
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:55,157
A very low percentage.

408
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:56,037
But.

409
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:57,936
that didn't matter.

410
00:22:58,236 --> 00:22:59,977
There was the belief, and it was correct,

411
00:22:59,997 --> 00:23:01,077
that if they wanted to cash out,

412
00:23:01,117 --> 00:23:02,297
they would get some of their money back.

413
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:06,218
So the objects had a real value for the players.

414
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,739
It wasn't a completely, entirely sunk cost.

415
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:13,020
The other way is, oh, and so when we did Magic Online,

416
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,781
what we did there, and this, I guess,

417
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:20,682
it launched almost 10 years ago, pretty close.

418
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:22,362
So for a product like that.

419
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:29,397
When people were purchasing the digital objects, we were very worried that they wouldn't find value in them.

420
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:35,419
So there's a cash-out system there where you can convert your digital cards into paper cards.

421
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:39,220
You say, get rid of my digital card, we'll mail you the paper card.

422
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,581
There's some restrictions and constraints.

423
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:51,745
But essentially, we felt that was important when the game first started in order to give people real value for the objects they were purchasing, that they clearly understood.

424
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:54,198
I think that's less important in today's day and age.

425
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:55,899
People are much more used to buying digital objects.

426
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,701
Digital secondary markets are common.

427
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:02,044
But back then it was a really critical thing.

428
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:03,445
Tournaments.

429
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:06,227
Let people play tournaments of your game

430
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:07,748
if it's a competitive game.

431
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:13,452
And that gives people, again, real value

432
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:15,174
for the objects that they've bought.

433
00:24:15,394 --> 00:24:17,616
Because they go, they go to a tournament,

434
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:18,796
they compete, they win.

435
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:21,663
There's social currency in winning.

436
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:23,043
There's real money in winning.

437
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:29,566
And so that, again, adds value to their purchases.

438
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:32,067
Fulfilling people's desire to collect.

439
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:34,088
Building community.

440
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:35,329
These are all sorts of things

441
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:37,270
that aren't quite tied into gameplay.

442
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,331
All very, very, very important.

443
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:41,692
When you have a product that's going to be like a hobby,

444
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:43,553
you need to think about these things.

445
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:43,933
Again.

446
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:46,604
returning value to their players for being loyal,

447
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:48,605
for being in the system for a year,

448
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:51,327
for making the purchases across time.

449
00:24:52,248 --> 00:24:53,288
There's a lot of other things

450
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,870
that are sort of outside the scope of the talk

451
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,831
that you can do, but the point is to figure out

452
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,713
how you can provide that value to your players

453
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,734
for being loyal customers and feed that.

454
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:09,057
If every game's a sale pitch,

455
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,319
then the scary thought is that your customers

456
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:12,079
are your salesmen.

457
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:15,701
And that is pretty scary.

458
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,724
Intermixing, but in order to facilitate them

459
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:26,570
being your salesman, it's really nice

460
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,292
when you can intermix large populations of customers

461
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:31,394
because it gives people more opportunity to play

462
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:33,475
and more opportunity to play against

463
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:35,557
a very wide variety of people.

464
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,600
Again, here's randomness absolutely helps.

465
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,543
I mean, you look at tournament games played for money.

466
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:47,100
in the sort of in the paper realm and you have a 50-year tradition

467
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:50,663
of or more of chess being played for money

468
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:54,105
and it's nowhere near as successful as poker

469
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:58,068
and there's a big reason for that. The randomness and the allowing

470
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:02,191
a much larger group of people to play, much easier to find a poker game than a

471
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:02,532
poker

472
00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:06,415
than a chess game, much more positive feedback for doing okay

473
00:26:07,736 --> 00:26:09,477
is critical in that sort of

474
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:12,379
poker's tournament success.

475
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,064
because it allows you to have fun when you're playing against people that might have a better deck.

476
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,206
And here's another important thing.

477
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:26,609
If you're playing against someone in any of your game interactions,

478
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,393
you really do want, again, because you want your customers to find value in purchasing more objects,

479
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:36,376
you want them to run into somebody who has bought more objects,

480
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:40,840
who is beating them, and they think they're beating them because they bought those extra objects.

481
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:44,947
if there's no randomness or a low amount of randomness in the system,

482
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:47,769
they will not have fun throughout that process.

483
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:52,112
If there's enough randomness in the system, they will have fun because maybe they're losing,

484
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:54,394
maybe they're winning 45% of the time.

485
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:58,376
And that's actually really an important sort of number.

486
00:26:58,537 --> 00:27:03,380
I mean, you really would love that to happen, and you would love people to think

487
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,583
that the extra purchase they make is going to be the one that puts them over the winning percentage.

488
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:11,106
If they're winning 0% of the time, they're going to have an awful, awful, awful time.

489
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:15,888
And they're going to think they need to make too many purchases that it's too far beyond them.

490
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:28,210
So this whole thing actually implies, this is something we struggled a lot with in the tournament formats for Magic and actually a little bit even Pokemon.

491
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:33,112
It implies limiting the potential number of formats you have to play.

492
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:38,013
You can play StarCraft in a million different ways on a million different maps.

493
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:40,733
And if you have a billion customers.

494
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,365
you're fine because all of those things will fill up.

495
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:44,666
You'll have plenty of people in each of those.

496
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:47,148
But except for the very top end games,

497
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:48,829
that's not a luxury that most games have.

498
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:52,212
You need to get in control of the number of formats

499
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:53,372
that people play your game.

500
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:56,455
And it's a really hard lesson

501
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:59,697
because every one of those games offers something fun

502
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:02,319
and offers a little bit different way to play.

503
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:04,020
And you want there to be different ways to play.

504
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,462
But you have to balance the consideration

505
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:08,624
of making sure there's a robust audience

506
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:09,805
in each one of those.

507
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:15,997
or else you start, again, to lose the value of players as salesmen,

508
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:21,138
and you lose sort of the value in any sort of social currency built up

509
00:28:22,058 --> 00:28:24,039
in being accomplished in any one of those formats.

510
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,160
This is a really important lesson, especially for video games.

511
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:30,881
It's sort of a side digression.

512
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:33,842
It's not so much about the intermixing of business and game design,

513
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:37,483
but it's something that I think a lot of people don't realize.

514
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:43,138
And that's reconfiguration in these distributed object games is half the game.

515
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:47,360
Well, that means that losses are critical for two reasons.

516
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,423
One, to drive sales, because if I win every game I play, I'm not incentivized to buy anything extra.

517
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:58,366
But even worse from the customer's point of view, they've put in all this effort into learning this very,

518
00:28:58,426 --> 00:29:04,509
very complex system where a large portion of the fun is the reconfiguration of their set of objects.

519
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:06,370
So if they're not losing.

520
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:16,237
they really actually don't get to access half of the game that you've designed for them.

521
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:23,463
In a strictly multiplayer game, losses are easy to come by. You look at your average

522
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:30,228
population, everyone's playing, half of them are losing, you know, half of the games are

523
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:31,148
losses for people.

524
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,855
So you might think it's trivial there in that case,

525
00:29:35,955 --> 00:29:38,037
but it's actually a little bit trickier than that.

526
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:44,080
You want it to not just be, for instance,

527
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,301
you could achieve that if your bottom half of the players

528
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:48,042
lost every game and your top half of the players

529
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:48,663
won every game.

530
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,264
Again, as you can tell, a disaster situation,

531
00:29:51,344 --> 00:29:53,466
very few people are actually accessing

532
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:55,347
that reconfiguration part of gameplay.

533
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:58,328
So what you want is you want the right amount

534
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:01,370
of win-loss ratio for people spread

535
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,711
across your whole population.

536
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,302
And it's something that you can,

537
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:08,924
there's a lot of statistical ways that you can measure this.

538
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:11,106
For instance, like in magic,

539
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:14,308
we used a variant of the ELO system that chess uses.

540
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,190
It essentially tells you what your win percent chance is

541
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,172
against someone else, like true skill ratings,

542
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:20,832
that sort of thing.

543
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,374
You really want to look at it across your population

544
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:27,597
and figure out if you're getting anything

545
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:28,918
too aberrant in that.

546
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,920
And once again,

547
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:41,374
Skill can be high, it can be extremely high, as high as it is in chess, but that doesn't mean that accuracy in skill testing does not have to follow from that.

548
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:47,999
You can have enough noise in the system through the randomness that you have as much skill as you want in the game,

549
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:55,505
and then you dial up that noise so that people can have fun playing people of higher skill,

550
00:30:55,925 --> 00:31:01,410
and you're getting a much smoother feedback on your actual true skill position than you would if...

551
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,411
you are simply taking a measurement.

552
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:05,552
Let's play the fun game of who's the tallest.

553
00:31:05,913 --> 00:31:08,935
And we line up, and OK, you win, and you lose.

554
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:14,639
And I think perhaps the more important implication

555
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:17,922
for most computer games is that the single player

556
00:31:17,962 --> 00:31:21,224
version of your games actually has to entail a lot of losses.

557
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:23,886
And this is hard.

558
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:27,149
I mean, we submitted games over the years to major publishers

559
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:29,290
and would get consistent feedback.

560
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,869
that the single player game was too hard,

561
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:33,910
the campaign was too hard, you were losing too much.

562
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,791
And we tried to make this exact argument

563
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:37,912
that I'm making now of,

564
00:31:38,392 --> 00:31:39,813
well you've got all these digital objects,

565
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:41,714
if they're winning all the time,

566
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:42,934
like the player should always win.

567
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:45,216
Well, if they should always win,

568
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:47,457
then there's no reason whatsoever

569
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:48,837
to have a distributed object game.

570
00:31:49,097 --> 00:31:51,439
They're just, they're not accessing half the gameplay.

571
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,200
The fun in these games is in losing,

572
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,562
reconfiguring, going back, playing and winning.

573
00:31:59,077 --> 00:32:02,898
And I don't know what loss percentage you're supposed to have, but it's pretty high.

574
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:07,181
I mean, even if you're losing 70% of the time, it's fine. It's a single-player campaign.

575
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:10,502
The win, sure, they should be able to win at the end of the campaign.

576
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:16,645
But along that way, you need to be, they need to be generating losses at a much higher rate

577
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:21,648
than you would normally sort of, most people from a game design sense, would consider,

578
00:32:21,668 --> 00:32:23,509
especially a long time ago.

579
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:30,374
And again, if reconfiguration is half the game,

580
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:33,055
repeat play is critical.

581
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:35,897
You want to be able to play against that same person

582
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:37,898
with that same deck after you make a small tweak.

583
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,421
You want to be able to get the tactical part of the game

584
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:44,182
under control so that you can access

585
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:45,382
the strategic part of the game.

586
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:51,906
Keeping play times low is, I cannot stress how important,

587
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,267
for each individual interaction,

588
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:55,808
I can't stress how important that is

589
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,090
for these games to achieve their full value.

590
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,296
If you're playing a two hour game,

591
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:02,137
and then you go back and you reconfigure,

592
00:33:02,177 --> 00:33:04,958
I mean, to play another two hour game,

593
00:33:05,238 --> 00:33:06,839
there's a certain audience out there,

594
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,060
I'm sure, for games like that.

595
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,842
But in general, for most people, most players,

596
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:12,922
that's just too much.

597
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:15,204
That's just not a high enough percentage of the time

598
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:18,165
where the thing that makes your distributed object game

599
00:33:18,265 --> 00:33:19,566
unique, where it sets it apart,

600
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:21,647
they're just not accessing that part of the game.

601
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:26,890
And repeat play is one of the biggest drivers

602
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:30,964
for players getting positive feedback,

603
00:33:31,404 --> 00:33:33,304
because there's somebody that's really annoying

604
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:34,764
that's beating them, beating them, beating them.

605
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:38,445
They go back, pull another object out of their collection,

606
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:40,826
change their thing, and beat that person.

607
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:42,727
That's, I mean, there's no better feeling

608
00:33:43,027 --> 00:33:44,747
that now you have this recurring villain,

609
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:49,028
or best friend, or whatever, and now you're beating him.

610
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:54,189
And we really struggled with this at Wizards.

611
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:57,750
We kept trying to, in R&D, move playtime down.

612
00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:01,033
And if I were making a new game today,

613
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,035
it would have an even lower play time than Magic.

614
00:34:06,137 --> 00:34:08,799
And now, design and business in these sorts of games

615
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,862
are intermixed in an interesting way.

616
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:13,323
Some examples.

617
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:18,147
When you change the rarity of an object,

618
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:22,370
you're not just changing it in a game design sense

619
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,471
to the frequency that it might appear for a player.

620
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:26,913
You're actually changing the price of the product.

621
00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:35,034
you, at Wizards, we used to look at, you know,

622
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:36,474
well, if you're a competitive player,

623
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:38,815
roughly what percentage of the objects will you need to buy?

624
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,296
How much will you need to spend to be competitive?

625
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:45,918
And if some of those objects change in rarity

626
00:34:45,998 --> 00:34:49,379
because you decided, oh, instead of one in 10

627
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:51,659
for this card to appear or object to appear,

628
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,040
it's gonna appear one in 12 times,

629
00:34:54,664 --> 00:34:59,508
Now all of a sudden, you've actually made sort of what would normally be considered a major marketing decision.

630
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:03,612
It's not like I'm the head of marketing for a project and I decide to call down to R&D

631
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:05,513
and talk to some junior level designers and say,

632
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:06,775
should we put this out at $29.99 or $49.99?

633
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:13,140
And they say, I don't know, $49.99. Great, we'll go with that.

634
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,884
And that's actually the decision that's being made constantly in these types of games,

635
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:21,387
something no less powerful than that.

636
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,302
even when you change the power of an object.

637
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:28,803
I mean, rarity sometimes, maybe that's a little more major decision,

638
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:30,363
but when you change the power of an object,

639
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:33,444
oh, I've got a dragon of 42 power,

640
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,584
and I don't know, he's not quite good enough,

641
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:37,004
I'll make him 63 power.

642
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,524
And just tweak it out.

643
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:41,805
Again, it's this sort of seemingly very, very, very minor decision,

644
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:43,825
which ripples through the whole system.

645
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:46,326
Now all of a sudden, your average price for your game

646
00:35:46,386 --> 00:35:49,767
for a competitive player could be, I don't know.

647
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,520
$30 a month instead of $20 a month.

648
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,822
And you've sort of completely unthinkingly

649
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:59,523
made that decision about how many sort of

650
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,685
top level cards are needed and what's required

651
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:03,405
to access play.

652
00:36:03,865 --> 00:36:06,226
I cannot stress enough how important it is

653
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:10,908
to understand what your audience is.

654
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:13,310
At Wizards of the Coast we would sort of

655
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,611
break down our audience into various categories.

656
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:16,731
These are competitive people.

657
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,132
These are kind of casually competitive people.

658
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:21,483
These people over here don't care.

659
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:22,463
They like the art.

660
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:23,663
They love dragon pictures.

661
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:26,284
And you sort of look at all those people.

662
00:36:26,704 --> 00:36:29,045
And when you make these decisions about small power

663
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,846
rarity changes, you are, again, changing

664
00:36:31,886 --> 00:36:33,486
the price of the product for those people,

665
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:37,748
just as much as if you actually change the dollar sign.

666
00:36:40,988 --> 00:36:42,749
And another thing is the release schedule.

667
00:36:43,629 --> 00:36:46,070
Something as simple as changing the release schedule

668
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,751
has major implications for.

669
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:55,182
for not just the gameplay, but for,

670
00:36:57,184 --> 00:36:58,505
well, I'll give you a specific example.

671
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:03,169
So these games, these combinatorial games

672
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:05,010
are very difficult to coalesce around

673
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,111
sort of proper strategy.

674
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:10,355
And the very top level players enjoy that

675
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,958
and like a fast rate of that.

676
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:17,280
But the, just one step below them.

677
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:19,965
if the rate's too high, if it's too fast,

678
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:24,687
they can't, they can never feel like they're

679
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:28,629
anything solid in their sort of efforts in the game.

680
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:32,911
So in 95 or so, this card came out called Necropotence.

681
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,212
Some of you might be players.

682
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:37,493
Necropotence is like the most hated card

683
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:40,674
in the history of Magic among sort of top players.

684
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:44,856
We had so many complaints because, as it turned out,

685
00:37:45,776 --> 00:37:47,617
Necropotence was a really freaking good card.

686
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:53,748
And a whole set of decks, all Necropotence decks, a little bit different, different in

687
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:57,510
interesting ways, but still the professionals kept bitching about it.

688
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:02,893
That card dominated play, dominated play for a whole summer.

689
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:06,835
And it's going to ruin the game, you've got to ban the card, you've got to get rid of

690
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:07,676
it, it's terrible.

691
00:38:08,296 --> 00:38:12,298
And an interesting thing happened, which was sales shot up, even though there weren't any

692
00:38:12,738 --> 00:38:14,219
new releases during that time period.

693
00:38:17,186 --> 00:38:22,207
It's largely anecdotal, but at the retail level feedback, it was like, oh yeah, it's

694
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:22,507
great.

695
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:24,128
People know what deck to play finally.

696
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:28,549
The average, the low-level customer, he knows what he's doing now because he knows that

697
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:32,331
if he builds a Necropotence deck, he may not win, but he's not coming with the worst deck.

698
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:33,811
He's whatever.

699
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:34,752
He's halfway there.

700
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:36,732
And this was enormous.

701
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,493
And the message boards took off.

702
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:41,334
Strategy articles took off.

703
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:43,395
And it was all because...

704
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:46,804
sort of the strategy had slowed down enough

705
00:38:47,304 --> 00:38:49,625
that a large enough percentage of the population

706
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:51,266
was able to catch up, access this,

707
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,027
know what they were supposed to buy.

708
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:56,389
I know, I go make these cards, I make this deck,

709
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,291
I know I'm no longer an idiot.

710
00:38:58,411 --> 00:39:00,352
I may not win, but I'm not a fool anymore.

711
00:39:00,912 --> 00:39:03,734
And I'm not saying you want everything to stagnate,

712
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,535
of course you don't wanna lose the top end of players,

713
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:07,156
but you have to respect everybody

714
00:39:07,576 --> 00:39:10,218
and changing release schedule as far as how rapidly

715
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:13,580
you're changing the strategy has very strong implications on

716
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:18,866
Again, the value of the incremental purchases for players at different levels of skill.

717
00:39:20,547 --> 00:39:25,508
And don't cut your best salesman, which are these sort of rabid top-level players, don't

718
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:28,028
cut your best salesman off at the knees by limiting their time.

719
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:35,850
They should be bitching about not having enough new things to think about at the same time

720
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,411
they're posting articles saying this is clearly, clearly, clearly the best strategy in the

721
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:39,651
game.

722
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:43,812
That's right about the point where it's perfect and then move on.

723
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,872
Yeah, changing the price of the product changes your potential customers.

724
00:39:55,192 --> 00:40:11,257
You, when you change the price of the product, either by, because you made the dragon have an extra whatever, three hit points, you, or if you make an actual change to the price, you change who your potential customers are.

725
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:18,858
And this is another thing where I think sort of more traditional marketing people might actually be more concerned about this sorts of thing,

726
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:30,147
where they'll say, well, I'm making a game for 10 year olds, so I'm going to put it out at a certain price point versus a game for mature audiences.

727
00:40:30,988 --> 00:40:32,969
And it makes a big difference.

728
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,571
And so it's something to consider.

729
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:39,354
You need to actually really know who your customers are, who the customers are on the fringes.

730
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,888
and how sensitive they will be to price changes

731
00:40:41,908 --> 00:40:44,169
in your products that you're doing all the time

732
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:47,049
by changing what mix of objects that they need to buy,

733
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:50,811
what rate they're expected to buy the objects at, et cetera.

734
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,032
One thing that we did, it's a lot less important

735
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:58,593
for digital games, I think,

736
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,854
is we were very big on the organized play.

737
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:04,195
Tournaments, leagues, that sort of thing

738
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:05,475
is a very powerful tool.

739
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:07,596
Sort of the interesting part about this

740
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:08,836
is that is it marketing?

741
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:09,996
or is it design?

742
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,077
When we started it, it was sort of traditional event marketing.

743
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,238
And I think that's sort of how many people would view it,

744
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:20,639
depending upon the company today.

745
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:23,979
And there, it was an intermixture.

746
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,580
It's design.

747
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,060
It was the only way we had to patch the game.

748
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:29,721
Games aren't just their rules.

749
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:31,221
They're not just the rules that come in the rule box.

750
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,162
It's how people play.

751
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:34,262
Every game, nobody plays by the rules,

752
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:35,843
or there's variations of the rules.

753
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,743
So by being able to pick that, you're

754
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:38,143
actually

755
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:41,983
effectively changing the rules that people are playing by.

756
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:45,585
It's a very powerful tool, and it's very similar,

757
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:49,126
like the way we thought of it, is to patching the game.

758
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:53,007
By patching the format, we actually

759
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:57,889
were sort of patching the game as per rules that we put out.

760
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:02,110
And it's a really interesting question,

761
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,511
because there's a lot involved here in the actual.

762
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,080
I would say more sort of event marketing mold,

763
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,561
like one thing that we ran up against,

764
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,803
especially with Pokemon, is keeping these play times short.

765
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:17,324
You've got kids, you've got six-year-old kids,

766
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:18,464
you've got seven-year-old kids,

767
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:22,165
so they're gonna come in to the game and they can't play.

768
00:42:22,345 --> 00:42:25,006
They can't sit there for two hours and play.

769
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:26,507
I mean, that's at the low end,

770
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,888
most of them are 10 years old or whatever,

771
00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:28,668
but even a 10-year-old,

772
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:30,729
he can't sit and play an hour and a half in a row.

773
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:31,789
It's just not gonna happen.

774
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:33,067
It's a terrible event.

775
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,647
It's terrible event marketing.

776
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:35,748
Doesn't work for anybody.

777
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:37,808
Doesn't work for the parents, the kids, a lot of crying.

778
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:39,629
There's a lot of crying at Pokemon tournaments.

779
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,130
And so then you have to start thinking about,

780
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:47,271
again, the design implications of that.

781
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:49,652
Lower your play time so that they can play.

782
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:50,592
Well, what does that mean?

783
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:55,313
Does that mean that I can't play best out of two out of three?

784
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:56,514
Maybe I can only play one game.

785
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:58,294
Maybe I need to change my mix of cards.

786
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:00,395
Maybe I need to start discarding defensive cards

787
00:43:00,435 --> 00:43:01,995
so that the game moves faster.

788
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:04,972
Then of course, then that is this whole big cycle,

789
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:07,313
then that affects how much skill there is in the game

790
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:09,153
if you're playing just one game at a time

791
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:10,113
or best two out of three.

792
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:14,415
So you play two out of three, it's more skill testing,

793
00:43:14,515 --> 00:43:16,035
you can develop more consistent winners,

794
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:19,457
a lot more social currency is being able to be built up

795
00:43:19,837 --> 00:43:21,897
among the audience for winning at tournaments

796
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:23,578
because there's these consistent winners.

797
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:25,539
You feel like you might be able to get a prize,

798
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:27,959
you feel like improving skill at the game

799
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,460
or buying more objects will actually help you.

800
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,991
Or do you dial down toward the randomness end

801
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:35,392
so that the tournament will run more smoothly?

802
00:43:35,432 --> 00:43:37,733
Well, the answer is somewhere in between.

803
00:43:37,753 --> 00:43:40,674
You need to take all these things into consideration

804
00:43:41,074 --> 00:43:42,115
based upon your audience.

805
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:47,057
And that probably happens just as much

806
00:43:47,197 --> 00:43:48,758
with online play of these games.

807
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,160
Are people expected to play a one hour game at lunch?

808
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,641
Or is it a game for kids?

809
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:55,741
Is it 10 or 15 minutes?

810
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:59,443
Well, your design in the very little things you do

811
00:43:59,663 --> 00:44:00,743
in those objects that come up.

812
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:02,814
are going to affect that play time.

813
00:44:03,294 --> 00:44:04,495
If your tournaments are important,

814
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,396
then you really need to be concerned

815
00:44:07,476 --> 00:44:08,797
much more about play time

816
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:11,798
than you were if they were not important.

817
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:14,120
And another thing is that organized play might be

818
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,820
sort of you think of the organism,

819
00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:19,522
the rules as unimportant as I actually think they are

820
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:20,883
in most games are the skeleton.

821
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:23,364
If my game is let's flip coins and see who wins

822
00:44:23,644 --> 00:44:24,564
or cut for high card,

823
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:26,265
you're not gonna have a pro tour.

824
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:27,226
It can't happen.

825
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:29,347
There's no way for you to get consistent winners on that.

826
00:44:29,643 --> 00:44:32,824
So you do need a certain underlying structure,

827
00:44:33,244 --> 00:44:36,364
rule structure, in order to build up certain types

828
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:38,285
of tournament structures, especially the competitive ones.

829
00:44:40,405 --> 00:44:43,526
So, a couple extra concerns, long-term concerns.

830
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:47,407
How do you keep objects interesting in the long-term

831
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,428
over the course of several years, and why should you care?

832
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:54,069
Well, you should care because hopefully,

833
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:55,789
your players are playing, and I don't mean to say

834
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,589
that every game that has distributed objects

835
00:44:57,649 --> 00:44:58,310
is going to last.

836
00:44:59,312 --> 00:45:01,293
for, what, how long did I say Magic was?

837
00:45:01,694 --> 00:45:01,934
18 years.

838
00:45:02,414 --> 00:45:05,035
But it might last for a year across several releases.

839
00:45:05,075 --> 00:45:06,256
That's sort of maybe a little,

840
00:45:06,776 --> 00:45:07,997
that's not normal for a game.

841
00:45:09,298 --> 00:45:10,819
So yeah, it definitely does matter.

842
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,242
We found that we couldn't just allow cards

843
00:45:17,302 --> 00:45:19,503
to live forever in the environment

844
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,364
because when a new player came in,

845
00:45:21,404 --> 00:45:22,805
they felt hopelessly outmatched

846
00:45:23,446 --> 00:45:25,547
because you have thousands of cards that I don't have.

847
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:27,848
So we would rotate objects out.

848
00:45:28,148 --> 00:45:29,969
That was part of what we did with the tournament formats.

849
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,352
And an interesting thing, in the long term,

850
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:36,314
you need to, in the medium term, you need to rotate objects out.

851
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:38,676
So no one is expected to have to make purchases

852
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:39,416
at too high a level.

853
00:45:40,317 --> 00:45:41,978
And in the really long term, you want

854
00:45:41,998 --> 00:45:43,759
to start rotating objects back in.

855
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,242
Because just as I was saying about the cash out value,

856
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:51,525
if the cards have no value after two years,

857
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:53,687
again, I should use objects instead of cards.

858
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,568
The objects have no value after two years.

859
00:45:56,266 --> 00:45:56,726
That's bad.

860
00:45:57,647 --> 00:46:00,649
But if they can always keep rotating back in,

861
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,350
there's always a chance of rotating back in.

862
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,690
That gives people hope.

863
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:07,433
And it actually does, in fact, increase the long-term value

864
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:07,993
of those cards.

865
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:11,475
Avoid complexity creep.

866
00:46:11,995 --> 00:46:13,896
This is the, yeah.

867
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:17,518
This is possibly the worst magic card ever made.

868
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:24,022
The text you see here, I hope you can't read it because.

869
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:27,503
you'd be some sort of mutant if you could read all those words,

870
00:46:28,724 --> 00:46:30,025
is about half the text of the card,

871
00:46:30,425 --> 00:46:32,066
because there was another set of rulings

872
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:34,828
that was about this long of the actual text of the card.

873
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:36,329
I created this card, by the way.

874
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,371
And what a disaster.

875
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:45,235
And it's the easiest way to sort of, oh, I've

876
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:47,356
got to put out more objects and more objects and more objects.

877
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:47,677
Well.

878
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:50,276
Yeah, let's just add another line of text.

879
00:46:50,396 --> 00:46:51,677
Let's have it be resistant to fire.

880
00:46:51,757 --> 00:46:54,919
Let's have it, I don't know, increase your accuracy by 10%.

881
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,682
Let's, oh, let's also have you draw a card

882
00:46:58,722 --> 00:46:59,482
and take the card away from it.

883
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:02,024
You just keep adding this list of things that these things do.

884
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:04,285
And then if that's the way that you're

885
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:06,327
trying to keep your design fresh across two years,

886
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:08,568
you're going to end up with stuff like this.

887
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:10,810
So you really do need to get in control of it.

888
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,132
I would set hard limits right in the beginning on how much,

889
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:16,353
how complex your stuff's going to be.

890
00:47:18,058 --> 00:47:23,481
and avoid power creep. Here's another really bad card for magic. I didn't create this one.

891
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:30,103
Not that dumb. And if you have power creep, two things will happen. One, you won't be

892
00:47:30,123 --> 00:47:35,825
able to rotate objects back in because they'll be awful. And that's a minor concern. The

893
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:39,347
major one is that you won't be in control of your game. You won't be in control of,

894
00:47:40,587 --> 00:47:43,608
if the power keeps going up, you will not be in control of your play time.

895
00:47:43,938 --> 00:47:48,102
Because now, maybe all of a sudden, the game is ending on turn four instead of turn ten.

896
00:47:48,622 --> 00:47:50,984
You won't be controlled necessarily of the amount of randomness in your game.

897
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:52,605
For Magic, it's a very specific example.

898
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:58,450
You're drawing cards, something that ends on turn ten is going to be, in a way, inherently

899
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,852
less random than a game that ends on turn four, just because you're accessing more cards,

900
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,814
your distribution is more even.

901
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:05,935
But in all these games.

902
00:48:06,827 --> 00:48:09,029
just a little bit extra, a little bit extra, a little bit extra.

903
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:12,071
I keep making my gun a little bit more powerful, a little bit more powerful, a little bit more

904
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:15,013
powerful so that people want to buy the next version, buy the next version, buy the next

905
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:15,354
version.

906
00:48:15,714 --> 00:48:19,136
And then pretty soon, you'll end up, oh, everything's a one-shot kill.

907
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,197
Clipped his ankle, he's dead.

908
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:22,419
And so that's a real problem.

909
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:29,644
So you ideally, if you can handle it, over the long term, you would like the power of

910
00:48:29,664 --> 00:48:35,448
your objects in year 18 to be the same as the power of your objects in year one.

911
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,511
And that won't happen.

912
00:48:38,091 --> 00:48:40,593
But as long as you keep having that as a goal,

913
00:48:40,914 --> 00:48:41,894
you'll cycle up and down.

914
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:48,940
And in conclusion, there's probably,

915
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,883
I would say there's two major lessons that I

916
00:48:51,903 --> 00:48:52,763
would like to get across.

917
00:48:53,504 --> 00:48:58,168
One is, there is no substitute for studying games, all games.

918
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:01,310
Any successful game, I don't care whether it's

919
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,973
basketball or poker.

920
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:11,629
the chess rating system, chess formats, any of these popular games, they have a valuable

921
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:13,309
lesson for the game you're working on.

922
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:20,572
It just, I can't, I cannot possibly understate this particular thing.

923
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:23,973
Probably you have a problem that's been solved by someone.

924
00:49:24,414 --> 00:49:29,275
Maybe it was solved by someone making the golf tour back in 1925.

925
00:49:29,755 --> 00:49:33,477
I don't know, maybe it was solved by someone last year who released a great RTS.

926
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:39,690
the answer is out there or at least something that's going to give you an idea for a problem that you have.

927
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:45,675
The other one is that your customer does not care what your org chart is at all.

928
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:52,660
So the fact that it's this person's job to set the price for a product

929
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,202
and it's this person's job to figure out what the power level is,

930
00:49:56,623 --> 00:50:00,446
you people need to get together and really figure it out

931
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:05,130
because you're both working on the product all the customer cares is.

932
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:07,290
what that ends up to him in the long run.

933
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:08,972
And this is hard.

934
00:50:08,992 --> 00:50:13,155
This is one of the hardest lessons for us at Wizards, because it's very painful when

935
00:50:13,275 --> 00:50:15,376
people are stepping on each other's toes.

936
00:50:16,037 --> 00:50:19,760
And you're going to have that both from the business people and from the marketing side.

937
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,564
But it's critical in these games to work it out, because there can be such an amazing

938
00:50:25,604 --> 00:50:31,608
value proposition for the customer and the publisher if you're able to sort of throw

939
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,050
those divisions away and think of everything in terms of the...

940
00:50:34,527 --> 00:50:35,688
and utility of the decision.

941
00:50:36,528 --> 00:50:36,788
That's it.

942
00:50:45,952 --> 00:50:46,773
That's it.

943
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:47,513
Questions?

944
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:54,576
Use the microphone.

945
00:50:54,776 --> 00:50:56,037
Oh, everyone, please fill out the cards.

946
00:51:01,298 --> 00:51:06,863
There's a couple of different CCGs I've been involved in, Magic being one of them, the other one being Legend of the Five Rings.

947
00:51:07,304 --> 00:51:12,088
One of the differences I noticed between the two is that in Legend of the Five Rings, the common most...

948
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:15,211
Sorry, could you speak more into the microphone? I can't quite hear you.

949
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:19,135
In... two games I've been involved in, Legend of the Five Rings and Magic.

950
00:51:20,156 --> 00:51:24,480
And one of the differences between the two is in Legend of the Five Rings, the commons were...

951
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:27,567
of more variable power than they are in Magic.

952
00:51:27,687 --> 00:51:30,228
Usually the commons in Magic are almost kind of throwaway cards

953
00:51:30,248 --> 00:51:31,348
when you get to the higher level.

954
00:51:31,748 --> 00:51:34,208
It's the uncommons and the rares that people tend to play with.

955
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:36,549
Do you have any thoughts about that?

956
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:37,729
One being the better design?

957
00:51:37,749 --> 00:51:39,830
I guess my main answer to that is to disagree.

958
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,530
Magic, there's plenty, like if you look at,

959
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:44,951
it's varied over the years.

960
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:49,372
Certainly if you look at a tournament decks in Magic,

961
00:51:50,992 --> 00:51:52,812
I think there's going to be as many common.

962
00:51:55,264 --> 00:52:00,267
cards in those top-level decks as there are in the other rarities, or at least it'll be

963
00:52:00,307 --> 00:52:05,870
close. Certainly when Magic first came out, lots of the most powerful cards were in common.

964
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,972
So the intention, at least, for Magic was, and I'm not saying that they did this, and

965
00:52:09,992 --> 00:52:14,455
I know at certain times people have had different viewpoints, but the intention was to push

966
00:52:15,075 --> 00:52:21,159
more complicated cards to rare, and to push cards that had more specialized effects that

967
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:22,620
may not occur as often to rare.

968
00:52:23,003 --> 00:52:26,465
Now, certainly a lot of the powerful ones in the very beginning did end up there.

969
00:52:26,945 --> 00:52:30,666
But I would say if you've noticed a consistent trend, it's unintentional.

970
00:52:32,787 --> 00:52:33,067
Thank you.

971
00:52:35,628 --> 00:52:40,810
Magic has different formats for the tournaments, and then Yu-Gi-Oh has the abandoned, restricted list.

972
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:45,452
Could you comment a little on the differences there that you see and the pluses and minuses?

973
00:52:46,693 --> 00:52:49,334
Sorry, the question is, Yu-Gi-Oh has...

974
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:54,789
Abandoned restricted lists? Correct, yeah. And but only one format?

975
00:52:55,469 --> 00:53:00,132
Well, it has abandoned restricted and then just limited and restricted, but the cards

976
00:53:00,392 --> 00:53:05,495
from the very first set can still be used, whereas Magic has the formats that rotate

977
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:11,699
them out. Oh, right, I see. Yeah, well, we made a conscious effort, I didn't work on

978
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:16,982
Yu-Gi-Oh, we made a conscious effort to keep the expenditure for the player down.

979
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:21,846
Uh, and so what happened with Magic in the beginning is you could use all the cards with

980
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:22,907
a ban and restricted list.

981
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:27,769
And it became really, really hard because our print runs were so limited in the beginning

982
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:31,871
to get those older cards, they're much more expensive than, say, first run Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

983
00:53:31,911 --> 00:53:35,072
So I don't know where they, I don't know how much it costs to put together a Yu-Gi-Oh deck,

984
00:53:35,392 --> 00:53:38,613
but we looked at, the price was just becoming more and more prohibitive.

985
00:53:38,653 --> 00:53:43,055
That's when we decided to start rotating out those older cards and we had to do it wholesale

986
00:53:43,115 --> 00:53:46,116
because you get a television show, they print whatever.

987
00:53:46,881 --> 00:53:51,744
100 billion cards literally to start. So their prices never got to the level that they were

988
00:53:51,764 --> 00:53:55,646
of the original Magic cards. We had to cut those off. Now, maybe they're making a mistake

989
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:58,408
because it's still too expensive to collect. I don't know. I haven't really looked at the

990
00:53:58,448 --> 00:54:03,191
chart. But that's the first thing I would do, would be sit down and look, you know,

991
00:54:03,311 --> 00:54:07,213
at that. It'd be great if the older cards were free enough that everyone could just

992
00:54:07,293 --> 00:54:12,496
use all their cards all the time. Thank you. Over here.

993
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:19,018
Sometimes when you make newer iterations of, like, say, Pokemon or Magic,

994
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:23,481
like, there were sometimes when you made a new card that just was better than a previous card.

995
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:25,442
How do you counter that later on?

996
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:29,384
Like, if you did it, if you did it intentionally, if it was accident, but later on,

997
00:54:29,444 --> 00:54:32,866
you know, sometimes, like, people will have cards that are just not really worth anything

998
00:54:32,886 --> 00:54:34,027
because they have the better version.

999
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:36,208
So how do you counter that later on?

1000
00:54:37,028 --> 00:54:37,168
Well...

1001
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:39,806
That's gone back and forth over the years.

1002
00:54:39,846 --> 00:54:45,088
We had a rule at one time that no card was supposed to be strictly better than any other card in the whole set.

1003
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:50,510
It was a good rule of thumb, but it didn't really work out.

1004
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:57,172
So eventually we just started making cards better or worse because of where we wanted the end goal to be.

1005
00:54:57,512 --> 00:55:05,435
You will be forced into obsoleting certain cards when you make tens of thousands of different magic cards.

1006
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:11,567
You'll be forced to do that. And the same thing if you're designing a computer game, same exact sort of thing.

1007
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:17,292
If you have enough objects, some are just going to be strictly better than others, and you can't help it.

1008
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:23,137
Would it be better to try to plan ahead of time to make sure that it doesn't happen, or does it really matter?

1009
00:55:23,637 --> 00:55:31,684
You know, is it better to just like, you know, to make sure, like, try to put, you know, a lot of effort into trying to not do that, or just let it happen?

1010
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:37,975
Um, I think you should plan for it to not happen, but then when it does, don't be too

1011
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:41,356
afraid and too resistant if you're actually going to end up in a better space.

1012
00:55:41,836 --> 00:55:43,917
Yes, certainly the ideal is that that doesn't happen.

1013
00:55:43,937 --> 00:55:45,538
I just, I don't think that's realistic.

1014
00:55:46,198 --> 00:55:50,019
Uh, so I, I do think sometimes you'll have to just say, yeah, you know, lightning bolt

1015
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:51,500
should cost whatever.

1016
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,101
R for two damage instead of R for three damage.

1017
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:55,081
That kind of thing.

1018
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:57,322
It just, yeah, you'll be forced into that.

1019
00:55:58,062 --> 00:55:58,242
Yes.

1020
00:55:59,483 --> 00:55:59,703
Over here.

1021
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:05,774
Yes, if someone has an idea for a trading card game, what advice would you give them

1022
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:06,995
to help flush it out?

1023
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:12,218
I wouldn't launch a new trading card game unless it had a major license attached to

1024
00:56:12,278 --> 00:56:13,339
it today.

1025
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,800
Okay.

1026
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,442
At least I wouldn't put money into it.

1027
00:56:17,762 --> 00:56:22,186
If you want to launch it sort of on your own, and you know 10 years ago I would have had

1028
00:56:22,226 --> 00:56:22,886
different advice.

1029
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:28,450
Now the way the market is, it's sort of difficult if you don't, if you aren't able to bring

1030
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,711
a lot of initial customers in.

1031
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:33,141
But if you wanted to, let's say, let's ask it a slight,

1032
00:56:33,381 --> 00:56:34,481
we'll question it a slightly different way.

1033
00:56:34,521 --> 00:56:36,342
If you want to make a really good trading card game,

1034
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:38,743
I would sit down, I would play test it.

1035
00:56:38,783 --> 00:56:40,704
I would play test it with people that are not your friends.

1036
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:42,685
I would play test it with strangers

1037
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,266
and I would do that for at least a year.

1038
00:56:44,646 --> 00:56:47,008
And I would make changes on that with the thing with,

1039
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,189
you know, we really sort of as nice

1040
00:56:50,229 --> 00:56:51,430
as you can get the cards to look.

1041
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,091
I mean, that's what we did back in grad school.

1042
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:55,972
You know, we had art, we photocopied it, cut it out.

1043
00:56:58,269 --> 00:57:00,510
these games are really, really, really hard to get right.

1044
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,012
And there's a lot of group think that goes on

1045
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:05,213
in your group of, in any group of friends.

1046
00:57:05,694 --> 00:57:09,056
And so, yeah, you know, put it out in front of people

1047
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:10,517
that aren't your friends for about a year

1048
00:57:11,117 --> 00:57:12,198
and keep making changes.

1049
00:57:12,618 --> 00:57:15,580
And you'll end up with a much better product

1050
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,421
at the end than you would.

1051
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:17,641
Great, thank you.

1052
00:57:17,942 --> 00:57:18,122
Sure.

1053
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:20,343
Yep.

1054
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,765
You mentioned that in single player campaigns,

1055
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:25,306
you needed to introduce very frequent failures

1056
00:57:25,346 --> 00:57:27,248
in order to motivate reconfiguration of the deck.

1057
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:27,568
Yeah.

1058
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:32,277
I'm wondering if you might think it would be possible to do something to motivate players

1059
00:57:32,377 --> 00:57:37,481
to reconfigure their decks proactively, so that they still get that rich reconfiguring

1060
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:41,705
experience without the feeling of failing all the time.

1061
00:57:42,105 --> 00:57:50,832
You can do a little bit of that, because you can say, now you're going to fight the fire

1062
00:57:50,872 --> 00:57:54,295
guy, so they sort of go ahead and think they should put all the anti-fire things in.

1063
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,241
And that's okay, it's just really difficult to...

1064
00:58:03,781 --> 00:58:05,022
There's two things about that.

1065
00:58:05,842 --> 00:58:07,742
Most of these systems, if they're gonna have

1066
00:58:07,782 --> 00:58:10,023
hundreds of objects, are sort of too complex

1067
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:11,743
for people to be able to successfully do that

1068
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:12,683
if it's a hard job.

1069
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:16,064
And I'm not saying that there aren't people

1070
00:58:16,084 --> 00:58:18,965
that could do it, but if you really want to provide

1071
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:20,985
a lot of value from the complexity of the system,

1072
00:58:21,325 --> 00:58:22,965
that's almost impossible.

1073
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:42,941
And then secondarily, when you get to the end of that campaign, you, I guess, I don't know, I would question how smart I was if I didn't lose any of the things, if I didn't lose any battles, it's very difficult for me to get feedback on how well or poorly I did.

1074
00:58:44,342 --> 00:58:48,145
I think it's more the nature of the complexity of the system makes it.

1075
00:58:49,448 --> 00:58:53,991
I definitely understand, and in fact the game that we submitted that was rejected had a lot of that in it,

1076
00:58:54,951 --> 00:59:05,437
but I think you still needed to generate the losses in order to, yeah, in order to really do the hard thinking about your deck.

1077
00:59:06,157 --> 00:59:06,438
Thank you.

1078
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:10,080
Yeah.

1079
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:15,683
One of the advantages of going digital is that you can update cards at any time.

1080
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:18,580
So you don't end up with a necropotence or a channel

1081
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,701
fireball situation.

1082
00:59:19,941 --> 00:59:22,983
But at the same time, you saw that sales surged as a result

1083
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:25,445
of players seeing which cards were needed.

1084
00:59:25,965 --> 00:59:26,145
Right.

1085
00:59:26,765 --> 00:59:27,866
So how do you?

1086
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:32,029
So updating cards is a very hard thing, even online.

1087
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:35,431
Just because it's possible to update does not mean that you

1088
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:36,312
want to update them.

1089
00:59:37,412 --> 00:59:40,194
Because someone's purchased this card, they feel really

1090
00:59:40,214 --> 00:59:42,015
good about this purchase because that was a very

1091
00:59:42,055 --> 00:59:43,817
powerful object that they bought.

1092
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:50,052
And then you decide later, oh, sorry, this is going to be the last question and then we'll go.

1093
00:59:50,392 --> 00:59:57,435
So then you decide later that that thing was too powerful.

1094
00:59:57,796 --> 01:00:01,738
Well, maybe I went out and bought that thing specifically because of its power.

1095
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:03,138
Well, now you nerf it.

1096
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:05,659
Well, how does that make me feel?

1097
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,162
How does that make me feel the next time I think there's a really good object out there that I want to buy?

1098
01:00:10,202 --> 01:00:11,142
Am I going to spend money on it?

1099
01:00:11,963 --> 01:00:13,783
How about if I wait and see if you nerf it or not?

1100
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,561
That's a decision you don't want to make. It's much better to constantly move forward if you can.

1101
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:23,303
Sometimes there'll be something so broken that it's just destroying the game and you have to deal with it.

1102
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:27,324
But aside from that, if you at all, if there's any way you possibly can,

1103
01:00:27,784 --> 01:00:31,966
don't take away what people have bought. It's a terrible thing.

1104
01:00:32,926 --> 01:00:33,246
Thank you.

1105
01:00:33,826 --> 01:00:36,107
All right. Sorry. No more time.
