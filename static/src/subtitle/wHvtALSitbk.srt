00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,710
This is your host Chris Graft with a quick note for our listeners.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,833
This podcast was recorded about a week prior to GDC 2020's postponement.

3
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:09,975
Thanks so much for your support and stay safe and healthy out there.

4
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:17,011
On GDC Podcast Episode 7, we've got Dave Lang, a tall guy with cool baseball hats who is Chief

5
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:19,652
Product Officer at Iron Galaxy Studios.

6
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:25,154
He's going to talk about game development in the 2000s, the Chicago game dev scene,

7
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:28,616
the video game porting business, and much, much more.

8
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,016
We'll be back in a sec.

9
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:55,988
And we're back! And it seems that we have found Alyssa McAleen after, uh,

10
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:02,399
after her being, um, missing in action for an entire month.

11
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:06,385
I was going to try to figure out what the in-canon reason for me not being around last

12
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:11,026
week was, but I haven't listened to the episode yet to find out.

13
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:13,107
Yeah, it is canon that...

14
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:13,967
I mean, it's the truth.

15
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:14,847
The truth is canon.

16
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:20,509
You were having your apartment building re-sited, and when I say you did that, you were the

17
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:24,330
one who actually made the order for the re-siting.

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,611
Yep, and I've been out there with the ladder and just yelling at myself to work faster.

19
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:34,029
And it turns out it's really hard to podcast when you're in a construction zone and especially

20
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:35,209
when you're a construction worker.

21
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:35,689
Is that right?

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,890
Yeah, they're still not done with it.

23
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,792
So I was like, as we were approaching the time, I was like staring out the window being

24
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:44,173
like, gonna come hammer on the wall next to my office again, you gotta do it.

25
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:48,035
They're staying away. They're very kind. Apparently GDC podcast fans.

26
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:51,117
So thank you to the construction team at my apartment building.

27
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:57,481
That's what I find missing among contractors these days is the respect for the podcast.

28
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:01,783
Good game development techniques and contracting.

29
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:04,205
Yeah. Well, they sound like a good crew, Alyssa.

30
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:05,866
Well, it's nice to have you back.

31
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:10,028
We got rid of that Alex guy whose last name we never did reveal.

32
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:14,271
He might be back if the sighting continues.

33
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:15,913
That Alex, someone's Alex.

34
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:22,116
Yeah, so let's do some morning announcements here, right?

35
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:27,698
What's going on at GDC?

36
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:32,700
I want like the Ferris Bueller with the dun dun dun before they do the morning

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,780
announcements at the high school.

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,161
Oh yeah, we need that.

39
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,281
Yeah, can you edit that in?

40
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:36,881
Yeah.

41
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:42,323
Let me find my links here for the Pioneer Award at GDC 2020.

42
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:50,708
They've announced that Roberto Williams is receiving that award at the GDCAs.

43
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:52,369
Did you say Roberto?

44
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:58,132
Roberto? I'm so bad with pronouncing names, I don't know why this is my job right now.

45
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:02,455
Who's Roberto Williams? Known for Kang's Quest.

46
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:05,597
Oh my gosh, okay, so you can handle that one because I can't talk.

47
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:08,194
No, no, you're fine.

48
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:09,156
I can't either.

49
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:12,481
I can't believe words are able to spill out of my mouth right now, honestly.

50
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:19,591
Yeah, but Roberta Williams, Pioneer Award, because she did amazing stuff throughout her

51
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,314
career with all the adventure games.

52
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:26,218
Did you ever play any of Roberta Williams' adventure games from Sierra On-Line?

53
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,680
Oh shoot, yes I have.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,081
I didn't...

55
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:30,683
I'm very bad at connecting name dots.

56
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:35,227
Sierra On-Line defined my childhood with weird adventure games that I didn't quite understand

57
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:36,308
how weird they were at the time.

58
00:03:39,111 --> 00:03:40,132
Mixed up fairy tales.

59
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:44,576
I never played King's Quest, but there was a Sierra On-Line one about fairy tales that

60
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:45,357
was really like...

61
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:49,218
dark actually, that was great and gave me nightmares. There's another one,

62
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:54,680
Hepper's Adventures in Time, I think was a CD-ROM game where you time traveled back and hung out

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,421
with a stoner Ben Franklin. That one was also super dark and gave me nightmares.

64
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:03,523
Wait, are you sure that this was a game where you went back in time and you met Ben Franklin?

65
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:07,824
It could have. Maybe I'm just getting all my time travel memories and compartmentalizing them

66
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:10,705
so they make sense to my child brain as, oh, it was a video game.

67
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,666
Yeah, yeah. Well, that happens to me sometimes too.

68
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:21,640
Roberto. So let's let's start getting our next guest in. He's just kind of

69
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,361
hanging back here. It was tough to sit back with the Roberto Williams talk.

70
00:04:27,622 --> 00:04:29,262
I have some Roberto Williams opinions.

71
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:32,168
There he is.

72
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:32,889
There he is.

73
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:36,633
The best game bar none, in my humble opinion, is Gabriel Knight.

74
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,856
That's the best Roberto Williams game.

75
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:39,176
Yeah.

76
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:44,603
Um, there was also, I remember, wait, let me, dammit, let me introduce you.

77
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:44,823
Okay, sorry.

78
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:45,604
You're completely breaking protocol.

79
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:45,905
That's my job.

80
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:46,105
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:46,445
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:46,746
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:46,986
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:47,206
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:47,407
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:47,787
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:47,987
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:48,188
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:48,388
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:48,668
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:48,908
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,390
As chief product officer.

93
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,311
I could get a stab at it and just put the accent on the wrong vowel.

94
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:55,931
See where that goes.

95
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,113
Okay, yeah, let's try it.

96
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,594
Okay, now our next guest, he cut his teeth as a game programmer in the 90s.

97
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:08,036
If I get any of this stuff wrong, we're going to have to edit Wikipedia.

98
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:16,661
It was Studio Tech Director at Midway where he oversaw games including Stranglehold.

99
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:22,464
And then he went on to found Chicago-based Iron Galaxy Studios, known for games like

100
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:26,667
Killer Instinct and their amazing ports of video games.

101
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,909
It is Dave Lange?

102
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:31,670
Close, very close.

103
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,570
It's Dov Lange.

104
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:38,933
Okay, thank you. You almost nailed it. Yeah. Yeah, thank you for joining us today.

105
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:40,834
No, thank you. It's my pleasure. It's all mine.

106
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:44,175
I love your work, Christ.

107
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:50,117
Now, let's, now, now, before we get in, like, let's, let's talk about, uh,

108
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:52,278
Roberta, Roberta, now I'm going to say Roberto.

109
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:59,041
Roberta Williams stuff, uh, like, what was your strong opinion there again, Dave?

110
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:02,642
Uh, Gabriel Knight series is without a doubt her best work, I believe.

111
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,175
I'm almost certain she worked on those games.

112
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:06,376
I'm almost certain.

113
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:09,578
I was going to Google it when you were talking to make sure I don't sound like an idiot,

114
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:11,759
but I didn't want to hear a clackety clack in the background.

115
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,060
I want to respect podcast etiquette.

116
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,043
So at the risk of being wrong on a podcast, I'm going to strongly say those are her best

117
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:19,283
games.

118
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:24,288
If the apartment building reciters can just back off for a minute, you can refrain from

119
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:25,529
tapping on your keyboard very loudly.

120
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:29,713
I can open the window, maybe they can shout in their favorite game too, just kind of get

121
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:30,354
the whole experience.

122
00:06:30,394 --> 00:06:30,554
Yeah.

123
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:30,874
Yeah.

124
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:35,639
I was working at GameStop when Phantasmagoria came out, and that was like a big deal.

125
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,505
Because there were some adult scenes in it, and it was FMV and stuff.

126
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:43,654
I never played that one.

127
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:44,495
That's the one I skipped.

128
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:49,899
I didn't play it, but I did see the box on the shelf while working at GameStop.

129
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,703
I'm going to minorly derail the conversation to embarrass myself on the podcast quickly.

130
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:55,184
You're going to derail the derailment.

131
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:56,145
Derail the derailment.

132
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:59,988
On the topic of mispronouncing names, just to get the ground nice and even here with

133
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:04,732
my own name, which is Alyssa, I got my hair done over the weekend, and when I introduced

134
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:05,052
myself...

135
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,836
to the woman dying my hair for four hours.

136
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,619
Didn't say my name, but she knew me from the invite,

137
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,402
and she's like, oh, good to see you, Allison.

138
00:07:13,703 --> 00:07:14,965
In that moment, I did not correct her.

139
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:18,670
And then for the next four hours, it was like, too late.

140
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,273
So I sat in the chair being called the wrong name

141
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:23,156
because this is the hole I dug for myself.

142
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:28,671
There's a certain, like, how long do you think you're allowed to let, like, what is the window

143
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,132
for correcting someone on your name?

144
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:33,234
Because I have, my full name is Christian with a K.

145
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:33,735
Yeah.

146
00:07:33,895 --> 00:07:35,716
So when people see it, like, on my credit card, they're like...

147
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:36,894
Here we go.

148
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:39,736
Kristen and like, you know, that's fine.

149
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:40,556
It's just Christian.

150
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:41,237
It happens.

151
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,057
Yeah.

152
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:45,659
But if you don't say anything in like those three seconds, anything

153
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,640
longer than that, it's weird.

154
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,461
Anything like longer than that, you think the window is three seconds.

155
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:50,862
It's like, it feels like 20.

156
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:52,163
Dave, what do you think?

157
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:55,384
So I definitely shouldn't correct my title at this point.

158
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:55,765
Right.

159
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:58,203
Oh, no, you've got a new job now.

160
00:07:58,423 --> 00:07:58,924
Okay.

161
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,445
I'm now chief product officer.

162
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:00,905
We nailed it.

163
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:01,986
Crushed it.

164
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:03,527
Oh yeah.

165
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:06,029
We got, wait, your product project?

166
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,370
No, I'm not.

167
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:08,591
I'm not entitled just founder.

168
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:09,412
Okay.

169
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:10,053
Just founder.

170
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:10,753
Just founder.

171
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,714
So it's not product.

172
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:12,595
No, no, no.

173
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:13,315
It's not chief.

174
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:14,056
It's not product.

175
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:14,837
And it's not officer.

176
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:15,537
It's not, it's not.

177
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:16,338
Oh, geez.

178
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:19,400
For a while I was calling myself C3PO for a while.

179
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,884
I was going to make that joke until I looked on your LinkedIn and knew I'd already made

180
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,224
the joke.

181
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:27,587
Yeah, because I was CEO and then we brought Adam in to be CEO.

182
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,988
I'm like, well, I need a title now.

183
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:32,331
And I don't care about titles at all, but people I talk to do.

184
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,413
And it should have a C in front of it, I guess.

185
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:37,876
And so I was calling myself C-3PO and it just confused the shit out of everyone.

186
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,638
So I subsequently reverted to founder.

187
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,980
Now when you say Adam, you're talking about Adam Boyes.

188
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,842
Yes, Adam T. Boyes, Esquire.

189
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:45,887
and

190
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:46,347
they have failed.

191
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:07,106
I had to Google CPO and I got all kinds of results for it.

192
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:10,208
So where that probably came from is when we did the flip.

193
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:17,073
So I was the CEO and Chelsea was our Director of Product Development.

194
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,574
Now you founded Iron Galaxy in 2008.

195
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:19,395
2008, right.

196
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:23,218
And then Chelsea joined me in 2010, I believe.

197
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:24,820
December 2010, something like that.

198
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:28,463
And she's been along for the ride almost the whole time.

199
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:29,684
She's like employee number 13.

200
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:33,368
And then when we brought Adam on board to be CEO,

201
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,811
I wanted to make Chelsea the C-suite 2 at that point.

202
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:39,313
And so at that point, she became CPO,

203
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,615
which is our chief product officer.

204
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,077
And then after about a year of that, she's like,

205
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:45,860
it doesn't really encapsulate what I actually do.

206
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,301
I'm just going to be COO.

207
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,202
Everyone knows what that is.

208
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:50,024
No one asked me any questions about COO.

209
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:52,886
And then you be founder, and then we'll call it a day.

210
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:53,807
And that's what we settled on.

211
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:56,950
So there's a lot of confusion around the C-suite at Iron Galaxy.

212
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:02,008
Are you still considered a C-suite executive even though there's no C?

213
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:05,070
I believe technically I'm above the C-suite in most people's minds.

214
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,272
I believe founder, you know there's two kinds of founders.

215
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:13,235
There's the founders who are still there and the quote-unquote power behind the throne

216
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:15,236
and the people that actually get shit done.

217
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:19,159
And then there's the founders who had to get out of the company because they said something

218
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:19,919
racist on Twitter.

219
00:10:21,324 --> 00:10:22,965
And I'm definitely not the latter yet.

220
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:23,965
That's not you though.

221
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:24,445
Yeah, not yet.

222
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:25,006
Congratulations.

223
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,787
Yeah, I just dodge another bullet every day, you know?

224
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,828
But I'm still the first one, I hope, anyway.

225
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:31,569
Yeah.

226
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,331
I mean, so basically, I'm not sure what you do.

227
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:43,435
You're the very upper tier of your company, but you still got stuck doing the podcast.

228
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:48,969
Yeah, so you know what? I'm a podcasting person. I love podcasts. I have my own podcast, in fact.

229
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,171
Oh yeah? What's it about?

230
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,852
It's kind of like the Seinfeld podcast. It's not really about anything.

231
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:56,553
It's just me and my friends talking. Actually, you know what? Recently,

232
00:10:56,994 --> 00:11:01,596
so I recently launched season three, and season three we're doing game development origin stories.

233
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:06,199
So I tracked down game developers, and I talked to them about how they got into the business.

234
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:11,161
Have you talked to anyone about origin stories? Have you heard an interesting one yet?

235
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:18,134
I'm going with people I know just to see if the concept works, and it definitely works.

236
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:21,898
The best one I've had on the podcast so far that I already knew is Jon Vignacchi.

237
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:24,321
His is the best by far.

238
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:31,710
He basically pre-internet stalked Mark Turmell and got a job just by stalking Mark Turmell.

239
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,251
It was amazing.

240
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:36,674
That's great. And also these names, you've been around the block.

241
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:39,055
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,777
When did you start game development?

243
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:46,641
So I started professionally in, my first job was January 96 at Sculptured Software.

244
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:51,644
Sculptured Software was a very prolific 16-bit developer,

245
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:55,106
like dated the Genesis version of Mortal Kombat, right, that everyone loves.

246
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:56,347
Yeah, amazing.

247
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,749
They were a port house, did a lot of stuff.

248
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:02,792
And then they got bought by Acclaim, like actually right before I got there.

249
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:06,915
And about, after my, I worked on Space Jam first for the Saturn,

250
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,737
and then I worked on a game called NHL Breakaway for the N64,

251
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:12,859
and as Breakaway was happening,

252
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,985
All of the leadership team got fired by a claim and they went off and started a new studio.

253
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,947
It's called Kodak Interactive.

254
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:30,357
So I finished the hockey game there and then quit and went and worked on WCW Mayhem and then WCW Backstage Assault.

255
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:38,724
Kodiak, and then those games didn't really turn out the way anyone wanted, and so that studio started to close kind of dramatically.

256
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:44,508
At the time I was working on a baseball game for Kodiak, but Microsoft contracted Kodiak to do it.

257
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:50,713
And when Kodiak folded kind of overnight, I ended up at the Microsoft Salt Lake studio to finish that game out.

258
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:53,596
And I hated that job. That job was horrible.

259
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:55,717
Oh yeah? What was so bad about it?

260
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,797
It was just not a good fit for me.

261
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,579
Like, gosh, I don't want to like speak for...

262
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:04,240
I can't imagine something not fitting your personality.

263
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,200
It's weird, right? Yeah, it's really weird.

264
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:07,641
Like, that place was like...

265
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:13,463
So it was a really well-established and fabled game.

266
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,304
Like, they did Tex Murphy, right?

267
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:16,104
Oh yeah.

268
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:17,425
They did the Lynx games.

269
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:20,366
They were a great developer that made a bunch of great games.

270
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,326
But I guess like...

271
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,712
There's no really kind of clean way to say this,

272
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,153
but just, yeah, it wasn't a fit.

273
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:28,755
I guess that's the best way to say it.

274
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,357
And I was there for about two years

275
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:33,659
and finished the baseball game.

276
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:35,080
And then they're kind of like,

277
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,421
hey, there's probably not another game

278
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,902
for you to work on here, wink, wink.

279
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:42,606
And so at the time my wife is like,

280
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:44,488
hey, let's have a family, let's go back home.

281
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:45,869
And so I'm originally from Chicago.

282
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,953
And so I went back and I interviewed with New FX

283
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,134
who became EA Chicago.

284
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,586
And I interviewed at Midway, and I didn't really want to work at either place,

285
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:57,728
because this was like the Fat Babies era, right?

286
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,373
And going to Midway sounded like the worst job in the fucking world, right?

287
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:05,576
And I just swore. I said I wasn't going to swear, and I just swore. Perfect.

288
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:06,897
It's 15 minutes in.

289
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:07,237
Yeah.

290
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:08,358
The floodgates are open.

291
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:10,860
And just rip the bandaid right off.

292
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,204
But I ended up going to Midway, and it ended up being the best decision I've made to that point in my career, for sure.

293
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:24,148
And I met a ton of talented people, and worked on tons of cool things, and just learned a lot about game development there.

294
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:24,757
Yeah.

295
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:30,201
I I'd like to talk about the Midway days because, um, I was, I started

296
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:32,823
reporting on the industry in late 2005.

297
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:38,487
And then a few years later, like, uh, you know, shit started

298
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:41,509
really hitting the fan at, at Midway.

299
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:45,012
Can you talk about, you know, like any interesting stories there?

300
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,693
Like that was, it seems like a tumultuous time.

301
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,074
There's like a revolving door of CEOs.

302
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,231
Yeah, I mean there's literally like no, what variety of story would you like?

303
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:54,471
I mean there's like, what kind of category?

304
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,032
Like a mafia involved story.

305
00:14:57,392 --> 00:14:58,272
Okay, so...

306
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:58,372
What?

307
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:01,053
I've got one of those.

308
00:15:01,873 --> 00:15:07,074
So there was always rumors that Midway was, like the CEO at the time was a guy named

309
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:08,295
Neil DeCastro, right?

310
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:12,756
And there was always rumors that he was hit mafia ties or was in the mafia or whatever.

311
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:15,577
And I didn't believe any of them or whatever.

312
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:19,659
I was like, oh that's stupid, there's no way, it doesn't make any sense.

313
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,680
And then my first week at Midway, and Midway was a weird place.

314
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,642
It was like, if you weren't at Midway like 30 years, they treated you like you just got

315
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:29,823
there and you never had a job before.

316
00:15:30,623 --> 00:15:32,144
And so the first week, like, no one talked to me.

317
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:36,085
And I went to lunch by myself, and I found this little kind of sandwich shop, like, right

318
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:36,966
around the corner from there.

319
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:40,787
And I go in there, I order a sandwich, and the guy's like, hey, you look like you probably

320
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,408
work at Midway.

321
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:42,748
And I go, yeah, I just started.

322
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,590
He goes, real family business they got going over there, huh?

323
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,391
And I shit my pants on the spot.

324
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:52,178
And I'm like, what have I done?

325
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:53,279
Like, is this for real?

326
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,400
Is this a thing?

327
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,001
And then the whole time I was there,

328
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,221
I never heard another Mafia reference

329
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:58,022
the whole time I was there.

330
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,683
But the first week, I was scared.

331
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:00,323
I was scared.

332
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:01,244
Terrified.

333
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:01,844
That's great though.

334
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:03,906
I mean, it's like blood in, blood out, right?

335
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:06,447
Yeah, at this point I'm expecting like,

336
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:08,028
I'm gonna be like, you know,

337
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,270
digging shallow graves for people

338
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,831
in the middle of Wrigley Field

339
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:13,351
and burying people at the pitcher's mound.

340
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,373
Like I'm having visions of what's going down

341
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:16,113
for me in my future.

342
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:17,754
And none of it ended up happening,

343
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:18,355
but it was pretty weird.

344
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:23,063
So the sandwich person I caught in your story said you look like someone that works at Midway.

345
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:23,724
Yes.

346
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:26,008
Why did you look like someone?

347
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,132
So Midway at the time was in a...

348
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:34,382
Let's just say it was in a very diverse neighborhood.

349
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:37,625
It was a lot of Hispanic influences,

350
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:38,866
a lot of Asian influences,

351
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:42,048
and there weren't a lot of people that looked like me,

352
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:43,349
aka huge white guys.

353
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,450
Tall white boys.

354
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,731
Right, that kind of live,

355
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:47,673
that are like endemic to that region, right?

356
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,914
And so if one walks in,

357
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,737
and you know, it's probably a midway person,

358
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:54,358
and sure enough, they guessed it correctly.

359
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,759
There, yeah, there they are.

360
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:56,419
Now.

361
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,401
Like, there was also the whole...

362
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:03,426
Sorry, I slightly nerd out about some of this older stuff, but like...

363
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:07,890
You were there as studio tech director, and I remember something going on,

364
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,213
trying to, like a big deal near the end, making a switch to Unreal Engine 3.

365
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,715
Yeah, so when I started, I started as...

366
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:17,238
I was the lead on Slugfest Loaded, that was my first thing there.

367
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:19,840
And then I was the lead on Blitz the League.

368
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:25,164
And then I spent like six months as tech director for all sports games,

369
00:17:25,705 --> 00:17:28,247
and then I got promoted to studio tech director.

370
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:32,290
And about the time I was sports game tech director,

371
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,191
Midway was on RenderWare at the time.

372
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:37,093
Pretty much everyone was on RenderWare of some form or function.

373
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:40,796
And Midway kind of made a strategic decision to switch to Unreal 3.

374
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:45,511
And thinking, okay, so here's the way it's going to work.

375
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:49,073
We'll be able to share engines for the first time and share experiences.

376
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:54,297
And if game team A writes something cool, game team B, C, D, and E will benefit from it.

377
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:59,680
And all these synergies that seem theoretical if you've never made a game before.

378
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,061
Seem theoretically possible.

379
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:07,925
And yeah, so basically everyone, like you know, Stranglehold was...

380
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:13,470
Oh gosh, what was the name of that game? It was the telkadesis game?

381
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,191
PsyOps.

382
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:20,295
So it's like PsyOps, they had to ditch their engine to go MK, ditch their engine to go Unreal.

383
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,917
Pretty much everyone that had established franchises.

384
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,959
In the middle of projects and series.

385
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:25,459
Right.

386
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,962
And then they came to the sports teams to do it, and the sports teams were like,

387
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:30,584
well our budget for the game...

388
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:34,286
The whole budget for Blitz the League 1 was $8 million.

389
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:39,430
If we wanted to rebuild a game, and that only works because

390
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:43,994
we had years and years of Blitz already there,

391
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:46,596
and we had to, like, what's new for this year, or whatever.

392
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:49,979
I'm telling you, if we have to switch to Unreal 3, it's a $20 million game,

393
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,740
it doesn't make sense. I'm like, exactly right.

394
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,882
Let's just leave it as renderware.

395
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:58,045
Aside from the sports games, everything was UE3 by the time the doors closed at Midway.

396
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:04,627
Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It's one of those things that, you know, it makes sense on paper, uh, to an executive, right?

397
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:13,198
Yeah, it's a funny though without them doing that experience like iron galaxy doesn't exist today because like one of my duties, um as studio tech director

398
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:15,980
So there was the core technology group,

399
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,261
which was in the Austin studio,

400
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:19,763
but every studio had an advanced technology group.

401
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:21,664
And it was a room full of engineers, basically.

402
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:24,406
And we were kind of tasked with the lofty goals

403
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,587
I talked about earlier, like, hey,

404
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:28,709
if the Wheelman team builds a crowd system,

405
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,411
now every team can use it.

406
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:33,072
And the ATG team's job is to distribute that

407
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,794
or work on the tool, make the tool chain better,

408
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:38,456
make the particle effects editor better,

409
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,158
make the UI system better or whatever,

410
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:40,938
that everyone benefits.

411
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:42,439
But really what we ended up doing.

412
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,084
was just fixing bugs, improving performance, working on RAM considerations or whatever

413
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:49,505
for the next game out the door.

414
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,888
And so it was a room full of 25 really good engineers and all we were doing was firefighting

415
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:55,529
for the next midway game coming out the door.

416
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,534
And as things started to disintegrate there, it was clear, like, I don't know what's going

417
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:02,835
to happen, but it's going to be dramatic.

418
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:08,119
I kind of realized, like, we have a room full of 25 people here just doing this for Midway.

419
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:12,382
Like we could do this freelance, I bet, and make some coin doing it and run a business.

420
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:16,905
And shortly after that realization, I kind of punched out of there and started exactly

421
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:17,305
that business.

422
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:29,802
That's cool. Yeah, that kind of brings us to Iron Galaxy, which is, you know, it's immersed itself in porting and work-for-hire stuff and tech consulting.

423
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:36,530
But, you know, you also do publishing and you work on franchises like Killer Instinct. I know that, you know, original IP is...

424
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,353
in probably, you know, in the cards on the cards for you.

425
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:46,398
But can you tell me about, you know, the affinity for the tech side?

426
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:50,041
Is it just because of your background or is it like a job stability thing?

427
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:51,963
You know, you have to work for hire stuff.

428
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,486
How long do you want me to talk about this for?

429
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:56,909
I want you to talk for about three minutes.

430
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:57,490
Okay.

431
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,551
No, as long as you want.

432
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:00,955
I've got multiple versions of this story.

433
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:02,477
I have a three-minute version. You're in luck.

434
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:03,358
Okay.

435
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:04,279
Starting now.

436
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,205
Okay, so basically the reason Iron Galaxy exists is...

437
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:14,433
You know, I had the opportunity that I saw with the things happening, but that's not the reason we did it.

438
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:19,274
The reason we did it is I'd been at so many companies that had kind of closed overnight on me.

439
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:22,415
Like, you know, Sculptured kicked out the management. It wasn't the company I loved anymore.

440
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,415
Kodiak literally closed overnight on me.

441
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:28,616
Microsoft, right, a company with like $10 billion in the bank, told me I'm not welcome there anymore, essentially.

442
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:29,677
I need to find a new job.

443
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:33,619
midway, disintegrated around me, like, you know, it's like no place is safe.

444
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:39,543
And I just wanted to build a game developer where I could work with my friends until I was done making games, right?

445
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:42,525
I want to build a place that we can retire from if we want to retire from.

446
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:47,108
And so stability is the thing we care about most in the world,

447
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:50,991
and as such we tend to work on a bunch of projects at once,

448
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:52,892
and a bunch of varieties of projects at once.

449
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:56,716
And so we started off doing just tech consulting,

450
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,077
like firefighting stuff.

451
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:00,279
Then we branched into doing ports.

452
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,462
And then we branched into doing original development.

453
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:09,628
And our portfolio now, ideally, we've

454
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:12,511
got one really big creative project in the works,

455
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,813
whether it's Killer Instinct or Extinction or whatever

456
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,555
is next for us, which we can't talk about quite yet.

457
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:19,117
We're doing some ports, you know, like we've worked on.

458
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,360
We helped Blizzard do Overwatch, Diablo 3.

459
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,262
We've helped Skyrim switch port with Bethesda.

460
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:27,124
And we're still doing a lot of co-developments.

461
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:31,827
And we have people embedded on teams at Bethesda and Blizzard

462
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:33,208
and other places I can't mention yet.

463
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,911
And so we kind of do all this different work

464
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:38,192
and we do like 10 to 12 different things at once.

465
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:39,934
And we don't do it because it's easy.

466
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:41,835
We do it because if one of them goes away...

467
00:22:42,716 --> 00:22:44,197
No one has to lose their job, right?

468
00:22:44,317 --> 00:22:45,937
There's plenty of work to go around for everyone else.

469
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:47,518
And so we want to be doing,

470
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,839
like, it's like when people start at IG,

471
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:51,720
what I tell them is like, okay, if you're coming here

472
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,741
and you have a game in your head that needs to get out,

473
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:57,923
this is probably not the best place for you to be, right?

474
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,144
Because, like I'm not saying we're not gonna make it,

475
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:01,224
I'm not saying it's impossible,

476
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:02,765
I'm saying it's not a priority.

477
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:05,366
Like, what's important here is making sure

478
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,727
that this company's built to last

479
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:10,008
and we're gonna make robust decisions around,

480
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:12,269
like, you know, ensuring that.

481
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,333
Other people's bad decisions or games' bad performances don't affect us in any way, shape, or form.

482
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:26,300
It's interesting because when you describe the business tack of Iron Galaxy, it's like,

483
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,604
well yeah, that makes sense. And then the next question is, well, why aren't more companies,

484
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:34,266
more game companies, doing what Iron Galaxy does?

485
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:37,708
And I assume the answer is probably because it's really hard?

486
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,230
Well, it's weird. So there's...

487
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:44,167
It's a really complicated question.

488
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:47,228
So there are people doing what we do.

489
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:50,509
I think it's just more rare that you know who we are

490
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,310
than more so that people don't do what we do, right?

491
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,931
Like, there's a bunch of companies out there

492
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,552
who I think kind of followed in our footsteps

493
00:23:57,612 --> 00:23:58,852
and realized like, oh yeah, we can,

494
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,653
because like when we started this company,

495
00:24:01,493 --> 00:24:03,174
it was pretty common for people to think

496
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,774
you can't outsource engineering, you know?

497
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:08,095
Like they had just barely gotten used to outsourcing art.

498
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:12,156
And like, oh no, engineering is too iterative

499
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:14,057
and it's too collaborative and it'll never work.

500
00:24:14,617 --> 00:24:16,257
And then we kind of showed, yes, it can work.

501
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:18,437
And so there's companies that do it like we do it now.

502
00:24:18,477 --> 00:24:20,558
And there's companies that have been doing ports longer

503
00:24:20,578 --> 00:24:21,358
than we've been doing them.

504
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,199
It's just for a variety of reasons,

505
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,099
we've kind of emerged from that group

506
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,520
as one of the developers people know about

507
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,500
more than others, right?

508
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,441
So there are a bunch of people behind the scenes

509
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:33,401
kind of doing this kind of work.

510
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:36,201
It's just maybe they're not as recognized as we are.

511
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:37,102
Yeah.

512
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:41,270
So I think when I was reading, doing my obligatory research into all of this...

513
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,593
The internet's talking. Let's just call it what it is.

514
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:46,316
Yeah, yeah, okay. I was trying to put a spin, but here we are.

515
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,601
So yeah, I was reading about how that's kind of the gist of your studio.

516
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:54,206
What you do is a lot of support for other projects and stuff like that, and that reminded me of...

517
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:59,771
Psyonix, Rocket League developers, did like, I watched a, I think it was a Noclip documentary

518
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:03,275
about them, and they were talking about how they did a similar kind of thing where they

519
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:07,559
did, but theirs was more, they did a bunch of like, helped other people with their projects

520
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:10,442
to keep themselves afloat while they chased their dream projects.

521
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:14,525
But that's kind of like, a same starting point but different goal from what you guys are

522
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:14,966
doing, right?

523
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:20,304
Yeah, it's a subtle... I know the Sionics guys fairly well, Dave and the crew over there.

524
00:25:20,324 --> 00:25:24,808
Well, that's probably overstating it, but I know them.

525
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:30,233
And we've talked about this stuff from time to time before Dave became a billionaire and doesn't talk to anyone anymore.

526
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:34,876
But the, like yeah, it's like, you know, they,

527
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:37,257
I think one of the differences between us

528
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:39,098
and other people that do this work, right,

529
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,379
and one of the reasons I think we have

530
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:42,519
kind of risen to the surface,

531
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,781
is I think a lot of companies do the work we do

532
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:46,421
to pay for the game they want to make.

533
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:50,604
And as a result, that shows in the work they do.

534
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:54,307
Maybe they don't have an even distribution of talent across all the projects.

535
00:25:54,947 --> 00:26:01,372
Maybe people that are on the support jobs or the port jobs are bitter they're not on the creative thing,

536
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:04,634
and they're kind of pissed off about that, and they're not doing their best work or whatever it is.

537
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,036
And that's just not what we do.

538
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:11,359
Like here, everyone understands that every project's important,

539
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,722
everyone's work is important for ensuring the goal of...

540
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:17,324
You know, we're going to be here to fight another day no matter what, right?

541
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:20,826
And so, I think that's one of the differences between us and almost everybody else.

542
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:25,609
Because they're looking to get that breakout hit and become financially independent.

543
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:30,692
And like, you know, that would be great if it happened, but it's not a goal.

544
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:32,614
Like, the reason we do creative things at all...

545
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:38,009
One, it's like, yeah, it would be nice in the 5% chance we have something that hits.

546
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:41,691
Like, hey, now money is not really as much of a concern as it normally is.

547
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:47,854
But really what it is, is we want diversity in partners and diversity in projects and platforms.

548
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:52,297
You never know. I'm not an analyst. I don't know which way the industry is going to go.

549
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:55,440
But I do know if we have experience doing something,

550
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,523
it's easier to get those kind of jobs in the future, right?

551
00:26:58,963 --> 00:27:01,186
And let's say, like, co-development dries up overnight,

552
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,710
and then we need to become a studio that pitches more creative IP.

553
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,353
Well, we've got experience doing that, right? Or whatever it is.

554
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,935
So it's more like a strategic thing than like a,

555
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:11,537
oh, I've got to make this game.

556
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:13,659
Holy shit, is this my ambition in life is to make this thing?

557
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:14,473
Yeah.

558
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:15,113
Yeah.

559
00:27:15,773 --> 00:27:23,815
And you're, uh, it seems that you have an opinion about, uh, uh, like

560
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:26,655
quality of life, job stability, things like that.

561
00:27:26,675 --> 00:27:29,216
And that was informed by your past experiences.

562
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:34,457
So, um, I'm wondering from your perspective, do you think that quality

563
00:27:34,497 --> 00:27:38,678
of life in the game industry has gotten better or worse or stayed about

564
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:40,718
the same over the past 15 years?

565
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:41,618
Oh, it's definitely better.

566
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:45,839
It's like, it couldn't be any worse than it was when I started.

567
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,081
And I do want to clarify something. I do tend to talk about this a lot or get asked about this a lot.

568
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:55,902
And I think one thing I kind of universally do a bad job at explaining, like

569
00:27:56,302 --> 00:28:00,483
Iron Galaxy has not always been this like oasis where we don't crunch, right?

570
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:06,284
Like in the beginning, I'd say the first three or four years or whatever, we all worked our asses off, right?

571
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:09,725
And then at some point, I just kind of decided like

572
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:12,567
You know what, if this is the way it has to be,

573
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,328
then it's kind of not worth doing.

574
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,351
And it wasn't overnight, but we slowly kind of

575
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:20,833
built a culture of no crunching

576
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:24,016
and zero tolerance of that sort of thing.

577
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:25,897
Some people still work hard,

578
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,378
and some people still put in extra hours

579
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:28,479
because they're passionate about stuff,

580
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,601
but it's something we try to monitor,

581
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:32,862
and the company will never ever ask anyone

582
00:28:32,882 --> 00:28:34,183
to work more than 40 a day.

583
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:37,166
The conversation I had with everybody in the studio,

584
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:38,987
it's like, listen, I don't,

585
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:41,449
I don't need you to work 41 hours, I just need your best 40.

586
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:45,592
As long as you're giving me your best 40, that's all I care about.

587
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,996
It's something I feel pretty strongly about now.

588
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,420
And I think we've proven you can do it.

589
00:28:55,042 --> 00:29:01,568
The hard part with creative projects and no crunch policy is, as someone...

590
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:05,833
You know, I talk a lot about, like, doing creative projects is like a strategic thing for us,

591
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:09,196
but that doesn't mean we don't have people here that are, like, incredibly passionate about, like,

592
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:12,259
making Killer Instinct as good as it can be, or whatever, right?

593
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,221
And a game can always be better.

594
00:29:14,902 --> 00:29:18,684
It can always, always be better. There's always something that can be better.

595
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,907
And developers know what can be better. We're not blind.

596
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:24,548
We play the game, we see these problems.

597
00:29:25,168 --> 00:29:29,811
And so having the discipline to kind of walk that line and take care of yourself

598
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:34,214
while feeling like you're doing your best work is very challenging on creative projects.

599
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:39,817
And I think the industry still sucks at it, but it's like...

600
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:42,503
through the lens of like, wow, that's a really hard problem.

601
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:45,291
Like, I'm not sure exactly what the solution there long term is.

602
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,595
Yeah, yeah.

603
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:48,736
Well, there you go, folks.

604
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,836
There's no—Dave doesn't have a solution for crunch.

605
00:29:51,276 --> 00:29:51,856
Yeah, weird, right?

606
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:52,357
And life balance.

607
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:52,597
Yeah.

608
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:59,439
Yeah, I mean, we—our solution is we just don't do it, and we—if a game is—needs

609
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:03,420
more time, our solution isn't, like, make people work 80 hours a week.

610
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,441
Our solution is go to our partner and get more time from them, you know?

611
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:08,941
But that's an imperfect solution, too, right?

612
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,502
That's like, comes with its own perils.

613
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:12,122
So yeah.

614
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:15,812
How's that conversation tend to go when you reach out to a studio you're working with

615
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:18,655
and you're like, hey, we need more time to do this, we can't do this in the amount of

616
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:21,538
time in interest of keeping my staff happy and healthy?

617
00:30:21,978 --> 00:30:29,061
Yeah, I mean, generally speaking, it's gotten easier over the years as our partners have

618
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:33,183
kind of gotten used to us and know the work we do and the quality we do.

619
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:38,045
It's kind of like, when we were just getting going, it would have been impossible, right?

620
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:43,567
And with some of the partners, I'm not going to name names, it would like literally if

621
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:44,828
we told them up front, like...

622
00:30:45,508 --> 00:30:46,969
Hey, we're not going to crunch this project.

623
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:48,270
We wouldn't get the gig, right?

624
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,751
It's just like flat out, we just wouldn't get it.

625
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:52,473
But now, 11 years into this thing,

626
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:55,015
everyone knows who we are, everyone knows what we stand for.

627
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:56,976
You know, the track record of our work

628
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:59,258
with this policy kind of stands on its own merits.

629
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:02,060
And either you care about that,

630
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,701
you care about like making a good game,

631
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:07,324
like, you know, or you care about other things.

632
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:08,405
And if you care about other things,

633
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:09,406
they just don't call us.

634
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:16,112
We have kind of like self-selected a client list of people that care first and foremost about game quality.

635
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:21,077
And because of that, those conversations are not nearly as hard as they would be otherwise.

636
00:31:24,477 --> 00:31:28,301
Is there a port that you're particularly proud of?

637
00:31:29,202 --> 00:31:34,609
Yeah, I mean it's still Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online Edition, without a doubt.

638
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:40,635
That was our first big, quote-unquote, big break.

639
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,840
There was a bunch of hand-wringing about some of the details about the game,

640
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,421
like really, really nitpicky stuff,

641
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,362
but I just couldn't be prouder of the game we put out.

642
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:55,684
It's kind of like our first effort, and the response it received,

643
00:31:55,744 --> 00:31:59,545
and it's still kind of seen as like the gold standard of Capcom fighting game ports,

644
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:02,766
and yeah, that's without a doubt what I'm still proudest of.

645
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:06,770
So my partner, I mentioned that we were doing this interview with you and he's like,

646
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,973
oh holy shit, Third Strike! Like immediately without missing a beat.

647
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:13,556
So yeah, I still got that. I played a crap load of that on

648
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:17,720
PlayStation 3 and still break it out every now and then if I want to get my ass handed to me.

649
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:18,837
Yeah, it's so weird.

650
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:23,399
Like, you know, the version we did isn't in the Capcom or Street Fighter 30-year edition

651
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:24,160
or whatever it was.

652
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,901
It's like a different version.

653
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:33,144
And it's like, I know why Capcom did that, but it's just so weird that there's people

654
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:37,826
out there playing a version of Third Strike that's not the one we did, and it's bad.

655
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:39,367
It's just really weird.

656
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,568
Wait, why didn't they include your version?

657
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:48,486
I assume it's financially, there's financial reasons tied to it is what I'm assuming.

658
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:50,147
They never even called us and asked us about it.

659
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,968
That's weird.

660
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:56,371
Yeah, I would assume it's some kind of financial, they didn't want to engage with us because

661
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:59,092
of cost reasons, is my assumption.

662
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:02,815
Again, I didn't talk with anyone at Capcom about it, but I did find it pretty weird.

663
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:07,747
So, Iron Galaxy is in Chicago.

664
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,611
I actually...

665
00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:13,375
We also have two studios. We have Chicago and Orlando.

666
00:33:13,956 --> 00:33:16,640
Oh yeah, that's right. Chicago and Orlando. Where are you calling from?

667
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,921
Are you in Chicago right now?

668
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:18,883
Yeah, Chicago right now.

669
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:21,425
Yeah, so I used to live in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

670
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:22,225
Nice!

671
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:26,449
We used to jump over there for Bears and Cubs games.

672
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:27,029
Okay.

673
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:34,074
What's... and I love Chicago, like just the vibe there is like so good,

674
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:37,277
and my kind of vibe... what's the game dev scene like there?

675
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:40,737
It's pretty not great, I would say.

676
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:41,537
Okay.

677
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:44,320
I think that's, I think among Chicago people,

678
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,581
that might be a contentious opinion.

679
00:33:46,382 --> 00:33:48,303
But, like, you've got NetherRealm,

680
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:50,745
who's still here and making kick-ass games, right?

681
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:53,628
Like MK and all the games, Injustice,

682
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:55,730
those games just keep getting better and better and better.

683
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,193
And they're, like, the top of the craft in that stuff.

684
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:00,574
Shout-outs to them.

685
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:05,438
There's us, there's people who have been around here forever, like High Voltage.

686
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,861
Then there's a kind of indies that are kind of up and coming.

687
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:15,743
Right? Like you got Young Horses here, who did Octodad,

688
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:18,504
and they're probably going to start talking about their next game here really soon.

689
00:34:20,045 --> 00:34:23,627
You've got a lot of indie people kind of getting things going,

690
00:34:24,288 --> 00:34:25,568
but it doesn't feel...

691
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,724
Like, it just doesn't feel like a game development hub to me.

692
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:32,185
You know, like people don't come here for game development, right?

693
00:34:32,265 --> 00:34:33,585
People don't think about Chicago.

694
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:35,686
Like, if you go to a random person and say,

695
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,347
hey, give me your top 10 game development cities,

696
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:40,668
like, I don't think most people name Chicago, right?

697
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:44,929
And so, I think it's not great, and I get it.

698
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:47,330
Like, the reason we opened the Orlando studio

699
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:50,973
It's not great here, and recruiting is very hard.

700
00:34:51,013 --> 00:34:53,835
When we're recruiting people with experience,

701
00:34:54,856 --> 00:34:56,897
they're usually coming from a warmer climate,

702
00:34:57,538 --> 00:34:58,839
or at least a coast or something.

703
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,261
And they have one of two reactions.

704
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:03,382
They either think they're going to freeze to death or get shot

705
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:04,403
the minute they get off the plane.

706
00:35:05,484 --> 00:35:10,289
And so recruiting is really hard and the city, you know, there's not a lot of economic support from the city.

707
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:15,834
And so if this is something, like all those problems, you know, the weather obviously you can talk to,

708
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,956
the crime you can talk to, the crime is largely a myth.

709
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:24,283
But really if you want people to start growing businesses here and like not move, you know,

710
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:28,487
half the development studio to Orlando, then we need support from the local government that we're not getting.

711
00:35:29,924 --> 00:35:32,146
So how big are your studios in each city?

712
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:35,288
So we are about 140 people across both of them,

713
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:41,632
and it's about 55-45 Orlando right now.

714
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,153
That's reasonably medium.

715
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:47,016
Yeah, it's one of those things too where it's weird.

716
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:55,069
You know, like, we started in 2008, like a month before the global recession, essentially.

717
00:35:55,089 --> 00:36:03,914
And while it made it impossible to get a loan for anything, it ended up, like, it's the reason we're probably still standing is because of that thing.

718
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:05,134
And it's like...

719
00:36:07,854 --> 00:36:10,677
Like you talk about cognitive biases, right?

720
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:13,781
It'd be really easy in our position to have survivors' bias, right?

721
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:16,925
They're like, oh yeah, we must be great because we're still here.

722
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:21,791
But if you look at us, it's like, one of the real reasons we're still here, and I believe

723
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:23,352
this in all my heart, and this is no bullshit,

724
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:29,318
When that recession hit, a lot of people started making fewer and fewer games every year, right?

725
00:36:29,498 --> 00:36:34,263
And budgets got, budgets kind of bifurcated. Budgets, they went smaller and bigger in the

726
00:36:34,303 --> 00:36:38,267
middle. It was already starting to dry up, but it just kind of disappeared altogether.

727
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:45,974
Yeah, it totally, the bottom fell out of the middle. So then you just have like really big or small.

728
00:36:46,214 --> 00:36:50,398
Right, and so there were a bunch of developers at the time that are our size now that had

729
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:50,939
to scramble.

730
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:54,702
They had to go to Facebook games or mobile games or go out of business altogether, right?

731
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:59,407
And so then when the economy kind of stabilized, there was this void of developers this size

732
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:00,408
that do this kind of work.

733
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:05,853
And it allowed us to kind of grow into that space much easier than we would have otherwise,

734
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:06,054
right?

735
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:07,215
Because we didn't have to displace.

736
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:10,716
These 20 other veteran studios that have been doing it better,

737
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:11,877
longer than we've been doing it.

738
00:37:11,937 --> 00:37:12,137
Right.

739
00:37:12,257 --> 00:37:15,998
And so, um, it's really weird to think about like, oh, that was a really good

740
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:18,359
thing for us, but I've no doubt it was at this point.

741
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:23,781
Well, there's like the talent, like when those like medium size studios, uh,

742
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:28,243
medium sized publishers closed down, then you kind of have all of the talent.

743
00:37:28,263 --> 00:37:30,504
You have, you have a recruitment pool, essentially.

744
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:31,004
Yeah.

745
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:31,844
Yeah.

746
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:34,565
And so, so, so there you have it.

747
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,846
Uh, if you benefited from the, uh, the recession.

748
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:38,522
Massively, yes.

749
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:39,562
Yes.

750
00:37:41,183 --> 00:37:42,064
Yeah, that's so interesting.

751
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:45,646
So, um, when you're, when you're talking about successes and

752
00:37:45,686 --> 00:37:49,748
failures at Iron Galaxy, uh, you know, what, what have you learned about

753
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:53,250
what, what players want and finding an audience, and I know that you do some,

754
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,112
you know, a lot of your work has to do with, you know, studios themselves.

755
00:37:57,513 --> 00:38:02,896
Um, but I know that, you know, you do killer, uh, killer instinct and you've

756
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:05,697
commented, I watched you part of your GDC talk.

757
00:38:07,258 --> 00:38:11,279
And I'm just wondering if you can speak to what you've learned about the audience.

758
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,699
Yeah, it's interesting.

759
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,840
I still feel like we've got a lot to learn there, frankly.

760
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:27,382
I don't think listening to the audience and being aware of their concerns is a skill we've fully developed at this point.

761
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:29,783
And I think it's something we need to be better at.

762
00:38:29,803 --> 00:38:31,603
I feel like, generically, it's really easy to engage.

763
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:40,021
with people that are saying things you agree with.

764
00:38:41,102 --> 00:38:44,425
And if there's people who are saying things like,

765
00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:47,267
maybe they're not even trolling or whatever,

766
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:49,089
they're just saying a view you disagree with,

767
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,611
it's really hard to have institutional discipline

768
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:55,135
to interrogate that feedback in a dispassionate way.

769
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:57,637
And say, okay, is there value here or not?

770
00:38:58,077 --> 00:38:58,277
Right?

771
00:38:58,677 --> 00:38:59,458
Yeah.

772
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:02,219
Because it's so easy to dismiss Twitter feedback.

773
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,121
It's so easy to dismiss forum feedback.

774
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:05,862
Because so much of it is just horrible.

775
00:39:06,182 --> 00:39:06,342
Right?

776
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:06,522
Yeah.

777
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:10,185
And I think that is something we need to be better at.

778
00:39:10,385 --> 00:39:11,566
And we need to figure out like,

779
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:14,467
how do we actually interrogate some of these notions

780
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,729
in a dispassionate way.

781
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,650
Because I think our knee-jerk response is,

782
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,371
oh, just ignore it all.

783
00:39:20,671 --> 00:39:20,852
Right?

784
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:21,392
Yeah.

785
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,333
It's a really, really difficult problem.

786
00:39:24,094 --> 00:39:25,294
Because you should ignore most of it.

787
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:26,855
Because most of it sucks.

788
00:39:28,436 --> 00:39:31,316
But that doesn't mean there's nothing out there that's valuable or good.

789
00:39:32,117 --> 00:39:35,818
And when we were a certain size, I remember with Third Strike,

790
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:41,099
I'd get a handful of emails a week from people who were passionate about Third Strike.

791
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,541
And a lot of them were nasty.

792
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:46,463
But then 9 times out of 10, I'd engage with the person and be like,

793
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:48,345
Hey, listen, if you're going to talk to me like that,

794
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:49,986
I'm not going to continue this conversation.

795
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:54,249
But if you want to have a discourse about how do we make this game better,

796
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,450
okay, let's do that.

797
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,312
9 times out of 10, those people respond with, I'm sorry.

798
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:01,235
I didn't think anyone would even read this thing.

799
00:40:02,155 --> 00:40:04,437
But here's the problems I see them, and they were really good, right?

800
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:06,078
And now the problem is...

801
00:40:06,993 --> 00:40:10,075
Like we're to the size and scale, like a killer instinct.

802
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:11,016
We just couldn't do that.

803
00:40:11,296 --> 00:40:11,477
Right.

804
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:13,778
There's like too many people.

805
00:40:13,798 --> 00:40:15,420
And I feel like that's a valuable job though.

806
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:15,880
Yeah.

807
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,361
Like Twitter is more prolific too.

808
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:21,905
I mean, you can't, you know, have that conversation like that nowadays to say

809
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:24,587
like, look, you're being a jerk and then they'll just come right back and say,

810
00:40:24,627 --> 00:40:25,368
well, you know, fuck you.

811
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:26,808
If you want to

812
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:28,929
back off immediately, but I don't think it's like that anymore.

813
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:50,799
That's actually, I think, one of the best things about my Twitter persona.

814
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:58,885
I've cultivated a view of myself from people that is impervious to trolling.

815
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:02,028
Like, who is going to send something nasty to me?

816
00:41:02,488 --> 00:41:05,731
I put so many stupider things out than you could ever tweet at me every day.

817
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:08,813
There's nothing you can do to get to me. It's impossible.

818
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:11,314
I've been trolling myself this whole time.

819
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:11,674
Right, exactly.

820
00:41:11,694 --> 00:41:13,155
You can't do anything.

821
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:15,235
It turns out I'm dumber than you are, as it turns out.

822
00:41:15,395 --> 00:41:16,816
Ha ha ha, joke's on you.

823
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:17,676
Yeah, yeah.

824
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:23,238
Yeah, you just self-deprecate yourself into invincibility.

825
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:26,959
Yeah, it's worked out inadvertently well, like many things in my life.

826
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,544
Um, I, now we're probably getting close to a wrap up time, but we need to hit, we need to hit a couple things here.

827
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:40,928
I think like, um, I'm not really caught up with, there's a thing with you and Windjammers and Adam,

828
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:45,431
uh, boys, I think, or what, what is, what's the story there?

829
00:41:45,852 --> 00:41:50,455
So Windjammers, I, um, this is not my finest moment.

830
00:41:52,296 --> 00:42:01,044
It was like, I want to say like maybe six GDCs ago, I was day drinking and then I remembered

831
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:06,509
I was supposed to be on the giant bomb stream that night and I got on the stream and I was

832
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:07,470
blasted.

833
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:11,013
I was out of my frickin' mind gone.

834
00:42:11,033 --> 00:42:12,575
I should not have been on.

835
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:13,956
This is a no judgment zone.

836
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,698
We've all done stuff like this.

837
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:18,161
Friends should have stopped me from going on.

838
00:42:18,782 --> 00:42:22,788
But, so Vinyaki knew we had Killer Instinct signed,

839
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:25,613
but we were announcing it like, though, Tuesday.

840
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:29,699
We had a big, like, exclusive in Polygon that was dropping Tuesday after GDC.

841
00:42:30,822 --> 00:42:35,886
And so, but he's a good friend, quote unquote.

842
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:37,968
He was trying to get me to ruin all that

843
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:39,670
and spill the beans on the giant bomb thing.

844
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:43,333
He goes, Dave, I hear you've got a big announcement to make.

845
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:46,396
And luckily, by the way, this should cement,

846
00:42:46,776 --> 00:42:48,738
as embarrassing as that show was for me,

847
00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:51,200
like if you have a doubt I can keep a secret,

848
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,441
look at that fucking stream.

849
00:42:53,762 --> 00:42:57,284
Because I just without a beat, I look at the camera,

850
00:42:57,304 --> 00:42:58,964
I go, yes, I've announced what to make.

851
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,785
You'll never have another Windjammers.

852
00:43:00,805 --> 00:43:06,347
Because Giant Bomb at the time had been playing a lot of Windjammers.

853
00:43:06,507 --> 00:43:09,348
It was something of a staple on their Friday show, they'd play it live.

854
00:43:09,668 --> 00:43:12,709
And I don't hate Windjammers. I've never even played Windjammers. I don't care.

855
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:14,430
I just thought it was a funny thing to say.

856
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,211
And then from that moment on, I was the guy who hates Windjammers.

857
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:20,052
That's a very random game to choose.

858
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:24,274
Yeah, and so, very, well, that might kind of, like, as I just mentioned, I was hammered.

859
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:27,775
And so, yeah, and so, at that point on, I became a, like,

860
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:29,216
Dave Lang professional Windjammer hater.

861
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:33,538
Yeah, I know. I was reading rumors, like, you owned the Windjammers property.

862
00:43:33,558 --> 00:43:37,079
Yeah, so I was keeping that under wraps so no one else could ever enjoy it again.

863
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:38,300
Yeah, yeah.

864
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:38,940
Okay.

865
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,321
There's another Windjammers coming out.

866
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:42,782
Did you, like, will that into existence somehow by just being like,

867
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:45,083
no, so much that Windjammers 2 just...

868
00:43:45,585 --> 00:43:47,769
It's pretty funny how that Windjammers stuff goes,

869
00:43:47,789 --> 00:43:50,112
because every time there's a Windjammers trailer for two,

870
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:51,695
or an announcement for two, or whatever,

871
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,257
people tweet at me like,

872
00:43:53,277 --> 00:43:54,459
Ha ha, you were wrong!

873
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:55,801
I'm like, hey, it's not out yet.

874
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:56,782
Also, it's not out yet.

875
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:05,085
So I think also we have to have you and Alyssa talk on air about Hitman.

876
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:08,927
So let's just open the floor for any Hitman map conversation.

877
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:14,290
There was the moment when we were doing our stalking, I had a podcast there again,

878
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:19,093
where I have already established I have a bad time linking names and like what

879
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:22,295
people have done. It takes me a second to like connect those dots.

880
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:26,558
And I was just literally sitting at my desk, I'm like, holy shit, he's the guy who made the Hitman list!

881
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:28,920
Because I had discussed that in Slack recently.

882
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:35,025
Because for Giant Bomb, your end of the year list this last year, you ranked the Hitman maps in 2016 too.

883
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:41,451
Yeah, I've been doing that giant bomb list for almost a decade now, and as this company's

884
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,013
gotten bigger and bigger, I have fewer and fewer time to play games.

885
00:44:44,734 --> 00:44:48,877
And so I literally didn't play 10 games I liked last year, right?

886
00:44:49,157 --> 00:44:53,900
And so I can't do a top 10 list, and so I just come up with hopefully creative, original

887
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,741
things to do every year.

888
00:44:55,181 --> 00:44:56,202
And people seem to like that list.

889
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:57,983
It seemed to go over pretty well, so yeah.

890
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:59,504
It was a good list.

891
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:02,707
I was going to disagree with it, but I get to the bottom and you're like, oh, there's

892
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:04,088
no such thing as a bad Hitman map.

893
00:45:04,128 --> 00:45:04,828
And I'm like, oh, you're right.

894
00:45:05,423 --> 00:45:07,286
There's only some that are better than others.

895
00:45:07,727 --> 00:45:08,007
Yeah.

896
00:45:08,608 --> 00:45:11,293
Colorado was one of the...

897
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:15,700
Okay, not to get too fan about Hitman talking here, but

898
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,986
Colorado for the longest time was my least favorite Hitman map.

899
00:45:20,607 --> 00:45:31,138
And then that was going through it the first time when I'm still like learning the magic of the game and kind of those all those systems you memorize, all the steps you memorize and the weird little ways that you can interact with NPCs that you figured out to kind of like game the system.

900
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:36,624
And then going back like Colorado is an entirely different experience once you have that little bit of knowledge under your belt.

901
00:45:38,394 --> 00:45:41,455
My personal Colorado story is filled with tragedy and heartbreak.

902
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:43,176
Yes, yes, yes.

903
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:46,338
So the way Colorado goes is there's three targets, right?

904
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:52,201
And then there is a secret door with like a facial scanner in the basement of one of the houses.

905
00:45:52,781 --> 00:45:57,804
And you need to build like a 3D print mask to get into that door, right?

906
00:45:57,944 --> 00:46:01,786
And so, but the mask is of someone you killed.

907
00:46:02,606 --> 00:46:04,087
and I didn't know about the mask bit.

908
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:06,889
And so I killed the guy on the other side of the map

909
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,352
and I carried him stealth mode

910
00:46:10,993 --> 00:46:13,114
all the way, I was gonna like hold his face up to the door.

911
00:46:14,443 --> 00:46:16,703
And so I played that map for two fricking hours,

912
00:46:17,243 --> 00:46:20,104
and I hauled from the cornfields all the way into the house

913
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:22,725
without being seen, Herculean task,

914
00:46:22,785 --> 00:46:25,625
and I get to the door, and there's no fricking prompt.

915
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:27,786
And I was so mad.

916
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,567
I was just getting angry just thinking about it.

917
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:33,447
I'm like, how, if this isn't even the way you do it,

918
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:34,988
how is this not like scripted?

919
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:36,948
Ah, this is the worst game of all time.

920
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,588
And I put Hitman down for a little bit,

921
00:46:38,648 --> 00:46:40,329
and I came back, and like, yeah, Colorado,

922
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,250
it was, at that point, it was the worst map by far.

923
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:44,690
But subsequently...

924
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,111
Oh, that would have been so brilliant though if that worked.

925
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:48,252
I feel like...

926
00:46:48,632 --> 00:46:51,274
I might be wrong, but I thought I read that that worked, so I don't know if they patched

927
00:46:51,294 --> 00:46:54,356
that in eventually, or I could be just making something up right now.

928
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:56,637
Maybe IO Interactive heard Dave's story.

929
00:46:56,657 --> 00:46:59,679
I've talked about it enough places, I wouldn't be surprised.

930
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:03,763
I mean, if they kept the suitcase, or the briefcase with the...

931
00:47:04,103 --> 00:47:04,464
The homing?

932
00:47:04,484 --> 00:47:08,188
The following, yeah, the homing briefcase, where if you throw it, it's not quite as fast,

933
00:47:08,268 --> 00:47:11,692
or it's a little bit faster than the run speed of the NPCs, so they'll start sprinting away

934
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:15,797
from it, and it'll track them, and follow them, and fly through the air, and they, like,

935
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:19,622
instead of patching that out as a bug, they, like, double down on it, which is, I, it was

936
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:19,842
great.

937
00:47:20,142 --> 00:47:25,345
Yeah, one of the best gifs in Hitman in recent times is the guy throwing the briefcase at

938
00:47:25,365 --> 00:47:26,266
the guy in the jet ski.

939
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:27,046
Yeah.

940
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:31,229
And the briefcase just like, holding, missing the guy in the jet ski.

941
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:31,709
Amazing.

942
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:32,730
Yeah.

943
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:38,513
I think, I forget who the level designer was, but she gave a talk at GDC last year.

944
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:45,303
and talked about the different kinds of level of spaces they designed in the Hitman level

945
00:47:45,343 --> 00:47:47,324
and color-coded everything and broke it down.

946
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,245
It's a really great talk.

947
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:52,707
Not sure if it's on the YouTube vault, but it's out there and you should really watch

948
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:55,108
it or read my live tweets or my article about it.

949
00:47:55,348 --> 00:47:58,030
There's also a great no-clip documentary on Hitman as well.

950
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:58,970
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

951
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,871
Watch all this material about Hitman.

952
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:06,353
But she was talking about Colorado and what made it different and why people didn't like it so much

953
00:48:06,373 --> 00:48:10,414
is because in Hitman games you typically have your two spaces in level design,

954
00:48:11,695 --> 00:48:17,037
on the broader category, where there are these social stealth places where you can walk around normally

955
00:48:17,057 --> 00:48:19,918
and as long as you don't do anything inherently illegal, no one's going to get pissed at you,

956
00:48:20,538 --> 00:48:23,859
and these more secure spaces where it's like this is a trespassing zone, there's armed guards,

957
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,361
and once you're in this spot you have to be stealthy or you have to blend in.

958
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:33,441
and Colorado is all that second space, which made it so difficult because there's no safe place.

959
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:36,082
Yeah, getting started. You gotta get the first outfit, and then, yeah.

960
00:48:36,643 --> 00:48:40,004
It's so difficult and such a different kind of level design, but even that,

961
00:48:40,064 --> 00:48:43,326
when you play enough of the game and you go back to it, really shines as a...

962
00:48:43,346 --> 00:48:46,508
I don't know. Level design in Hitman is so good. I could talk about it forever.

963
00:48:46,528 --> 00:48:51,410
Yeah, I mean, they're geniuses. I have, obviously, things I like or don't like about the map.

964
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,051
My personal take on...

965
00:48:54,192 --> 00:49:00,596
Why most of the three target maps aren't as good as the other maps is because they have

966
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:06,441
the same amount of set pieces as the two or one target maps, but they're spread across

967
00:49:06,461 --> 00:49:07,021
three targets.

968
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:11,564
And so killing everyone is just kind of inherently, there's less interesting and less variety

969
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:12,225
ways to do it.

970
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:15,227
And so it's just kind of just not as good.

971
00:49:15,267 --> 00:49:19,590
And it's like, I would love, love, love to go to IO one day and just kind of sit with

972
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:22,372
people and just talk about it and chop it up, just as a fan, because that would be super

973
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:22,492
fun.

974
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:27,655
Oh, but they, like, it's another interesting thing is, like, on the basic level, because

975
00:49:27,935 --> 00:49:31,156
the multi-target ones can feed, like, three different games to, like, a lower level person,

976
00:49:31,197 --> 00:49:34,818
but then you watch, like, someone who speedruns the game play it, and they'll set this up

977
00:49:35,018 --> 00:49:38,900
while running, and, like, with one hand tied behind their back, and, like, hit a button

978
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,582
at the exit, all three die at the same time they leave, and, like, I don't know, it's

979
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:47,564
just designing a game that can take that level of variance is just very interesting, and

980
00:49:47,624 --> 00:49:49,565
we should talk about other things on our hitman, I apologize.

981
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,646
Nope, nope, I'm just going to let it go, keep going.

982
00:49:52,377 --> 00:49:52,557
Yeah.

983
00:49:52,677 --> 00:49:56,941
Well, this is a good, um, uh, way to get a good place to stop

984
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:58,022
and a good way to stop.

985
00:49:58,062 --> 00:49:59,383
I think this was lovely.

986
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:00,364
Thank you so much, Dave.

987
00:50:00,504 --> 00:50:01,985
Really appreciate you taking time.

988
00:50:02,005 --> 00:50:03,166
I know you're a busy man.

989
00:50:03,186 --> 00:50:03,466
Yeah.

990
00:50:03,486 --> 00:50:03,987
Thanks for having me.

991
00:50:04,007 --> 00:50:04,227
It was fun.

992
00:50:22,946 --> 00:50:24,387
And we are back!

993
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:26,708
How about that dove lounge?

994
00:50:27,248 --> 00:50:27,848
Dave Lang?

995
00:50:28,628 --> 00:50:30,549
Da-da... yep.

996
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:34,771
I can't even... I tried to deliberately mispronounce it and my mouth is like, no.

997
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:36,692
Yeah.

998
00:50:36,812 --> 00:50:40,993
The brain-mouth connection is melting with Alyssa.

999
00:50:41,648 --> 00:50:43,848
Yeah, or Allison, I'm just going to rebrand my entire...

1000
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:47,509
That's really going to confuse me if you keep on saying that.

1001
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:52,030
And it's going to be just like, oh, you can't even like get the name of like the,

1002
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,431
you know, the woman on your staff right.

1003
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:58,132
This is all, I was just like, it's not quite gaslighting, but I'm all,

1004
00:50:58,152 --> 00:50:59,252
I'm just setting you up for failure.

1005
00:50:59,632 --> 00:51:00,652
It's the long con.

1006
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:01,813
That's right.

1007
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:02,653
I like a challenge.

1008
00:51:03,373 --> 00:51:06,594
So, so the day of conversation, that was, that was good.

1009
00:51:06,854 --> 00:51:10,795
That was one of the, like one of the most fun podcasts that we've done yet.

1010
00:51:11,308 --> 00:51:13,310
I think all our podcasts have been equally fun.

1011
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:13,830
They've been.

1012
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:14,471
Some people we've interviewed.

1013
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:18,134
Some of them have been, let's be honest, some of them have been better than others.

1014
00:51:18,514 --> 00:51:19,755
Last month's when I wasn't here.

1015
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:22,458
No, I haven't listened to it, I'm sure it was great.

1016
00:51:22,938 --> 00:51:24,079
Oh yeah, that one was great.

1017
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,280
Yeah, that one was good.

1018
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,543
No, all of our guests, they are equally loved by us.

1019
00:51:30,044 --> 00:51:30,925
We play no favorites.

1020
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:34,328
But that was a really good chat.

1021
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:42,756
Yeah, I like just starting out just talking about random stuff, like Gabriel Knight and

1022
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:46,259
Roberto Williams, your favorites.

1023
00:51:46,279 --> 00:51:48,662
I'm going to lose sleep over that one, I'm so sorry.

1024
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:49,382
No, that's alright.

1025
00:51:49,623 --> 00:51:51,665
If she listens to this ever, I am so sorry.

1026
00:51:51,885 --> 00:51:54,646
Yeah, she's not. I don't think you have anything to worry about there.

1027
00:51:56,406 --> 00:52:04,569
Yeah, it's cool talking to someone who's been in the game industry for a long time, and like,

1028
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:11,671
you know, a lot... this is a young industry, so it's kind of... I don't know, I'm trying to...

1029
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:18,373
I'm trying not to sound ageist here. Dave's older than the youngins that we've had on before.

1030
00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:26,694
I'm somewhere right in the middle between Dave and the younger people who have accomplished

1031
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:28,295
more than I ever will in my career.

1032
00:52:28,316 --> 00:52:33,680
So we've had a good career representation throughout our trajectory so far, so that's

1033
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:33,960
great.

1034
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,581
Yeah.

1035
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:39,084
But no, it is always really wonderful to hear those conversations about the old days of

1036
00:52:39,104 --> 00:52:43,588
the industry and how things were way back then with certain companies that maybe don't

1037
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:47,851
exist anymore or maybe have gone on to a completely different image or something like that.

1038
00:52:48,312 --> 00:52:52,853
It's funny because it's not even like, you say the old days, but it does, I mean, it was like 2003.

1039
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:53,593
Yeah.

1040
00:52:56,033 --> 00:53:00,214
But it does feel like that because things move so quickly in the industry, I feel like,

1041
00:53:00,274 --> 00:53:02,435
and it's, you know, at times volatile.

1042
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:08,856
And I love how it's kind of like, I did report pretty extensively,

1043
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:11,316
like earlier on in my career on Midway.

1044
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:16,959
So to have somebody that was there, you know, during that time in the 2000s,

1045
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:19,700
I love how he was just like,

1046
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,161
okay, what kind of interesting story do you want to hear about Midway?

1047
00:53:22,421 --> 00:53:24,582
And then I'm like, hmm, Mafia.

1048
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,803
And it's just like, okay, well.

1049
00:53:27,422 --> 00:53:29,803
Did you know going into that that there was a mafia story?

1050
00:53:29,963 --> 00:53:36,066
Yeah, I knew that like there was had this rumored like background, but that's just hilarious

1051
00:53:36,086 --> 00:53:39,307
I was sitting here like slack-jawed the whole time being like what's going on?

1052
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:46,290
Like the sandwich guy just going that's a real nice family business they got going on over there, huh?

1053
00:53:48,572 --> 00:53:51,374
I could picture that scene in my mind if he was saying it.

1054
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:51,954
Yeah.

1055
00:53:52,455 --> 00:53:58,678
Young, impressionable Dave going in to get his meatball sub.

1056
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,701
It's also nice to hear the...

1057
00:54:05,382 --> 00:54:11,046
Like the issues that studios still face in the industry against like how it was 20, 15, 20 years ago.

1058
00:54:11,266 --> 00:54:11,486
Yeah.

1059
00:54:11,546 --> 00:54:19,150
It's like, and those are still issues. If they're more of an issue, less of an issue with like crunch and like how he said it's gotten like that kind of awareness has gotten better about the same?

1060
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:19,811
Yeah.

1061
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:20,651
Yeah.

1062
00:54:20,711 --> 00:54:23,793
It was a whole hour ago. I don't remember what exactly the word was.

1063
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:33,358
Oh no, he said that, no, Dave said that the work-life balance and quality of life in the game industry has gotten, you know, undeniably better.

1064
00:54:33,898 --> 00:54:39,080
Yeah, which is a nice perspective to kind of like reflect on because it's easy to get caught in like the moment-to-moment issues

1065
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,601
which are still important and should be focused on, but like the larger scheme of things, it's also good to have that.

1066
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:49,523
Yeah, yeah, and I'm glad that at least one person benefited from everyone's loss during the recession, so...

1067
00:54:52,404 --> 00:55:12,076
But it's true though, that's interesting what he was saying because there was speculation at that time because you had THQ going out of business, Midway was one of them, and really just the middle falling out of the industry and that impacted so many things, even games media, it impacted that.

1068
00:55:12,756 --> 00:55:15,578
You know, these are publishers that would pay for advertisements.

1069
00:55:16,659 --> 00:55:19,801
And so that recession, it had this ripple effect.

1070
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:24,384
But there was also talk about, you know, well now there's all this talent that's out there.

1071
00:55:24,524 --> 00:55:30,808
So then you see people either leave the industry or they found, you know, Iron Galaxy, you

1072
00:55:30,848 --> 00:55:30,968
know.

1073
00:55:30,988 --> 00:55:31,428
Yeah.

1074
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:34,470
And then the people who still want to work in the industry.

1075
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:43,074
You know, there's a talent pool now, you know, and they go and either found their own stuff or or go to work on on startups.

1076
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:47,176
Yeah, like making the best of a bad situation, but in like a really unique way.

1077
00:55:47,736 --> 00:55:49,577
But I don't know the entire like studio structure.

1078
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:56,100
of Iron Galaxy, which is really interesting, because you hear about studios that make their

1079
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,182
bank doing support work for other games, and they're not the ones that you hear. They're not

1080
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:05,304
the blank game by blank studio that's not the headline. But the work they do is really important,

1081
00:56:05,484 --> 00:56:10,507
and he employs 140 people at that company, which is way larger than I thought that was before

1082
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,908
reading about any of that, at two locations.

1083
00:56:13,508 --> 00:56:18,194
And just highlighting the importance of that kind of work and the value of that work and the place that that has.

1084
00:56:18,594 --> 00:56:20,617
It was a really nice part of the conversation.

1085
00:56:20,657 --> 00:56:23,820
Yeah, they are the unsung heroes of game development.

1086
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:29,066
And we can kind of vent on this, but...

1087
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:34,688
The job stability, making that the goal, is super interesting to me, you know?

1088
00:56:35,008 --> 00:56:43,371
And that's not as glamorous, you know, as saying, I have this idea, you know, and then you execute and then it becomes a hit.

1089
00:56:43,831 --> 00:56:45,392
You know, a tiny fraction

1090
00:56:46,992 --> 00:56:48,353
that success happens to people.

1091
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:53,819
Yeah, you have more studios kind of like going for the same kind of thing, like Indies will,

1092
00:56:53,859 --> 00:56:55,060
like a lot of co-ops lately.

1093
00:56:55,801 --> 00:57:00,145
It's been talked about like more and more where like the team owns the studio and kind

1094
00:57:00,185 --> 00:57:02,807
of getting job security and putting employees first that way.

1095
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:07,330
And then Iron Galaxy is like a different, it's the same idea but a completely different

1096
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,572
path for that and just like seeing how those both work.

1097
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:10,373
Yeah.

1098
00:57:11,093 --> 00:57:11,994
So there you go.

1099
00:57:12,415 --> 00:57:15,397
You don't always have to be the next Jon Blow.

1100
00:57:18,944 --> 00:57:20,886
I want to be the next Dave Lang, honestly.

1101
00:57:20,906 --> 00:57:22,627
Yeah.

1102
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:23,188
I don't know.

1103
00:57:23,668 --> 00:57:24,248
I have to get a little...

1104
00:57:24,669 --> 00:57:25,309
You program?

1105
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:31,754
We'll have to get a little taller and a little more Caucasian, but I think I could do it.

1106
00:57:31,854 --> 00:57:33,716
It's important to dream big.

1107
00:57:35,317 --> 00:57:36,138
All right, that's it.

1108
00:57:36,178 --> 00:57:39,460
So check us out on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify,

1109
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:42,903
and someday we'll upload some more of these to YouTube,

1110
00:57:42,943 --> 00:57:44,584
but we've got a couple of them up there right now.

1111
00:57:45,525 --> 00:57:46,366
Just don't read the comments.

1112
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:47,286
But...

1113
00:57:49,274 --> 00:57:53,678
If you like what you heard, you know, like and subscribe, we'd love to have you.

1114
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:55,859
And that's all for this month.

1115
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:56,860
Thanks Alyssa!

1116
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,061
Cool, thank you!

1117
00:57:58,381 --> 00:57:58,942
Bye!

1118
00:57:59,442 --> 00:57:59,722
Bye!
