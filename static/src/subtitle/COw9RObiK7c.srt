Hey there, this is Jorge del Val. I'm a research engineer here at the SIT division at Electronic Codes.

00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:19,646
As some of you might know, deep generative models are among some of the most popular areas of research in the deep learning community nowadays.

3
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:25,311
We have seen enormous success of techniques such as generative adversarial networks,

4
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:33,718
variational autoencoders, or autoregressive methods in either generating or morphing different kinds of content.

5
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:43,091
So we believe that this kind of techniques will have a profound impact on the way that we understand game development in the future.

6
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:50,442
So if you want to know more about how these techniques work on a fundamental level, about

7
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:55,726
some of the state-of-the-art results, or have a hint about how we can actually apply this

8
00:00:55,826 --> 00:01:03,332
to game development nowadays, don't hesitate to come to my talk at GDC, the Machine Learning

9
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:05,234
Tutorial Day, Tuesday at 5.30.

10
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:10,618
So regards from Stockholm, and I'll see you in San Francisco.
