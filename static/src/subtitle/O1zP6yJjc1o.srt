1
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:08,564
Hey everybody, it's 5 o'clock.

2
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:10,566
Hope everybody's having a super great GDC.

3
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:14,209
For people just coming in, there are some seats down the front rows.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,211
Don't be shy.

5
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:25,179
So I gave a talk last year about game studio management and how studios should be structured

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,882
and I was surprised to learn that, oh, I still have a bunch of things that I'd still like

7
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:29,663
to say about that.

8
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:32,396
But this year I'm giving a kind of a different talk,

9
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,457
Game Studio Leadership.

10
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:37,058
So this is much more about what you personally,

11
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:38,679
as a studio leader,

12
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,020
things that you should maybe be considering doing.

13
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,822
It's called Game Studio Leadership, you can do it.

14
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,683
I'm a little nervous because it's all new material,

15
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:48,824
but I'm confident that I can do it.

16
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:49,625
So it's going to be fine.

17
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:53,980
So just a little bit about my background.

18
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,682
A long time ago, I used to be a circus performer,

19
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:59,803
a traveling juggler with a number of different troops

20
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:02,164
like the Fryhoffer Circus Troop right there.

21
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:04,465
And inexplicably, I went from there

22
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:06,586
to start becoming a programmer at IBM.

23
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,535
Then I was working at the phone company for a while.

24
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:14,458
Then I managed to get the phone company

25
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:15,638
to send me to graduate school

26
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,999
to learn about virtual reality,

27
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,362
and that I leveraged into a job at Disney.

28
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:22,283
So sorry, phone company.

29
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:26,626
And then I was at Disney for seven years,

30
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:28,988
and then I, about 15 years ago.

31
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,557
I moved to Pittsburgh.

32
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:32,398
I started teaching at Carnegie Mellon University.

33
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:39,924
And also I started a studio called Shell Games, which started as a small studio and has grown

34
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:40,405
quite a bit.

35
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:44,828
So a lot of the lessons I'll be talking about here, a lot of it's going to be what I've

36
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:48,711
learned kind of running Shell Games over the years, but also these other organizations

37
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:53,355
that I was a part of were very instructive to me about different ways to deal with leadership

38
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,096
in creative situations.

39
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,806
Here's some footage of what Shell Games looks like on the inside.

40
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:01,688
We've got about 105 people.

41
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,972
We reproduce multiple games at a time, typically between 6 and 12 games.

42
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:09,555
It's not at all unusual for us to be working on.

43
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:13,077
If you're wondering how we got that cool footage, it's very simple.

44
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:17,261
Just drones flying around inside.

45
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,122
That's not distracting at all.

46
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,879
Yeah, we're not gonna keep those up full time,

47
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,500
we tried it, it's not good.

48
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:28,883
So who's this talk for exactly?

49
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:31,945
So it's definitely for people who are interested

50
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,307
in taking on some amount of studio leadership,

51
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,388
or maybe you're already doing some studio leadership.

52
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,930
I've tried to make it so that it will work

53
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,172
for people doing small studios

54
00:02:41,232 --> 00:02:42,953
with just a handful of people.

55
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,115
And also maybe you had a small studio

56
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:47,256
and it got a little bigger and it got a little bigger

57
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:49,298
and oh my God, you're really freaking out right now.

58
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:52,440
And so growing studios, growth is a very,

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,562
one of the most challenging parts of studio management.

60
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:58,985
Or maybe you're not really running some independent studio.

61
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,868
Maybe you're part of some large gray entity,

62
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,989
but somewhere deep inside that entity

63
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:05,671
you're running a small team.

64
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:07,572
And a lot of the same things apply.

65
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:10,354
And so we'll talk about some of those things as well.

66
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:13,953
So I call those embedded studios.

67
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:17,293
So when it comes to studio management,

68
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:20,474
I often think about airports.

69
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:23,394
Airports are kind of like snowflakes.

70
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:26,115
Have you noticed how they're all different?

71
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:28,855
Like no two airports are alike.

72
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:31,616
They're like radically different from each other.

73
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:35,257
And some people say that studio management

74
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:36,917
is like airport design.

75
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:39,778
No one seems to know the right answer.

76
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,820
And no matter how you do it, people are unhappy.

77
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:43,641
Right?

78
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:48,604
And I know that sounds, you know, people say that.

79
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:51,786
But I'm here to tell you that no, you can do it.

80
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:55,468
You can do leadership inside a studio.

81
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:58,050
So now why would you do this anyway?

82
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,192
Like why does someone go and take

83
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:02,973
on the ridiculous endeavor of starting

84
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:05,054
and trying to run a studio?

85
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:09,355
Now, for some people, you know, it may be that you just don't like the idea of working

86
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:10,256
for someone else.

87
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:15,317
Or maybe you tried working for someone else and you got tired of making the wrong games

88
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:18,498
with the wrong people the wrong way, right?

89
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:24,000
And you have a fantasy about, like, I'm just going to cut these chains and I am going to

90
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,261
go out and I am going to do things the right way.

91
00:04:28,282 --> 00:04:29,822
Here's a movie to illustrate that.

92
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,303
We got our audio up there.

93
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:32,243
Scott, are we good?

94
00:04:32,263 --> 00:04:33,383
All right.

95
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:33,663
Here we go.

96
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:44,478
This is the story of one who will become leader of the great Rebellion.

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,142
She-Ra, Princess of Power.

98
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:54,545
That is the best echo ever. I just really like that echo.

99
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:57,553
I know there's a lot of people out there saying,

100
00:04:57,593 --> 00:04:58,473
yeah, no, I get it.

101
00:04:58,513 --> 00:04:59,714
I really, that's what I want to do.

102
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:00,935
I want to pick up the sword

103
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,275
and I want to go out there and do this.

104
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:03,776
But some of you are saying like,

105
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:08,259
but I'm not sure, She-Ra, I'm not exactly relating to that.

106
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,701
She-Ra is not exactly someone I'm relating to.

107
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,242
And if you feel that way,

108
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:15,844
I would like you to consider that every woman

109
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:18,986
who comes to GDC, 95% of the time,

110
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:21,287
they see male role models on stage

111
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,028
and that's how they feel.

112
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:28,693
And so we can all kind of, you know, think about being She-Ra.

113
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:32,817
Like, we can handle that just for one day, for one moment.

114
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:34,598
Because one thing I really...

115
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:37,581
I mean, it's exciting, we're seeing more women come into the game industry.

116
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:42,105
One thing I'm really hoping to see is more and more women running their own studios.

117
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:43,366
Is that right, ladies?

118
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,267
Yeah.

119
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:51,357
Because I'll tell you ladies, if anyone can do it, you can do it.

120
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:51,897
Yes.

121
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,580
Actually, ladies, actually if you'll indulge me, just the ladies right now,

122
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,083
what I want to get is for the honor of Grayskull on the count of three.

123
00:05:59,203 --> 00:05:59,643
All right, ready?

124
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:01,144
One, two, three.

125
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:04,427
For the honor of Grayskull.

126
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,407
Oh, that was kind of awesome.

127
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,931
Sometimes there's parts in the talk that are just for me.

128
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,937
It's okay, that's okay, that can be a thing.

129
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:16,938
All right, so, you decided you're gonna start a studio.

130
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,119
You've got the fantasy, you're gonna go and do this.

131
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,720
So you have the plan.

132
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,961
So here's the plan, simple plan.

133
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,501
Number one, build a studio.

134
00:06:25,663 --> 00:06:27,824
Number two, make awesome games.

135
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:31,305
Yes, this is the plan, excellent plan.

136
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,306
Before we embark upon this plan,

137
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,228
we should consider what a game actually is, right?

138
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,483
So games interact with the mind, right?

139
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:46,267
So games are machines that interact with the mind.

140
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,968
And this is why they're so hard to make,

141
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,649
because the mind is super complicated

142
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,791
and machines are super fragile.

143
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:54,273
But it's cool, because when they interact with the mind,

144
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,154
like, amazing stuff happens,

145
00:06:56,595 --> 00:07:00,037
and the machine produces joy and money, right?

146
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:07,124
That's amazing. So that's what a game is, a machine that interacts with the mind to produce joy and money.

147
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,667
Of course, who would not want to make that? That's amazing.

148
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:11,749
Right? So how are you going to do that?

149
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:14,712
Well, you can work on your own, but you can only go so far on your own.

150
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:16,394
So you've got to get some people together, right?

151
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:19,177
So you get a group of people together and they're going to work on your game.

152
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:21,439
And this sounds great. This sounds like a great thing to do.

153
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,560
That's what building a studio is.

154
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:28,507
And this is not easy because unfortunately the world is a chaotic place.

155
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:33,413
So in this talk to represent chaos I'm going to use the ancient Greek symbol for chaos,

156
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,096
which many people are aware is the sharknado.

157
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:42,146
All right, because the world is full of chaos that wants to rip your studio apart.

158
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:47,948
It turns out that game developers want things like they want to eat and have a life and

159
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:52,989
all these things that require money and they require freedom from distractions.

160
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:56,710
So chaos can come from an awful lot of places.

161
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,571
And how are the developers going to deal with this chaos that's going to rip apart the game

162
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,591
development process?

163
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,531
They're not.

164
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,752
You're going to do that.

165
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,572
That is what you're going to do.

166
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,793
When you picked up the magic sword, that was the deal,

167
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,053
that you're going to be the one that deals with the chaos

168
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:19,254
so that they can focus on the process of getting

169
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:20,735
the game made.

170
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:25,536
And this is the difference between leaders and followers.

171
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:28,536
The thing to think about is that what good followers do.

172
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,098
is they excel in orderly situations.

173
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,779
An orderly situation is set up,

174
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,341
the followers are kind of given some kind of marching order,

175
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,682
and they go and they do it super, super, super well.

176
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,143
That's what followers are about.

177
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:42,004
Leaders, on the other hand,

178
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:44,666
they need to excel in chaotic situations.

179
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:47,608
Now, everybody does some amount of leading and following

180
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:48,548
anywhere in their job,

181
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,609
even if you're just sitting down

182
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,769
and you're going to code something up,

183
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,131
you run into kinds of chaos and you've got to deal with it,

184
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:55,072
and you've got to take some level of leadership in that.

185
00:08:55,712 --> 00:09:00,716
But the leadership I'm talking about is the leadership that destroys the chaos that will

186
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:02,897
destroy your studio, right?

187
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:07,880
That's what you as a studio leader, that is your job to kill those sharknadoes that want

188
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,062
to rip your studio to pieces.

189
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,183
And that's tough, right?

190
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:15,045
Because you're like, oh my God, I don't want to deal with all that chaos.

191
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:17,367
That's really hard and that's really difficult.

192
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:20,789
And I'm here to tell you, you can do it.

193
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:21,569
You can do it.

194
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:23,871
And we'll talk about how you're going to do it.

195
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,932
Okay, so how are you going to do it?

196
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:30,555
You need to protect the developers from all this chaos.

197
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:32,936
And that's what building a studio is.

198
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:39,381
A studio is a boundary and a border that kind of finds a way to keep the chaos away so people

199
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:42,884
can focus on making amazing games.

200
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,524
And one of the main ways they're going to do that,

201
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,105
one of the main things that keeps chaos away is money.

202
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:52,286
If people have money to take care of their lives

203
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:53,966
and their food and their rent and all that,

204
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,867
they can focus on doing the things that they love

205
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,187
and the chaos can stay away.

206
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:00,768
The leading cause of ripping studios apart

207
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:04,049
is not having enough money to kind of get your stuff going.

208
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,709
So we'll talk a little bit about that.

209
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:08,830
But all that goes well, then you get rid of the chaos

210
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,971
and everybody can focus and you're making amazing games.

211
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:12,931
But...

212
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,191
Where are you going to get this money from?

213
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,952
Right? Because that's a question.

214
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:19,732
And hey, before we even talk about where you're going to get the money from,

215
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,192
where are you going to get the people from?

216
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,413
Like where are these people coming from?

217
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,713
So maybe we better revisit the plan.

218
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,754
Alright, plan. One, build the studio.

219
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:30,334
Okay, and then what?

220
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:32,474
Then you're going to protect the studio.

221
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,375
And you need to protect the studio

222
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:35,755
with money and other things.

223
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:37,575
And then you're going to make awesome games.

224
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:40,116
Okay, so build the studio, protect the studio,

225
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:40,916
make awesome games.

226
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,489
Let's pause for a moment now to talk about

227
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:47,191
some of the concrete things in terms of building a studio.

228
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:49,412
I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail about these.

229
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:51,174
I'm just gonna kind of skim over it real fast

230
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:53,455
because you can find out about this stuff in other places.

231
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,417
But if you haven't done it before,

232
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:56,918
one of the first things you're gonna wanna start with

233
00:10:56,978 --> 00:10:58,339
is getting some kind of lawyer

234
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,961
because you need a lawyer to help you do things

235
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:02,902
you can't do on your own.

236
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,904
Like for example, start a legal entity,

237
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:06,905
starting a company of some kind.

238
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:08,046
You're gonna want to do that

239
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,827
because it's a form of protection for you.

240
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:12,389
and for your other employees.

241
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:14,171
And a lawyer will help you do that.

242
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,392
Likely you're going to want some kind of accountant

243
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,454
so you can help get the taxes done

244
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:21,176
and get those sorts of things rolling.

245
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:24,439
And you're gonna need some kind of payroll service system.

246
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,360
These things are all easily obtainable.

247
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,882
Anybody who starts a hairdressing shop or whatever

248
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,684
has to do all this, you can do it too.

249
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:32,946
So I'm not gonna dwell on that.

250
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:35,624
You're going to have the question of office space.

251
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:37,825
Do you want to, are you just going to work out of your home,

252
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:39,965
just work out of Starbucks, or are you going to get some kind

253
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:41,186
of office space that you rent?

254
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:42,266
You're going to have to work that out,

255
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,326
talk to a real estate agent.

256
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:44,867
You'll have the question of insurance.

257
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:47,807
Is your, are you as a studio owner providing

258
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:50,088
health insurance and all of that?

259
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:52,108
Of course, there's going to be equipment.

260
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:53,629
Are people just bringing their own equipment

261
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,389
or are you providing equipment?

262
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,489
And then of course, finally, you got to have some people

263
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,790
for this studio.

264
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,570
So there's your quick eight step process

265
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,531
to getting a studio built right there.

266
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:03,511
You need to do at a minimum.

267
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:05,312
Those, those eight things.

268
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,816
And now some people say, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute,

269
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,757
wait a minute, why are we getting a bunch of people in here?

270
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,498
We haven't even decided what the studio is doing.

271
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:15,520
Shouldn't we have like an idea?

272
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,743
Shouldn't we start with like I have this grand vision of the perfect game

273
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,585
and then I will go out and get the people for that perfect game

274
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:22,866
and go and do that?

275
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:25,168
And that is a way you can go and do that.

276
00:12:25,768 --> 00:12:29,372
But there's a lot of people who advise that no, that's not the right way to do it.

277
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:32,596
There's an excellent book that I encourage people to check out called Good to Great.

278
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:38,683
It's a study of companies that started out pretty good and eventually became great and stayed great for 10 years or more.

279
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:44,372
And it finds patterns between them all, how they all similarly excelled.

280
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:48,215
And one of the things that it found is they did not start with an amazing idea.

281
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:49,857
That isn't how they began.

282
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:51,358
They went at it differently.

283
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:54,560
Instead of saying, I've got a great idea, let's get the right people for that idea.

284
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:58,944
They instead, they used this analogy of a bus, right?

285
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:02,066
The idea is, you could say, hey, I've got a bus and

286
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:04,248
it's going to this very specific place.

287
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:06,349
Let me get people and let's get them on the bus.

288
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,392
But they say, no, don't do that.

289
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:09,153
Get your bus.

290
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:11,938
Go get the best people you can.

291
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:15,103
Get them all on the bus, and then all look at each other

292
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:17,187
and say, now where should we go?

293
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:21,886
Because if you have a bunch of smart people together,

294
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:24,808
then they're going to do something really smart.

295
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:28,010
Ideally, you're gonna get people smarter than you, right?

296
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:30,432
And they are gonna do something really smart.

297
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,134
So one of the principles from that book is,

298
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:35,236
first figure out who, and then let the right people

299
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,017
figure out the right thing to do.

300
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:39,199
So that's something to think about,

301
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,060
and something to consider.

302
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,541
Certainly, if you're,

303
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:48,036
Building a game development studio, you're going to be having the three main types of

304
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:48,877
game developers.

305
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:54,323
Sometimes referred to as dwarves, elves, and men.

306
00:13:55,224 --> 00:14:01,531
Other times referred to as engineering, art, and design, slash marketing, slash everything

307
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:01,811
else.

308
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:02,392
Right?

309
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:06,775
And that's sort of a joke, but also everyone knows it's like, no, it is really kind of

310
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:07,176
like that.

311
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,998
These are three different groups of people who think about the world in really, really

312
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:11,698
different ways.

313
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,321
And you're going to need those different people, and you're going to need to be ready for the

314
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:18,643
fact that they're not going to agree on everything.

315
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:19,984
Okay, so that's fine.

316
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:24,887
So you're going to get a bunch of great people, and now, now what are you going to do?

317
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,544
Well, one other thing to think about is other ways to look at people.

318
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:33,549
You want just, you're like, sure, I want great artists and great engineers, but is that enough?

319
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:35,291
Am I just looking at skills?

320
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:40,042
So, I got this interesting formula from Paul Stefanok,

321
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:41,703
who used to work with us at Shell Games,

322
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:43,823
and I found it very interesting and very useful,

323
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:46,944
that often the right way to think about developer value

324
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,325
don't just think about skills.

325
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:51,886
What Paul suggested to me, and I still believe is very true,

326
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:56,848
is that you take skills and you multiply that by enthusiasm,

327
00:14:57,988 --> 00:15:00,569
and then you multiply that by respectability.

328
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,870
Now, what is respectability?

329
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,770
That's a crazy word, though.

330
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,511
Why would you even say that?

331
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:07,945
It's a complicated idea.

332
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:08,687
The idea is this,

333
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,040
the ability to make others feel respected.

334
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:18,675
Okay? Not how much respect you show to others necessarily, and not how much respect you've

335
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:23,338
earned from them, but how much you make other people feel respected. I know that sounds

336
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:28,821
a little oblique, but I totally agree with Paul that if you give everybody scores on

337
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:33,064
these three numbers from like zero to three, and then multiply those three numbers together,

338
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:36,826
it gives you a pretty good sense of how much someone's value really is. Because someone

339
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:41,389
with like a three in skills and a three in enthusiasm and a zero in respectability,

340
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:45,231
like has zero or possibly negative value even. Maybe there should be a negative

341
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:49,633
respectability, I don't know. So someone who has all twos has an eight, someone who has

342
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:53,735
all threes has a twenty-seven, like it makes a big difference. But these are three really

343
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:58,918
important things to think about when you're trying to pick the right people. And yeah,

344
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:04,220
even three times three times zero is zero. Now a lot of people may have heard, um,

345
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:11,109
Jason Vandenberg in past years has talked a lot about the big five personality types.

346
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:15,474
And this is, psychologists in the world don't agree on much, but this is one thing they

347
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:16,134
all agree on.

348
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:20,039
That when you want to evaluate like what are the types of personalities that people have,

349
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,202
there are these five spectrum.

350
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:25,944
Are people more curious or more cautious?

351
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:27,284
Are the introverts or extroverts?

352
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:29,405
Are they more nervous or are they more secure?

353
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:31,326
These opposite ends of the spectrum.

354
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:33,047
And then what you can basically do

355
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:34,348
is for almost every individual,

356
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:35,529
you can kind of do a little test

357
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:38,290
and figure out where do they reside

358
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,111
on each of these spectra.

359
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:41,832
So this leads to a question,

360
00:16:42,212 --> 00:16:44,893
what personality type is best for game development?

361
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:51,711
And the answer that people figure out pretty quickly is like, no, all of these things have pros and cons.

362
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:56,794
Being more curious is a pro, but it can get you in trouble, but being more cautious is a pro,

363
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:58,395
but it can also make you too safe.

364
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:02,597
Every single one of these has a pro and has a con.

365
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:07,580
And ideally, most people quickly realize what they want is they want to cover the spectrum.

366
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,784
They want a mix of people that will have little red X's in all the parts of all five spectra.

367
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:16,399
Which that way, great, we're covering everything.

368
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:17,781
We got people who are thinking about risk

369
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,042
and people who are thinking about adventure,

370
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:20,503
you know, all of those things.

371
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:22,324
With people who like to just stay in and work,

372
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:24,686
people who like to go out and network, that's all great.

373
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:26,848
But the important thing to realize is,

374
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,450
these are all opposites.

375
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:32,653
These people are not going to agree with each other, right?

376
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,115
Just inherently, what we're saying is,

377
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,198
if the optimal studio covers all these bases,

378
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:42,101
the optimal studio is at odds with itself all the time.

379
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,082
And guess whose problem that is?

380
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:47,282
It's your problem, right?

381
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:48,723
Because when you picked up the sword,

382
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:50,843
oh my God, now that's totally your problem.

383
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:53,404
And a related question,

384
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:55,265
we often think about what skills do I need?

385
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:56,445
What skills do I need?

386
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,646
I talked about skills and enthusiasms.

387
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:02,847
An excellent question is what enthusiasms do I need?

388
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,848
What kinds of champions do I need?

389
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:07,809
Because sure, you have people who are good at this

390
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,490
and good at that, but what are people excited about?

391
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,451
Maybe someone's not good at playtesting,

392
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:13,931
but they're super excited about it,

393
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:15,252
and they really wanna learn about it,

394
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:17,553
and they really are going to defend it, protect it.

395
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:19,935
Maybe someone really cares about user experience.

396
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:23,697
Maybe someone really cares about marketing the studio.

397
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:27,199
Thinking about having a diverse collection of enthusiasm

398
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,200
so that you have the right champions in your studio

399
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,880
is really important.

400
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:32,809
So those are some tips for getting the right people.

401
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,430
Okay, so check.

402
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,070
Number one, we built a studio, we had a lawyer,

403
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,851
we got great people, now we're good.

404
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:42,671
So now part two, we got to protect the studio from chaos.

405
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:44,512
And we're going to do that by going out

406
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:45,872
and getting some money.

407
00:18:46,532 --> 00:18:49,353
I keep this little statue in my office

408
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,113
that I found somewhere.

409
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:53,153
I love it because it just, for me,

410
00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:56,594
it sums up finances in the game industry perfectly.

411
00:18:57,757 --> 00:19:02,019
right? The money's right there. Just grab it. Just go ahead. Just take the money. It's

412
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:06,621
right there. Just go and get it. Right? But unfortunately, going and getting it is not

413
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:14,006
so easy. And even once you do get it and you give it to the developers, they go through

414
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:19,769
it super, super fast. So money is on your mind a lot if you're going to be making your

415
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:24,851
own studio and trying to run it. So let's talk about the four different ways that you're

416
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:25,632
going to get money.

417
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:29,225
Number one, scenario one, you use your own money.

418
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:31,547
You're independently wealthy, you have this big sack of cash,

419
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:34,089
you're like, let's do it, let's make this awesome game.

420
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:35,169
That's great.

421
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:36,911
If you can do that, excellent, good for you.

422
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,712
And I've seen a lot of people do that.

423
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:40,673
So often they'll do it by scrimping and saving,

424
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:41,774
but they'll do it.

425
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:42,995
So let's just talk about how that works.

426
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:46,418
So there's your studio, and you're going to put your own money into it.

427
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:47,559
And that's great.

428
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:51,042
And then, boom, it starts making games, and the games start coming out.

429
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:52,163
And that's great.

430
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,245
And then you've got your big vacuum machine on top,

431
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:56,007
and it sucks the money out of those games.

432
00:19:56,748 --> 00:19:57,889
And then it puts them back in.

433
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:01,913
And hopefully, this virtuous cycle just keeps going on to infinity.

434
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,534
Now of course we all know that sometimes that doesn't happen.

435
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:06,094
We had a great roundtable this morning.

436
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:07,895
People talked about, oh, we made a game,

437
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,036
we're so successful, and then we got complacent.

438
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:13,597
And the money dried up and we got in all kinds of trouble.

439
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:16,739
But this is the easiest and best situation.

440
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:19,400
So if you're already rich, good, congratulations.

441
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,440
You're in a good position for this.

442
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:24,983
But we're not all like that, so let's look at scenario two,

443
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,763
which is the work for hire scenario.

444
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:29,164
And this works this way, all right?

445
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:30,945
So we've got our studio, where's the money come from?

446
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,025
It's not our money, it comes from somebody else.

447
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,926
Somebody says, hey, make a game for me.

448
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:38,127
And then, well, what happens with this game?

449
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:42,308
You produce the game, but it's their game, not yours.

450
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:43,789
See, I made the games a different color

451
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,089
because it belongs to them now.

452
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,890
And then do I bring down my money pipe

453
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,710
and suck the money out?

454
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,511
No, they have their own money pipe.

455
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:51,914
and they're gonna suck any money that the games get

456
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:54,197
and it goes away and you don't get any new money for that.

457
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:56,641
But at least you got to make games and that's cool

458
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:58,984
and you got to do that.

459
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:02,349
So, oh look, there's my sad dry money pipe

460
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:03,691
and like nothing's happening with that.

461
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,876
And some people are like, ugh, I don't like this.

462
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,138
The whole point of my own studio is

463
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:10,581
so that I don't have to make other people's games.

464
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:12,264
And if you feel that way, you probably

465
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:13,626
want to avoid work for hire.

466
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,468
But work for hire can be really cool.

467
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:18,192
You can work with amazing world class partners.

468
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,095
have a great time working with them,

469
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,255
and then when the project's over,

470
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,416
and they're going all insane,

471
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:24,756
and they're getting ready to lay people off,

472
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,836
you're like, that's cool, we'll go work over here now,

473
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:29,637
everything's fine, good luck guys, we'll let you have that.

474
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:32,438
So you can, if you enjoy it, it can be really great.

475
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:34,618
Our studio, we've done an awful lot of work

476
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:35,458
for hire over the years,

477
00:21:35,518 --> 00:21:38,079
we've stayed completely independent because of that.

478
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,140
It's not uncommon for us to be doing 60 to 80%

479
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,060
of what we're doing is work for hire,

480
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,761
use the profits, and then to use those on our own IP,

481
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:48,821
is not at all unusual.

482
00:21:49,993 --> 00:21:52,615
Then there's scenario three, used to be super common,

483
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:55,256
the publisher scenario, now it's less common

484
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:57,938
and now it's a hard one, but it comes and goes.

485
00:21:58,278 --> 00:21:59,738
So let's just be clear about how that works.

486
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:01,860
How's the publisher scenario work?

487
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,681
There's your studio, and what happens?

488
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:06,722
Okay, they put in a bunch of money,

489
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:07,983
but some of it's your money.

490
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:10,144
They kind of expect you to put some of your own money in.

491
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:11,364
That's kind of, they're like,

492
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:13,846
we need you to have skin in the game, Mr. Shell.

493
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:14,766
Okay, yeah, I got it.

494
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:16,827
We'll have some, that sounds gross, but we'll do it.

495
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,452
And then you make the games and depending on how the deal works, right?

496
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,455
Sometimes you own them, and sometimes they own them, and sometimes you own part of them,

497
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:27,856
and so that's negotiable.

498
00:22:27,976 --> 00:22:29,477
So some games are owned and some aren't.

499
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:30,717
And then what happens with the money?

500
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,459
Like, you both bring money pipes of different kinds,

501
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,340
and you have a big wrestling match about money pipes,

502
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,922
trying to figure out who can get how much and all that.

503
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:41,266
and this is a kind of the traditional publisher relationship which can be

504
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:42,527
really nice for

505
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:45,952
uh... studios because it kind of reduces your risk but you still

506
00:22:46,212 --> 00:22:49,376
have home run protection if you got a big hit you can still get really rich

507
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,999
off of it and that can be pretty nice

508
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:55,203
but publisher deals are harder to secure than they used to be

509
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:58,578
And then scenario four, investments.

510
00:22:59,218 --> 00:23:00,039
All right, how's this work?

511
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:01,360
All right, I got my studio.

512
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:03,662
It's all somebody else's money.

513
00:23:03,802 --> 00:23:05,023
You know, you might put your own money in,

514
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:05,904
but you probably won't, right?

515
00:23:05,924 --> 00:23:07,605
So if somebody else has brought their money in,

516
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:09,627
this is great, this sounds good so far.

517
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:11,088
I don't have to worry about my own money.

518
00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:12,749
And what do they want in exchange?

519
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:13,910
Oh my God.

520
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:19,773
Right? Oh, suddenly it's not your studio anymore. Well, you still have part of it, but most of it is

521
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:23,254
gonna be theirs, or maybe, I don't know, there's gonna be a big fight about who owns how much of a

522
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:28,976
studio, and then you're producing games, and you own some, and they own some. Now, the money pipe,

523
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:33,077
like, sucks the money back in, and that's pretty cool, but, like, wait, now whose money is this

524
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:37,739
now? That it's not totally my studio anymore? Now, it depends on how you work that out, right? And

525
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:42,580
the idea of majority control, and who has, who owns more than half of the studio, ends up being

526
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:43,641
really, really crucial.

527
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:50,267
And it's really hard for game studios to get investor money sometimes, because

528
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:54,069
investors generally are coming from the tech sector. They're not thinking about games

529
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:58,611
as games. They're thinking about games as a platform. How is your game a platform? I don't want to hear

530
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:04,974
about the game. I want to hear about your platform, right? And what do they want? They want 10x, right?

531
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:09,757
10x. What does that mean? It means, well, if I give you two million dollars, I expect to see

532
00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:13,038
20 million dollars back for my investment. Oh my god.

533
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,220
That's a lot.

534
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:14,720
Really?

535
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:17,965
Your game is that good that they're going to put in 2 million and get 20 million out?

536
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:22,833
You've got to be pretty bold to be able to go and tell them that story, but people do

537
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:24,135
it all the time, right?

538
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:25,477
In case you're not...

539
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,680
In case you're not clear on what 10x means, it's this many.

540
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,921
Like, it's a lot of monies.

541
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:33,222
It's a lot.

542
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:36,183
But particularly if you've got a platform story,

543
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:38,744
it can be very valid and it can work out really well

544
00:24:40,185 --> 00:24:41,045
in a lot of scenarios.

545
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:45,087
So those are the four main scenarios for raising money.

546
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:47,908
Now, some people do just one, some people mix and match,

547
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:48,809
and then there's others.

548
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,190
We didn't talk about crowdfunding.

549
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,871
And I didn't talk about that because almost nobody can survive purely on that.

550
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,152
People use that as a supplement.

551
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:58,094
You might also get grant funding for something you do, right?

552
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:02,136
And that can be a supplement, but again, nobody can subsist entirely on that.

553
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:05,898
And so if you're going to keep a studio going over time, you're going to have to be thinking

554
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:06,878
about this a lot.

555
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,560
And if you don't like thinking about money and you really don't enjoy it, well, then

556
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:13,662
you need to do something different.

557
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:16,644
Let me ask you, does anyone know who that is?

558
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:19,405
Say again?

559
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:21,766
Walt Disney?

560
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,187
It is not Walt Disney.

561
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:24,207
That's a good guess though.

562
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:27,029
A close relation, right?

563
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:28,169
Right.

564
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,672
You know, anybody recognizes Walt Disney, but who recognizes Roy Disney, right?

565
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,934
Roy was there with Walt every step of the way.

566
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:41,316
When they created the studio back in the 20s, it was the Disney Brothers Studio.

567
00:25:41,996 --> 00:25:45,558
Roy was more or less the CEO of that place almost the entire time.

568
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:48,576
But he realized that having Walt as a front man

569
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,097
was a better way to get business

570
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:53,040
because Roy was a consummate businessman.

571
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,881
He knew how to make the money work

572
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:57,943
and Walt sure as hell did not, right?

573
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,384
Walt was bad with money.

574
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:00,926
He was a creative genius who wanted to do

575
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:02,487
these incredible, beautiful things

576
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:06,270
and when it came to money, he was kind of a scary disaster.

577
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,052
But Roy was there to kinda deal with the money.

578
00:26:09,372 --> 00:26:11,313
So you've gotta think about, are you cool?

579
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:13,835
Are you into the game of getting the money

580
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:14,536
and dealing with that?

581
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:16,557
If you are, that's fine, do that.

582
00:26:16,837 --> 00:26:18,217
If you're not, get some help,

583
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:19,418
because you're gonna need the help,

584
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:20,698
because it's never easy.

585
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,559
Okay, so we got the people,

586
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,380
and somehow we got the money.

587
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,162
Awesome, finally, studio's done, studio's protected.

588
00:26:29,382 --> 00:26:30,822
Now I can get to what I've always wanted.

589
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:32,383
I'm gonna make awesome games.

590
00:26:32,443 --> 00:26:33,723
I'm not gonna make awesome games.

591
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,664
What is happening?

592
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:38,065
No, no you're not,

593
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:40,766
because you run the studio now,

594
00:26:41,907 --> 00:26:43,147
and that's not your job anymore.

595
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:57,351
You have a new job. Your job is optimize the studio. That's your job.

596
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:01,412
And you're like, but wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I've got my people and I've got my

597
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:06,213
game. Everyone knows a great game is the most important thing. That's my top priority. No,

598
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:12,694
it's not. Your number one priority is making sure that your team has everything they need

599
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:17,375
to make a great game. Your number two priority is making sure that game is great.

600
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:18,915
So let me just make that clear.

601
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:24,016
Your team's top priority is making the game great.

602
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:28,258
Your top priority is making the team great.

603
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,059
Because if you're not gonna do it, who's gonna do it?

604
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,221
There's no one else who's gonna do it.

605
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:35,242
And that has to be your priority.

606
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:39,442
And again, if you're not up for that, if you're not ready for that, you want to think twice

607
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:43,744
about really am I the one who's really going to run the studio because it's the primary

608
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:47,227
responsibility of leading a studio team.

609
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:51,229
And it's tough, man, because the team wants all these things.

610
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:56,103
They want all this stuff and if they don't have the stuff they're not happy.

611
00:27:56,123 --> 00:28:00,444
And if they're not happy you don't have a good game and everything is bad.

612
00:28:00,944 --> 00:28:02,645
They want so many things. Oh my God.

613
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:05,485
They want like an alphabet of things,

614
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:10,967
right? It's actually not a whole alphabet.

615
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,907
It's weirdly a half of an alphabet,

616
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,028
technically a half of that.

617
00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:22,886
Also, now this one in particular is the alphabet of happiness, TM.

618
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,149
And you're like, I don't want to solve these problems.

619
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,553
I don't want to, I got to find ways to get people excited about their work and make sure

620
00:28:32,573 --> 00:28:34,574
they like each other and coach them.

621
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:37,817
And really, that's, you know what?

622
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,799
When you picked up that sword.

623
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:42,536
You signed up.

624
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:44,177
And when you're like, what do they expect from me?

625
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:44,577
Really?

626
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:46,058
They expect me to do all this.

627
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:47,159
This is what they expect.

628
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:49,441
They did, because when you picked it up,

629
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:50,181
you know what you said?

630
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:52,723
You said, I'm a superhero.

631
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,064
That's what you said.

632
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:56,046
And that's what they expect.

633
00:28:56,998 --> 00:28:58,399
Now you know you're not a superhero,

634
00:28:58,459 --> 00:28:59,680
I know you're not a superhero.

635
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,421
And they kinda know that too,

636
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:03,122
but they expect you to be one anyway.

637
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:04,222
Right?

638
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,883
That's what they expect.

639
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:07,484
Because, and when you're a superhero,

640
00:29:07,864 --> 00:29:09,265
every problem is your problem.

641
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:11,066
Every problem at the studio,

642
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:12,166
it's like, well you can't say,

643
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:13,007
well that's their problem.

644
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:14,288
No, it's all your problem.

645
00:29:14,408 --> 00:29:16,649
It all goes to you, right?

646
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,250
And that sounds terrifying and daunting,

647
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,091
but guess what?

648
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:21,858
You can do it.

649
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,579
You totally can.

650
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,980
So I'm gonna give you practical tips

651
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,921
on how to be a superhero.

652
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:28,462
All right, practical superhero tips.

653
00:29:28,862 --> 00:29:31,544
Number one, you wanna get organized.

654
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,285
Get yourself organized.

655
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:33,965
Now a lot of people are like,

656
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,306
wait, I'm a creative person.

657
00:29:35,986 --> 00:29:37,567
Like, organization is death.

658
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,148
Organization is the end of the world.

659
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:39,728
It's terrible.

660
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,109
It's not right.

661
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:42,770
I like what Flaubert had to say.

662
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,891
Be regular and orderly in your life

663
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,013
so you may be violent and original in your work.

664
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,121
Right? Being orderly is a way to be powerful.

665
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:54,863
Or as Alton Brown says, organization will set you free.

666
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:56,964
And who's your main enemy?

667
00:29:58,725 --> 00:29:59,965
The Sharknado.

668
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,006
The opposite of chaos is order.

669
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:04,167
You want to find ways to be orderly.

670
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,408
When you are orderly, you protect your studio

671
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:08,509
from the chaos that will rip it apart.

672
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:12,371
So even if it's not in your nature, find ways to be orderly.

673
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,651
And I'll give you some tips.

674
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:14,832
One, get a notebook.

675
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:17,305
Because your memory, it sucks.

676
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:18,445
People are like, hey, you need to do this.

677
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:19,606
Oh yeah, I'll remember to do that.

678
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:20,326
No, you won't.

679
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:21,286
You totally won't.

680
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:22,746
You got a million things to think about.

681
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:24,847
Your brain can think about five things at a time

682
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:26,147
if you're lucky, right?

683
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:27,527
So, get a notebook.

684
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:29,268
I really recommend the book Getting Things Done.

685
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:32,048
It's a little out of date in practical wise,

686
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:34,109
but philosophy wise, it really is great

687
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,089
at helping you become an organized person.

688
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:39,510
Note the subtitle, The Art of Stress-Free Productivity,

689
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,531
because that's the goal, to be orderly

690
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:43,491
in a stress-free way and get everything done.

691
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:45,431
At a minimum, you're gonna want a to-do list.

692
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:47,472
of course, so that you remember to do things.

693
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,373
You're gonna, of course, you're gonna have a notebook

694
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:50,834
for general notes about this and that,

695
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:52,595
but you're also gonna need a hot list.

696
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:55,336
And it took me a long time to understand about a hot list.

697
00:30:55,957 --> 00:30:59,058
I've been using the same notebook now for 20 years.

698
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:01,859
I'll show it to you here.

699
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:03,620
Same notebook, right there.

700
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:06,704
I've had this notebook, I realize, for really 20 years,

701
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:08,145
the same exact notebook.

702
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:09,687
It's one of these notebooks where you can take the pages

703
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,168
in and out so you can reorganize it.

704
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:12,649
And you can see how I've done it here.

705
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:14,690
I've got a bunch of tabs on the front page.

706
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:17,072
Those are all the different things I have to keep track of.

707
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:20,475
Some of them are people that I have to coach and manage.

708
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:22,717
Some of them are projects I need to keep an eye on.

709
00:31:22,977 --> 00:31:24,278
And then so I have a page for each one.

710
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:25,899
You see a sample page there on the right.

711
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,380
And look, I keep it really simple.

712
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:29,762
What a hot list is, it's not stuff I have to do.

713
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,206
It's stuff that I have to keep an eye on, that I have to remember to keep checking with

714
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:34,847
the team about.

715
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:37,429
Like, I'll see a thing and I'm like, ooh, those textures are ugly.

716
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,290
And I'll say, when are you going to fix those textures?

717
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,452
They're like, oh, no, no, no, pretty soon, maybe next week.

718
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:45,215
So you write down ugly textures, right, and you put a little note, next week, they say

719
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:46,356
they're going to fix it.

720
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:48,939
So that way, when you check in with the team, they're like, anything you want to check on?

721
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:51,421
I'm like, oh, yeah, those ugly textures, did you fix those yet, right?

722
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:53,102
So you remember to do that.

723
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:55,204
So having a hot list is very important.

724
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:57,566
I'm a paper and pencil kind of guy.

725
00:31:57,826 --> 00:31:59,587
And so again, in terms of being organized,

726
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:00,788
one of the things I always say,

727
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,811
being organized is reaching for the catch up

728
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:05,973
and it is there, right?

729
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,175
So that's what organization is, right?

730
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,696
It's not like you forgot to get the catch up

731
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:10,757
or you lost it or anything.

732
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,598
So it's very important.

733
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:13,960
I need an eraser for this.

734
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,361
I know that sounds stupid, but I'm always,

735
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,342
you write things and then you erase status things,

736
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:19,344
but who has a pencil and eraser with them?

737
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:21,566
I do because it's taped in the notebook.

738
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,962
Right? It's always right there.

739
00:32:25,283 --> 00:32:27,651
I can't possibly lose it. It's always right there.

740
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:32,525
I'm not saying you have to do that, but you have to come up with your systems, the systems

741
00:32:32,545 --> 00:32:33,506
that are going to work for you.

742
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:36,109
You're going to think of things all the time, write them down.

743
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:37,850
Keep a notepad by the bed.

744
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,152
If you don't do that, oh my God, keep a notepad by the bed.

745
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,874
And why would you just keep it by the bed?

746
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:45,357
Like your shaving or whatever, why wouldn't you have one in the medicine cabinet?

747
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:48,120
You think of so many smart things then, you're like, oh, I'll remember that later.

748
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,161
You won't!

749
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:51,563
Write it down and get it in a notepad that goes somewhere.

750
00:32:52,184 --> 00:32:54,346
And yes, yes, this is totally a thing.

751
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:58,567
In the shower one day I was like, oh my god, waterproof paper, that would be genius, I

752
00:32:58,587 --> 00:32:59,107
should invent it.

753
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:00,149
Someone already invented it.

754
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:04,293
So keep a waterproof paper pad in the shower because you think of things in the shower,

755
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:06,736
you know you do really important things, write them down.

756
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:08,598
All right, so get organized.

757
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:10,100
You're like, ew, who does that?

758
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:11,402
A superhero!

759
00:33:11,842 --> 00:33:12,743
That's who does that.

760
00:33:13,264 --> 00:33:13,564
All right.

761
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:17,198
So another practical tip, running a studio,

762
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,659
it's so tempting to run around firefighting all the time.

763
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,239
There's Sharknado's breaking everything

764
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,980
and causing fires all over the place,

765
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,560
and you've got to help this, and you've got to fix this,

766
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,701
and you've got to fix that, and it feels so productive

767
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:28,822
when you're putting out all these fires.

768
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,743
But when you're doing that, you're not moving forward.

769
00:33:31,863 --> 00:33:33,563
You're just barely getting by.

770
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:36,984
What you need is to find time so you can think ahead

771
00:33:37,104 --> 00:33:39,665
of what happens next, what does the studio do next,

772
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:41,006
who do we need to hire next?

773
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:41,766
You need time.

774
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:45,547
for that. You need to get beyond firefighting mode.

775
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:49,108
Okay? And there's a lot of ways to do that. One of them is to make time

776
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:52,830
for yourself. On my calendar, every morning from nine to ten

777
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,551
is a block. It just says, important work. During that period, I am not allowed to

778
00:33:57,591 --> 00:34:01,412
look at email. I am only allowed to do things on my to-do

779
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:03,813
list, which are things that are kind of for

780
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:07,335
getting out ahead of things. I can't, I don't always hit it every day,

781
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:10,195
but trying to have that discipline makes such a difference and makes things much

782
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:10,816
calmer.

783
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:14,824
Delegating is one of the hardest things for people.

784
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:15,824
You started your own studio

785
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:16,904
because you wanted to do everything.

786
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:18,525
You want everything to be perfect your way,

787
00:34:18,545 --> 00:34:20,566
but you can't do everything.

788
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:22,846
And pretty soon your people are gonna start to hate you

789
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,327
because stuff's not getting done

790
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:27,108
because you're the bottleneck, right?

791
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,108
And you don't want that.

792
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:30,349
And you need to make time to do the important things.

793
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:33,310
So you need to start experimenting with delegating,

794
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,131
getting other people to do things,

795
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:37,832
and figuring out what are the tasks you wanna hold on to,

796
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:40,213
and what are the tasks you wanna give to others?

797
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,524
Another important one, keep doing what you're best at.

798
00:34:44,744 --> 00:34:45,866
Now I know I just said no,

799
00:34:45,926 --> 00:34:46,947
you can't work on the game anymore,

800
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:48,830
you gotta focus on the people.

801
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,153
Well of course, the people are your top responsibility.

802
00:34:51,534 --> 00:34:52,415
But you're doing this

803
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:54,658
because you have some genius with games.

804
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,561
There's something you're super good at.

805
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,305
Don't give it up because you're still good at it.

806
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:02,688
Find a way that you can still do the parts

807
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:03,970
that you're best at.

808
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,652
Your team expects that from you.

809
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,733
It's your superpower.

810
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:07,754
It's one of your superpowers.

811
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:10,217
Your team expects you to bring that thing you're best at

812
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,240
and find a way to get that in there.

813
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,834
Being humble is super important.

814
00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:19,737
It's real easy to pick up that sword and get real arrogant,

815
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,401
and it leads to a downfall every single time.

816
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:25,082
It leads to people not telling you the truth.

817
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,845
It leads to all kinds of problems.

818
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:31,208
And what do we call a superhero who's not humble?

819
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:38,082
Villain right you might be a super villain and you don't know it and no one's going to tell you because you're such an arrogant

820
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,363
Pain in the ass right?

821
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:44,128
And then that that's that's never good. So you want to be humble

822
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:48,207
Important, you're now gonna be super busy.

823
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,748
You're gonna be so busy, you're doing this job

824
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:51,529
60, 80 hours a week, whatever.

825
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,252
It can be easy to run yourself into the ground

826
00:35:54,312 --> 00:35:55,453
and get a lot of bad habits.

827
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,895
You need to find your healthy self.

828
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,437
Find a way to kind of get healthy habits in your life

829
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:02,899
because everybody needs you to do that.

830
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:05,302
An unhealthy superhero, you know,

831
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:07,423
who's coughing and wheezing down the street

832
00:36:07,463 --> 00:36:09,265
and hyperventilating every time something goes wrong,

833
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:11,367
it's like that's not gonna work for you.

834
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:16,510
And a phrase I got from Jeff Outlaw, one of the senior producers at our studio,

835
00:36:17,691 --> 00:36:19,232
you eat last.

836
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:23,455
Okay, think of a situation, we're bringing pizza in, we're having a big brainstorming party,

837
00:36:23,696 --> 00:36:27,799
did we order enough pizza? I don't know, probably we did, everybody's lining up getting pizza.

838
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:35,724
Imagine a situation where like you eat first and then there's not enough pizza for somebody else and then there you are, you know

839
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:40,267
Running the studio and you're eating pizza and other people are like, oh man, I'm sorry. I was late

840
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:44,790
I was fixing all these bugs that we only have because the deadlines were so short and

841
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,072
Like and what happens is people notice what you do

842
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,038
They notice, they're not always gonna tell you

843
00:36:52,078 --> 00:36:54,139
that they notice, they notice what they do

844
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,560
because they expect more from you

845
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,522
than they expect from the other people they work with.

846
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:02,863
Because you picked up that sword, they expect more from you.

847
00:37:03,424 --> 00:37:05,845
So you need to always remember,

848
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,886
like put everyone else first.

849
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,067
Because that's what superheroes do.

850
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,848
Okay, so there's some superhero tips.

851
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:16,750
So let's get to the alphabet of happiness.

852
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,151
We can do this, we're gonna go through these

853
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:18,851
and do these things.

854
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:22,045
Now they're hard, and I know they're icky,

855
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:22,906
and I know they're gross.

856
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:24,587
Do I have to do them?

857
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:26,469
Yes, you do, because you're holding a sword.

858
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:27,449
So who else is going to do it?

859
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,131
One way to think about why these are so important

860
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:32,573
and what's important about them for people,

861
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:34,314
anyone who's taken a basic psychology class

862
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:36,196
has run into Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

863
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:39,518
We often talk about it in terms of players and storytelling,

864
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:41,660
but you think about it in terms of the people

865
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,541
in your studio.

866
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:44,462
It's very, very relevant and valid.

867
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,264
At the bottom are your basic physiological needs,

868
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:49,325
and you say, well, what does that have to do with my studio?

869
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:52,447
How do you think people pay for food and water?

870
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:54,929
And when people crunch and they're not sleeping,

871
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:57,890
you're taking away one of their basic physiological needs.

872
00:37:58,371 --> 00:38:00,252
And then after that, there's psychological needs.

873
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:03,213
And you're like, well, family, friendship, whatever.

874
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:04,253
What does that have to do with anything?

875
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:07,815
When you've got your staff working 60 hours a week, and

876
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:09,195
they can't maintain their family

877
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:12,256
relationships very well, they've got all kinds of

878
00:38:12,316 --> 00:38:13,036
troubles and problems.

879
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:15,357
Because the whole point of this hierarchy is the stuff at

880
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:17,898
the top can't happen unless the stuff lower

881
00:38:17,938 --> 00:38:19,458
down is taken care of.

882
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,759
And what's at the top?

883
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:23,540
At the very top, we have people achieving their full

884
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,001
potential and doing creative activities.

885
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:33,606
How are they going to be great game developers if the things underneath are like falling apart in their lives?

886
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:36,488
They can do it for a little while, but they can't sustain it.

887
00:38:36,808 --> 00:38:42,012
And so you need to always keep an eye out for like, does everyone have all their needs fulfilled?

888
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:43,954
And even look at that level four, esteem needs.

889
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:47,336
Like if you're just barking at the team all the time and they're feeling like,

890
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,939
oh man, yeah, geez, I guess maybe we do kind of suck.

891
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:53,521
Like again, they're not going to be their best creative selves.

892
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:55,943
So, some concrete things that you can do.

893
00:38:56,724 --> 00:38:56,984
All right.

894
00:38:57,779 --> 00:38:58,807
A, adequate salary.

895
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:00,842
Well, that's kind of straightforward.

896
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,163
People need to get paid.

897
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,784
But the problem is now it's your job to figure out

898
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:05,745
how much is that?

899
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:08,147
How much should people get paid?

900
00:39:08,227 --> 00:39:08,987
Here's my pro tip.

901
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:10,689
Ask them, right?

902
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:13,911
So, you know, how much would you be looking to make

903
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:14,471
at this job?

904
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:15,592
And they'll tell you.

905
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:18,394
And if you're like, oh, like we can afford that,

906
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:20,595
then you say, yeah, okay, that's great.

907
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:23,037
And if you're thinking, oh, no, we can't,

908
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:25,539
then you figure out, well, what can we afford?

909
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:26,960
And you tell them and they'll decide.

910
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:31,424
And that way, either way, they decided, yeah, okay, I'm doing it,

911
00:39:31,524 --> 00:39:35,868
and then they'll be starting on a basis of some kind of adequate salary.

912
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:38,671
You know, it's a simple but important thing.

913
00:39:39,872 --> 00:39:43,095
Second one, people need to believe in what they're doing,

914
00:39:43,276 --> 00:39:44,917
especially in something like games.

915
00:39:44,977 --> 00:39:47,400
Games is a passion-based industry.

916
00:39:48,468 --> 00:39:51,149
and they need to believe in the mission,

917
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:53,109
not just the mission of this particular game,

918
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:55,369
like where's this studio going?

919
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,450
What are we doing after this game?

920
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,110
What is this place really all about?

921
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,191
I was working at a place once and I asked the boss that,

922
00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:04,131
I'm like, what exactly is our goal?

923
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:06,312
And he's like, you know, I don't know, make cool stuff,

924
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:09,573
I don't know, and it was so unsatisfying to realize,

925
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:12,633
my God, he has no plan, we're just gonna drift around

926
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:15,354
from one thing to the next, that doesn't feel great,

927
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,815
I wanna feel like I'm part of something important.

928
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:21,577
Now, some people say, oh, really, I'm going to make a mission statement?

929
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:23,799
That sounds like the most corporate thing ever.

930
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:26,521
And yeah, if you make a crap mission statement, it is.

931
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:27,962
Right?

932
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:32,785
But you should, are you doing this for an important reason or not?

933
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:35,127
And the answer might be no, I'm not doing it for an important reason.

934
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:38,309
But if you are, you should be able to say what that is.

935
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,290
That's the mission statement.

936
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:45,013
Now, it takes some thinking, and it takes some work, and it takes some bravery to be

937
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:46,114
able to do it.

938
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,918
I really recommend reading this book, The Advantage, by Patrick Valencioni.

939
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:51,819
It is short and it is great.

940
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:55,963
It is all about that the main advantage an organization can have is to be healthy.

941
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:59,766
And he gives all these tips, and one of them is about coming up with clear mission statements,

942
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:02,389
clear core values, clear principles.

943
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:05,952
And so following the template of that, one of the things like we've done at our studio

944
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:10,316
is we have, you know, we have this little sheet right here where we have our clear mission

945
00:41:10,356 --> 00:41:10,736
statement.

946
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:14,020
our clear core values, we have a bunch of principles,

947
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,081
I'm not gonna get into all those,

948
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:17,184
and you'll notice at the bottom, top priority right now,

949
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,066
and this is our current studio priority,

950
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:23,091
which we decided is protect and leverage our VRAR momentum.

951
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,053
Now you might say, one priority?

952
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:27,656
But like, yeah, you can only have one top priority.

953
00:41:27,796 --> 00:41:29,918
That's how top priority works.

954
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:33,580
And so there I labeled everything and that's the thing.

955
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,001
And if you want to download these slides later,

956
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:37,282
you can check all that stuff out as a sample.

957
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:40,624
And but the important thing is that you have these discussions

958
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:44,265
with yourself and with the team to figure out what are we about,

959
00:41:44,385 --> 00:41:46,466
what is important to us, and guess what?

960
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,627
You can change them later if you realize

961
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:49,688
that you picked the wrong ones.

962
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:50,648
You can do that.

963
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:51,308
It's okay.

964
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:54,390
But you need to be brave enough to step up and say,

965
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,231
this is what we're about.

966
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:58,371
And say it in front of everybody and get them to believe it.

967
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,362
And it's tough, right? Because people are scared to put these principles down.

968
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:05,564
Because this means, oh my God, what if I don't always do these?

969
00:42:05,704 --> 00:42:07,806
This means I'm going to be a hypocrite and people will call me out.

970
00:42:08,086 --> 00:42:12,390
Yes, that's right, they will. People will call you out for going against your own values.

971
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,652
You want that to happen. You want that to happen.

972
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:17,934
It's helpful. It hurts, but it's helpful.

973
00:42:20,195 --> 00:42:21,596
Culture is really important.

974
00:42:21,616 --> 00:42:23,237
Everyone that says culture is so important,

975
00:42:23,297 --> 00:42:25,139
how do you engineer an excellent culture?

976
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:27,040
Well, you can't engineer an excellent culture.

977
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,401
Cultures grow.

978
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:30,143
That's what cultures do.

979
00:42:30,163 --> 00:42:32,044
They grow from how people.

980
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:38,083
interact with each other. So that starts with you. How do you interact with everybody else?

981
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:40,945
And then how do they interact with each other?

982
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:46,670
That's all the culture is. And so focus on those interactions and you'll have an excellent culture.

983
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,454
It's not about, oh, we have jelly beans in the break room. It's not about that.

984
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:53,376
It's about how people interact with each other.

985
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,463
A big part of your job is removing distractions.

986
00:42:57,543 --> 00:42:59,924
One of the horrible things, sharknadoes can crop up

987
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,626
inside the studio, they don't all come from outside.

988
00:43:02,986 --> 00:43:05,187
You can get two people together who just don't get along

989
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:06,528
and suddenly you have chaos,

990
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:09,430
and that's your problem to solve.

991
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,171
So chaos can come from anywhere

992
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:12,632
and you have to keep an eye out for it,

993
00:43:12,672 --> 00:43:13,633
you need to look for it,

994
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:16,094
and you need to find ways to deal with it.

995
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:18,416
People always say, oh, I hated working at that one place

996
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:20,137
because it had so much politics.

997
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:27,825
What is politics? Politics is one person wants to tell something to someone else, but they can't.

998
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:33,431
They're afraid to, they have this reason and that reason, they can't tell them, so they go and tell other people.

999
00:43:33,551 --> 00:43:37,455
Oh, did you hear what that guy said? And this and that. That's when politics begins.

1000
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:40,618
You need to look for that and weed that out and not let that.

1001
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:45,000
happen. And of course it can come from you yourself and you have to watch for that.

1002
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,361
Great advice from Ed Catmull, another excellent book, Creativity Inc., his tale of how Pixar

1003
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:54,883
was created and formed and he has all these leadership lessons in there. A lot of great

1004
00:43:54,903 --> 00:44:01,805
quotes in that book. You have problems you know and problems you don't know. And realizing

1005
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:05,046
this, realizing of course we all know we have problems we know and we're trying to fix those

1006
00:44:05,086 --> 00:44:08,887
problems. But acknowledging that you also have problems you don't know.

1007
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:13,684
means you're going to keep an eye out for problems that you're like not even aware of

1008
00:44:13,744 --> 00:44:13,884
yet.

1009
00:44:13,925 --> 00:44:14,725
It's very important.

1010
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:18,147
And the other phrase he uses, the good hides the bad.

1011
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:22,349
When things are going really well at the studio, no one wants to tell you about some crappy

1012
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:26,051
situation where there's a fight between the art and engineering department, because people

1013
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:29,373
feel bad that they've got this crappy thing going on when everything's so good.

1014
00:44:29,653 --> 00:44:32,115
Because when things are good, when things are bad, everyone will talk about all the

1015
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:32,495
bad things.

1016
00:44:32,715 --> 00:44:34,636
When things are good, the good things hide the bad things.

1017
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:38,017
So don't fall under the illusion like, oh, everything seems to be going so well.

1018
00:44:38,277 --> 00:44:41,699
You still must weed out these hidden problems.

1019
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:48,582
And a very important thing he mentions, only the leaders can remake the rules of the studio.

1020
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:53,946
Sometimes you have rules, written or unwritten, at the studio that are broken and bad.

1021
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:58,230
And most of the people in the studio can't do anything about it.

1022
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,113
It's just they don't see it as something within their power.

1023
00:45:01,653 --> 00:45:03,055
It's only within your power.

1024
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:08,059
Ed Catmull tells this great story about this really bad design table they had

1025
00:45:08,299 --> 00:45:11,122
that was long and skinny, and the people who sat in the middle of it

1026
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:15,026
were the important people, and people on the ends didn't really get to participate very much.

1027
00:45:15,606 --> 00:45:18,352
And everyone knew it was bad, but no one would say anything

1028
00:45:18,372 --> 00:45:21,158
because they were like, obviously management likes this

1029
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:23,142
because that's why they put this table here.

1030
00:45:23,953 --> 00:45:29,156
right? And eventually they had to realize, oh my God, we have to change this. And it

1031
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:34,280
was a big deal. I had a situation on I Expect You to Die. We'd been very, very budget conscious

1032
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,762
because we'd had a history in the past of sometimes going over budget on internal projects.

1033
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:41,304
So we'd really clamp down on it. And we had rules about, you know, this is the budget

1034
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:46,308
and that's that. The team came up with this brilliant idea to do this opening credit song

1035
00:45:46,388 --> 00:45:46,848
sequence.

1036
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:49,890
And they were like, oh, this is great, but we can't do it,

1037
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,050
because it's just not in the budget.

1038
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,831
And no one even wanted to bring it up with me.

1039
00:45:52,991 --> 00:45:55,353
They didn't even want to say it, because they were sure I

1040
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:56,093
would shoot it down.

1041
00:45:56,413 --> 00:45:58,754
And then I happened to see it, and I'm like, oh my god, this

1042
00:45:58,815 --> 00:45:59,335
is so amazing.

1043
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:00,195
We have to do this.

1044
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:01,836
And they're like, and so here I am.

1045
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,297
I'm the head of the company telling them, we

1046
00:46:03,357 --> 00:46:03,937
have to do this.

1047
00:46:03,957 --> 00:46:05,318
And they're like, we can't.

1048
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:08,820
I'm like, why can't we?

1049
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,181
It's just the budget.

1050
00:46:10,241 --> 00:46:10,661
It's not there.

1051
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,042
I'm like, we'll change the budget.

1052
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:15,523
And everyone's like, wait, we can change the budget?

1053
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:16,404
Right?

1054
00:46:17,496 --> 00:46:21,937
And so that's one of the things, when you end up in a leadership position,

1055
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:26,099
you have to look for places the rules need to be remade.

1056
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:30,260
People need to not just believe in their work and believe in the mission,

1057
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,841
they need to be excited about it, they need to be enthusiastic.

1058
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:36,802
And you're like, of course they are, they're making games, it's awesome.

1059
00:46:37,778 --> 00:46:38,118
Are they?

1060
00:46:38,678 --> 00:46:38,998
Really?

1061
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:40,719
Maybe, maybe not.

1062
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:42,000
You need to talk to people.

1063
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:42,820
You need to ask.

1064
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,401
Check in with people about how they're feeling

1065
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:46,482
about the work.

1066
00:46:46,982 --> 00:46:48,343
You need to ask just in case.

1067
00:46:49,683 --> 00:46:52,244
People need to feel cared about.

1068
00:46:52,805 --> 00:46:53,445
It's important.

1069
00:46:53,565 --> 00:46:55,246
It's one of the things that really improves

1070
00:46:55,286 --> 00:46:56,026
their self-esteem.

1071
00:46:57,107 --> 00:47:01,569
And you might say, of course, you know, they get paid,

1072
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:03,831
they get to make games, of course they feel cared about.

1073
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:05,832
But is that really true?

1074
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:08,613
Like, what have you done to really show you care

1075
00:47:09,134 --> 00:47:10,615
how they feel, right?

1076
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,796
And a great way to do that is to ask them how they feel.

1077
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:16,218
I like this phrase, I forgot to say I care.

1078
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,459
And it's an easy thing to forget.

1079
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,161
So the best way to do this is first

1080
00:47:21,201 --> 00:47:23,482
you have to actually care, right?

1081
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:24,703
If you don't actually care.

1082
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,143
You're going to have a hard time.

1083
00:47:26,183 --> 00:47:28,264
But first, you have to actually care, but that's not enough.

1084
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:30,585
Then you have to back that up by doing things

1085
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:33,747
that caring people do, and even that's not enough.

1086
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:35,708
Then you have to tell people anyway

1087
00:47:35,908 --> 00:47:38,389
about that you care how they feel and that you want to know,

1088
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:39,770
how do you feel about this?

1089
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:43,800
I'm going to lump these next two together because they have a lot to do with each other.

1090
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,861
Good feedback and helpful coaching.

1091
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:47,661
This is one of the hardest things.

1092
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:50,782
For me personally, this was really, really hard.

1093
00:47:50,802 --> 00:47:55,544
I think we still struggle with it a bit, but it was a turning point for me to realize how

1094
00:47:55,604 --> 00:47:56,884
important these things are.

1095
00:47:57,785 --> 00:47:59,786
that people really need excellent feedback

1096
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:00,646
about what they're doing.

1097
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:03,288
I personally believe 360 feedback,

1098
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:05,509
where you collect feedback from people's peers

1099
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:08,531
about each other, about what are they good at,

1100
00:48:08,571 --> 00:48:11,133
what do they need to get better at, is really important.

1101
00:48:11,313 --> 00:48:12,814
They can't give it to each other directly

1102
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:14,455
because it's too dangerous.

1103
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,336
It could cause too much tension.

1104
00:48:16,356 --> 00:48:18,837
So you create a situation where it has to flow

1105
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:20,618
through studio leadership, where people say,

1106
00:48:20,979 --> 00:48:22,340
here's what I liked about this person,

1107
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,840
and here's where this person needs to improve,

1108
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:24,161
and then...

1109
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:27,863
The manager as coach needs to kind of sit down with people

1110
00:48:27,923 --> 00:48:31,406
and say, you know, here's what people feel like you need

1111
00:48:31,426 --> 00:48:32,007
to get better at.

1112
00:48:32,127 --> 00:48:33,768
And so you need to get that feedback.

1113
00:48:34,669 --> 00:48:37,671
A thing you need to come to terms with, who are your A,

1114
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:38,692
B, and C players?

1115
00:48:38,812 --> 00:48:39,773
Who are your people who are excellent?

1116
00:48:39,793 --> 00:48:40,773
Who are your people who are, yeah, they're OK?

1117
00:48:40,813 --> 00:48:42,915
And who are your people who are having trouble?

1118
00:48:43,455 --> 00:48:44,556
Nobody likes to face this.

1119
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:47,619
You don't like to face the fact that, yeah, that one guy

1120
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:48,980
is not really doing very well.

1121
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,841
I'm just going to try and not think about it because I want

1122
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:51,261
to avoid it.

1123
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:54,639
you need to think about it because that person who's not doing very well,

1124
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:58,381
you could have an A player in there instead and imagine how much better everything would be.

1125
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:02,884
And their life won't end if they have to end up leaving the studio.

1126
00:49:03,224 --> 00:49:07,066
And maybe if you actually confronted their problem, maybe you'd help them deal with it and they'd get better.

1127
00:49:07,586 --> 00:49:10,948
Right? But ignoring the C players is just unacceptable.

1128
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,670
Because people need to know where they stand.

1129
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,131
They need you to tell them, like, how am I doing?

1130
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:17,011
Am I doing well?

1131
00:49:17,451 --> 00:49:19,992
How do I, how do I, and if not, how can I get better?

1132
00:49:20,632 --> 00:49:23,873
And the C players, you need to find a way to get the better,

1133
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:26,294
and if you can't get them better, you need to get them out.

1134
00:49:26,654 --> 00:49:28,435
And it sucks, nobody likes firing people.

1135
00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:31,155
It sucks to have to do it, but you have to do it.

1136
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:33,576
And people's lives don't end when they get fired.

1137
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:34,336
Often it's better.

1138
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:36,257
They're like, oh, I was really struggling at this one place,

1139
00:49:36,277 --> 00:49:38,898
I got fired, and man, I found a place I fit in much better,

1140
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:39,718
and I'm doing better work.

1141
00:49:39,738 --> 00:49:41,478
It happens all the time.

1142
00:49:42,508 --> 00:49:43,249
So, coaching.

1143
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:47,190
You must make time for one-on-one coaching meetings.

1144
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,190
It always feels like, oh, I don't have time for this,

1145
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,090
we gotta focus on the game,

1146
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,451
and I gotta focus on all these fires.

1147
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:54,091
You need to make time to sit down with people and say,

1148
00:49:54,251 --> 00:49:56,332
how's it going, what's going well,

1149
00:49:56,432 --> 00:49:58,412
what do you need help with, what are problems that you have?

1150
00:49:58,713 --> 00:49:59,933
You need to give your people time

1151
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,694
to talk through their problems

1152
00:50:02,914 --> 00:50:05,474
so they can get advice from you or from somebody.

1153
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:08,035
And this really, as a leader,

1154
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:09,595
this is your number one priority.

1155
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:11,636
One-on-one meetings with.

1156
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:16,599
the people you work with is the best thing you can do to help make them great.

1157
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:19,421
And it's scary because you don't know the perfect way to do it,

1158
00:50:19,761 --> 00:50:22,663
and you don't know exactly what to say, and you don't have to have all the answers.

1159
00:50:22,943 --> 00:50:25,464
We've all had the situation where you go and you,

1160
00:50:25,825 --> 00:50:28,486
you go to somebody with a problem and like you talk through the problem

1161
00:50:28,506 --> 00:50:31,408
and then you realize the solution in your own brain just through talking about it.

1162
00:50:31,868 --> 00:50:32,669
Right? Just...

1163
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:35,711
And the more you do it, you're just going to get better at it anyway.

1164
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:40,615
And this is a great time for you to have your core valuables, your core principles and your

1165
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,496
core values ready.

1166
00:50:42,636 --> 00:50:45,878
Like I always keep them on a little sheet of paper right nearby when we have these meetings.

1167
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,401
So when someone did something really great, I can say, hey man, that's really great.

1168
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:51,262
You're really embodying what we're about.

1169
00:50:51,642 --> 00:50:55,025
Or someone did something that's questionable, I can say, well, I don't think that was good.

1170
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:59,368
Or I can say, hey, look, guy, principle number four, we've talked about this.

1171
00:50:59,448 --> 00:51:00,889
Why are you going against it?

1172
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:02,570
Talk about it in the concrete.

1173
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:08,694
way. And very efficient, help people coach each other. Make opportunities for people

1174
00:51:08,734 --> 00:51:15,338
to get together and just share their problems with each other. And just create those opportunities,

1175
00:51:15,498 --> 00:51:20,441
get them scheduled. I remember the first time I finally figured out to do that and people

1176
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:23,063
were like, wow, I didn't know that we were allowed to do this.

1177
00:51:24,012 --> 00:51:25,932
Yeah, okay, right, no, it is really useful

1178
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:27,133
and sort of obviously useful,

1179
00:51:27,173 --> 00:51:29,233
but no one ever said this was a good thing to do.

1180
00:51:29,914 --> 00:51:32,875
Two amazing books by the same people, by Stone and Heen,

1181
00:51:33,735 --> 00:51:35,015
Difficult Conversations.

1182
00:51:35,455 --> 00:51:38,696
This is all about how do you have difficult conversations

1183
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:40,497
in a productive, useful way,

1184
00:51:40,957 --> 00:51:43,038
and related, Thanks for the Feedback.

1185
00:51:43,258 --> 00:51:45,599
It's a book about how to take feedback,

1186
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,719
but in doing so, it's really about

1187
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:50,100
how to give the best possible feedback.

1188
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,342
And one thing I've been doing recently,

1189
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:55,964
I totally recommend, get a tool for anonymous feedback.

1190
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:57,986
We've been using this one called OfficeVibe.

1191
00:51:59,152 --> 00:52:00,192
It's expensive.

1192
00:52:00,212 --> 00:52:01,353
I'll put it out there.

1193
00:52:01,593 --> 00:52:04,095
We're in a little debate about, is this really worth it?

1194
00:52:04,115 --> 00:52:05,636
But we feel like it is.

1195
00:52:06,216 --> 00:52:09,438
And what this does is it sends little quizzes, easy little

1196
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,700
surveys to people about how you feel about your project,

1197
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,201
how you feel about your coworkers, how you feel about

1198
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:16,003
your boss, just little simple things, simple, simple little

1199
00:52:16,023 --> 00:52:18,745
web things, just like one or two questions a week.

1200
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:19,565
Real simple.

1201
00:52:19,885 --> 00:52:21,807
And then it collects all that data and it shares the data

1202
00:52:21,827 --> 00:52:23,368
with management in an anonymous way.

1203
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,250
So you can kind of see the vibe of what's going on in there.

1204
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,611
But most important, this is the most valuable part,

1205
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:30,632
people can kind of, there's free form open boxes,

1206
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:31,973
people can kind of type stuff in,

1207
00:52:32,294 --> 00:52:34,055
and you get it all, and it's all anonymous.

1208
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:35,336
So it's like a suggestion box

1209
00:52:35,596 --> 00:52:37,017
of the things people are concerned about.

1210
00:52:37,437 --> 00:52:38,217
And here's the best part,

1211
00:52:38,518 --> 00:52:42,640
you can answer the questions anonymously.

1212
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,041
You're not anonymous, they know it's you.

1213
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,002
You're the boss, they know that.

1214
00:52:45,802 --> 00:52:47,382
But you don't know who asked it.

1215
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:49,683
So someone's like, man, I'm really upset by this one thing.

1216
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:50,743
This project got canceled.

1217
00:52:50,803 --> 00:52:52,423
And I think we're going on the wrong track.

1218
00:52:52,463 --> 00:52:54,904
And you'd be like, whoa, I haven't heard about this.

1219
00:52:54,944 --> 00:52:58,205
And you can say, hey, Anonymous, let me tell you,

1220
00:52:58,305 --> 00:52:59,385
I really think this is better.

1221
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:01,086
And here's the reasons why it's so much better.

1222
00:53:01,466 --> 00:53:02,546
And sometimes they come back.

1223
00:53:02,606 --> 00:53:05,627
First, they're like, oh my god, my big, serious complaint.

1224
00:53:06,007 --> 00:53:08,167
The boss just got me a letter back.

1225
00:53:08,187 --> 00:53:10,568
And sometimes they're like, that actually made sense.

1226
00:53:10,628 --> 00:53:11,368
And they write back to you.

1227
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:12,649
And they say, thanks for explaining that.

1228
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:13,489
I didn't know.

1229
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:14,209
I didn't understand.

1230
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,950
I've had no other way to get information like that.

1231
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,631
So like finding a tool for anonymous feedback is great.

1232
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:24,592
You can check out my talk from last year.

1233
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:26,973
It was all about information flow in the studio.

1234
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:32,814
One of the great things in this Patrick Lencioni book, he uses a term that is super valuable,

1235
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:34,195
overcommunication.

1236
00:53:34,816 --> 00:53:39,781
He points out that people can't read your mind, and as a leader, you must over-communicate

1237
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:42,023
the things that are important.

1238
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:45,767
You must say them not just once, you can't be just like, oh, I said it, they all know.

1239
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:49,191
You need to say it again and again to the point where you're a little embarrassed, right?

1240
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:53,295
Because a repetition of important things is helpful, because they're important, right?

1241
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:55,577
So you should repeat important things.

1242
00:53:56,238 --> 00:53:58,600
you should be saying important things again and again,

1243
00:53:58,981 --> 00:53:59,782
in different ways.

1244
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:01,544
Because it's better for people to hear,

1245
00:54:01,624 --> 00:54:03,346
you get the idea, but look how uncomfortable it is,

1246
00:54:03,386 --> 00:54:04,307
but I'm gonna do it anyway.

1247
00:54:04,547 --> 00:54:06,509
Important things, you should repeat them, right?

1248
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:07,430
Yeah.

1249
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:09,172
So.

1250
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:12,488
A joint feeling of respect, right?

1251
00:54:12,908 --> 00:54:14,829
You want to feel respected by people,

1252
00:54:14,909 --> 00:54:16,330
people want to feel respected by you.

1253
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:17,991
You want to look for these situations.

1254
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:19,431
This is back to this notion of,

1255
00:54:19,992 --> 00:54:24,274
are you yourself good at making others feel respected?

1256
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,055
And you need to look inside yourself

1257
00:54:26,515 --> 00:54:28,376
and make sure that that's really true.

1258
00:54:30,284 --> 00:54:34,125
Keeping communication comfortable, because when it's not comfortable, it stops.

1259
00:54:34,325 --> 00:54:36,146
And that's when politics begins.

1260
00:54:37,046 --> 00:54:41,888
One of the things as a game designer, I feel like my most important discovery is this reading

1261
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:45,669
some psychology neurology paper and realizing that we have two different circuits in our

1262
00:54:45,709 --> 00:54:50,830
brains, that the circuits for avoiding negative consequences and the circuits for seeking

1263
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,871
positive consequences are completely different brain systems.

1264
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:58,339
And we see this in game design all the time, this moment when people switch from reward

1265
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,722
seeking to punishment avoiding.

1266
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:01,065
It's very important for game design.

1267
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,390
It's also very important for your studio.

1268
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,722
Why are people communicating with you?

1269
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:09,024
Are they communicating with you because they have to?

1270
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:11,506
Or are they communicating with you because they want to?

1271
00:55:12,006 --> 00:55:13,387
Everything will be different.

1272
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:16,169
If you're the kind of person who's tough to talk to, and

1273
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:17,810
they're like, ugh, I don't want to talk to that guy,

1274
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:21,814
people are using a totally different part of their brain.

1275
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:23,815
And how's it going in your studio?

1276
00:55:23,835 --> 00:55:25,076
How's the communication going?

1277
00:55:25,536 --> 00:55:26,377
When is it comfortable?

1278
00:55:26,417 --> 00:55:27,318
When is it uncomfortable?

1279
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,501
People want to like their teammates, and I know that sounds sort of simple and sort of straightforward,

1280
00:55:33,521 --> 00:55:35,222
but it's true and it's important.

1281
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:38,044
And when you interview people, you should be thinking about likability.

1282
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:42,686
Who is going to fit in with the culture and how are people going to like each other?

1283
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:48,209
And if you check out last year's talk, I talked a lot about the research evidence

1284
00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:51,851
that shows that likability is more important.

1285
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:53,832
then how good somebody is at their job.

1286
00:55:54,372 --> 00:55:56,834
That sounds crazy, but it's totally true,

1287
00:55:56,914 --> 00:55:58,895
and you can hear the complicated story about it,

1288
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:01,476
but you wanna focus, you wanna think about

1289
00:56:01,596 --> 00:56:03,177
making sure people like each other.

1290
00:56:03,617 --> 00:56:05,679
It's one of the main reasons people quit a studio,

1291
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:07,540
is like I couldn't stand the people I was working with.

1292
00:56:08,494 --> 00:56:12,337
And the last part of the alphabet is measurable progress.

1293
00:56:12,997 --> 00:56:14,858
People really want measurable progress.

1294
00:56:14,919 --> 00:56:16,200
We know that we're game designers.

1295
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,961
Oh my God, how do we not know that?

1296
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:22,885
We do know that, but we so rarely design it well

1297
00:56:23,045 --> 00:56:24,406
into our studios.

1298
00:56:24,446 --> 00:56:25,487
And it comes from so many places.

1299
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:26,708
It can certainly come from the project.

1300
00:56:26,728 --> 00:56:28,209
We're making great progress on the project.

1301
00:56:28,269 --> 00:56:29,610
I feel really great about that.

1302
00:56:30,371 --> 00:56:32,232
Raises are really important.

1303
00:56:32,652 --> 00:56:34,854
Did you ever think about why we have inflation

1304
00:56:35,495 --> 00:56:36,315
here on planet Earth?

1305
00:56:37,157 --> 00:56:38,677
Every nation has inflation.

1306
00:56:38,877 --> 00:56:43,338
Why should it be that prices and salaries gradually rise over time?

1307
00:56:43,558 --> 00:56:45,018
Shouldn't it drift up and drift down?

1308
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:49,319
No, it gradually rises because human beings like progress,

1309
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,500
even if we have to make it up.

1310
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,120
Right?

1311
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,161
So figuring out the raises that are going

1312
00:56:56,181 --> 00:56:58,161
to feel like good, measurable progress for people

1313
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,482
is very important and very tricky.

1314
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:04,816
People's growing responsibility and getting more and more responsibility is important.

1315
00:57:04,996 --> 00:57:08,559
And of course, you want to make it clear, measurably clear, letting people know that

1316
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:12,722
like I'm now, you know, yeah, we're giving you these new responsibilities and we're looking

1317
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:13,903
forward to you taking care of those.

1318
00:57:14,504 --> 00:57:16,506
One thing people talk about is the Peter Principle.

1319
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,948
This is a famous thing in large organizations.

1320
00:57:19,468 --> 00:57:22,831
The idea that people get promoted, you know, you're good at your job.

1321
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:23,712
We're going to promote you.

1322
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:24,753
Oh, you're good at your job.

1323
00:57:24,773 --> 00:57:25,473
We're going to promote you.

1324
00:57:25,553 --> 00:57:26,314
And when do we stop?

1325
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:28,396
We stop when you suck at your job.

1326
00:57:29,305 --> 00:57:32,306
And what that means is ultimately you're going to have an organization full of people who

1327
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:33,086
suck at their job.

1328
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:37,207
And some people are like, there's nothing you can do about it, it's just what happens.

1329
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,067
It's not true.

1330
00:57:38,567 --> 00:57:44,089
The way you do it is don't promote people until they've already been doing the new job

1331
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:44,649
for a while.

1332
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:47,710
Because if they do the new job and they suck, don't promote them.

1333
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:49,931
But if they do their new job and they're great,

1334
00:57:49,951 --> 00:57:52,553
well, then you promote them and you avoid the Peter principle.

1335
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:55,035
So job titles and figuring that out is important.

1336
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:55,976
And I know it sounds silly.

1337
00:57:56,316 --> 00:57:56,977
Like, oh, really?

1338
00:57:56,997 --> 00:57:57,597
Just a name?

1339
00:57:57,657 --> 00:57:58,278
Just a label?

1340
00:57:58,538 --> 00:57:59,679
You're game designers.

1341
00:57:59,779 --> 00:58:00,379
Oh my god.

1342
00:58:00,419 --> 00:58:01,080
You know that.

1343
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,221
You know how important just some bogus title

1344
00:58:03,682 --> 00:58:06,384
is into making someone feel good about themselves?

1345
00:58:06,424 --> 00:58:07,204
You know that.

1346
00:58:08,873 --> 00:58:11,635
Clear feedback, of course, about exactly,

1347
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,336
are you good at your job?

1348
00:58:13,596 --> 00:58:14,817
Are you getting better or not?

1349
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:16,337
And having your manager tell you,

1350
00:58:16,457 --> 00:58:17,658
yeah, you're really getting better.

1351
00:58:17,698 --> 00:58:18,879
I really see you getting better.

1352
00:58:18,899 --> 00:58:21,000
And being very clear about that is important.

1353
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,701
And then, of course, watching a studio grow itself,

1354
00:58:23,781 --> 00:58:25,302
which sometimes happens with studios,

1355
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:28,324
that can feel like progress to people as well.

1356
00:58:28,604 --> 00:58:31,525
So I'm gonna talk about some studio growth rules of thumb.

1357
00:58:32,806 --> 00:58:33,986
Just real quick here.

1358
00:58:34,426 --> 00:58:36,287
If you have more than five people,

1359
00:58:36,807 --> 00:58:38,587
that's at the point where you need a producer.

1360
00:58:38,787 --> 00:58:40,668
And you're going to need another producer for every 10

1361
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:41,668
developers that you get.

1362
00:58:42,568 --> 00:58:44,249
If you have more than 10 people in your studio,

1363
00:58:44,269 --> 00:58:46,129
you're going to find you're needing sub-team meetings

1364
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:48,209
to get certain kinds of communication to happen.

1365
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,370
When you've got small studios, you

1366
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,750
don't have to think about communication so much.

1367
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:51,370
It just happens.

1368
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:52,250
Everybody's just there.

1369
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,831
Once you get more than 10, you have

1370
00:58:53,851 --> 00:58:55,991
to organize and plan the communication,

1371
00:58:56,391 --> 00:58:57,372
or it doesn't happen.

1372
00:58:58,357 --> 00:58:59,619
Once you get more than 20 people,

1373
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,683
like coaching isn't going to happen so naturally anymore.

1374
00:59:02,743 --> 00:59:05,808
You need to assign formal coaching responsibilities.

1375
00:59:06,549 --> 00:59:07,610
Once you get more than 30,

1376
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,253
you better get a full-time IT guy.

1377
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:10,554
I'll just say that, it's important.

1378
00:59:10,995 --> 00:59:13,078
And you're gonna need one every 50 more developers you get.

1379
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:17,640
Once you get to around 40 people, you're going to find you need departments of some kind.

1380
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,300
A flat architecture is not going to work for you anymore, and you're going to need leaders

1381
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:22,981
to lead up these departments.

1382
00:59:23,741 --> 00:59:27,102
And by 50, you'll probably need full-time HR, you'll probably need full-time accounting

1383
00:59:27,142 --> 00:59:27,742
and finance.

1384
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:33,544
Once you get to 60, you're going to need two layers of management for coaching inside departments.

1385
00:59:34,044 --> 00:59:38,565
I heard when Media Molecule was formed, the guys who do Little Big Planet, they said,

1386
00:59:39,865 --> 00:59:44,848
We're, our plan is to not have to get bigger than 30 because we've had the best experiences

1387
00:59:45,088 --> 00:59:46,309
with no more than 30 devs.

1388
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:48,931
So we're going to design games that only need 30 devs.

1389
00:59:49,371 --> 00:59:51,752
Now just look at the website, they have 51 devs right now.

1390
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:56,075
So I think, what I suspect is they're pushing up against that 60 number.

1391
00:59:56,215 --> 00:59:58,997
They don't want to, they don't, they don't want a place where they want to have those

1392
00:59:59,057 --> 00:59:59,557
two layers.

1393
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:04,002
And we're up to 105, I'm not really seeing

1394
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:05,484
too many more barriers right now,

1395
01:00:05,544 --> 01:00:06,585
but I'll tell you this, once you reach 150,

1396
01:00:06,886 --> 01:00:08,488
and I've seen this again and again,

1397
01:00:08,528 --> 01:00:10,931
you hit Dunbar's number, this is an innate human thing,

1398
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:12,072
you can read all about it,

1399
01:00:12,253 --> 01:00:13,895
and your organization will split in two.

1400
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:15,957
It's just what happens with human primates.

1401
01:00:16,903 --> 01:00:18,544
Now, when should you get business development?

1402
01:00:18,564 --> 01:00:19,844
When should you get marketing?

1403
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,305
I can't give you guidelines on that.

1404
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:22,866
Some people start with it at day one.

1405
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,827
Some people don't need to start with it till later.

1406
01:00:25,607 --> 01:00:26,728
But you're gonna need it sometime,

1407
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:27,608
so you better figure that out.

1408
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:29,570
Okay, back to the plan.

1409
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:31,671
You built a studio, you protected the studio,

1410
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:34,792
and now you're focusing a lot on optimizing the studio.

1411
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:36,893
But you're still a little bit sad,

1412
01:00:36,993 --> 01:00:40,735
because I didn't really wanna think about people all day.

1413
01:00:40,755 --> 01:00:42,276
I wanna think about games.

1414
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:43,917
That's why I did this.

1415
01:00:43,997 --> 01:00:45,338
I wanna think about games all day.

1416
01:00:46,287 --> 01:00:47,287
And I'll give you a secret.

1417
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:50,430
The studio is a game.

1418
01:00:54,673 --> 01:00:56,374
And the people who work there are the players.

1419
01:00:57,795 --> 01:01:00,157
And everything you know about game design,

1420
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,859
you can use to make that studio great.

1421
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,382
And if you do that, you're going to make

1422
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:12,806
a studio that doesn't just make games

1423
01:01:12,906 --> 01:01:14,707
and doesn't just make money, but is

1424
01:01:14,727 --> 01:01:15,708
going to create joy.

1425
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:20,020
for every single person who interacts with it at all.

1426
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:23,604
And it's going to be the hardest damn game

1427
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:25,727
that you have ever worked on.

1428
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:29,592
But I'm here to tell you, you can do it.

1429
01:01:30,874 --> 01:01:31,455
Thanks very much.

1430
01:01:46,534 --> 01:01:47,919
It looks like I use up all the time.

1431
01:01:47,979 --> 01:01:49,625
I'm happy to chat with people afterwards.

1432
01:01:49,745 --> 01:01:52,153
Please don't forget to fill out your surveys

1433
01:01:52,214 --> 01:01:52,836
and have a great GDC.
