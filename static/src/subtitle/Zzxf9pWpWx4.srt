1
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:11,233
You have a cool idea for a video game.

2
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,775
It's been a while since you've been this excited

3
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:14,616
about a project.

4
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:17,038
Ideas seem to flow out to you readily

5
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:18,559
and you start to craft them.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,222
Working on this game has been a lot easier

7
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:22,283
than the last project.

8
00:00:23,243 --> 00:00:24,725
You work on it for a while,

9
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,046
happy with the progress you're making,

10
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:29,409
but then you start to hit some bugs and some issues.

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,392
It's okay, persevere, no problem.

12
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:37,856
You do this for a while longer, but you slowly hit more bugs, more problems.

13
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,777
It's getting harder to keep pushing through them.

14
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:44,859
But when you start to notice, you could have done things a little bit better.

15
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:48,400
Now you're going back to go fix those problems,

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,721
but you're uncovering more bugs and more problems.

17
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:54,442
Now you're trying to find that motivation,

18
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:58,004
trying to rekindle that fire that push you to work on the project

19
00:00:58,044 --> 00:00:58,724
in the first place.

20
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:02,926
You sit there as your mind starts to wander.

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,936
And then suddenly, you have a cool idea for a video game.

22
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,765
Hi, my name is Charles McGregor, and I'm the founder and sole

23
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:14,788
developer at Tribe Games.

24
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:17,533
And I personally have been stuck in this loop before.

25
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:24,136
It feels like you aren't making any progress on any of your projects or your skills.

26
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:26,198
And you're basically you're in a rut.

27
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,064
I want to tell you about my story of starting out in that cycle

28
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:35,828
and then how I had a turning point that helped launch my career.

29
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,153
And what that led to, and hopefully this can help you make that leap.

30
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:42,194
But.

31
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:47,279
Before I even start, I do want to say that there is nothing wrong

32
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,942
with wanting to just be a hobbyist developer or a hobbyist at anything in life.

33
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:56,545
You don't always have to try and make a living off of everything that you do.

34
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:02,769
And if doing doing things just for you is valid,

35
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,632
you don't have to continue to try and pursue

36
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:09,974
some type of financial gain out of this and such.

37
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:12,796
So I encourage you to keep doing that if that is your goal.

38
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:20,847
This talk is for those that feel stuck in a cycle of starting new projects,

39
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,671
for those who want to make the jump from being a hobbyist to a professional,

40
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,393
and even for those

41
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,375
who want to switch things up.

42
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:32,037
So this is still for you.

43
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,261
But for me, when I first started out, I had the goal of

44
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:41,024
I already had the goal of doing it professionally when I was like

45
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:42,646
eight or nine years old, I.

46
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:48,737
I read an article in a Time magazine about a young girl who started her own bakery business.

47
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,100
And she was around my age at the time.

48
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:57,704
I didn't realize that you could do something at such a young age.

49
00:02:58,185 --> 00:03:02,428
So I wanted to do that, but I knew I wanted to do that with something that I loved.

50
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:08,253
So I approached my dad and asked him, how do you make video games?

51
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:16,429
My dad is a computer scientist, so he sat me down and taught me how to code and do the fundamentals.

52
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:23,414
He bought me some software called Dark Basic. Yes, that is as terrifying of a box as you

53
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:29,478
might have thought even back then. But he taught me how to do programming

54
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:32,100
in such in all the basics that he knew.

55
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:41,338
And it was super cool that there is a thing that specialized in programming video games.

56
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:48,783
Bear in mind, I didn't know what a game engine was back then, but I was just so excited to

57
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:52,585
keep on working on or work on video games in general.

58
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,832
He also bought me a 700 page book on Dark Basic

59
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,453
that I attempted to read all of.

60
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:04,175
I would stay in bed when I was supposed to be

61
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:08,036
when I was supposed to be asleep and try and read through all of the different

62
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:10,517
chapters. I never ended up doing that.

63
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:16,180
But I was I was really excited about learning

64
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,462
and working towards the goal of making games for a living.

65
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:26,415
As I was learning Dark Basic, I was reading the dedicated forms online

66
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:31,420
where I found out that about Dark Basic Professional.

67
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:36,045
And I was thinking back then, oh, if I had a professional version

68
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:38,987
of this software, then I would make better games.

69
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:43,854
So I pleaded with my dad to see if we can make the upgrade.

70
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:49,717
And I'm extremely fortunate to have like super supportive parents that I believe

71
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:54,399
believed in me when I was really going full bore into

72
00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:00,341
into learning how to do development and all of the the crazy hobbies that I work on.

73
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:03,963
So he got the upgrade and I.

74
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:13,415
And I quickly learned that that did not help me in terms of trying to figure out how to make video games.

75
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:24,006
A quick aside, upgrading to get the pro version of something should not be your first concern when you are starting out.

76
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:29,372
I had started out making small projects, but I never actually finished anything.

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,063
I would get to a point where I had some technical problem or lose motivation working on a game.

78
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,187
I would work on, I would start working on a game.

79
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:45,660
get a ways in, but then find that,

80
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,963
oh, there's something that I could have done better or something

81
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:53,126
that has taken my interest elsewhere.

82
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,369
And then I wouldn't actually complete the video of the video game

83
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,451
that I was trying to do, because finishing a game

84
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:03,474
seemed like a task that would always take years to complete.

85
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:08,318
When I became discouraged, I would factor that in

86
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,780
and then be the move on to another project.

87
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:16,644
And when I did move on, I felt like I've always,

88
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:18,604
or I needed to work on something harder

89
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:20,725
because it needs to move,

90
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:23,466
or because I felt like I needed to move forward

91
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:25,406
in developing my skills.

92
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,988
So I started to work on a game called Emerald,

93
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:33,529
which was initially small, but I started working,

94
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,610
which was initially small for a while.

95
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,751
But then I started working on another game with my friends.

96
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:41,132
Unfortunately.

97
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:42,697
That game petered out.

98
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:46,200
And then I attempted to go back to the first game,

99
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:50,063
but I lost the drive and motivation to work on that

100
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:54,186
because I was hitting technical problems and I didn't want to work on old,

101
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:55,947
old code.

102
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:01,811
But I knew I I knew I could have done things better,

103
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:03,152
so I didn't want to go back.

104
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:07,595
So the list of games that I didn't finish and grew and grew.

105
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:10,657
Eventually, I made the switch over to Unity.

106
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,174
seeing that I would be able to make games for multiple platforms,

107
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:24,457
where I would be able to, and I had what I consider one of my most productive summers,

108
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:31,360
where I learned Unity, I learned 3D modeling, I learned Blender, I learned more about music

109
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,161
production, I started working on a new game.

110
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,111
And I was extremely excited.

111
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:42,775
I was I was really into the process of learning new things.

112
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,617
But with all of that.

113
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,920
I still didn't finish again.

114
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:55,305
I was getting frustrated as I was not finishing games that I started,

115
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:57,306
and this went on for years and years.

116
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:03,225
This started out since I learned about Dark Basic

117
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:07,387
back when I was a kid in the middle of high school,

118
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:11,270
still trying to figure out how to finish games.

119
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:15,733
As I was learning more and more about Unity

120
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:18,375
and starting and stopping projects, of course,

121
00:08:19,496 --> 00:08:22,898
I came across a Unity forum post that told me about,

122
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,901
told a story and the post was called

123
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:30,178
The answer to every, can it be done,

124
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:32,220
and I've lost my way post.

125
00:08:34,922 --> 00:08:38,365
The post starts out with a more whimsical take

126
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:39,746
on what I led the talk out with.

127
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,649
The journey of someone who followed the sound

128
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,651
of an ambitious project right away.

129
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:49,615
How it led them astray and losing that drive

130
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,656
to keep working on that project.

131
00:08:53,098 --> 00:09:01,181
After that anecdote, the post goes on to talk about how the poster's wife said that he has

132
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:06,263
been messing around with this prototype that he's been working on for too long.

133
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:12,206
And he needs to finish whatever he was working on.

134
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:21,090
After getting a bit defensive, his wife replied, build something in six weeks, anything at all.

135
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:23,766
so long as you finish it.

136
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:27,950
Knowing he couldn't finish it in six weeks,

137
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,171
he said, give me eight weeks.

138
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:30,812
It took him nine.

139
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:33,915
He shipped the product out,

140
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,457
admits it wasn't the greatest,

141
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:39,540
but it was finished and for the world to see.

142
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:42,961
It flipped a switch.

143
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:45,923
He started to actually finish projects.

144
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:51,226
And in and in the four years preceding, he had released nine products

145
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:55,248
out on three different platforms, along with a slew of other

146
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,290
great accomplishments and personal achievements.

147
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:05,254
I totally wanted that after hearing that I wanted to be able to finish games,

148
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:06,795
I was like, Oh, that sounds amazing.

149
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,997
But the problem is that I heard all of that before.

150
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:17,660
I heard you need to start small or don't work on an MMORPG as your first project.

151
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:22,326
The problem is that I thought I was following those guidelines already.

152
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:30,494
Instead of doing the 3D hack and slash idea that I had wanted to make, I started out and

153
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,977
lowered my scope to a 2D Frogger game.

154
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:34,942
which is smaller.

155
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:37,684
But after initially paring down the size,

156
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:42,107
I let my mind wander to more and more things

157
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:42,968
to add to the game.

158
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:45,250
Add in multiplayer.

159
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,912
Add in an in-game level editor.

160
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:52,195
There was some arbitrary limit that I thought of

161
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:54,877
that needed, oh yeah, we need more environments.

162
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:57,319
Actually, we need two more environments.

163
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,903
Let's add characters and add a story behind it.

164
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,071
Ah, but you know what else we also need?

165
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,653
We need to update all the art.

166
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:12,916
And then we should also add some more environments,

167
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,978
because clearly there's not enough environments.

168
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:20,301
It's not actually a game yet if there are not enough environments.

169
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:24,824
And then I and then the the crowning achievement is

170
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:29,347
instead of working on what I already had, let's make bigger levels.

171
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:37,009
Now, the list goes on and on of things that I started adding and adding and adding to the game.

172
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:44,394
But. I, I was never stopping in adding new features.

173
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:53,960
The post hit me because I was him, I toiled away on a game for a while, but then I didn't finish it.

174
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:56,959
I kept going and I didn't know when to stop.

175
00:11:57,619 --> 00:12:00,601
Or I didn't know when to stop adding features.

176
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:10,086
Or the game was already too big in some of the earlier versions of games that I started.

177
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,708
But that post came at a great time.

178
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:21,677
I had the opportunity to make a small game for a school club fair

179
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:25,338
that we were trying to showcase our work at the catch.

180
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,739
I had two days to finish it.

181
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,560
Perfect. The game had to be complete.

182
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,560
It had a deadline.

183
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,561
So I started to get working on it.

184
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:39,862
The work the game needed to be flashy and easy to pick up and play,

185
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:44,283
but it ultimately needed be finished in two days.

186
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:50,569
So I was inspired by one of my favorite arcade games, Geometry Wars,

187
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:53,830
and I started work on glitching the system.

188
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,031
It was rough, but it was completed.

189
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:02,013
And I showed it off at the event and it went amazingly.

190
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:07,115
Sure, there were some bugs and it wasn't the most balanced game out there,

191
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:10,877
but there was something that was actually finished.

192
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:13,858
And from after that event, I said, OK.

193
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:17,636
I'm going to polish what I already have.

194
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:21,498
I'm gonna release it and I have two weeks.

195
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm giving myself a two week limit.

196
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,543
So I started working and polishing

197
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:29,164
and I said I had two weeks.

198
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:31,045
It took two months.

199
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:37,129
I wanted to make sure that I didn't add in new features

200
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,552
but I still added in some new features.

201
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:44,114
I did add in a new enemy and I added in some power ups.

202
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:48,568
But for the majority of that, I was only adding in polish.

203
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:54,313
And discovering that adding in polish took that much time

204
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:57,796
really helped put things in perspective.

205
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:03,881
And about eight weeks later, I finished.

206
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:05,223
I was done.

207
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:09,367
I remember when I put in the last line of code.

208
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,268
I remember when I used that 3D modeling experience

209
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:16,488
that I learned that one summer to help make the trailer.

210
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,309
I remember sitting there after releasing

211
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:25,110
the game on my website, thinking to myself, I did it.

212
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,831
It was a surreal experience, because I've never

213
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:33,092
gotten to that point where I got to the point

214
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:35,913
where I could say that, hey, I actually finished.

215
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:40,723
And with this, the floodgates opened.

216
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:46,550
Glitch in the system opened up so many doors

217
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,994
that I didn't want to take them for granted.

218
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:55,146
I had the opportunity to port the game to a mobile RIP Windows phone.

219
00:14:56,266 --> 00:15:00,127
I was able to get my first paid gig because of it.

220
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:04,007
I was able to do some of my first public talks

221
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,048
because of because of glitch in the system.

222
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:09,928
I won my first award because of a game that I made,

223
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:13,489
which is absolutely insane.

224
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,870
And I can't believe that that's the case.

225
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,862
So with that, I was able to keep that momentum.

226
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:29,105
I started to understand what it what went into finishing a game

227
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,726
because I now had experience of doing it.

228
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:33,967
Sure, it was a small game.

229
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,690
But the ending to development was no longer a hazy area.

230
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,812
It no longer was, oh, this automatically takes years and years

231
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,212
because it's a video game.

232
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:50,334
So I was able to start working on projects that were much more reasonable in scope.

233
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:54,295
And I understood what caused my games to blow.

234
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,696
I better understood what caused my games as well.

235
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:02,638
Adding new features every week would tend to do that.

236
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,801
So, yeah, I didn't want to jump into any bigger project

237
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:11,281
than glitching the system right away.

238
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:16,147
I wanted to continue learning from smaller projects and smaller game jams.

239
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:18,748
Smaller projects

240
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:22,409
went where that's where I learned about game jams,

241
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:26,150
where you have a set amount of time to finish games.

242
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,152
This helped me make more progress in learning and growing as a developer.

243
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:37,334
I was able to do my first my first contract job.

244
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,472
because of glitch in the system, as I mentioned.

245
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,813
I was able to work on my first VR experience

246
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:47,694
with the Minnesota Orchestra,

247
00:16:48,095 --> 00:16:50,516
which is insane to think about.

248
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:53,877
I did my first game jam with friends,

249
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:58,199
where I was able to experience in a short amount of time

250
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:00,379
the creation of a polished,

251
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,101
what I consider a polished experience.

252
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,971
And then on top of that,

253
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:10,512
I also worked on my own solo game jam.

254
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:14,153
So I continued down this path,

255
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,293
working on more smaller games

256
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,754
that helped me get better and better.

257
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:21,894
And now all the games that I've worked on

258
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,515
from then on out did see the finish line.

259
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:30,756
And you know, it's okay if you don't finish some games.

260
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:33,376
But it became less about

261
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:42,272
about me running out of steam on those ideas, on those games, but it's more on, oh, these

262
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:43,953
ideas are not working out.

263
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:52,600
So after doing this about two years, I had about eight projects finished of varying sizes,

264
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,563
which is a stark contrast to what I had done before.

265
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,222
So this ultimately led me to my biggest solo project

266
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:05,363
I had taken on.

267
00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:08,424
A project that was born out of similar constraints

268
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:10,866
from my first completed game.

269
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,847
I had four days to complete a game

270
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:15,928
that was going to present to a class

271
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,950
that had nothing to do with video games.

272
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:22,612
This led me to start work on HyperDot.

273
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:26,454
I applied what I learned from all the other projects

274
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:29,336
that I had worked on from before.

275
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:34,166
And I scoped it to what I thought would be reasonable

276
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:38,870
after showcasing or after doing the presentation

277
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,391
for that four days.

278
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,913
I'd scoped it to what I thought would be reasonable

279
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:45,835
to be done in about six months total.

280
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:48,757
It took nearly four years.

281
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:54,742
So yeah, it doesn't always work out perfectly every time.

282
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,272
But I still ended up finishing the game.

283
00:18:57,792 --> 00:19:00,073
I was able to practice what I've learned

284
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:03,734
from previous projects, and I limited my scope early.

285
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:07,295
And I had clear goals.

286
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:11,236
And even though I fell into some of the same trappings

287
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:13,737
as a project like my first project,

288
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:17,678
the difference was that I had much more experience

289
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:23,473
dealing with each part of the game so I could figure out the size

290
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:26,434
of the endeavors that I'm going into.

291
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:30,255
So, yes, HyperDot also has

292
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:32,936
multiple environments.

293
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:37,898
It also has more mechanics, adding in an in-game level editor.

294
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,359
But I was more comfortable comfortable working on those

295
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:44,981
because I was able to experience them from previous projects

296
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:47,642
or my past finished games.

297
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:57,823
So with that, in the end, I was able to actually make a game that I was immensely proud of.

298
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:05,451
A game that I stayed true to the original design pillars of. A game that I finished. HyperDot was

299
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:10,137
partially made so I could prove to myself that I could finish a game that was bigger

300
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,138
than Glitch in the System.

301
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:15,445
that I could express myself through mechanics, design,

302
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,326
music, and art of a game.

303
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:21,289
But HyperDot became much more than just the game.

304
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:27,734
HyperDot, I hold HyperDot so close to my heart

305
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,616
because I was able to fulfill those childhood dreams

306
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:32,137
that I had all those years ago.

307
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,180
I was able to do things that I only seen

308
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,222
on a TV or a computer screen.

309
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,363
I was able to meet people that I followed for years.

310
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,745
I'm able to do this very talk,

311
00:20:46,307 --> 00:20:48,829
and I was able to finish a game,

312
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:51,751
point to it and say, I made that.

313
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:54,533
And I'm really proud of that.

314
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:01,839
OK, so you're probably tired of hearing me wax

315
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:04,481
poetics about my story and whatnot.

316
00:21:05,242 --> 00:21:06,443
So with all that said.

317
00:21:07,522 --> 00:21:09,303
What can we take away with all of this?

318
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:14,145
When you feel like you are getting nowhere in your projects

319
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,406
or you're restarting all the time,

320
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:18,767
when you feel like you aren't making progress

321
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:21,248
and getting better at development,

322
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:26,950
when you want to take the next step, try to finish a game.

323
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:30,812
It doesn't matter how small you think that idea is.

324
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:34,173
Go through the process of releasing a game.

325
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:40,200
And when I say releasing, releasing doesn't only mean put it on the store.

326
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,543
It could mean that, but it also can mean just post it on a form or share

327
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,823
it with your friends and family.

328
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:52,565
It doesn't always have to be publicly available to everyone.

329
00:21:53,746 --> 00:22:00,989
Just go through the process so then you can better understand the scope of all

330
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,450
of the things that you're trying to do.

331
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,404
for future games.

332
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:11,389
And I know that you have probably heard this advice before,

333
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:14,732
because I heard it before before that forum post,

334
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:17,534
which is try making a small game.

335
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:22,358
But sometimes it's hard to figure out how small you should make it.

336
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:28,182
So. Try putting a time limit on the developments.

337
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:32,726
Try putting a time limit on the development and add a stopping point

338
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:33,847
after two months.

339
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,769
or one month, or even one week.

340
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,953
Try making a game that you can finish in that time,

341
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:45,497
include releasing and whatever releasing means to you.

342
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,558
Try doing a game jam that would add a lower pressure.

343
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,940
So you have 48 hours to make it.

344
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,262
And because it's only 48 hours, it doesn't have to be

345
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,543
the greatest thing since indoor plumbing.

346
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:03,846
It can be what it can be, what it is for the 48 hours.

347
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:06,067
It can be creative or expressive.

348
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,108
But as long as you try and finish the game.

349
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,052
And I know that you really want to work on that dream project of yours.

350
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,848
that idea that seems a little bit too big,

351
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:24,050
or just it seems like, oh, this is

352
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,450
the thing that is motivating me to work on the game.

353
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:32,012
Try, before you do, work on that.

354
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:33,432
Hold on to that idea.

355
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:38,633
And try and make a smaller game, multiple smaller games,

356
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:41,454
that can teach you how to work on that big game.

357
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,669
Try pulling out that cool art style that you're thinking of,

358
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,136
and then work on an experiment or a prototype

359
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:50,739
or even a finished game.

360
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:51,974
on doing that.

361
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:55,996
Try pulling out that mechanic or that the sweet audio ideas

362
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:59,938
that you have and do those on separate projects.

363
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:03,519
That way, when you do go back to that big idea,

364
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:08,041
it's more refined because you have that idea of what

365
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:12,322
you have a better idea of how this entire game will be scoped out.

366
00:24:13,763 --> 00:24:14,803
Because think of it this way.

367
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:20,067
Think of the first time that you did something

368
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:21,748
that you do regularly now.

369
00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:24,869
Think of the first time that you played a game

370
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,890
or you drew a doodle or played an instrument or ran a race.

371
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:33,232
Then compare that first time to where you are now.

372
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,713
To see how far you have come,

373
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:42,115
apply that to apply where you've,

374
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,696
the growth that you had in that hobby

375
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:45,676
or that.

376
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:50,500
that thing that you're trying to compare to.

377
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:55,002
And then see where that you can

378
00:24:55,162 --> 00:25:00,044
apply that to your dream game.

379
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:02,145
The big game will still be there.

380
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:06,646
But if you had all that experience doing those smaller things

381
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:10,408
the big game will be better and better in quality because of

382
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:10,988
how

383
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,124
you build on all of your information and knowledge from those small games.

384
00:25:18,705 --> 00:25:20,307
Which lands on the last point

385
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:24,571
that I will mention is that it's OK,

386
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:29,795
not being it's OK for whatever you make to not be the greatest thing.

387
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:34,520
I will admit glitch in the system wasn't the greatest thing ever,

388
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,262
but it was fun, but it wasn't the greatest thing ever.

389
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:43,256
But I learned from my process of making Glitch in the System.

390
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,718
And you can learn from your process

391
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:47,799
of making whatever project that you're working on

392
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,660
so that next time you can be back.

393
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:56,685
Now, none of these things that I've mentioned are guarantees.

394
00:25:57,565 --> 00:25:59,907
Some of these things may work for you.

395
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:00,787
Some won't.

396
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:03,149
Some, maybe none will.

397
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,851
But I hope that at least this starts you

398
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:07,812
in the right direction.

399
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:16,598
My goal is for the my goal for this talk is for this to be someone's forum post.

400
00:26:17,938 --> 00:26:22,239
For this to be something where you've heard this at the right time,

401
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:25,720
when I heard that advice, when I saw that forum post.

402
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,521
I I already heard that advice before I got what that advice meant,

403
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:37,663
but I didn't understand and internalize what it meant until that moment.

404
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:41,409
So you may have already heard this advice before,

405
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,812
but I hope that someone hears this just at the right time

406
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:49,134
so that they can make their jump and their leap.

407
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,916
All right, and with that,

408
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:57,859
thank you so much for listening to me ramble on and on.

409
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:01,060
You can follow me on Twitter,

410
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:02,942

411
00:27:03,082 --> 00:27:07,244
at DarkAceTG to keep up with whatever I'm doing.

412
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:12,093
And thank you so much for taking the time to hear my story.

413
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:14,879
And I hope that this talk helps you in some way.
