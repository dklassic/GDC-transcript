1
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:11,531
Hi everybody. My name is Paul Rabicki and today I'm here to talk about,

2
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:15,672
uh, it's kind of a bullshit title. Um,

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,552
so who knows what this is?

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,313
Who knows what the pink line represents? Okay.

5
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:27,834
Think about how much information you just grokked in like two or three seconds.

6
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:32,915
So wouldn't it be great if we could do something like this?

7
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,451
for our UX designs.

8
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:40,514
So maybe I think this is more what I'm gonna talk about.

9
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:46,397
But before I talk about sort of methodologies

10
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:50,538
and techniques, I just wanna set a shared context

11
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:53,300
of what UX design is, at least to me,

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,180
for the purposes of this talk.

13
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:59,791
So we sort of have the four tentpoles of game design,

14
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,051
product development.

15
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:04,993
And we have some levels of proficiency and understanding

16
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:05,514
within that.

17
00:01:07,254 --> 00:01:10,816
And I think every discipline would put themselves

18
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:11,476
in the center of this.

19
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:12,777
I totally get that.

20
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:15,178
We have a mixed crowd here today.

21
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,539
Everybody belongs there.

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,680
But here's my pitch.

23
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:21,341
The reason why I think UX sits here

24
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,762
is because we're all in the same room.

25
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:31,841
We as UX designers take the goals of all of these other disciplines and synthesize that

26
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,323
for the player experience.

27
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:40,690
And we're doing that separate from UI, which more sits over here.

28
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,964
So this is my blob.

29
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,987
I've done most jobs in the product development lifecycle.

30
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:50,708
I started in QA.

31
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:52,649
I've been a producer.

32
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:56,091
I wrote some really simple Flash games for set-top boxes.

33
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:59,694
But for the past several years, I've been doing UX.

34
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,075
And I love how.

35
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,355
where our discipline sits at the moment.

36
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:09,297
I sort of say every UX designer has a major and a minor.

37
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:11,958
So we all do UX design,

38
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:14,699
but we come from a variety of different backgrounds.

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,681
And we have a variety of different interests

40
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,821
along this axis.

41
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:20,062
So.

42
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:25,284
This is my UI design partner on my most recent project.

43
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:27,384
And there's hella overlap there.

44
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:28,444
Yes, I get that.

45
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:29,685
I think that's good.

46
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:33,526
I think that should not be something to be afraid of.

47
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:39,447
Specifically, game design also generally tends to overlap UX.

48
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:44,988
There's a lot of room to grow in here.

49
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:52,268
And this is the blobs of all of the UX designers at Maxis.

50
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,251
And the key, I think, for successful teams

51
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:02,014
is putting together blobs that are aware

52
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:05,236
of each other's overlap and don't fight that,

53
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:09,098
but seek to grow in interesting and new directions.

54
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:13,065
So, what's your blob look like?

55
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,448
Your team, the person whose job and role

56
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,249
you wanna grow into.

57
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,733
And today, I'm hoping that here, what I share with you

58
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,655
allows you to grow your UX design blobs.

59
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:32,020
With that, what exactly does UX do?

60
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:35,964
Most people think of this, but...

61
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:40,521
for a successful product development pipeline,

62
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:43,384
I think there's several steps before this.

63
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:45,887
And I'm talking through this in the context today

64
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:48,329
of starting on a new project or with a new team

65
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:49,831
and building from the ground up.

66
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,675
For me, wireframes are like halfway through.

67
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:56,078
So let's jump back to the foundation.

68
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:57,900
Research.

69
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:03,641
So certainly read all the specs and various documentation,

70
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,264
but also interview all of the leadership

71
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:08,487
and the key stakeholders on your project,

72
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:12,271
and find out, I heard this talked about earlier today,

73
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:15,254
find out what everybody's goals are on the project

74
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:17,196
so you know not just where the project is,

75
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:19,278
but where you want to get to

76
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:20,760
and where everybody else wants to get to.

77
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:25,335
And I want to talk about that third one, deconstructs.

78
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:27,956
I'm on the mobile side.

79
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:30,937
We're doing deconstructs all the time.

80
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:36,078
And I think everybody does this, but a lot of times you'll

81
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:41,719
play a game for a week or two, lunch breaks, evenings, and

82
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,959
take a bunch of screenshots, and that stuff sits on a

83
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:45,960
shared drive somewhere.

84
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,220
And that's cool.

85
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,401
You can refer to it later when you need to talk about it.

86
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:55,303
But I would propose take the half hour and just throw that

87
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:56,723
thing into Illustrator or Sketch.

88
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:01,185
And all you're doing is laying things out horizontally along

89
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,726
the axis of time, and then vertically for states.

90
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:10,208
And what this does is when you output this, and the key is to

91
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:13,129
make sure this gets output and set up on the wiki or

92
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,170
someplace visible, this creates a.

93
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:20,226
durable, tangible output to your research time.

94
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,949
And that's one thing that I think a lot of times,

95
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,510
at least for designers,

96
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:27,112
because we're doing this all the time,

97
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:32,177
but it can be tricky to get leadership to give you time

98
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:35,020
to do deeper research, and by creating an output,

99
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:36,902
that can help in that process.

100
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:41,859
So audience for this is yourself as a UX designer,

101
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,459
but also design and PM.

102
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:49,121
I've actually talked to the core PM team at Maxis

103
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,702
to sort of start doing things or deconstructs this way

104
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:55,464
to make things usable and accessible to other team members.

105
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,625
So once you have done your research,

106
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:04,027
let's talk about information architecture,

107
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:06,168
but maybe in a slightly different way.

108
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:11,017
I would phrase, there's sort of two steps here,

109
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:14,959
that you're basically thinking about the player journey

110
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,980
through your feature, through your game,

111
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,060
depends what scope and scale you're talking here.

112
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,642
But you're basically just looking at the decisions

113
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:23,883
that the player would make.

114
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:28,092
and do one per box, and then think of all the supporting information that you'd need for that.

115
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:33,394
And this is a great way to get yourself in the mindset of a player

116
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,515
based on just the player experience.

117
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:40,795
You're not thinking about monetization, you're not thinking about any of the other stuff at this point.

118
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:45,896
And this also maps really nicely to that research piece.

119
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:49,437
If you're doing deconstructs, being able to reverse engineer those screens

120
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:54,058
and think about what the player was being asked to decide and why they were being asked to decide it.

121
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:59,626
So time on this is, you know, half hour to a couple hours.

122
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:01,647
It's all done in text and boxes.

123
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:03,568
I work in Illustrator or Sketch,

124
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,548
but you can do this in any number of ways.

125
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:08,050
And the idea is something super cheap and easy

126
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,050
just to get this out of your head

127
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:14,072
and be able to put it in front of other people,

128
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,773
like your design partners, and say,

129
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:17,574
hey, is this like, you know,

130
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:19,114
is this sort of what we're thinking

131
00:07:19,374 --> 00:07:21,115
the player's gonna be going through?

132
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:26,099
It's a good quick way to sort of value check that.

133
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:30,463
On projects we've done this on whiteboards,

134
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,424
we've done this with note cards.

135
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:36,067
There's any number of ways to do this super cheap and easy.

136
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:40,371
And the benefit here is it sort of forces you to think

137
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:43,954
through the actual step-by-step portion

138
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,096
without getting into full wireframes.

139
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:49,438
So, you know, quarter day, half day.

140
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:54,474
But once you've done that, you need to do a second pass.

141
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:56,635
I call these box wires.

142
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:59,117
A lot of game designers will do this as part of design specs.

143
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:05,042
And what you're going for here is just like information areas.

144
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:06,283
Circle, square, triangle.

145
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:09,806
It would be nice, because we're all professionals,

146
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:12,908
that your rectangles are, in fact, button-sized,

147
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:15,230
44 points, fonts, things like that.

148
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,433
But it's just a quick way to sort of take that.

149
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:27,218
text and color it in and get a sense of is the information,

150
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:30,759
the information order and the information priority

151
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,600
making sense from screen to screen.

152
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:36,581
Again, time for something like this,

153
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:41,383
half day to maybe two days if you're doing something big.

154
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:45,925
And the audience for this is yourself

155
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:49,086
and your game designers, PMs as well.

156
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,061
I think that's as far as you want to take this,

157
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:55,182
because it's sort of a value check

158
00:08:55,562 --> 00:08:56,703
if you're headed in the right direction.

159
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:59,744
But it depends on the team and studio

160
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:01,945
as to how much you can show this to other disciplines,

161
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:04,666
how much you can ask creative leadership

162
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:06,127
if this is the right direction.

163
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,349
So once you have sort of a quick base idea,

164
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,850
that flow that you designed,

165
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,633
because designers, we always sort of start in the middle

166
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,595
and then we work our way to the beginning and the end,

167
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:22,538
was probably not the first time player experience.

168
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,581
So I call that first, second, loss, and boss.

169
00:09:27,422 --> 00:09:28,523
It's the first time through,

170
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:31,025
because all you're doing is taking your file

171
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:32,746
and just option dragging everything out,

172
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:34,267
pulling stuff out, putting stuff in.

173
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,609
And then you think about, okay,

174
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,351
first time through, second time through,

175
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:42,234
but what about when the player actually lost a session,

176
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:42,654
a level?

177
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:47,618
And then what about if there was a boss

178
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:48,799
or a special win condition?

179
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,061
And those are sort of the four states

180
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:54,484
that seem to catch the most of these little

181
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:57,027
UI changes, UX changes.

182
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:01,751
And by iterating on all these steps,

183
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,573
you wind up with sort of a core flow there

184
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:07,096
that's pretty well vetted against these other states.

185
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:08,637
Now.

186
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:11,805
I don't think there's an output piece for this,

187
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,486
because it's really just sort of a workpiece

188
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,448
for us as designers.

189
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:21,191
But I will say, take those box wires

190
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:24,113
and put it into a map.

191
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,474
Time is horizontal, states are vertical.

192
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:30,216
Looks maybe very much like the research piece.

193
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:32,578
But the idea here is that

194
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:38,238
For this format, especially when shared

195
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:40,859
with other team members in a discussion setting,

196
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:46,641
it really allows people to just sort of focus

197
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:48,021
on whatever they wanna look at.

198
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:49,702
Engineering will be looking at something different

199
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,943
from product, or you might be having a discussion

200
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:53,883
about a particular feature.

201
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,092
But the key to making this thing useful is it can't be

202
00:10:58,392 --> 00:10:59,112
in a digital form.

203
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,214
So something that we do is we actually print

204
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:03,435
these out on a plotter.

205
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:06,657
If you work at a big company, they exist.

206
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:07,817
You can print to them.

207
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:10,179
Just don't print on the glossy stuff, because that's like $100

208
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:13,300
a roll. Print on the cheap stuff, it's like $30 a roll.

209
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,862
We actually buy our own paper so that Undyne doesn't yell

210
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:17,623
at us in Maxis.

211
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:24,238
We use it for all sorts of discussions around the product development process.

212
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:29,802
It's really, really great when an engineer has a question on something

213
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:33,224
and you'll be like, wait a second,

214
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:35,246
I don't know if that's really the product direction we want to go.

215
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:38,468
You can grab somebody else, you can throw a couple people into a conversation,

216
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:43,111
and you can short circuit those, oh, I thought you meant conversations

217
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:45,333
that lose like a half day here and a half day there

218
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:47,294
and make your game like two weeks late.

219
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,120
mobile time frame.

220
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:57,085
And that, I think, is sort of the key to this type of

221
00:11:57,505 --> 00:11:58,225
design deliverable.

222
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:05,250
So at this point, we're sort of halfway through.

223
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,291
We have a good overview understanding.

224
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:12,314
But let's talk about the actual details.

225
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:13,435
Holy shit.

226
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:14,616
Detailed wireframes.

227
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:15,576
Finally there.

228
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:16,397
OK.

229
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,421
Now when you're designing your wireframes,

230
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:22,162
you're designing from a position of understanding

231
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:25,664
what the player journey is, what the various states are,

232
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:29,166
and you can actually spend the time

233
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:33,529
to get your visual language set.

234
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:37,511
Again, I don't think I need to sort of belabor this point,

235
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:40,232
but UX is not UI.

236
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:43,234
It's maybe the foundation for UI, it's the framework,

237
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:51,243
Don't think that it adds anything to the UX deliverables

238
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:54,844
to set corner radius, to think about drop shadows,

239
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:57,405
those kind of things in wireframe.

240
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,326
It's similar to, it's a cousin to, but never the same.

241
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:07,589
And the key here is that each of these screens is numbered

242
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,049
and when you're, I'm just gonna go back.

243
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,031
When you're looking at something like this,

244
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:13,832
especially with distributed studios,

245
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:16,814
this is really, really great for having remote conversations

246
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:20,995
because you can be talking to different disciplines

247
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,636
in different studios and saying,

248
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,758
well, so at the windscreen on like 27,

249
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:30,700
does that go back to the main HUD on 13?

250
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,761
Like, no, no, no, but we also then need to do this power up

251
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:34,721
on screen 12.

252
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:37,763
Oh, okay, and then you're talking about

253
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:40,144
specific versions of those screens.

254
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:44,578
And that's where the flow can get messy or also be very clean.

255
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,079
Those misunderstandings can creep in.

256
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,342
So being able to reference your numbers, um,

257
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,064
also helps in later steps on documentation.

258
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:58,008
This also then allows you to check everything out on device.

259
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:04,073
Um, you're creating all of these files. I'm sure you're shocked by this.

260
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:05,074
Put it in a map.

261
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:08,253
take that box flow that you built,

262
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:11,935
and basically fill in with all of your detailed wireframes.

263
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:17,838
Again, by creating a durable output to this process,

264
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,819
you have something that other disciplines

265
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,841
can use and listen to, as well as speak to

266
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:25,361
and have that conversation.

267
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:27,122
It also gives you a nice little checklist

268
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:30,824
of all the stuff that you have to design by whatever date.

269
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:37,889
And don't tell anybody this, but I've used this in a DD situation where I'm saying,

270
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:41,772
okay, we have this number of screens to design, but we have this amount of time.

271
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:46,396
And when you have a visual record of this stuff and you can go over to the wall and just kind of point at stuff,

272
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:49,838
say, well, which ones, which, this is sort of part of the core.

273
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,860
I think we need to do these first and these second.

274
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,742
It becomes a very quick conversation to say, yes, we can do that.

275
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:57,984
Or actually this feature here, it's going to be a little more important.

276
00:14:59,606 --> 00:14:59,746
So.

277
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:04,170
At this point, you're talking a week, maybe two,

278
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,432
depending as to how complex your game is,

279
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:08,793
your feature is, if you're having to build

280
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:10,994
a wireframe toolkit from scratch.

281
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:12,495
So it's pretty heavyweight.

282
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:14,796
You really wanna know where you're going

283
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,017
before you get to this point.

284
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:19,740
And obviously, all of these screens can be pulled out

285
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,262
for one-pager specs and for the review and the buy-in process.

286
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,184
So I think this is more for a

287
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:31,336
team and product development process,

288
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:33,878
and less for reviews and pitching.

289
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,480
Although again, it depends on your creative leadership

290
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,001
and how willing they are to sort of like,

291
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:41,683
wander by and see what conversations are going on

292
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:42,404
and get involved.

293
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:44,045
Or maybe you don't want that.

294
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:48,427
In which case, you can position them on roly whiteboards

295
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:49,488
and you can turn them away.

296
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:51,690
But I never recommend doing that.

297
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:54,431
So.

298
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,816
There's a point where this physical deliverable,

299
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:05,599
this model, kind of reached its optimum efficiency.

300
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:11,421
And you really need to move into a new set of deliverables

301
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:11,962
at this point.

302
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:19,245
But look at how far we've come from sort of the research,

303
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,246
we've thought through the player journey,

304
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:25,588
we've done box flows, all that up to detailed wires.

305
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:31,653
without digging into individual pages in the specs,

306
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:36,499
where sometimes you can lose the continuity

307
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:40,484
from screen to screen or the redundancy of information.

308
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:44,208
You're able to see all of that in this overview format.

309
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,170
So.

310
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:48,141
Click mocks.

311
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,443
Again, very, very easy way to just sort of get something on

312
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:56,905
your device, be just tapping from screen to screen.

313
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:58,686
There's a billion tools for this kind of stuff.

314
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:02,127
But you already have all those wireframe screens.

315
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,168
You can hook stuff together like this pretty quickly.

316
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,130
This is really great for what we call Kleenex testing,

317
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:14,813
basically talking to people on other teams and getting a

318
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:16,453
directional review.

319
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,756
and sort of a directional sense of where your feature is.

320
00:17:22,617 --> 00:17:26,698
One thing that we've done on a small studio

321
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:30,300
that I think would be great to see in a large studio,

322
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,060
and we're still not quite there yet,

323
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,161
is we actually had everybody on the team

324
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,082
do these Kleenex sessions.

325
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,783
So we wrote a script,

326
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:43,714
And I gave them the click prototype.

327
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:46,275
I was like, okay, go find two people and interview them.

328
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:47,395
Talk to them about our game.

329
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:50,096
And the engineers were awesome.

330
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:51,677
They were game to try this.

331
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,838
Like, everybody went out and found somebody

332
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:56,459
and talked about our game to other people.

333
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,280
And it really helped.

334
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:03,158
not only gather data and have that conversation,

335
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:06,820
but everybody felt really involved

336
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,361
in the product development process

337
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:10,343
in a way that doesn't always happen

338
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:13,505
on larger, more sort of siloed teams.

339
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:16,927
So, I'm still trying to figure out

340
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:18,489
how to pull that off on a big team,

341
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:19,870
but we're getting there.

342
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:24,892
Audience for this is pretty much everybody.

343
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,652
You can show this to creative leadership.

344
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:28,872
You can even do this as a,

345
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:35,233
like a review for people who maybe aren't able to grok,

346
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:37,714
sort of the one-page spec format.

347
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:43,335
And showing things in motion is really where UX shines,

348
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:48,016
especially in terms of the internal order of appearance.

349
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,431
So, you know, UX is UI plus time, right?

350
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:56,312
It's those states in between the wireframes

351
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:58,913
that you've created that really is where your work

352
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:01,955
can be most valuable to the team and to the game.

353
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:09,138
Whether you do this in, you know, Flash or Flinto,

354
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:12,179
whatever it is, they can be very small mocks,

355
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,820
but they have to run on the device.

356
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,942
And all of this stuff can then wind up.

357
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:20,829
in your specs.

358
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,351
So I'm not saying don't do specs.

359
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:28,874
You'll notice that this is fairly late in the process

360
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:30,835
simply because

361
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:34,297
the specs tend to

362
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:40,000
become very heavy to maintain, especially late in the game.

363
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:41,902
Pun not intended.

364
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:46,399
When you're documenting everything,

365
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,209
you have your wireframes, you have your maps,

366
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,815
and you can put your click mocks up there.

367
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:55,416
it all becomes a sort of a good repository,

368
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:58,298
not just for getting engineering up and running,

369
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:00,520
because this is the how you can build it

370
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:02,962
style of documentation,

371
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:06,905
but it's also really useful when two months later,

372
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:08,826
you have to go back and look at a system

373
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:09,707
that you've already designed

374
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:12,669
because you added this new feature or this new system

375
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:15,591
and you wanna figure out where it touches the other stuff,

376
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:16,712
you can look at your maps,

377
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:19,874
you wanna figure out what UI it invalidates,

378
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:21,556
you can look at your click mocks.

379
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,707
And the audience for this is obviously everybody,

380
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:30,570
engineering, QA, it's sort of an ongoing thing,

381
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,672
so I don't set a time here.

382
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:36,995
But the key for, I think, throughout all this

383
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,436
is the visibility of the work.

384
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,158
This is going on the wiki.

385
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,402
Finally, you're actually watching

386
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:49,225
quote unquote real people, outsiders, play.

387
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:50,586
So.

388
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,291
Your researcher is running a test, you have a prototype,

389
00:20:56,391 --> 00:21:00,032
and what we're all doing as UX designers

390
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:03,373
is sitting there writing notes

391
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:08,074
and keeping track of just sort of our own direction

392
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:14,835
because the team has a series of,

393
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:16,776
oh, we know we wanna change this thing later,

394
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,016
but maybe isn't necessarily in the build.

395
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:20,616
You wanna capture all that stuff.

396
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,679
And so writing that in a Google Sheet live where

397
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:28,042
everybody can see it and having a Slack chat running

398
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:32,405
where people can add input is really, really valuable in

399
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:35,947
gathering all that feedback from different points of view

400
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:37,929
throughout the team while the user tests are running.

401
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:43,812
Another thing we do is we have a room dedicated to

402
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,974
broadcasting the test sessions.

403
00:21:46,314 --> 00:21:47,615
And we encourage everybody to come by.

404
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:49,296
Just bring your laptop, hang out and work.

405
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:49,656
It's cool.

406
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,099
The danger to that model can be

407
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:58,901
if you get creative leadership who comes by,

408
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,843
sees a particular thing, confirmation bias kicks in,

409
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:04,044
yes, that is exactly, and then,

410
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:06,125
okay, you've gotta do damage control against that.

411
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,606
So, to that point,

412
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:12,148
we always sort of track the number of instances,

413
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:13,889
and actually,

414
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,992
This slide has changed, because this is always sort of an evolving process.

415
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:22,413
But the idea of the rainbow sheet

416
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:26,095
is something that we're actually trying literally today

417
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:30,637
on our research, and tracking the number of instances of

418
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:33,398
particular reports of behavior. But

419
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:39,000
in the recent past, we've always sort of ranked stuff in a stack rank

420
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,061
in a Google sheet, made that visible to the team. And then the key is

421
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:47,466
making sure that you have your sort of three,

422
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:50,829
the stuff that we will guaranteed need to fix,

423
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:53,971
stuff that we're really like to fix if we can,

424
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:57,213
and then the, yeah, who the fuck is kidding ourselves?

425
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:58,494
We're never gonna do that.

426
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:01,716
But it's there, and we know it has to be done at some point.

427
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:07,240
So, once you have this set of user feedback,

428
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:12,834
And you can vet that sort of against the team's assumptions,

429
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:14,015
because there's all these assumptions

430
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,556
that you've been making the entire time, right?

431
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,477
And it's all about getting that information,

432
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,798
you know, out in a visible way that other people

433
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:22,179
can sort of weigh in and call bullshit on certain things.

434
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,282
And I've run through 10 steps.

435
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:35,333
in a linear list and I assigned some rough times.

436
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:37,694
Again, this is based on a, you know,

437
00:23:38,274 --> 00:23:39,654
just a simple match three title.

438
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,916
These are intentionally small footprint tools

439
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:48,998
and techniques because they need to be used

440
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,559
at varying times throughout the product development process.

441
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:56,592
You can't just do the early research stuff at the beginning

442
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:58,733
and do your spec at the end.

443
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:01,836
I've never seen that actually happen.

444
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:05,759
So really, it's probably something more like this,

445
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,361
the reality of what we do.

446
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:12,604
And the dashed arrows sort of represent the areas

447
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:15,127
where I see studios iterate the most,

448
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:18,449
the things that sort of force that, the rethinking.

449
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,613
It sort of tends to fit into sort of a first.

450
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:27,753
scope of what exactly are we doing?

451
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:29,554
What's the framing of this?

452
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,895
And very loose, very rough, very fast stuff.

453
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:34,696
And then as you get sort of a sense of that,

454
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:37,096
you can get into sort of your more detailed

455
00:24:37,457 --> 00:24:40,438
and specific tools and techniques.

456
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:43,639
But I think that as UX designers,

457
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,440
we are most valuable to both the team and to the game,

458
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,701
the end result product,

459
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:52,021
when we focus on...

460
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,356
doing lightweight things and techniques

461
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:59,778
that have a tangible, durable output

462
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,839
for not just our own design process,

463
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,440
but for the team as well.

464
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:10,044
And with that, I'll end by asking.

465
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,921
So what methods, either that I outlined here

466
00:25:15,462 --> 00:25:16,983
or other things that you can think of,

467
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,246
would you employ next week, next project

468
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:26,692
in your studio to contribute to both the UX process

469
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:28,873
but to the game and to the discipline as a whole?

470
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:32,176
So, thank you very much.

471
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,540
And I was told, if anybody has any questions,

472
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,321
please be sure to step up to the microphone.

473
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:49,103
Hi there.

474
00:25:50,123 --> 00:25:53,405
I'm Dana, I work over at Microsoft on Xbox games.

475
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,327
I just wanted to, I was curious about...

476
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,753
I really appreciate the user journey that you kind of mapped out there.

477
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:10,083
One thing that we tend to do also is we started mapping out the system architecture, so kind

478
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:14,408
of what some of the backend engineering services are and how they integrate.

479
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:21,915
And I think that kind of also the engineering aspect helped us and we would align it with the user

480
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:27,300
touchpoints and the user journey so you could kind of get a sense of what that whole experience was and what

481
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,284
The tech was doing from the backside. So I was just curious if that's something that you guys

482
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,246
also add to your journeys?

483
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:37,426
Or is that something you kind of discuss as a group

484
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:39,167
and that impacts the decisions that you

485
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:40,568
make around your user journeys?

486
00:26:40,928 --> 00:26:41,388
Definitely.

487
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:45,150
So as I think I said at the start,

488
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,231
the idea that UX takes the goals of the other disciplines,

489
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:50,752
but also knowing the constraints.

490
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:52,993
Like what's our budget, what's our engine,

491
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:54,033
what's our timeline?

492
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:55,334
All that stuff, I think.

493
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,172
to get the best design has to be considered.

494
00:26:59,692 --> 00:27:01,033
Otherwise you wind up sort of designing

495
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,954
and running out of railroad at the end of your railroad,

496
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:05,035
whatever the metaphor would be.

497
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:07,596
We don't do it explicitly,

498
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:12,098
but we do all sort of sit down with the engineers

499
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:12,958
and with the other disciplines.

500
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:14,058
And when we do designs,

501
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:16,780
we have a cross-discipline design review.

502
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,001
So we invite engineering to that and we ask,

503
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:21,442
hey, what do you think about this?

504
00:27:21,902 --> 00:27:23,923
Are there suggestions that you would have of other things?

505
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,426
Yeah, and the deliverables you have up front

506
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,467
are so lightweight that it probably makes it really easy

507
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:30,909
for you to iterate and change based on that feedback.

508
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:31,769
Okay, thank you.

509
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:31,889
Yeah.

510
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:35,952
Cool.

511
00:27:37,373 --> 00:27:38,954
Well, if there aren't any other questions,

512
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:41,155
I'll be across the way in wrap up,

513
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:42,036
and thank you very much.
