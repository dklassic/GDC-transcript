1
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:13,993
Just to start, I'm going to be doing a Chicory post-mortem.

2
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:19,516
We're going to be talking about sort of my approach to the marketing and public relations

3
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:25,180
campaign that we ran throughout sort of Chicory's development and then through its launch.

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,922
And to start, I'm going to tell you, one, this is Chicory.

5
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:33,103
If you're not familiar with it, I can totally recommend it.

6
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:36,424
One, we published it, but two, it's awesome.

7
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:39,945
And other people thought it was awesome, too.

8
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:42,365
If you have any questions about how we manage that save file

9
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:47,187
system, I'll tell you about it over drinks.

10
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:49,208
It was quite a task.

11
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,909
When you can paint everything in an entire game,

12
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,289
there's problems sometimes.

13
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:58,006
So first off, my name is Becca Saltzman.

14
00:00:58,006 --> 00:00:59,606
I am the CEO and co-founder of Finji.

15
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:02,207
We are both an independent development studio

16
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:06,888
and a sort of micro-indie publisher.

17
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:07,889
This is my information.

18
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:10,409
I don't close my DMs on Twitter, so feel free to reach out.

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,870
And that's our website.

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,351
And if you need to email me, it's hello at finji.co.

21
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:18,991
If you wanna send me a pitch, it's pitch at finji.co.

22
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:22,882
I run the studio with my husband and partner.

23
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,424
His name is Adam Saltzman.

24
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,788
He sort of runs the creative side of our studio,

25
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:29,792
so our internal development team.

26
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:31,334
We are based in Grand Rapids, Michigan,

27
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:33,477
which is probably a weird place for a game studio.

28
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:34,579
We kind of love it.

29
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:38,845
Some of our past games aside from Chicory,

30
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:43,889
we launch a lot of games, it feels like.

31
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:45,411
Some of them include Cannibalt, which

32
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:47,372
is sort of the old Endless Runner.

33
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:49,714
My husband is the designer on that.

34
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:52,737
We also launched Overland, which was an Apple Arcade launch

35
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,217
title back in 2019.

36
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:58,001
And then we've published games like Chicory, Colorful Tale,

37
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,003
Night in the Woods.

38
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:01,284
Last week, we launched Tunic, which

39
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,800
I'm a little tired.

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,501
It's, yeah, it's pretty cool.

41
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,444
It's been like eight days and it's been awesome.

42
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:09,927
And we also have published Wilmot's Warehouse

43
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:11,029
and several other like mobile titles,

44
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,170
sort of legacy mobile titles.

45
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,994
Our studio itself is actually pretty small.

46
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:18,477
I'm giving you this information so you have context

47
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:19,898
for the type of marketing and PR talk

48
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:21,440
that we're talking about today.

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,441
I am not a big studio.

50
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,222
So these are,

51
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:29,479
sort of skills that we use when we work on a very small team.

52
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,580
So the size of my studio does matter.

53
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,964
There are about 16 of us sort of across internal development and publishing.

54
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:41,207
And they're on sort of biz dev, marketing, community management, and

55
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:42,388
launch operation staff.

56
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:45,411
There are about four of us, and I'm one of those four.

57
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:49,874
We have three QA staff and a little over eight or nine development staff.

58
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:57,316
We also work with a PR and marketing firm in Europe, and this is actually brand new as of 2021 because our

59
00:02:57,316 --> 00:03:00,738
It just got too busy. There weren't quite enough hands to handle our campaigns anymore

60
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:06,420
And they have been helping us roll out our PR and marketing campaigns, and they embed directly within our studio

61
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,922
And they've been helping with all of our launches so Chicory, Tunic, and our upcoming launches

62
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:15,405
I run the biz side of Fingy.

63
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:19,386
I'm also a core creative team member on the community and marketing initiatives that we

64
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:20,266
produce.

65
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,947
And I'm also a member of the creative team on our internal development projects, mostly

66
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:25,488
in the narrative and narrative design realm.

67
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:29,109
So that's just a little bit about me and where I come from.

68
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,230
I approach marketing and PR as a marketing and PR professional.

69
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,690
I worked in media relations before.

70
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:41,598
games in a different life. I was not always in running Fingy. I had a career before games,

71
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:54,601
and that career was in media relations. So I'm now going to tell you a little bit about our campaign.

72
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,682
On March 19th,

73
00:03:56,231 --> 00:04:02,413
2020, that date probably looks kind of familiar, because on March 13th my kids didn't go back to school anymore.

74
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:08,135
Everything about the way that we launched games changed. All of my plans got erased.

75
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:12,736
We came home from PAX East in 2020 and we're like, okay, we're not going anywhere anymore.

76
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,884
We had this Excel document that we had been using for years for our marketing meetings,

77
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:26,230
and we had to add a tab that was just, oh god, what can we do now? How are we going to launch

78
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:31,715
this game? Chicory's coming up on content complete. How are we going to tell anybody about this?

79
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm a bit of a doomsday person. I was pre-med in a former life as well, so when I was looking at

80
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,103
the epidemiology and reading the reports, I was just like, oh no, we're not going anywhere.

81
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:46,187
So I started panicking and started trying to come up with like 300 different backup plans.

82
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:51,852
In our meeting we put together this tab and we just started like

83
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:57,317
brainstorming if we're having to launch this game from home, we can't go talk to people anymore.

84
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:01,981
How do we do that? And how do we do that with our staff of three?

85
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:08,967
And our new marketing firm in Europe who has never launched a game with us before.

86
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,473
So I'm going to step back a little bit so you sort of understand where we started.

87
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:20,676
We picked up Chicory after the Kickstarter campaign.

88
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:28,120
So Greg and his team actually launched this in August of 2019.

89
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:31,874
We mentored Greg a little bit with Wandersong.

90
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,095
So after the Kickstarter campaign, we approached him.

91
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,537
We're like, hey, do you want to work with us?

92
00:05:35,537 --> 00:05:37,378
This would be really fun to do together.

93
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,660
We've always wanted to do a game together.

94
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,262
So we announced our partnership in February of 2020,

95
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:50,149
which was right before PAX East, which was the next month.

96
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,950
After that, everything locked down.

97
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,431
We couldn't see each other anymore.

98
00:05:53,873 --> 00:06:01,498
And we had to move over into more of an online sort of PR and marketing beat calendar indefinitely.

99
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:05,141
We did the June 2020 Summer Demo Fest.

100
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:12,165
We did Indie Arena Online, which we're going to talk a little bit about later.

101
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:19,731
We also did, in that time, I negotiated our PS5 partnership, and we announced that in February of 2021.

102
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:27,331
I'm going to tell you about when Chickory was feature complete.

103
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:28,832
Put a big O X on that.

104
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:31,715
We were feature complete with the game in August,

105
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,176
the very end of August of 2020.

106
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:35,478
We didn't launch until June 2021.

107
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,200
This is an indie title where usually it's like we launch

108
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,503
and we're like hitting the Steam Go button

109
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:42,464
like 30 seconds later.

110
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:44,887
We were feature complete.

111
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:46,228
Like, I mean, gosh.

112
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:51,989
10 months in advance. You're wondering, what the hell did you do for those 10 months?

113
00:06:51,989 --> 00:07:00,156
And what we did was a massive PR campaign. Because we had sort of all this extra

114
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:08,243
game development time, we started doing more things online. We found a localization budget

115
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,605
to make the game a more worldwide launch.

116
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,147
And a lot of this was due to the fact that we were sort of trapped.

117
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:19,889
We couldn't go out and talk to people. We had to figure out how to get a bigger audience from home.

118
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,172
We also had to port the game, it was built in GameMaker,

119
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:25,952
to PS4 and PS5.

120
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:33,035
And since we were a launch title, we had to build in a bunch more engineering time

121
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,176
throughout the process.

122
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:38,335
So back to the timeline real quick.

123
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:40,977
Announced our PS5 announcement in February 2021.

124
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:46,000
We announced a timeline exactly a month later,

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,502
and we knew that these were going to be separated.

126
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,503
We knew that these were going to be a month apart, even when

127
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,464
I did that February announce.

128
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:55,826
We put the game in Ludonarikon, and there's

129
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:57,967
reasons for that, which we'll explain.

130
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:59,608
I didn't announce a launch date until May 27,

131
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,750
which was two weeks before launch.

132
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,404
People look at that and they're like, you're crazy.

133
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,305
What were you doing?

134
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:08,846
All of this was very intentional.

135
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:13,088
There was kind of no, there were a lot of other options,

136
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:16,249
but there were no better options for this particular title

137
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:20,011
and the state of the world at this time.

138
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:25,894
So, we launched the title on June 10th, 2020,

139
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:29,336
which historically everyone knows that's E3 week.

140
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:30,836
That's also kind of a,

141
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,668
probably terrifying.

142
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:35,049
Looking back now, I'm like, why would I do that?

143
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,029
Launching during E3 is terrifying,

144
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:40,511
especially when you're a black and white game where

145
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:45,512
you color everything, and it's very cartoony.

146
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:48,373
But we worked really hard to have some partnerships

147
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:51,254
to make that work.

148
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:55,776
So from March, when we announced, until May,

149
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:58,177
we were actually in and out of the certification process.

150
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:00,618
If you've worked on new hardware before,

151
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:02,138
that is kind of a dicey.

152
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:10,830
time, especially being the, as far as we know, the very first game maker game to come out on a PS5.

153
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:18,635
Our schedule had to be kind of loose. We had to be able to absorb

154
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:22,637
any engineering unknowns when we started our porting process.

155
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:29,221
So, the reason why we felt confident

156
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:35,935
for being able to pull off sort of the two weeks notice of a game kind of before their

157
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:43,422
launch date is because of all of the timeline, sort of leading up to this point.

158
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:47,426
Now, we're going to step even farther back.

159
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:48,267
Who is the team?

160
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:49,048
Why did it matter?

161
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:54,212
And this is a piece of the marketing plan from the very beginning.

162
00:09:54,979 --> 00:10:01,224
The Wandersong team included Greg Lobanoff, who's the lead designer on the project.

163
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:05,307
We had several past launches between all of the team members.

164
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:11,813
They included Wandersong, Celeste, Guild Wars 2, Night in the Woods, Untitled Goose Game, and Eichenfell.

165
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:15,918
Those are just from the team that worked on Chicory.

166
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,419
So if you're looking at like,

167
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,180
why does it have a 92 Metacritic?

168
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,222
Those are the games these designers worked on.

169
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:24,825
And this little, this super team of mostly Canadians

170
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:30,049
came together and built this during a pandemic.

171
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:31,690
We also had three experienced devs

172
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,814
that were leading the new devs on that team.

173
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:39,717
Lena, Greg, and M. Halberstadt.

174
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,202
are responsible for some of the best indie titles that have come out in the last several years,

175
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:50,486
and were able to sort of teach and mentor both Alexis and Madeline through the process.

176
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:56,129
The game also had clear design goals. They knew what they were making,

177
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:59,491
they knew what they were relying on, and

178
00:11:00,496 --> 00:11:08,838
They didn't spend a lot of time sort of arguing about the end goals of the sort of the design

179
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:09,378
of the game.

180
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:15,760
They knew exactly what they were sort of racing towards, which is like a really good position

181
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,640
to be in.

182
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,961
But you have to acknowledge that when you look at a team, you have to look at a team

183
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:20,621
holistically.

184
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:24,943
If you don't have a past like that, you're going to have to make up for it so that like

185
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:28,083
when you put together your pros and cons in front of you of how to market a game.

186
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:29,667
If you don't have it, it's a con.

187
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,667
Nobody knows who you are.

188
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,748
How do we bridge that gap?

189
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:37,790
In our case, we had that so we could build off of it,

190
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,031
which is why their Kickstarter.

191
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:49,177
already had a leg up. Greg loves Kickstarter. He loves audience building. He loves interacting

192
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:56,600
on the internet. He's one of the few devs who will schedule out tweets for months just

193
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,502
to make sure that he has engagement and he doesn't forget.

194
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:07,524
Chikri was Kickstarted. It had, sorry, I have to read this number, 2,342 backers. Their

195
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:09,205
budget was actually pretty small.

196
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,312
50,000 or 60,000 to complete the campaign.

197
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:16,553
And they ended up with like 87,000.

198
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:22,156
What they were able to do with this and.

199
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:25,574
There are a lot of other ways to do this,

200
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:27,615
but this is one of the many ways to do it,

201
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:30,236
and Night in the Woods did this exact same thing,

202
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:34,057
is you are building sort of your very first audience.

203
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:38,379
In this case, the team already had their first audience

204
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:39,639
because they had past fans.

205
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,480
With their Kickstarter, they were able

206
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,660
to create their second audience.

207
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,742
And these are players who are excited,

208
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:49,923
who are seeing this thing for the first time,

209
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:51,764
and now they're going to have access to

210
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:57,741
all of these newsletters if you're going to do a Kickstarter properly.

211
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:01,744
With especially in the marketing,

212
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:04,187
you're always looking for a way to.

213
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:07,105
Create levels of audience.

214
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:09,366
Who are your initial fans?

215
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:11,806
How are you building a second set of initial fans?

216
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,127
Who is your third set of initial fans?

217
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,907
And you can do this in a multitude of ways.

218
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:19,668
If this were normal times, it would be like third set

219
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,489
audience would be who you're developing

220
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,329
or who you're meeting at PAX.

221
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:25,610
And those people at PAX who you're striking up

222
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,810
relationships with, they're going out and bringing

223
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,551
other people over to your PAX booth to create your.

224
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:36,200
your in-person, real-life audience, and they're going to go out and continue to talk to more

225
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,520
people.

226
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:44,908
In this case, the Kickstarter, thank goodness, because we didn't know about the pandemic

227
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:51,093
at this point, this was their second-level audience.

228
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:52,575
Sorry, dry mouth.

229
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,136
With Kickstarter, you have this opportunity

230
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,058
to have this early audience gathering, the early audience

231
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:01,179
communication.

232
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:03,180
And the thing that you're developing at this point

233
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,441
is a term that I find really interesting.

234
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:10,665
It's one that we rely on internally to Fingy.

235
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:12,286
We call this a maven.

236
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:16,808
It's like sort of an old sort of media PR cultural term.

237
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:21,083
And if you sort of follow pop culture or something,

238
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,344
these are the people who are,

239
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:24,545
they're kind of trendsetters,

240
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:29,029
but they're even in front of trendsetters.

241
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,791
They are, it's a sort of media term

242
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,333
for early adopters of things.

243
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,155
They are going to be the people who don't just adopt it,

244
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:41,338
but they're going to evangelize it as well.

245
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:45,541
Kickstarter backers are people who will evangelize

246
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,242
a project for a very long time.

247
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:55,081
It's been a useful word to think of for our games just across the board.

248
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,822
It's a word that I've been using for almost 20 years,

249
00:14:56,822 --> 00:15:02,964
because they generally will end up being long-term fans of your company.

250
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:08,847
Early adopters of Greg's work or even like pre-Wandersong fans

251
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:13,009
who came from his early, early work when he was sort of late teens, early twenties,

252
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:13,969
came into Wandersong.

253
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:17,326
came into Chicory and are probably going to follow him

254
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:18,046
into his next project.

255
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:20,008
And they will continue to talk about this.

256
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,789
They will see a Kickstarter and they

257
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:25,552
will send it to other people.

258
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:29,635
They're also the people who will see the 26 updates

259
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:32,677
on a Kickstarter and send them to other people.

260
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:35,419
Chicory did 26 updates over 18 months of their Kickstarter

261
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:36,580
campaign.

262
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,222
Constant communication with their first and second

263
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:41,003
tier audience.

264
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:47,306
Mavens have a tendency to also not be ashamed of their fandom.

265
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:54,109
So I'm, this is embarrassing, and I'm going to say this, and this will probably end up

266
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:59,452
on like a YouTube channel someday, but I am a Spice Girls Maven, and it's okay, I can

267
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:00,593
say this out loud.

268
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:01,693
I love the Spice Girls.

269
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:05,775
I have no shame at all about this.

270
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:09,364
The sort of people that you're trying to get to adopt,

271
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:12,106
your early adopters, your early mavens for your game projects,

272
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:15,389
you want them to not be ashamed of just being

273
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:16,910
so enthusiastic about your work.

274
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,213
And you can do this just by, you can support them, obviously,

275
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:21,954
with their updates.

276
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:25,516
You can support them by talking to them on Twitter.

277
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:28,319
You can provide content for them to share,

278
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,301
the kind of content that they're interested in.

279
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:34,043
People are always going to seek connection to the things

280
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:34,583
that they love.

281
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,094
And when you provide that connection,

282
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:40,657
they will share it with others.

283
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:45,460
Now, after Fingy, so we came into this game

284
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,182
with a reasonable-sized Kickstarter audience.

285
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:50,803
We had past projects.

286
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:53,125
We had fans of these creators.

287
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,826
And I had to figure out, what the heck are we

288
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:56,307
going to do with this?

289
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:01,350
And my job is I have to design a launch plan.

290
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,792
For a game like Chicory, that's actually kind of hard.

291
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:07,638
I'd never worked on a Game Maker game before.

292
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:10,500
I had never launched a PS5 title before.

293
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,826
And I'd never worked with Greg and his team, with the exception of M, before.

294
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:20,349
I had to sort of take all of their strengths and consolidate them into something that would

295
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:24,132
be useful to talk about as Fingy the Publishing Project.

296
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:28,496
One of those things that you have to do...

297
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:31,337
is you have to, in order to design the launch plan,

298
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:33,959
is you have to identify the points of intersection

299
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:37,321
between what the team wants, what Finji needs,

300
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,582
and what our business partner, in this case, Sony, needs.

301
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:45,325
None of those things align in exact, like, perfect,

302
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:47,346
in exact, perfect alignment.

303
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:50,208
We have to look for the places where we intersect,

304
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,789
where our interests are identical.

305
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:56,611
And that might be, we need to sell a bunch of copies.

306
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:59,333
We need to be well-reviewed.

307
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,975
We need to be something that people can say,

308
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:05,156
oh, I was involved with that project.

309
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:06,817
It makes whatever look good.

310
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:08,818
Or we support a diverse team.

311
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:10,138
There's a lot of different places

312
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:14,040
that you can have intersection with the various stakeholders

313
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,380
on a project.

314
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,922
All of these should be part of your marketing campaign.

315
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:20,643
They should be the base foundation.

316
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:32,498
As you're figuring out how to maximize the intersection points where the three parties

317
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:38,660
involved have common goals, you're able to pencil in possible marketing beats.

318
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,662
So this seems difficult, but if you're looking out in front of you, like I am launching a

319
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:48,144
game, Sony is my partner, what is an obvious possible mark?

320
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:56,015
Intersection point we need to launch something they know the public doesn't know the title so we need to launch a title

321
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:56,695
How do we do that?

322
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:59,257
Well, we are working for a common goal to an event

323
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:03,800
They need a trailer on device so they can show it and then they get to be the ones that bring that news to the

324
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:11,425
World that's an intersection point Sony has a need they need to announce this game. I have a need I need to build an audience

325
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:15,548
So we're all both working towards the same thing

326
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:17,489
But using the exact same asset to get there

327
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:22,133
That's what you mean by working towards a marketing beat,

328
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:26,777
working towards the same goal.

329
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:29,979
Now there's a lot of ways to sort of pencil in

330
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:33,561
your marketing beats between current and future available

331
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:36,964
assets, interviews, events, what's out in front of you.

332
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:39,466
And usually the question is like, well, I don't know.

333
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:40,166
We'll get to that.

334
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,387
I don't know what's out in front of me.

335
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,044
When you're sort of looking at this,

336
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:47,105
and you're looking at like 18 months until launch,

337
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:50,728
there's probably like 5 to 20 versions of this.

338
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:52,370
Well, what if I do this?

339
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,912
Well, then I would go to this event,

340
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:56,733
and then I would talk about it this way.

341
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:59,836
And at this event, I could talk about x design.

342
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:02,078
I could set up an interview for y.

343
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:08,083
I could participate in this event in this way,

344
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,566
which would cause me to talk about story,

345
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:19,818
You think about the reason for the event or the talk or anything, and how can you turn

346
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:26,621
that into something that produces content that people can get a hold of in the news

347
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:29,262
or on the internet.

348
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:37,025
I built five of these in the summer of 2020, following multiple distribution paths to launch.

349
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:44,239
When we decided to go with Sony, when we sort of developed that partnership,

350
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:51,025
I sort of went quiet with Chicory in the fall of 2020. This was super intentional at this point.

351
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:57,323
We have a tendency when we know how we're going to launch a game,

352
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,847
where we're like, we leak out a little bit of information and then things go

353
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:04,331
very very quiet for a long time, it's because I'm holding new

354
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:08,075
information for what we call springboard times.

355
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:12,721
So for example, this is unrelated to chicory but it's the most recent example,

356
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:19,112
I had a launch date for Tunic, and I knew that launch date for Tunic back in the summer of 2021,

357
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:24,275
but nobody knew that until December because I was holding that for springboard time.

358
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:29,278
My springboard time was the Game Awards. This is similar with Chicory. I knew that I was content

359
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:35,921
complete. I knew that I had this PS5 deal, but I had to wait for a springboard time in order

360
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,783
to announce it, which meant that I knew when exactly I would be launching the title.

361
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:45,005
We also tie springboard times to new assets,

362
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:46,425
things that people can latch on to,

363
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:48,507
things that people can share.

364
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,088
We also tailor the message for each channel.

365
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:56,051
The way you talk to some press is very different

366
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:56,951
from how you talk to other press,

367
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:58,692
which is very different from how you talk

368
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,413
to your Kickstarter backers,

369
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:01,374
which is very different from how you talk

370
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:02,775
to the kids on your Discord.

371
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:05,336
All of them have to be tailored

372
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:07,718
to how they're going to be receptive

373
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:09,158
to the information that you're sharing.

374
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,551
And you always work towards the next news drop.

375
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:16,272
So cool.

376
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:19,133
I did some, like, we announced that we're coming out,

377
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:19,973
oops, I'm sorry.

378
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:23,355
We announced that we're coming out on PlayStation

379
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:24,415
in February of 2021 for Chicory.

380
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:28,277
I knew in March that I was going to be announcing

381
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:29,758
the range that it was coming out.

382
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,159
It wasn't the date because I didn't know it yet,

383
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,160
but we're like, spring, which gave me a max deadline.

384
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,461
It had to come out before.

385
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:42,590
whatever June 20 something is when it turns into summer.

386
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,793
We did that all intentional, but we

387
00:22:44,793 --> 00:22:47,177
were working towards that next news drop

388
00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:48,839
when we did the February launch.

389
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:56,679
And the way that you can always be working towards your next news drop is you prep 90%

390
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,142
done assets for quick turnaround.

391
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:05,887
When you're a super, super small studio and your partner is like, hey, I need an on-device

392
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:09,751
trailer and you're like, cool, that's four weeks of work.

393
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:14,615
Who the hell can do that on the kind of turnaround time that a lot of consoles or business partners

394
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:15,075
ask for?

395
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:23,731
Nobody can. I can't do it. And we don't. I had that chicory. I had the February chicory launch

396
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:30,575
trailer. I had that asset done in April of 2020. We only had to make edits to it. We had to put it

397
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:37,598
in the correct timeline. We had to add the right bumpers. We were working on the tunic trailer.

398
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:43,921
That was storyboarded and worked on last fall. Because we were working towards

399
00:23:44,872 --> 00:23:50,314
events that we were hoping to get a hold of well before we actually had it confirmed.

400
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:56,576
Especially with something like trailers, try to work towards 90% assets. Finishing up 10% in a

401
00:23:56,576 --> 00:24:03,119
week is possible. Doing a trailer in a week will hurt you and it's not a good idea and it's not

402
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,840
going to be a good trailer and it's unkind to all of your collaborators.

403
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:12,869
You also have to be flexible.

404
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:17,391
We were up for an announcement in October of 2020,

405
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:22,593
December of 2020, possibly even January,

406
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:24,114
I think we had one canceled.

407
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,575
And all of those announcements for getting

408
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:29,496
our PlayStation announcement announced just fell through.

409
00:24:29,496 --> 00:24:30,757
There wasn't room for it.

410
00:24:30,757 --> 00:24:31,797
It wasn't a good fit.

411
00:24:31,797 --> 00:24:34,358
And we just continued to hold these assets,

412
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:38,260
because eventually we would have the correct intersection

413
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,640
point.

414
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:43,406
that would make the most noise.

415
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:45,568
And if your partner is on board with it,

416
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,670
if your partner is also helping with this marketing,

417
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,792
that will work.

418
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:53,296
So be flexible.

419
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:53,457
Now.

420
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:56,999
One of the main things that we have a tendency to do

421
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:59,641
is we position our team to take advantage of an external,

422
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:02,583
we call these, this is the nice way to call these things

423
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,684
when somebody calls you up and like,

424
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:04,745
hey, I want you to be in an event.

425
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:07,647
We're like, oh, that's a great external opportunity

426
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:08,428
rather than cursing.

427
00:25:08,428 --> 00:25:09,489
We used to just curse.

428
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:12,871
Position your team to take advantage

429
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:14,713
of an external opportunity before it happens.

430
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:19,136
People always ask, well, how?

431
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:20,217
How do you know this?

432
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:23,520
The industry runs on a calendar and it's not a mystery.

433
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:27,594
The calendar is the same every year.

434
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:30,316
When does Apple do their fall announcements?

435
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:32,518
Second week of September.

436
00:25:32,518 --> 00:25:32,879
It just is.

437
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:36,342
When do they announce stuff?

438
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:36,762
March 25th.

439
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:39,824
There's an announcement in March.

440
00:25:39,824 --> 00:25:41,626
You can just find this information

441
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:42,747
by just looking at the internet.

442
00:25:42,747 --> 00:25:44,128
You can just make notes.

443
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:47,411
The platforms also run on a calendar.

444
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:49,853
The events run on a calendar.

445
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,961
And your game marketing schedule cannot ignore that calendar

446
00:25:54,961 --> 00:26:00,726
unless you are so big that you make your own calendar.

447
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,188
You are probably not that big.

448
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:08,312
There's very few people who are that big.

449
00:26:08,312 --> 00:26:13,176
For years now, many years, I track every single event.

450
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:16,238
I have like a Hobonichi, like a paper calendar,

451
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:17,219
which everyone makes fun of me for.

452
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:19,081
They're like, why are you not digital?

453
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,282
Well, I like writing things down.

454
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:27,963
I track everything in that thing for years, and I keep them stacked, actually, behind my desk.

455
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:32,566
I track when the sales happen across all platforms.

456
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:33,546
I track events.

457
00:26:33,546 --> 00:26:41,250
I track studio vacations, when Sony goes on vacation at the holidays.

458
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:41,670
I track that.

459
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,472
I track when they announced major games.

460
00:26:46,268 --> 00:26:52,289
That way I can go back and I can look for correlations between how the calendar moves

461
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:53,709
from year to year.

462
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:57,010
When our state of play is going to happen, I can tell you that.

463
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,251
When our Xbox Twitch event is going to happen, I can probably tell you that too.

464
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:10,332
Because they have internal process that dictates the timeline that these things can happen.

465
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:11,572
You don't have to know what any of that is.

466
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:13,553
You just have to look at when they have the events.

467
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:23,365
Now, we ended up in a position, obviously, with COVID, that we were trapped.

468
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:25,106
We couldn't go to PAX anymore.

469
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:28,629
And now we're forced to figure out how to make use of an online

470
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:33,752
event with a tiny, tiny team.

471
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:40,215
Online events are going to, are going to then and will now increase launch reach

472
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:43,457
because the industry has changed.

473
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:47,340
Like always, like timestamp this talk today on March 23rd or 24th, whatever it is.

474
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,723
It is different from the industry of six months ago,

475
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:52,684
and it's going to be different from the industry six months

476
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:53,405
from now.

477
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:57,389
The online events are not going to go away.

478
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:00,151
Online demo events are just not going to go away

479
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:02,994
because we have created a system now

480
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:04,135
that was hard to create,

481
00:28:04,135 --> 00:28:06,217
where people can access these things.

482
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,859
Steam demo events are awesome.

483
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,200
They happen all the time,

484
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,702
and that was not a thing that really existed

485
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:15,265
in the form that it is now before the pandemic.

486
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,841
They'd tried maybe one of them, and it was heavily curated.

487
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:21,062
And now you can just turn your demos on and off

488
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:25,925
with a button, which is not how it used to work.

489
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:31,527
If you can't turn people's heads in real life,

490
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:36,210
the next best thing is at-home access.

491
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,451
And this really does open it up for those of us

492
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:39,231
who can't travel.

493
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:42,433
It is not realistic to say, hey, everybody, go to PAX.

494
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:45,096
You can't do that.

495
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:48,539
How do you, why do you, like I can't go to the Tokyo game show.

496
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:49,259
I've never been there.

497
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:50,080
I really want to go.

498
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,262
I'm never going to make it there.

499
00:28:53,262 --> 00:28:56,824
Who can make it to Gamescom this third week of August?

500
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:57,945
It's expensive.

501
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,766
When you have these online demo events,

502
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:03,588
it means that you also can be sitting at the same table

503
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:07,351
as all the other game developers in the world on a platform

504
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:10,013
like Steam, or if any of the, Xbox, for example,

505
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:12,894
also did demo events last year.

506
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:12,914
I.

507
00:29:14,228 --> 00:29:19,230
And it's up to you to figure out how to make the most of these online events, because it's

508
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,070
not just the event.

509
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:30,095
I have pointed out, just on here, some of the events that we did, and this is correlated

510
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:32,556
to our Chickory wish lists.

511
00:29:32,556 --> 00:29:37,838
We have our Kickstarter campaign when the page went live.

512
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:39,919
We have the first Steam DemoFest.

513
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,300
I think that's actually the very, very first one that they did.

514
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:46,633
I've highlighted three others.

515
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:52,458
Indie Arena Online, which was the Gamescom 2020 sort of fill-in.

516
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,799
Ludonaracon is awesome.

517
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,802
If you can participate in that, it takes over the whole front page of Steam

518
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:01,224
and drives wish lists for the whole weekend.

519
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:01,704
All of this matters.

520
00:30:01,704 --> 00:30:02,205
These are all marketing beats.

521
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:09,710
These are all ways to collect your audience before you launch your game.

522
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:15,283
I put a picture of this up here.

523
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:20,248
This is my online booth for Indie Arena Online in 2020.

524
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:25,292
It was and is an online MMO where you walk

525
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,733
through virtual booths.

526
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:31,798
All of these things, like if you hit Play,

527
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:35,841
that would take you to the Steam page to play the demo.

528
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,804
It had soundless trailers running on it.

529
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:39,124
You could.

530
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:44,602
click over to my merch booth, which was just like my Fingy store.

531
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:47,344
And you could, we had little NPCs in there, you could sort of see

532
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:51,206
Chickory Dog in the middle, which had sort of

533
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:54,728
a twine-like conversation

534
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:59,291
dialogue system that my community manager, Harris, typed up. And it was all

535
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:03,633
Twitter linked. It was really hard to do because it was so limited.

536
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:06,475
And every single one of those people, I think, was named me.

537
00:31:07,514 --> 00:31:10,395
But we just put in conversations, what is the game about?

538
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:14,617
How can you, what's the quickest way that you can tell people what chicory is about?

539
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:17,518
This thing was not easy to build in 2020.

540
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:19,559
It's gotten much, much easier.

541
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,560
They actually changed and overhauled the whole system for 2022.

542
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:23,740
No, 2021.

543
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,521
It's so cool.

544
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:31,543
And it's a way to participate in Gamescom

545
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:34,784
without actually going to Cologne.

546
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:37,025
You are engaging with a European audience.

547
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:39,080
that you might otherwise not have access to.

548
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:46,488
In addition to just building a showpiece booth,

549
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:50,752
which took about two weeks, it was way harder in 2020,

550
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:56,598
we provided an entire weekend of online streaming schedule.

551
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:58,299
We reached out to streamers to play our demo

552
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:01,603
and we let them stream it on our Steam page.

553
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:07,479
We provided, we made our own talks and recorded them

554
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,080
with like lower thirds and the whole thing,

555
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,981
and we streamed them on our Twitch channel.

556
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:15,283
We did Q&As with developers in our Discord.

557
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:16,904
So we had Greg and his team come in

558
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:19,906
and talk to fans in our Discord about the game design,

559
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:23,168
and then they could just go play the demo.

560
00:32:23,168 --> 00:32:27,811
We did, we did our restreaming, we did Twitter initiatives.

561
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:30,453
So during this time we did

562
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:31,813
chicory character haircuts.

563
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:44,273
So we would, we were in the process of adding all the hair mechanics to the game and we were just giving all the characters haircuts.

564
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:55,658
We also did a draw, draw whatever in the chicory art style, just on a live art stream.

565
00:32:58,072 --> 00:32:59,275
It was awesome.

566
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:01,964
Like these timed demos were such a cool opportunity

567
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:04,451
to provide content directly to our fans.

568
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:09,474
So online event participation, you did it,

569
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:11,875
but you're not actually done.

570
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,036
You can prep your content in advance.

571
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:16,977
You can use the tools that just the internet gives you

572
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:19,118
at your disposal effectively.

573
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:20,918
It's going to drive online engagement

574
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:23,879
because that's literally how the system is designed to work.

575
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:27,441
You can use all of these pieces,

576
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:31,822
and it's just for a weekend.

577
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:31,982
So.

578
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:35,992
We refer to, we have a minimum viable product

579
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:37,713
when it comes to online events,

580
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:40,556
where we have a certain number of things

581
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:41,917
that we try to schedule for each day,

582
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:44,539
because you don't have to keep it running the whole time.

583
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:49,783
So for Gamescom, we try to do maybe 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.,

584
00:33:49,783 --> 00:33:50,404
so during our workday,

585
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:53,366
and that's all the content that we'll provide,

586
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,608
because we're catering to a European audience.

587
00:33:55,608 --> 00:33:57,389
If we're working in the Steam Demo Fest,

588
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:59,071
we're working more at nighttime,

589
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,952
so we're trying to catch the after-school crowd.

590
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:06,110
We're looking at one to two things a day, maybe.

591
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,073
If you have a Discord, you can just turn on the radio part,

592
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:12,996
and you can host an audio show.

593
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:15,137
We do those all the time in our Fingy Discord.

594
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:19,241
It's just fun, where you can just have people come on stage,

595
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:21,522
have them ask a question, talk about game design.

596
00:34:21,522 --> 00:34:29,569
It really does, though, all of this, it will take.

597
00:34:30,142 --> 00:34:33,604
time away from you, especially if you're a small indie team.

598
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,545
So you need to actually build this into your production

599
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:35,725
schedule.

600
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:39,768
The cool thing, though, because all of this stuff is online,

601
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:44,711
for Indie Arena especially, and we did this

602
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:46,412
with the Chicory team, we actually

603
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:49,594
started building content in July for this event.

604
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:53,296
So that way, we didn't have to do this stuff live.

605
00:34:53,296 --> 00:34:55,418
Who wants to do that on a Saturday?

606
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:58,240
We would run the shows that we had pre-recorded.

607
00:34:58,673 --> 00:35:00,173
And then we had like these five weeks,

608
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:03,114
we could put it into our schedule and then run the content.

609
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:06,995
And especially if you're a small indie team or any team,

610
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:08,936
the next time there's a Steam demo fest,

611
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:10,416
you want to know what content you can run?

612
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:14,797
The content from your last event,

613
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:17,658
because you want to know how many eyeballs saw it

614
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:18,158
at that time?

615
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:18,978
Wow, 15?

616
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:21,019
Let's go for more.

617
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,460
Like you can just rerun your content, rerun old streams.

618
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,560
You can just put them up on your page.

619
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:34,421
This work is not just like a one-off thing, you can continue to use it.

620
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:40,506
All of our platform, single day press beats, even for other platforms, increase awareness.

621
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:44,790
These are also our wish lists.

622
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:49,554
Our Sony announcements have spikes on our Steam wish lists, our launch date announcements

623
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:52,516
spike on wish lists, our launch day wish lists.

624
00:35:54,452 --> 00:36:00,616
Every single time that we talked to the public, we had spikes.

625
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,519
If you ask any developer in this industry to show this graph,

626
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:06,220
I promise you every single one of them

627
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,102
is going to have the same information on it.

628
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:10,462
Every time you talk to the public,

629
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:13,244
you absolutely will have wish list increases.

630
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:16,486
And even when you announce for other platforms,

631
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:19,108
you will have Steam wish list increases.

632
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:20,809
This has been this way forever.

633
00:36:21,351 --> 00:36:23,332
And it is really important to internalize this truth

634
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:24,192
about how Steam works.

635
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:31,235
Because all of this works for us as developers towards one goal.

636
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:36,797
When we launch a game, people know that the damn thing

637
00:36:36,797 --> 00:36:37,517
is available.

638
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:39,778
And they know it's available because they've

639
00:36:39,778 --> 00:36:40,578
wish-listed the game.

640
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:43,759
Because we don't have huge marketing budgets.

641
00:36:46,714 --> 00:36:49,676
Now, this was a weird one for us,

642
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:51,636
participating in the Summer Games Fest.

643
00:36:51,636 --> 00:36:55,638
We were sort of coming up on launch,

644
00:36:55,638 --> 00:37:00,401
and we had all of these assets sitting out ready for basically

645
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:00,841
us to go.

646
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:05,123
And we needed to be ready at any point to participate.

647
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,784
We had our launch trailer.

648
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:09,545
We had an accolades trailer, just

649
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:11,166
ready to put accolades in it.

650
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,806
We had

651
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:16,270
We had ideas of how this could work,

652
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,051
and it was sort of our job to pitch them.

653
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:21,633
I mentioned already that we were sort of

654
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,855
at the front of the PS5 launches,

655
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:25,736
and we knew that we weren't going to get

656
00:37:25,736 --> 00:37:29,379
months of known ramp up on our launch date

657
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:31,360
because new tech things often have unknowns.

658
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,744
This doesn't make launching a game impossible

659
00:37:36,744 --> 00:37:39,026
unless you prepare yourself.

660
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:41,327
So when it is time to go, you are ready to go.

661
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:48,968
So I'm going to talk a little bit just like how did this come together. So we launched actually,

662
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:54,992
we shadowed, almost shadow dropped. I negotiated a pretty cool version of it. We didn't tell anyone

663
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:58,674
what time of the day it was going to be launched and we had it as part of the steam or the Summer

664
00:37:58,674 --> 00:38:05,479
Games Fest, which is Jeff Keeley's event. So we mentioned that it was going to be launching in

665
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:11,543
spring in March of 2021. Our porting efforts were absolutely taking longer than expected because of

666
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:16,771
sort of our games engine and the new hardware. And we had planned for this.

667
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:22,436
And we knew that it was going to be like real tight coming into our launch.

668
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:23,777
It was very hard being patient.

669
00:38:24,873 --> 00:38:28,015
So when it looked like we were going to hit the June date,

670
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:30,536
which happens to overlap E3, which is kind of a terrible time

671
00:38:30,536 --> 00:38:32,958
to try to launch a game as an indie,

672
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:37,220
we started negotiating hard for an E3 spot,

673
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,902
using both our contacts at Sony,

674
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:44,024
but also my previous contacts with sort of Jeff Keighley

675
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:46,266
and the Game Awards.

676
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:51,767
There were a bunch of options on the table, and one of those absolutely was a complete

677
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:57,930
shadow drop, which would have, as I talked about earlier, we had these Kickstarter backers

678
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:03,352
who are our earliest fans, and of all the people that you want to make angry, you don't

679
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:04,413
piss off your mavens.

680
00:39:04,413 --> 00:39:08,475
So if we had shadow dropped a game, we would not have told people who are most excited

681
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:10,576
about our game that it was launching.

682
00:39:10,576 --> 00:39:12,597
They wouldn't know that they could play it right away.

683
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:15,475
They would have had to clear their schedule to get a hold of it.

684
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:19,077
And that's kind of a cruddy way to treat your best fans.

685
00:39:19,077 --> 00:39:25,621
Uh, so we sort of negotiated the best version of this, which was, we will tell

686
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:28,743
our fans that we're launching, but we're not going to tell them exactly when or

687
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:33,585
how, which means that they also get to participate on launch day in the sort of

688
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:39,528
like really loud version that we had arranged at the steam or the summer games fest.

689
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:39,768
So.

690
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,573
We provided a way forward that hit all of our goals

691
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:48,175
across all three people, or all three stakeholders.

692
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:49,735
We had our launch day announcement,

693
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:51,036
which meant the Kickstarter backers

694
00:39:51,036 --> 00:39:53,116
were going to be satisfied.

695
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:55,417
We had our exclusive partner content,

696
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:57,378
which meant that Sony was going to be satisfied.

697
00:39:57,378 --> 00:39:59,859
And we had a press push with a known embargo

698
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:02,800
and streamer push, which meant that Finji

699
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,081
could talk to press and get our reviews in order.

700
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:07,881
And we had beautiful assets from the team.

701
00:40:08,972 --> 00:40:14,857
It was not hard to do this, but looking at what the end goals were for everyone involved

702
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:21,783
meant that we were able to come up with a solution that allowed everyone to have sort

703
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:26,188
of a part in the process.

704
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:28,910
If anyone ever wants to talk about that, we should do it over drinks.

705
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,391
It's pretty stressful.

706
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,423
So, traditional PR plans are wonderful.

707
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:39,847
PR, public relations is like talking to media and press and sort of navigating

708
00:40:39,847 --> 00:40:45,331
that, that whole industry and it's very weird.

709
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:51,376
The thing that's super, super important, especially even with small indie titles

710
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:58,261
is to understand that press game reviews are awesome, but that's not PR.

711
00:40:58,261 --> 00:41:00,142
That's just what happens when you launch a game.

712
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:06,637
Public relations and media relations is being able to pitch a story about you to the media

713
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:13,081
to get them to cover you beyond your press review, your game review.

714
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:20,106
This is going up and talking to them and being like, hey, I have a really cool dev story.

715
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:21,568
Let me tell you about it.

716
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:24,570
Would you like to talk to my team about.

717
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:31,075
The process of inventing genderless language for a 75,000 word script.

718
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:34,999
How do you do that in French?

719
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,902
It's a nightmare.

720
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:37,923
That's a story.

721
00:41:37,923 --> 00:41:38,504
That's a pitch.

722
00:41:38,504 --> 00:41:42,348
That's something somebody would want to talk about and it's not a game review.

723
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:48,865
Or the intersection of creativity and feeling like you're not good enough in the games industry.

724
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:53,646
Also a story. Let's talk about imposter syndrome. And let's talk to the Chicory team about that.

725
00:41:53,646 --> 00:41:59,808
They did a whole game about imposter syndrome. Or lessons learned from Wandersong.

726
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:03,289
Why does Chicory shine in a different way?

727
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:08,290
Like that's pitching stories that people want to talk about that are not game reviews.

728
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,474
That's traditional media relations.

729
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:13,335
And we started that in June.

730
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:13,695
No, not June.

731
00:42:13,695 --> 00:42:16,637
We started that way before June, February.

732
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:20,779
And we had the stories start trickling out in May and June.

733
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:23,161
We also did physical press kits.

734
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:26,003
This is the first time we ever did this.

735
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:28,724
I almost vetoed it, and I'm so glad I didn't.

736
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:31,726
We spent money on 150 physical press kits.

737
00:42:31,726 --> 00:42:34,628
And it wasn't your normal garbage swag.

738
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:43,351
We did watercolor scenes of the game itself.

739
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:47,272
We sent custom watercolor, like, I don't even

740
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:51,473
know the cartridges, plus paintbrushes.

741
00:42:51,473 --> 00:42:57,495
We did a donation to schools.

742
00:42:57,495 --> 00:43:00,056
So every one of the press kits costs like $15.

743
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:01,796
And I did $15 per press kit.

744
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:03,397
And we donated this directly to.

745
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:11,184
educators in the United States who are teaching art in schools, which you can pick up from

746
00:43:11,184 --> 00:43:14,427
DonorsChoose just as a charity donation.

747
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:16,389
And we told people we did that.

748
00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:20,513
We didn't tell the internet we did that, but we told the people who we sent the press kit

749
00:43:20,513 --> 00:43:21,634
to that we did that.

750
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:26,799
We also did like a custom pin of the lost kittens.

751
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:29,261
This was all themed directly around

752
00:43:31,414 --> 00:43:34,275
Chicory itself, things that matter to Chicory.

753
00:43:34,275 --> 00:43:36,897
We wanted the press and content creators,

754
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:40,419
and even the team got them,

755
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:43,641
to sit down and watercolor a scene,

756
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:47,003
like in real life and not just in the game.

757
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:49,545
We also did key distribution to press in tiers.

758
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:51,686
We tier our press.

759
00:43:51,686 --> 00:43:53,527
Top tier, NDA tier,

760
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:56,269
they get three to four weeks to review a game.

761
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:59,291
We also do one week before, day before, and day of,

762
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:00,032
depending on

763
00:44:00,382 --> 00:44:03,544
if we're afraid somebody's going to break embargo.

764
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,546
We also did a huge asset overhaul.

765
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:07,707
We checked screenshots, GIFs, trailer cuts.

766
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:10,269
And we made sure that we worked ahead so all of these things

767
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:13,772
were ready to go in the weeks leading up to launch.

768
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:16,154
We also used developer tools for launch.

769
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:20,017
On Steam, you can just put streams up.

770
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:23,960
Did you talk to anybody about streaming on your web page

771
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,460
on launch day?

772
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,642
We also had a very small, very modest advertising budget,

773
00:44:29,642 --> 00:44:31,843
which ICO helped us put together,

774
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:35,144
pointing people at both Steam and the PlayStation store

775
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:36,645
pages.

776
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:41,807
And we did test runs of that to figure out

777
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:45,769
who would be the best audiences to sort of point

778
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:46,729
at a Fingy game.

779
00:44:50,643 --> 00:44:52,805
And that was actually a really weird process,

780
00:44:52,805 --> 00:45:02,472
because we don't discriminate against audiences.

781
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:05,335
Finji has an amazing, supportive, furry audience

782
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,155
out there.

783
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:06,576
We just do.

784
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:08,718
It's cool.

785
00:45:08,718 --> 00:45:12,200
And providing advertisements to that audience

786
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,042
was like a no-brainer for us.

787
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:17,485
We have a game that's all the characters are animals.

788
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:23,433
and they have a great representative audience on Twitter,

789
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:24,953
that should be part of our audience.

790
00:45:24,953 --> 00:45:27,354
And we did a test on that to see if that was

791
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:32,936
an appropriate way to use our ad money.

792
00:45:32,936 --> 00:45:35,216
So we always work ahead on all launches

793
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:38,777
because nothing is stopping us except ourselves.

794
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,458
We love to procrastinate and we are very aware of that.

795
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:43,779
So we work way, way, way ahead.

796
00:45:44,646 --> 00:45:49,410
That way we are always ready for when something does come up.

797
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,172
You can write your press release for your launch

798
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:52,573
two months in advance.

799
00:45:52,573 --> 00:45:53,854
You know the most about your game.

800
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,656
You can just put it in a Google Doc and hang onto it.

801
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:58,799
And you can also research your press context two months

802
00:45:58,799 --> 00:45:59,820
in advance.

803
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,822
You can not procrastinate that, so you're

804
00:46:01,822 --> 00:46:03,303
ready to go when your game's ready to go.

805
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:05,645
You can pull your Steam keys early.

806
00:46:05,645 --> 00:46:07,667
You can make a trailer that fits into your schedule

807
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:09,169
and hold it for a year.

808
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:10,069
I'm holding.

809
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:16,585
two trailers right now? Three trailers. I am holding three trailers right now and I've had

810
00:46:16,585 --> 00:46:23,570
them done for quite a while. One of them I've had done since 2020 and it's just sitting in a drop box

811
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:26,973
waiting for the right moment for me to show the world how cool it is.

812
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,171
You can build a burndown list of things to do for launch

813
00:46:32,171 --> 00:46:33,472
and assign them to the right people.

814
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:34,953
And that right person might be you.

815
00:46:34,953 --> 00:46:37,054
It might be just your burndown list.

816
00:46:37,054 --> 00:46:39,935
We keep actually a master list in Notion.

817
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:41,655
I have several of these now.

818
00:46:41,655 --> 00:46:45,297
And it'll be like 60 or 70 items long by the time we're done.

819
00:46:45,297 --> 00:46:52,700
And we divide it out between the four of us.

820
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:52,980
So yeah.

821
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:55,964
I have time for questions.

822
00:46:55,964 --> 00:46:59,005
I just want to sort of end with, when you limit yourself

823
00:46:59,005 --> 00:47:00,966
to the ways other people talk about their games,

824
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:04,847
when you limit to the way that you've

825
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:07,307
seen other people do things, you're actually

826
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:10,508
doing yourself a disservice as far as how

827
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:12,789
you talk about your own games.

828
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:16,950
You're no longer representing your living product.

829
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,851
You're sort of following arbitrary rules

830
00:47:18,851 --> 00:47:21,412
without considering the outcome.

831
00:47:23,796 --> 00:47:28,539
Each game's marketing plan is unique within the game itself.

832
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:31,821
And that's like a super important design tenet.

833
00:47:31,821 --> 00:47:38,146
You need to be able to sort of create a possibility space

834
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,347
for how you talk about and engage with your marketing

835
00:47:40,347 --> 00:47:44,150
problem as a creative design problem,

836
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,211
and not just like, well, these are the rules.

837
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,672
This is what I'm supposed to do.

838
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:53,773
As game designers and developers, we do have the opportunity to approach marketing from the realm of design,

839
00:47:53,773 --> 00:47:58,978
and our medium specifically is uniquely positioned to offer up ways to connect with our audience

840
00:47:58,978 --> 00:48:02,181
when you are looking at the problem in a more holistic way.

841
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:09,347
We have access to a lot of tools, and your game itself has mechanics and themes within

842
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:13,812
to build a whole interactive process out of those tools.

843
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,121
Chicory had that. It was built into the way it was painted. It was built into the gifts.

844
00:48:20,121 --> 00:48:24,123
It was built into the way that Sony also wanted to show it.

845
00:48:24,123 --> 00:48:30,266
And all the pieces that we did were designed to maximize the systems in place,

846
00:48:30,266 --> 00:48:35,029
the Steam wish lists, the audience building, the collection of more

847
00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:39,411
people inside our Discord. We brought talks into our Discord. They stayed as fans.

848
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,641
All of these things were built together.

849
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:47,102
We did not think about them as individual process

850
00:48:47,102 --> 00:48:50,043
that we just sort of did once and threw away.

851
00:48:50,043 --> 00:48:51,423
Everything is a stair step.

852
00:48:51,423 --> 00:48:53,063
Everything builds off of each other.

853
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:56,504
So yeah, if you have any questions,

854
00:48:56,504 --> 00:49:00,345
I've got, I think, maybe 11 minutes.

855
00:49:00,345 --> 00:49:02,226
I usually am able to do a bunch of wrap up,

856
00:49:02,226 --> 00:49:07,667
but I have to catch a flight home at about an hour, so.

857
00:49:08,002 --> 00:49:12,124
I'm not on the plane an hour, I have to be at the airport, or in my car in an hour.

858
00:49:12,124 --> 00:49:16,647
So yeah, if you have any questions, feel free to ping me.

859
00:49:16,647 --> 00:49:19,268
There's a mic there, and I will repeat your question.

860
00:49:19,268 --> 00:49:25,832
And it can be kind of about anything.

861
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,853
Hey, quick question.

862
00:49:27,853 --> 00:49:31,575
Do you have any examples of, you were talking about mavens a lot.

863
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,625
of acquiring that audience when that Kickstarter isn't involved?

864
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:42,249
There's actually, there's a bunch of ways.

865
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:44,672
So, it kinda depends on what you're actually gonna do with your project.

866
00:49:44,672 --> 00:49:48,115
We'll do the most obvious

867
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:51,759
one right now. So, say you have a demo of your game.

868
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:54,862
You got it up on Steam and you're gonna participate in a Steam demo day.

869
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:59,550
When that happens, your Steam forums are already open.

870
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,352
People are going to be talking about it online.

871
00:50:01,352 --> 00:50:04,034
It's possible you're going to find somebody talking

872
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:04,675
about your game on Reddit.

873
00:50:04,675 --> 00:50:06,596
Those are the sort of people.

874
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:10,340
You want to watch literally everything people say.

875
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,521
They're not going to be like you're never, well,

876
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:13,142
actually you might.

877
00:50:13,142 --> 00:50:14,083
If you end up at an event or something,

878
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:17,706
you might actually meet them and learn their names.

879
00:50:17,706 --> 00:50:19,287
But you're going to watch everything

880
00:50:19,287 --> 00:50:22,530
that they say because they're going to talk about it.

881
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:23,932
They're not going to be able to stop.

882
00:50:24,836 --> 00:50:26,597
It's going to be endless.

883
00:50:26,597 --> 00:50:28,738
They're going to pop up all the time.

884
00:50:28,738 --> 00:50:31,799
We have one actually in Tunic who is a fan

885
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:35,501
of past work of one of the collaborators on it.

886
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:39,803
It was really funny because they dropped into our Discord.

887
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,464
People familiar with them were like,

888
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:45,665
oh no, they're here.

889
00:50:45,665 --> 00:50:47,386
This one right here is a super fan,

890
00:50:47,386 --> 00:50:51,768
which is awesome because once you see a super fan drop on,

891
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:53,909
you can see people gravitate around them.

892
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:59,796
because they have a tendency to know more about your project it feels like

893
00:50:59,796 --> 00:51:05,061
than you do and they talk about it better than you do because they just

894
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:10,227
understand it on like a usually a very personal level you'll run into him as

895
00:51:10,227 --> 00:51:14,092
well like if we ever get to go back to real events like PAX or whatever they'll

896
00:51:14,092 --> 00:51:15,673
come and explain your game back to you

897
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:23,300
And just, I mentioned this before probably at the GDC talk, wholesale steal their words.

898
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,346
Because whatever they came up with is better than what you are going to come up with.

899
00:51:27,346 --> 00:51:28,708
That's happened more than once.

900
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:30,230
Of course.

901
00:51:31,545 --> 00:51:32,846
Hey, thanks for the talk.

902
00:51:32,846 --> 00:51:34,626
Uh, I had two things.

903
00:51:34,626 --> 00:51:40,127
Uh, the first was how do you approach, um, post launch content, stuff like speed

904
00:51:40,127 --> 00:51:42,688
running, like GDQ, uh, Chickory was at GDQ.

905
00:51:42,688 --> 00:51:46,108
And I assume that was something you were aware of and involved with.

906
00:51:46,108 --> 00:51:49,869
Uh, and then the second one is when you have these projects that, you know, you

907
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:54,350
are working on stuff very long in advance, how do you decide what is the project

908
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,390
that I'm going to work on today?

909
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,050
Like, how do you know?

910
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:01,155
okay we need to be prepping assets for Tunic versus Chicory versus whatever else is still

911
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:10,603
in the pipeline. Those are good questions. So the first one is about GDQ. So Chicory was debuted at

912
00:52:10,603 --> 00:52:18,030
the Speedrunning Awesome Games Done Quick in January. And the second question is like,

913
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:22,284
How do you pick and how do you fit in production?

914
00:52:22,284 --> 00:52:28,269
So first, GDQ is really interesting because we actually didn't know how it worked.

915
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:32,873
We've never really had a game in it exactly.

916
00:52:32,873 --> 00:52:36,496
You can't just say, hey, GDQ, do chicory.

917
00:52:36,496 --> 00:52:42,662
The speedrunning community are the ones who submit, like, I want to do this.

918
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:46,561
and then they get chosen or not.

919
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:50,123
So we actually didn't have much to do with that,

920
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:52,425
other than we crossed our fingers and prayed

921
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:53,445
that somebody would.

922
00:52:53,445 --> 00:52:56,707
We knew there was an active speedrunning community,

923
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,749
but we didn't really have any ins or a way

924
00:52:58,749 --> 00:52:59,669
to ask them to do that,

925
00:52:59,669 --> 00:53:03,152
and honestly, it's a faux pas, you don't.

926
00:53:03,152 --> 00:53:06,014
So we just really, really, really hoped that they would,

927
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:09,676
because we knew all the people who speedrun it,

928
00:53:09,676 --> 00:53:12,238
because Greg is super, absolutely loves speedrunning.

929
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:19,126
When it got selected, so talking about working ahead, we had this dream of doing this custom PS5,

930
00:53:19,126 --> 00:53:23,528
which are obviously very, very hard to get a hold of. My community manager,

931
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:28,391
because he's on the computer all day and needs to keep his airline card active during COVID,

932
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:37,435
has been sourcing PS5s for friends and family. That's how I got mine. But he sourced me the

933
00:53:37,435 --> 00:53:42,117
second PS5 in February of 2020.

934
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:47,222
I had that PS5 sitting in my house for a very long time.

935
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:50,143
And we started talking to Zandra, and I was like,

936
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,163
hey, you want to paint these plates?

937
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:53,323
We'll ship them to you.

938
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:57,724
We didn't know what we were going to do with that PS5.

939
00:53:57,724 --> 00:54:01,005
I just had it done and had no place to put it.

940
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:06,326
And when GDQ, like Chickory, got into it,

941
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:10,847
I asked Kevin from Power Up Audio for an intro.

942
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,287
I was like, I got a prize for you.

943
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:14,850
I don't know what I'm going to do with it.

944
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:21,313
I have this PS5 that we painted, and this is a cool, charity-focused way to offload

945
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:24,854
this beautiful thing."

946
00:54:24,854 --> 00:54:31,478
So it was one of those moments where I was, I have a painted PS5, how am I going to offload

947
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:31,798
this?

948
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:36,100
I didn't know how, and I was just waiting for an opportunity to do something with it.

949
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:36,920
And that sounds...

950
00:54:38,284 --> 00:54:41,305
crazy, probably, but it was such a good idea,

951
00:54:41,305 --> 00:54:43,906
an opportunity will come up.

952
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,267
So that's how we got rid of it.

953
00:54:45,267 --> 00:54:49,349
We didn't have anything to do with Chicory getting in,

954
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:54,371
but once I saw the opportunity, I did something with it.

955
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:56,332
And I got to donate a cool PS5 to charity.

956
00:54:56,332 --> 00:54:57,952
I don't know who got it.

957
00:54:57,952 --> 00:55:01,174
I really would love to see a picture with this person

958
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:06,656
who has this beautiful black light painted PS5 someday.

959
00:55:07,793 --> 00:55:09,454
Second question, production schedule.

960
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:12,477
How do I figure out, like, am I going to make a Glory Society trailer today,

961
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:14,778
or am I going to do a chicory asset?

962
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:18,902
Are we going to, like, focus on a gif or a talk or?

963
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,643
When you look at the calendar out in front of you,

964
00:55:20,643 --> 00:55:23,145
you have a pretty good idea of where things are going to slot in.

965
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:28,289
And you also know what you're working on production wise.

966
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:33,784
You often are able to slot these sort of things into breaks.

967
00:55:33,784 --> 00:55:39,350
People just can't program and solve things endlessly forever.

968
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:42,073
Building these marketing assets are like using creative time

969
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:43,075
in a different way.

970
00:55:43,075 --> 00:55:45,598
And we usually try to slot them in a way to give people breaks.

971
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:53,157
So a lot of the trailer work was done in breaks between things

972
00:55:53,157 --> 00:55:55,497
before a portion of the game was started

973
00:55:55,497 --> 00:55:57,298
or after it was finished up.

974
00:55:57,298 --> 00:56:01,060
So that way, part of the materials were halfway done.

975
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,661
And then when they sat down to do it,

976
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,122
they were able to knock it out in a week.

977
00:56:06,122 --> 00:56:09,923
We work that way in Fingy internal 100% of the time.

978
00:56:09,923 --> 00:56:11,824
Right now, we're stewing on a pretty big project.

979
00:56:11,824 --> 00:56:15,965
We're not going to build that until the last week of April.

980
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:28,336
Because we want it storyboarded, we want all the pieces of it already ready to go before we like sit down, so we don't like just bang up against like a wall trying to figure out a way to make it work.

981
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:39,962
So we usually have a pretty good idea of like these are the things we're going to need in the future, about how much time are they going to take. And as soon as we see that time we slot them in.

982
00:56:39,962 --> 00:56:41,944
So we don't stress people out.

983
00:56:41,944 --> 00:56:42,984
Does that make sense? Cool.

984
00:56:44,765 --> 00:56:47,086
Hi there, and thanks for our talk.

985
00:56:47,086 --> 00:56:50,846
So, let's talk a bit about money.

986
00:56:50,846 --> 00:56:53,367
If you were to kind of count all the resources

987
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:55,547
involved in marketing, be it, I don't know,

988
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:59,348
hours of work, straight up money spent on it,

989
00:56:59,348 --> 00:57:01,908
compare that to the money that,

990
00:57:01,908 --> 00:57:04,769
or resources that you spent making the game,

991
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:07,289
what's kind of the ratio between the two?

992
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:13,170
For marketing, it's actually quite low.

993
00:57:14,032 --> 00:57:21,674
pretty tiny company so I'd probably probably in total across all of the

994
00:57:21,674 --> 00:57:26,335
chicory stuff and I have to discount I'm not gonna include salaries for my staff

995
00:57:26,335 --> 00:57:30,536
no okay living salaries for well salaries for staff it's a little weird

996
00:57:30,536 --> 00:57:34,997
because they're working on like five projects right now so I'm gonna give you

997
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:41,059
two numbers so in total like all the things that I spent on chicory over

998
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:42,820
probably two years

999
00:57:43,578 --> 00:57:49,867
We're probably looking at maybe $18,000 to $20,000 tops.

1000
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:50,167
Okay.

1001
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:53,472
That's like a online booth.

1002
00:57:56,662 --> 00:57:59,983
maybe a computer, the PS5 is pricey,

1003
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:04,504
paying Xandra to paint it, shipping that thing around.

1004
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:08,526
We did have a small advertising campaign,

1005
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:12,147
which was I think like maybe 7,500 across both our tests

1006
00:58:12,147 --> 00:58:14,987
and the like one week that we did.

1007
00:58:14,987 --> 00:58:17,888
And that went really far, it was surprising.

1008
00:58:17,888 --> 00:58:23,290
And kind of how, like what percentage of the time

1009
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,990
does the staff work on marketing stuff?

1010
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:30,093
So my staff goes full-time on projects when we need to be full-time on it.

1011
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:42,061
So during Chicory's time, we did, they were probably doing at least probably 10 to 15

1012
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:49,045
hours of Chicory work right up until six months pre-launch.

1013
00:58:49,045 --> 00:58:52,888
And then it was probably closer to 20 to 25 hours of work.

1014
00:58:53,515 --> 00:58:56,557
And that's across trailer.

1015
00:58:56,557 --> 00:58:58,718
This staff also does launch management,

1016
00:58:58,718 --> 00:59:01,500
so cutting up the assets into 500 different ways

1017
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,840
for storefronts.

1018
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,903
The 10 to 15 different versions of the trailer

1019
00:59:06,903 --> 00:59:08,784
that you need with the different branding on it.

1020
00:59:08,784 --> 00:59:15,648
And so this is a staff of me, Harris, Emily.

1021
00:59:15,648 --> 00:59:18,429
And then ICO handled the PR.

1022
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:22,892
And they probably did five to seven hours of work.

1023
00:59:23,245 --> 00:59:31,367
a week. So, yeah, whatever that budget is. I can't, the number won't help because it's

1024
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,787
going to be in USD, really.

1025
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:37,688
Yeah, no, I was more trying to get a sense of kind of the scale of work.

1026
00:59:37,688 --> 00:59:38,369
The hours, yeah.

1027
00:59:38,369 --> 00:59:39,869
Yeah, the scale of work.

1028
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:45,990
So, if this was only my job, I could have done all of the work solo.

1029
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:46,771
Okay.

1030
00:59:46,771 --> 00:59:49,911
Like, it is technically one person's job.

1031
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:51,172
In how many months?

1032
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,892
I mean, it's like six months of work.

1033
00:59:53,397 --> 00:59:56,220
Okay, so six months of work for one person is kind of...

1034
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,763
Yeah, but the way our studio is structured,

1035
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,284
like Harris also runs our Discord.

1036
01:00:01,284 --> 01:00:02,546
No, of course, but yeah, that's the scale.

1037
01:00:02,546 --> 01:00:02,906
Okay, cool, thanks.

1038
01:00:02,906 --> 01:00:03,146
Yep.

1039
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:05,648
The thing with PR though,

1040
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:08,311
is it's not six months of full-time work.

1041
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:09,972
It's 18 months of part-time work.

1042
01:00:09,972 --> 01:00:12,855
And then one really awful week.

1043
01:00:12,855 --> 01:00:15,978
Thanks for the talk.

1044
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:17,499
Oh, of course.

1045
01:00:17,499 --> 01:00:19,481
I know we're at time, I saw you, okay.

1046
01:00:20,023 --> 01:00:25,566
What's the approach to creating the demo for a narrative game in your sense?

1047
01:00:25,566 --> 01:00:31,469
Do you take like a vertical slide as to like the middle of the game and just present it or do you like

1048
01:00:31,469 --> 01:00:35,631
Create the first part of the game and present the story up until one point and then cut it off on demo

1049
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:39,953
It's actually a really good question because I've had to do this several times

1050
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:46,797
So the question is how when you're building a narrative game, you're obviously you're in a position where you're gonna spoil a whole bunch of stuff

1051
01:00:46,797 --> 01:00:47,637
How do you?

1052
01:00:48,842 --> 01:00:52,764
Pick which part of the game you're going to show in a demo.

1053
01:00:52,764 --> 01:00:54,884
So I could do a whole talk about demo design,

1054
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:58,966
because it's important, especially if you're

1055
01:00:58,966 --> 01:01:01,627
going to be showing this on a show floor.

1056
01:01:01,627 --> 01:01:03,928
I have rules about length, 10 to 15 minutes,

1057
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:06,929
especially if it's on a convention show floor.

1058
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,570
And you want to drop them into a place

1059
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:13,992
where knowing exactly who and what the characters are

1060
01:01:13,992 --> 01:01:16,573
is not required to have a good time with the story.

1061
01:01:17,637 --> 01:01:22,798
So, we did two or three different demos with Night in the Woods.

1062
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,879
The first one was a very bespoke.

1063
01:01:26,879 --> 01:01:30,740
Most of that first demo didn't even end up in the main game.

1064
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:38,001
It was just intro May, get her to a place where you sort of interacted with her friends,

1065
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:45,183
do band practice, throw a gnome off the top of a rooftop, eat some donuts, done.

1066
01:01:46,825 --> 01:01:47,845
That's a real thing.

1067
01:01:47,845 --> 01:01:51,687
I can't believe I say these words out loud in order, but that's a video game.

1068
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:55,209
The second one, however, cut, um, one of the friend quests.

1069
01:01:55,209 --> 01:02:00,952
Um, so you are hanging out with B and you're in the mall and it's again, the

1070
01:02:00,952 --> 01:02:05,495
same thing it's showing you're walking, you're doing the mini game, you're

1071
01:02:05,495 --> 01:02:07,656
getting an understanding of like sort of the humor.

1072
01:02:08,066 --> 01:02:09,807
But there's nothing about it that's

1073
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:12,528
going to spoil the contents of the game.

1074
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:16,109
We never, ever in a demo show the very end of the game.

1075
01:02:16,109 --> 01:02:18,890
In a narrative game, we never show the very beginning.

1076
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:21,891
Because the very beginning is like onboarding.

1077
01:02:21,891 --> 01:02:22,671
Who are these people?

1078
01:02:22,671 --> 01:02:23,311
It's not boring.

1079
01:02:23,311 --> 01:02:23,912
It's great.

1080
01:02:23,912 --> 01:02:25,332
But it's real boring for a demo.

1081
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:27,973
Because what you want to get them to is the game loop.

1082
01:02:27,973 --> 01:02:29,754
And for a narrative game, there's

1083
01:02:29,754 --> 01:02:31,754
probably going to be something there for the game loop.

1084
01:02:31,754 --> 01:02:33,775
And it's probably going to be cut

1085
01:02:33,775 --> 01:02:35,936
from a scene in chapter two.

1086
01:02:36,983 --> 01:02:41,425
So find your 10 to 20 minute long scene in that chapter.

1087
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:45,047
And then cut out the spoilers.

1088
01:02:45,047 --> 01:02:48,348
So it doesn't actually have to be shippable content.

1089
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:53,471
It can be, oops, it can be like a very custom version of it.

1090
01:02:53,471 --> 01:02:55,572
We can even, I guess, build something

1091
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:58,033
that's not gonna be shown ever on the game

1092
01:02:58,033 --> 01:02:59,293
just for the demo's purpose.

1093
01:02:59,495 --> 01:03:00,215
Oh, absolutely.

1094
01:03:00,215 --> 01:03:06,778
I mean, the Night in the Woods initial demo was, I mean, I think it's technically actually

1095
01:03:06,778 --> 01:03:11,560
built into the final game, but nothing actually is pulled in.

1096
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,801
It was all replaced.

1097
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:20,203
But I can still find it actually in the script, like in the tags and stuff.

1098
01:03:20,203 --> 01:03:21,504
Thank you.

1099
01:03:21,504 --> 01:03:22,544
Of course.

1100
01:03:22,544 --> 01:03:24,925
Any other questions, comments?

1101
01:03:24,925 --> 01:03:26,566
Okay, cool.

1102
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:27,727
Feel free to reach out to me.

1103
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:28,607
Feel free to reach out to me.

1104
01:03:29,904 --> 01:03:33,589
I'm easily found and very approachable.

1105
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:34,431
So, thank you. ♪♪
