1
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,843
I know it's one of the last sessions of the day, so thank you for turning up.

2
00:00:07,664 --> 00:00:16,907
You've come to a talk about Rubik's Cubes at a game developers conference, so congratulations.

3
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:25,991
In 1982, there's an estimated 100 million to 1 billion Rubik's Cubes in the world, including

4
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:26,491
counterfeits.

5
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:31,017
And it's easy to see why. They're very interesting to look at.

6
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:36,479
They are fun to hold and to twist. It's immediately obvious what the goal is.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,181
It's immediately obvious what the tools at your disposal to reach that goal.

8
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:44,803
But it's also incredibly, incredibly hard to solve.

9
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:49,625
And by the end of 1982, everyone who wanted to buy a Rubik's Cube had bought one,

10
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:51,626
and they had all figured out that they couldn't solve it.

11
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:57,208
So they went on people's bookshelves,

12
00:00:57,528 --> 00:01:00,530
and the sales dried up almost overnight.

13
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:09,297
But today, people meet in hotel convention centers

14
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:11,418
all over the world to see who can solve it fastest.

15
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,401
It's a real hobby with a global governing body

16
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,942
and a vibrant and growing player base.

17
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:19,525
So how did it go from a dead toy to what it is today?

18
00:01:21,072 --> 00:01:21,452
I'm Andrew.

19
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:25,674
I've been a developer since 2004, but for the purposes of this talk, my credentials

20
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:27,655
are that I can solve a Rubik's Cube in 26.4 seconds.

21
00:01:27,675 --> 00:01:33,038
We're going to talk a little bit today about what speedcubing is.

22
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,281
And then most of the talk we're going to spend on how it became a thing all on its own without

23
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:42,483
any kind of corporate body pushing it as a thing.

24
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:47,146
So first of all, if we want to talk about speedcubing, we need to talk a little bit

25
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,567
about how to solve a Rubik's Cube.

26
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:49,227
I don't want to...

27
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:55,526
I don't want to spoil the joy for any of you if you choose to leave here and try and discover

28
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:56,806
how to solve the Rubik's Cube for yourself.

29
00:01:57,806 --> 00:02:02,047
But I do want to cover some of the basic fundamentals for how we're going to solve it.

30
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:04,187
Let's get my little laser pointer.

31
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:09,968
So the first thing most people do when they try and solve the Rubik's Cube and what everyone

32
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:14,989
did in the 80s was get one face, all the stickers matching on one face, think they're making

33
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:18,550
one sixth of the progress towards solving the cube and then discover that doing the

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,530
next face is actually incredibly hard.

35
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,613
and the problem that they hit upon was that they were solving the stickers rather than

36
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:28,513
solving the pieces.

37
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:32,656
So there are three different types of pieces on a Rubik's Cube, they're called cubelets.

38
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:33,977
There are three different types of cubelets.

39
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:39,661
There are these centerpieces here, and you can see there's three we can see, the yellow,

40
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,962
the orange, and the green.

41
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:46,205
There are the edge pieces that have two stickers, like these ones, and there are corner pieces

42
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:47,066
that have three stickers.

43
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:53,366
Now, when we manipulate the cube, all we can do is turn the face of the cube.

44
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:58,393
And when we turn the face of a cube, one of the faces, we see the centerpiece stays still.

45
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:00,757
All these pieces around here stay still.

46
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:03,466
and then these pieces around the edge move.

47
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:04,927
And the same on this face.

48
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:08,567
Like if we turn this face, this orange centerpiece will stay absolutely still,

49
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,288
these pieces will move,

50
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,168
and then these pieces all around the edge will stay still.

51
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:17,489
So there's not actually any way, any manipulation you can make to this cube

52
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:18,969
that will move those centerpieces.

53
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,110
They're fixed relative to each other.

54
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,370
Green will always be next to orange, will always be next to yellow.

55
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,031
And so the only thing we actually have to do to solve the cube

56
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,512
is get these edge pieces and these corner pieces in the right place.

57
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:37,298
In each one, they already have an identified place they should be.

58
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:39,459
So if we look at this edge piece here, it has two stickers.

59
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:40,780
It has green and it has yellow.

60
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,042
So it must go between the green center and the yellow center.

61
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:45,243
So it must go exactly here.

62
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,305
There's only one piece that can go in that slot,

63
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:49,486
and there's only one slot for that piece to go into.

64
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:51,147
Same with the corner piece.

65
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,628
It has three stickers, we can see it's got green and orange,

66
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:55,909
so it must go between these green and orange centers.

67
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,090
We see it's also got white, but this is the yellow face,

68
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,871
so we can intuit that white must be on the bottom here,

69
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:04,432
and this corner piece must go here into this slot.

70
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:09,674
And then we're simply going to solve it layer by layer.

71
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:13,955
So when you solve the first layer of a cube, it looks a bit like this.

72
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:17,277
You can see those, because we've solved pieces instead of stickers,

73
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:18,777
you can see those sides of the cube.

74
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,228
at that satisfying T shape to them.

75
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:26,250
And most people, given enough time, can intuit how to do this step on their own.

76
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:31,712
The second stage is to move the middle pieces down into the...

77
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,233
the edge pieces down into the middle layer.

78
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:36,134
And you can see there's only four of them that have to go in to complete that.

79
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:37,714
Two-thirds of the cube are completed.

80
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:40,915
And most people, given more time, can complete this second step.

81
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,643
The last step is to correctly position and orientate all of the pieces in the last layer,

82
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,785
which is incredibly difficult and has loads of edge cases and you have no scratch space

83
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:51,386
to do it into.

84
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:57,269
So if I were you and you were interested in getting a Rubik's Cube, I would try and intuit

85
00:04:57,309 --> 00:05:01,531
these first two steps and especially if you're interested more in speedcubing than anything

86
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:05,854
else than the puzzle nature of it, then I would just skip the third step and look up

87
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:06,254
a solution.

88
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:13,933
But speedcubers aren't intuiting how to solve the cube every time they do a speed solve.

89
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:14,914
I'm not doing that.

90
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:17,016
I couldn't do that in 30 seconds.

91
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,659
We're using several tools in order to get us to that step.

92
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,460
And one of the first tools we're using is algorithms.

93
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,863
So we're breaking the solve down into many individual steps.

94
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:28,466
You've already seen some of them, first layer, middle layer, last layer.

95
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:30,287
But then you can break it down even further.

96
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,796
And so you recognize the current step you're on,

97
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:34,798
you know the step you want to be on next,

98
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,142
and then you will have memorized the exact moves,

99
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:40,745
the exact turns that get you from this sub-step

100
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:42,587
to the next sub-step, and that's called an algorithm.

101
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:44,309
And it uses this notation you can see

102
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,390
along the bottom of the slide here,

103
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,192
which is just telling you exactly which face to turn

104
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:48,053
and how far to turn it.

105
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:53,867
And this algorithm we're looking at is taking that middle piece down and to the right.

106
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,469
So when you have a piece on the top layer that you know needs to go down and to the

107
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:01,031
right, you just execute these steps and it will be down and to the right and the rest

108
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,131
of the cube won't be disturbed.

109
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:04,573
So algorithms.

110
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,134
You have to learn.

111
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:11,156
A beginner probably needs to know half a dozen algorithms in order to finish the cube.

112
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:16,119
The best speedcubers in the world will probably know hundreds of algorithms if not thousands

113
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:16,640
of algorithms.

114
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,641
And it's just about practice, repetition, like ingraining it in your memory.

115
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:26,482
And then the next step is executing those algorithms really fast.

116
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,162
This is called turns per second, or TPS.

117
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:32,283
The best cubers will have upwards of ten, their solves will have upwards of ten turns

118
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:33,163
in every second.

119
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:38,205
And that's a matter of manipulating the cube in such a way that you don't have to re-grip

120
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,945
and let go and move your hands, because that's the slowest thing you can do when you're

121
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:41,725
manipulating the cube.

122
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:43,329
is to turn it around in your hands.

123
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,390
Try and get your hand on the top to turn the top.

124
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,012
So, speedcubers use their fingers and their thumbs

125
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:51,014
and every digit to manipulate the cube on all the faces

126
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:52,015
without having to re-grip.

127
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:55,438
And again, practice, muscle memory, repetition.

128
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:58,880
And we're aiming to reach this point of ultimacity

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,523
or over-learning where you know

130
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:04,584
what you're executing so well

131
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,606
that it can kind of just do it by itself.

132
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,147
Just the way when you're driving a car,

133
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:09,208
you can...

134
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:17,830
You can turn left without having to think about slowing down and using the gears and indicating and moving the steering wheel.

135
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,471
You just turn left and carry on with your conversation while you're doing it.

136
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:28,515
So we're over learning and getting this level of automicity so we can do this next step, which is look ahead.

137
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:34,457
In Lookahead, the idea is that as you're executing an algorithm and moving to the next step,

138
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:38,922
you can already be looking at the cube and trying to figure out what the step after that

139
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,124
is going to be and what the next algorithm is going to be.

140
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:44,368
So you can queue it up and as soon as you finish executing one algorithm, you go straight

141
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:45,149
into the next algorithm.

142
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:50,673
In this GIF, there is a very slight pause where this speed solver, who does like a 10-second

143
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:55,875
solve, this speed solver has a break-stand look-ahead just there.

144
00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:01,197
They didn't do enough look-ahead, they have to stop, waste time, and look at the cube

145
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:02,117
without doing like this.

146
00:08:02,237 --> 00:08:05,979
The cube is completely static for like a second while they figure out what the next state

147
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,199
or what the next algorithm is going to be.

148
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,820
With good look-ahead, that would never happen.

149
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,321
Every solve would just be a constant flow of moves.

150
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:15,305
So that's how you solve really fast.

151
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:17,447
So how do you solve really fast in competition?

152
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:20,850
This is Felix Zemdeg, who's probably,

153
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,252
well, definitely the greatest living speedcuber

154
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:23,933
we have at the moment.

155
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:25,475
This is him setting the world record in 2018.

156
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:28,257
This isn't actually the current world record.

157
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:31,020
The current world record is held by Yuxin Du of China,

158
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,403
who set a record of 3.47 seconds.

159
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,305
He can solve the Rubik's Cube faster

160
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,446
than I can say 3.47 seconds.

161
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:45,350
But unfortunately there's no good video of that one, so you've got this 4.22 record instead.

162
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,532
So every competition is run exactly the same.

163
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:53,935
The first step is your Rubik's Cube is taken away, a random scramble is applied to it,

164
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:59,137
it's brought back to you hidden under a cup, you can see the cup to the right of this GIF

165
00:08:59,177 --> 00:08:59,718
when it starts.

166
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:03,340
It's brought to you under a cup, and then the cup is lifted.

167
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,166
and you're given 15 seconds to pick up and look at the cube.

168
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:11,107
And the best speakers now will be plotting their first 10 or 15 moves out

169
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:12,468
as they're looking at this step.

170
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:14,088
Then you put the cube down again.

171
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:16,629
You put your hands on the timing buttons,

172
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:18,590
which Felix is going to do now.

173
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,510
Take your hands off.

174
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:21,631
Now the timer has started.

175
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,091
Solve it as fast as you can.

176
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:23,972
Get it back on the mat.

177
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:25,232
Put your hands back on the buttons.

178
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:27,693
The second you get your hand back on the button, the timer stops.

179
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,433
And that is your time.

180
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:33,788
You do that five times with five different scrambles.

181
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:36,070
And when you've finished, we take your best scramble

182
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,731
and your worst scramble, we throw away those times

183
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:39,633
and you take the mean average of the remaining time

184
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,414
and that is your average of five.

185
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,915
And the competition is simply

186
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,216
who has the best average of five.

187
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:47,138
So you put that all together

188
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:48,880
and you have what I think is a sport.

189
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:56,919
Bennett Foddy in his GDC talk in 2014 talked about the three characteristics that he thinks makes a game a sport and he talked about

190
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:03,123
Integrity which is there's no easy way to cheat and there's no easy way to buy your way to the top

191
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:09,066
and if you don't know the scramble, there's no easy way to glitch your cube into the correct state fast and

192
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:12,748
You can buy the best speedcube in the world

193
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:18,152
It will cost you the price of a triple-a console game and it won't take you from a one minute solve to a ten seconds

194
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:19,452
So it has integrity

195
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:25,801
The second is stakes, and that doesn't necessarily mean big winner's checks, although that helps,

196
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:29,863
but it means is there an easy way where I can compare my performance to someone else's

197
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:31,083
performance and know who won.

198
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:35,305
Because we have the average of five score and your personal best, that's very, very

199
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:35,566
easy.

200
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:36,346
So we have stakes.

201
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:43,950
And the last one is performance, and that's the idea of I know how to do, I know what

202
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,251
I need to do, but not how to do it.

203
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:47,972
And also this aspect of...

204
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,561
how someone's 30 seconds solve will look very different to another person's 30 seconds solve.

205
00:10:55,601 --> 00:11:00,482
There's this aspect of performance coming through and personality coming through in the way they solve the cube.

206
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:02,963
So you put all those things together and it is,

207
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:07,065
by FODE standards, a sport. And it's a growing sport.

208
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:11,866
This is stats from the World Governing Body of Speedcubing showing the number of competitions and

209
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,707
the number of countries going up year on year. This isn't just

210
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:17,608
an American thing or Chinese thing. This is worldwide.

211
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:19,952
And also the number of players going up.

212
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:23,573
Last year, in-person competitions, over 40,000 players.

213
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,794
And you can imagine there's probably people

214
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,474
who count themselves as part of the hobby,

215
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:28,395
as part of the pastime,

216
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:30,196
who don't go to in-person competitions.

217
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:30,896
That includes me.

218
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:34,837
So maybe 10 times that number, maybe 15 times that number.

219
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:38,699
We can say maybe top estimate,

220
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,580
maybe there's a million speedcubers in the world,

221
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,740
which is pretty impressive.

222
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:44,541
So that's the state of speedcubing today.

223
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:45,502
So how did we get there?

224
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:51,269
And I'm gonna break this down in terms of different puzzles

225
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,871
that speedcubing had to solve as a community.

226
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:01,195
And the first one is organization.

227
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,178
So there were people all around the world

228
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:06,359
through the 80s and the 90s

229
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:07,860
who were interested in speed solving

230
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,800
and were speed solving,

231
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,782
but they were doing it in small local communities.

232
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:13,744
And there was no global organization.

233
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,589
And that changed in the late 90s and early 2000s.

234
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,630
That changed, it started organizing on a global scale.

235
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,070
And the short answer of how that happened

236
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,271
is just the internet.

237
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:27,372
But once people started talking in IRC and in forums,

238
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:31,854
then this notion of trying to run a world championship

239
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:35,395
started growing, and trying to organize the sport as a sport

240
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:36,215
rather than just a hobby.

241
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,268
And it happened for the first time in 2003.

242
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:43,472
They held the first of the modern Rubik's World

243
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:45,093
Championships, Speedcubing World Championships.

244
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:46,835
And it was run by this man on the right, Dan Gosby.

245
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,919
And there were a fair number of teething troubles to do

246
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,882
with running this event.

247
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:55,402
And

248
00:12:56,493 --> 00:13:00,734
There was a fair amount of backlash, which is probably, in hindsight, entirely overblown,

249
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:05,116
but still, Dan Gosby took this criticism rather personally,

250
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,536
and he left the scene immediately after organizing this event.

251
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:12,157
And this is an interesting inflection point in the history of speedcubing,

252
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:16,618
because his style of world championship is very different to the world championship that we have today.

253
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:20,339
It's very different to that average of five format that I've already shown you.

254
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,120
He was much more interested in a much more confrontational...

255
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,485
It's a television sport where there were mind games and it was much more like wrestling

256
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,767
where you could even know if you weren't technically the best solver you could still win because

257
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:35,148
you could get inside someone else's head.

258
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:38,771
And that's very different to what we have these days so it's interesting to think about

259
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,633
what the sport would be like if he had stayed around.

260
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,340
So the next year, two people from the different sides of the world came together

261
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,982
and decided they needed some kind of umbrella organization

262
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:56,165
to help regulate the sport and organize events.

263
00:13:56,505 --> 00:14:00,708
And that was Tyson Mow on the left, who was part of the Californian speedcubing scene,

264
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:03,789
and Ron Van Bucum on the right, who was part of the Netherlands scene.

265
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,571
And they formed the WCA, the World Cube Association, in 2003.

266
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:06,911
In 2004, sorry.

267
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:15,396
And the next year they held their first WCA World Championship, which is weirdly hard

268
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:18,878
to find good photos of, so you've got the really low-res rubbish stuff.

269
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,380
And it was a success, people enjoyed it.

270
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,303
It wasn't perfect, there were problems, but generally people had a good reaction to it,

271
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:26,945
and then we were off to the races.

272
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:29,406
Ever since, there was a World Championship every two years.

273
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:35,484
So what did WCA do that, what did they bring to the table

274
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:37,985
that helps improve the sport and the community?

275
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:40,306
And I think there was a couple of factors here.

276
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,707
The first is this aspect of consistency.

277
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:47,109
So the Average of Five format that I've told you about

278
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:49,410
is exactly the same at your local meetup.

279
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,093
at your nationals and at the world championships.

280
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:55,818
So it's very easy for you to attend any one of those levels

281
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:59,142
and then move up or down the scale.

282
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:00,885
It's very accessible to you to do that.

283
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:02,827
And it's also very easy for the organizers

284
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,730
because they've already run countless events

285
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,691
of the exact same format.

286
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:07,593
The only thing that changes is how many people are entering.

287
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:14,059
They also have a very accessible format.

288
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:18,080
So last year, Ralph Costa et al.

289
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,700
published some work on trust spectrums,

290
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,401
which they wanted to use to categorize

291
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:25,861
MMO and online communities.

292
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:27,421
But I think applies here as well.

293
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:30,942
So Ralph Costa would categorize this as,

294
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:34,982
speedcubing as a game with lots of parallel play,

295
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:37,683
which means I can solve my Rubik's cubes

296
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,783
and you can solve your Rubik's cubes

297
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,183
and we don't really impact on each other.

298
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:44,126
There are no what they called roles in this sport,

299
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:48,330
which means I don't need to wait for someone to solve a 4x4 if I want to solve a 3x3.

300
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,271
And they were independent resources.

301
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:54,415
I can take as long or as slow as I want to solve my cubes,

302
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:56,937
and you can take as long as you want, and we don't impact each other.

303
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,719
And when you put all those together,

304
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:03,102
they would categorize this sport as a low trust game, which sounds...

305
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:07,585
divisive, but it's not. What it means is it's very, very accessible.

306
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:12,548
It's very easy for someone to come along and join the sport, and it's very easy for people to start up their own

307
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:20,792
their own events, because they don't need some minimum bar of quality player or some minimum quantity of people in order for it to happen.

308
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:22,993
And I think that's vital. When you have,

309
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:27,375
when you're starting with a puzzle that already has such a large learning curve,

310
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:33,218
having a sport associated with it that actually has a really shallow learning curve helps balance that out.

311
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,370
The WCA also has what they call the delegate system.

312
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,232
And this means that any event anywhere in the world can be an official WCA event and

313
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:48,013
can have official world records and official national records set at it as long as it has

314
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:49,594
a WCA delegate in attendance.

315
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:55,196
And that is someone who's trained in the WCA regulations as well as how to run a WCA event.

316
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:59,597
Now the interesting thing is that any WCA delegate...

317
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:00,458
Excuse me.

318
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:02,999
can train another WCA delegate.

319
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,580
So Ron Van Buchen, who you saw a few slides ago,

320
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,841
used to fill his suitcase up with Rubik's Cubes,

321
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:11,202
fly to some far-flung corner of the world

322
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:12,382
where he knew there were some people

323
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:13,523
interested in running events,

324
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:16,103
train them as delegates, leave them with the cubes,

325
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,164
and then within a year or two,

326
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:19,985
that country was full of delegates

327
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,746
trained to run events, and they were having

328
00:17:22,246 --> 00:17:25,007
like half a dozen events a year.

329
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:29,048
So it helps it spread almost like a virus.

330
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:35,154
And then finally, it's a very non-confrontational sport,

331
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:39,918
as opposed to, like, Dan Gosby's model

332
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,379
of a more wrestling-style sport.

333
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,742
In fact, which is actually to its detriment

334
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,143
in terms of a spectator sport,

335
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:48,505
because if you're watching two people,

336
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:49,526
and in the World Championships,

337
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,747
they have the top two cubers on the stage,

338
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:53,489
and they'll solve in turns.

339
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:54,630
So one will do their first solve,

340
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,731
the other one will do their first solve,

341
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,792
the first one will do its second solve, and so on.

342
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,102
But it's actually really hard for you as a spectator to work out who's in the lead right now,

343
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:07,768
because you have to do all that mental arithmetic of throwing away the best and the worst and doing an average.

344
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,515
So really all it comes down to is there's no strategic decision to make.

345
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:15,499
Just make your next solve really fast. That's the only option.

346
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:21,649
And that makes it very collegiate, it makes it very friendly, because all you're focused

347
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:23,870
on is doing well and solving fast.

348
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,472
And if someone beats you in an event, it doesn't really matter as long as you're pushing your

349
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:30,512
personal best forward.

350
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:34,353
And so everyone's really happy for everyone else as long as everyone's making progress.

351
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,834
And it makes it a very friendly sport to be part of.

352
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:40,655
So now we've got organization.

353
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:50,012
What we need now is innovation so we can have more exciting, interesting things to do in

354
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:50,392
a sport.

355
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:56,097
And the major factor standing in the way of that at one point was the Rubik's Cube itself,

356
00:18:56,297 --> 00:19:03,002
the brand, the company behind it produced these cubes that are very good toys, but they're

357
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:04,083
not good speed cubes.

358
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:10,529
They're slow, they're inconsistent, they take ages to break in, they're very awkward to

359
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:10,869
use.

360
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:18,561
And I mentioned that the 2005, the WCA World Championships weren't perfect, and one of

361
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:22,564
the things that wasn't perfect about it was that you had to use official brand, freshly

362
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:24,925
unboxed Rubik's Cubes as part of the competition.

363
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:30,488
And this was both unfair because people were getting, some people were getting cubes that

364
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:33,890
were relatively easy to turn and some were getting ones that were hard to turn, but also

365
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,711
unfair because...

366
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,372
Licensed Rubik's Cubes vary from country to country.

367
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:41,455
People coming from Japan, very used to a different color scheme,

368
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:42,496
color scheme layout.

369
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:45,179
And you can imagine that can make it very awkward to solve fast if

370
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,301
white is no longer opposite yellow.

371
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,209
And Tyson Marrow now says this was a mistake.

372
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,273
He says, it's not the Nike 100 meters in the Olympics.

373
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,835
It doesn't matter what trainers you're wearing.

374
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,439
What matters is your time investment

375
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,800
and your skill level and your talent.

376
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,603
And so from that point onwards,

377
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:02,505
the WCA have been very happy to take

378
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:05,129
Rubik's brand sponsorship money,

379
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:07,351
but you can use any cube you want in the competition.

380
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:13,461
And so people started popping up, wanting to design better speedcubes for speedcubers.

381
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:15,142
But they were still having trouble.

382
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:19,985
If you remember, at the beginning of the talk, I said there was a billion cubes in the world,

383
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,105
including counterfeits.

384
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:25,488
And Seven Towns, which is the company that owns the Rubik's Cube brand, still has this

385
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:26,608
hangover from the 80s of being very...

386
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:31,517
very, very protective of Rubik's Cube and of counterfeit Rubik's Cubes.

387
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:35,260
And they'll use things like patents and trademarks to try and stop people

388
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,282
selling what they think are counterfeit products.

389
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:42,205
Unfortunately, speedcube designers often got caught in the crossfire of that.

390
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:47,529
And so there was a stage in the mid-2010s where it's like good speedcubes were being

391
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:52,213
sold flat-packed like this to try and avoid any implication that this was like an official Rubik's product.

392
00:20:53,606 --> 00:21:00,475
That eased up in the mid 2010s, and I'd love to do a whole talk about the patent-like cases

393
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:04,921
and trademark cases and stuff, but I don't think that's a GDC talk that people would

394
00:21:04,941 --> 00:21:05,462
be interested in.

395
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:10,176
But it eased up, and now these days there's a tremendous variety of different speedcubes

396
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:13,337
and innovative designs in the market on making faster speedcubes.

397
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:18,118
Things like having springs inside your cube that can make it more forgiving of bad turns,

398
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:22,099
having magnets which make it more stable, having...

399
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:27,420
Customization is the thing this last 12 months, of being able to set up the cube exactly how

400
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,381
you want it, to make it your cube.

401
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:33,243
But we're still not quite sustainable.

402
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:34,445
So we've got innovation,

403
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,808
but we haven't got sustainability yet.

404
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:38,270
And this is because, like we said,

405
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,494
there's maybe a million speedcubers in the world,

406
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:44,998
but you can only really sell them one piece of plastic.

407
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,381
And these pieces of plastic aren't that expensive.

408
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:50,183
So to make it a sustainable business for the designers,

409
00:21:50,883 --> 00:21:52,684
what they need to do is sell you more plastic.

410
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:54,825
And they can't sell you the Rubik's Cube because you already have a 3x3.

411
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:58,527
So what they're going to do is manufacture different types of cubes

412
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:00,227
and sell you those things instead.

413
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:03,709
And that worked great, like that worked out great for speedcubers because...

414
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,181
One thing they can never, they can always be pushing their times down and doing better

415
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,862
and practicing more, but one thing they can never ever do is solve three by three for

416
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:12,643
the first time again.

417
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:19,185
And so getting these new puzzles, these new experiences is something they're very interested

418
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,906
in and they're very happy to purchase these things.

419
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:26,008
And so collecting as part of the hobby started, became a thing.

420
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,809
And there's two main types of collecting.

421
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,871
The first one is collecting as novelty, the idea of trying to have that first 3x3 experience again.

422
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:41,633
And you can have that either as maybe adding more layers or more dimensions to your puzzle.

423
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:46,094
So both of these kind of use 3x3 algorithms in a weird way.

424
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:51,496
Or you can have something that's fundamentally different to the Rubik's Cube.

425
00:22:51,516 --> 00:22:53,816
This one on the left is called the square one,

426
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:56,457
because it doesn't matter how many 3x3 algorithms you know,

427
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:58,438
when you unbox it, you're back to square one.

428
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:05,557
And there's also collection as aesthetic, the idea of collecting things that are interesting

429
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:06,658
or rare or novel.

430
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,923
And you've got things here, these are called shape mods, which are, these are both essentially

431
00:23:12,363 --> 00:23:13,004
Rubik's cubes.

432
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:17,589
They're both 3x3s, except they've jumbled everything around.

433
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,050
Where's my little laser pointer?

434
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,493
So, this is actually the corner piece on the fissure cube,

435
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:24,714
and this is the edge piece.

436
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:26,175
So everything's slightly twisted.

437
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:27,456
This is the ghost cube,

438
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:30,098
which has every single piece has a unique shape.

439
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:32,439
And see you're solving based on shape rather than position.

440
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,220
But it's still a 3x3.

441
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,547
And then there's things like this,

442
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:37,929
which is the Oscar van Deveter sphere gear,

443
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:39,870
which is really interesting to look at,

444
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,372
really interesting to turn, but trivially easy to solve.

445
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:45,175
No one's buying that because they want the experience

446
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:45,955
of solving the puzzle.

447
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:47,056
They're buying it because they think

448
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:48,137
it looks cool on their shelf.

449
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,502
So now we've got all the pillars I think we need

450
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:58,666
for a sustainable sport, but no one joins your sport

451
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:00,007
because they've heard that you've got

452
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:00,947
good sustainable pillars.

453
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:05,282
And so we need to get people in and I think there's two reasons why people

454
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:11,107
get interested in join speedcubing. And the first one is definitely a novelty, a nostalgia factor.

455
00:24:12,648 --> 00:24:16,851
Because we talked about the beginning how everyone got burnt out on the Rubik's Cube in 82 and they

456
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:21,455
couldn't solve it, but they didn't throw them away, they put them on their bookshelves. And so I can

457
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:24,898
remember my parents' Rubik's Cube on their bookshelf, people younger than me can probably

458
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:27,160
remember their grandparents' Rubik's Cube. And...

459
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:33,521
We don't have that burnout from the original fad.

460
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:38,804
And so for us, picking up a Rubik's Cube has got a huge dollop of nostalgia

461
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:41,005
of the family home from when they were young.

462
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:46,228
And I sent out some surveys to big speedcubing sites online

463
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:48,850
to try and get some idea of how people got into speedcubing.

464
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,051
I got some comments to back that up.

465
00:24:54,077 --> 00:25:01,381
But I think it's a really important part of the hobby itself, this nostalgia factor.

466
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:07,265
And the other factor I think is important is this virality that comes with it as well.

467
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:11,908
So this is a screenshot of a video of Colin Burns breaking the world record in 2015.

468
00:25:12,748 --> 00:25:16,371
And this is interesting because he was the first American to hold the world record for

469
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:17,071
about a decade.

470
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:21,894
Which means this clip went sort of viral on local news on the...

471
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:22,475
And now...

472
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,810
Here's some funny news at the end of the show.

473
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:31,275
We got lots of interest in Speedcubing spiked after this

474
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:32,836
because people saw this stuff on the news.

475
00:25:33,476 --> 00:25:34,957
But I think it's not just patriotism

476
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:36,759
that got this onto the news.

477
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:37,780
I think that helped.

478
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,763
But also I just think it's intrinsically interesting

479
00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:43,804
to watch someone solve a Rubik's Cube.

480
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:47,147
It's a demonstration of their time investment

481
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:48,228
and their skill level.

482
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:50,850
And as humans, we just find that interesting to watch.

483
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,530
And I've got comments to back that up as well.

484
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,214
I like that middle one.

485
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:00,779
I think it's interesting that the YouTube algorithm has figured out that we, as humans, find it interesting to watch this.

486
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,762
But it's not just that it's interesting to watch.

487
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:07,227
It's actually really rewarding as a cuber to teach someone else to cube.

488
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:12,534
Because it's not like Smash Brothers where if I teach you to play Smash Brothers and eventually you beat me, I lose out.

489
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:19,323
In speedcubing, if I teach you to speedcube and you surpass me, that doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to me because we've got that collegiate,

490
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:24,710
non-confrontational aspect to the sport. As long as I'm pushing my personal best forward, it's fine.

491
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:32,098
And in that aspect, I think it's very similar to video game speed running,

492
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,621
in that it's interesting to watch because this is investment,

493
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:37,863
like you're watching someone else's time investment.

494
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:42,206
I think speed running is very welcoming of new people to the sport.

495
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:51,494
So, to wrap up, I think when you've got a nostalgic, satisfying, yet complex toy

496
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:55,157
with sustainable, innovative designers and businesses,

497
00:26:56,693 --> 00:26:58,854
based on an accessible and welcoming competition,

498
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:01,075
all tied together with a governing body

499
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:03,196
that puts players before corporate interests,

500
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:06,337
then you end up with a sport where before,

501
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,418
there was a dead toy.

502
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:08,838
And I'll leave you with this.

503
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:11,299
In 2018, a rogue, big money,

504
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,360
non-WCA World Championship was announced.

505
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,681
And when Red Bull is trying to muscle in on your sport,

506
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,801
you must be doing something right.

507
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:18,702
Thank you very much.

508
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:29,714
Don't forget to fill out your forms, high-five your CAs on the way out because they're awesome, and if anyone's got any questions

509
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:38,080
Hi, oh hello, yeah one fun question. What's your best time?

510
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,440
26.4 seconds

511
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:44,895
Congratulations.

512
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:48,918
That was on the plane over here by the way.

513
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:49,878
Wow.

514
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:52,921
The real question is, I was a little bit confused because earlier you said that like,

515
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:58,385
there's no, for one reason for something to be considered as a sport,

516
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:01,327
is that you shouldn't have any advantage, like,

517
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:07,070
Based on your equipment or anything, but then you mentioned that like people are making their own stuff now with magnets and other sort of stuff.

518
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:12,831
And like in sports it's important for there to be like, you know, whatever like regulation size balls and stuff like that. So like

519
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:22,395
I was a bit confused with that. So like with like with the world competitions, like how do you I guess kind of regulate like what kind of

520
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:24,095
speed cubes can be used?

521
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,257
So the position of the WCA at the moment is that

522
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,732
It doesn't matter.

523
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:31,174
There's no...

524
00:28:34,987 --> 00:28:37,629
There hasn't yet been a technology that's deemed unfair.

525
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,950
It's not like the swimsuits in the Olympics a couple of years ago.

526
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,392
There's nothing that's been deemed terribly unfair.

527
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:47,595
It's just about making the cubes more reliable, easier to use, more satisfying to use.

528
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:52,938
Interestingly, Erno Rubrik himself, the inventor of the Rubik's Cube, takes the opposite position.

529
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:55,560
He thinks all cubes should be standardized and it should just be about skill.

530
00:28:56,281 --> 00:29:02,184
But yeah, at the moment, we haven't reached the point where anyone's taken offense at any particular design.

531
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:02,825
Maybe that will come.

532
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,611
Hi, I'm interested in the organization, the WCA sort of

533
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:09,892
history.

534
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:13,554
And as a community of game developers here, I think a lot

535
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:16,435
of people are making games and hoping that they may take on

536
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:18,596
sort of like a community and like a competitive

537
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:19,236
scene of their own.

538
00:29:19,697 --> 00:29:21,858
How important do you think it was that that organization

539
00:29:22,438 --> 00:29:23,859
wasn't run by Rubik's?

540
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,520
Or was that sort of grassroots part of it an

541
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,461
essential component?

542
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:36,599
I think so in this case, I think so, because that original Rubik's Cube was just so inherently

543
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:39,261
bad as a speed cube, and still is bad as a speed cube.

544
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:42,063
In fact, I have a bunch down here if people want to come and play with them, but I have

545
00:29:42,303 --> 00:29:48,967
a brand Rubik's Cube and you can compare it to my good speed cube and see what you think

546
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:49,627
the differences are.

547
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:57,182
But yes, it's the tension between making it accessible

548
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,883
to people just exploring the puzzle,

549
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,745
to children who are just playing with the puzzle,

550
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,926
which is what the Rubik's brand wants to be,

551
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:05,849
and then also making it really fast,

552
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:08,991
which makes it unstable and makes it hard to use.

553
00:30:09,732 --> 00:30:11,453
And that's improved a little bit with magnets recently,

554
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:14,916
but still they're very loose feeling cubes

555
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:16,318
compared to the Rubik's cube.

556
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:19,040
So for this, yes, for this particular domain, yes.

557
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,281
And I think probably,

558
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:23,083
You can see it in speedrunning as well.

559
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:27,727
In speedrunning, they don't look at the original intention of the game designers.

560
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:29,929
It's just about how do I get to this end as fast as possible?

561
00:30:29,949 --> 00:30:32,471
I'm going to glitch my way through it. I'm going to break my way through it.

562
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:39,217
So it's giving... I think it's really important to give the players the control of what they're doing

563
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,900
and let them try and find their best way of doing it. Does that make sense?

564
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,021
Yeah, totally. Thank you.

565
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:55,196
So, I can totally understand why making the sport non-confrontational is a good thing,

566
00:30:55,236 --> 00:31:01,262
but I'm curious to know what confrontational Rubik's Cubing looks like.

567
00:31:02,003 --> 00:31:04,084
How do you make Rubik's Cube confrontational?

568
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,401
So the Red Bull World Championships actually does that.

569
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:10,861
The Red Bull World Championships is a face-off between two people,

570
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:12,842
and there's various different events they have.

571
00:31:12,882 --> 00:31:15,522
It's not just solving, we call it racing,

572
00:31:15,562 --> 00:31:17,343
where you both try and solve a Rubik's Cube,

573
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:18,723
and the first one to solve wins a point.

574
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:23,504
There are various other events as well, but it's, yeah, it's face-to-face,

575
00:31:23,784 --> 00:31:29,845
like getting up in each other's grill and, like, making it

576
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:32,386
so when you do something good, someone else loses out.

577
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,452
And I think that's really important for spectator, it makes it a much better spectator sport.

578
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:42,135
And I think they'll reach a point where speedcubing reaches a ceiling and they need to start looking at

579
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:45,736
making the top level sport more interesting to spectators.

580
00:31:47,137 --> 00:31:49,618
But we haven't reached that yet because it's not grown big enough yet.

581
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,980
I think there's probably 10x more growth left in the sport.

582
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:54,621
Thank you.

583
00:31:57,921 --> 00:32:02,943
I'm just curious, in competition, does each competitor have the same randomization of their cube?

584
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:08,586
And how do you know, if that's not true, then how do you know if somebody didn't just get a simpler solve?

585
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:15,890
So, everyone gets... it's a bit technical, but every hour there's a set list of random scrambles.

586
00:32:23,564 --> 00:32:27,108
So they're guaranteed to be good random scrambles.

587
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:28,469
And then those are applied

588
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:30,070
by the people called the scramblers

589
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,052
that scramble the cubes for you.

590
00:32:34,314 --> 00:32:36,116
So, and that changes every hour.

591
00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:37,877
So the idea is you can't get a scramble

592
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:38,978
and then go and tell your mates

593
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:41,340
and then they are prepared for what the scramble will be.

594
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,220
So what was the question again?

595
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,541
You were asking about scrambles.

596
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:49,603
I guess I was drawing a parallel in my mind

597
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:52,324
to duplicate bridge, where you do play

598
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:54,866
a series of different hands, but each partner

599
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:59,148
is kind of playing a hand which every other team has played.

600
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:03,051
And so in some sense, it's a fair version of bridge,

601
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:05,652
because everybody is given the same resources

602
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:06,493
to be able to play.

603
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:10,376
Oh yeah, the average of five thing is designed to help with that,

604
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:15,640
because you do get very beneficial scrambles sometimes.

605
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,983
There's a thing called a PLL skip, which is like gold dust in cubing.

606
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:22,726
If you get a PLL skip, which is like skipping a whole step,

607
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:24,887
like one of the most expensive steps of solving the cube,

608
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:28,950
and it just randomly happens to come out solved,

609
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,751
and you don't have to do it.

610
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:34,275
Getting PLL skip is a really key part of getting a good fast time.

611
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:40,841
And so they take that five and throw away the best time and the worst time in order to try and get around

612
00:33:41,182 --> 00:33:46,046
Like accidentally giving people like some people a PLL skip scramble and some people don't get a PLL skip scramble

613
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,033
Okay, thank you very much come to the front and play with the cubes if you want to play with the cubes

614
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:54,055
But have a good rest of your Monday
