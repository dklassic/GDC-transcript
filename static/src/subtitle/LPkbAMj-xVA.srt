1
00:00:02,124 --> 00:00:03,945
Here we go. Thank you very much.

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:04,045
Hi.

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:09,588
Thank you.

4
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:10,769
Okay, so as I just said,

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,450
turn your phones up as loud as possible,

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,611
interrupt really often. No.

7
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:15,812
Okay, hello everybody.

8
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:17,313
Thank you very much for coming along here.

9
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:19,514
Let's see if the clicker actually works. It does.

10
00:00:19,514 --> 00:00:20,395
Excellent stuff.

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,621
So my name is Professor Matter Haggis. I have been making games for quite a while now.

12
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:32,124
I started off with things like Burnout Paradise quite a few years ago on the AAA side of things.

13
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:34,245
I was one of the writers on Aliens vs. Predator.

14
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:38,827
I've also done a lot of indie stuff before that, so I've been doing it about 15 years.

15
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:41,609
I've had a couple of series on MTV2 in Europe.

16
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:46,971
I've done animations and games for Channel 4 and things like that back in my indie freelance days.

17
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:54,155
These days I'm actually associate professor at NHTV University in Netherlands. It's one of the highest rated games courses in Europe

18
00:00:54,155 --> 00:01:00,040
So if you're looking at games education really great place to go. So my students in the room

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,703
I'm also making a game at the moment called fragments of him

20
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:06,124
It's coming out on Xbox One and PC next month,

21
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:07,924
and later in the year on PlayStation 4,

22
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:10,865
which is really, really storytelling focused.

23
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:11,946
Now what I'm gonna be talking about today

24
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,647
is a lot of the storytelling and writing methods

25
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:17,227
that I've used when I'm making fragments of him,

26
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:19,088
using illustrations from classic literature

27
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,348
and things like that.

28
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:21,669
You may have also noticed

29
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:23,689
that I do talk really quite fast.

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,554
So I know we've got an international audience here, so not everybody can always keep up if I go really really fast and I talk like that.

31
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:34,817
So the most big important points are going to be on the screens behind me.

32
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:36,178
There's a lot of them.

33
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,752
What I'm going to do to make this easy is I'm going to be building up a diagram as we go today.

34
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:47,335
I do want to reassure you the very very last slide after I said thank you and all that kind of stuff

35
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:50,897
I will put the full diagram up on screen so you don't need to be constantly photographing

36
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:52,898
if you think you're going to miss this diagram.

37
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:56,080
It will be all there at the end, you will have time to take it if you want to.

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,961
Hopefully you find it interesting enough to want to take it.

39
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,722
So let's build up this diagram. This is the core part of it.

40
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:05,264
We're going to roughly build it out this kind of way that we start off with

41
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:07,524
before you even start writing like this.

42
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:11,266
Why you would write like this, what actually writing like this is,

43
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:15,107
and what I mean when we go after writing like this. I want to say by like this is

44
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:18,008
like, how do we write less? Or how do we write

45
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:21,130
the same amount but say more? How do we kind of keep the compression

46
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,090
but increase the complexity?

47
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,631
This is really what we're looking at here.

48
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:27,212
Now, there's three different methods I'm going to talk to you about today.

49
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:32,333
A lot of this is keying in with a lot of the other narrative design talks you may have heard over the last couple of days.

50
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:36,974
There's a lot of things that a lot of people are talking about in trying to build complexity in here.

51
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:39,675
So I've got these three techniques which are going to feed into that central one there.

52
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:43,858
So the very first part, I want to emphasize this before we even start doing this, is don't

53
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:45,600
compromise essential gameplay information.

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,862
It's really important the player needs to be able to understand what they're doing,

55
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:51,765
how they're supposed to be achieving these things.

56
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:55,648
With that in mind, now you can start playing around with your writing.

57
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:59,231
So keep it obvious, unless it's part of the game for people to not know, but I'll leave

58
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:00,092
it up to you to understand that.

59
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:04,453
So really what we're aiming for here is adding value with story.

60
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:08,875
We want the stories to make the experiences more engaging, the play more fun, the world more

61
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:13,997
immersive. Because really what story is there for is additional investment into the play activities.

62
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:17,978
Now those play activities might be shooting a robot in the face, they might be saving a cat

63
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:23,620
from a tree. But why is it a robot? Why is it a cat? If these things have emotional attachment

64
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,081
in them already, how do we build on that emotional attachment? How do we make those actions feel more

65
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:28,581
meaningful?

66
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:31,704
This is really what we're looking at trying to achieve.

67
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:33,966
We're trying to make meaning within our games.

68
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:37,669
Because basically we've got this situation where we've got all our players on one side

69
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:40,231
and we've got a game that we've made here.

70
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:44,915
And sometimes it kind of feels like story is this wall in the middle between the two of them.

71
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:49,379
That you've got these cut scenes you have to watch, you have to listen to this dialogue, you kind of go, yep.

72
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,402
Okay, when does this story end?

73
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:55,265
When can I actually move on to the next piece?

74
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:57,487
That's not the world we want to be working in.

75
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,768
We want to be working in this kind of way

76
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:01,070
where the game is right next to them all the time.

77
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,191
They're fully engaged with this.

78
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:06,215
And then that kind of play experience

79
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:07,856
is becoming something which is involved with it.

80
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,338
All the storytelling is involved with that play experience

81
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:11,559
on a moment by moment basis.

82
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,922
It's building out into more complex experiences

83
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,724
and the whole story is interwoven into the game.

84
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:19,889
So this is what we're really looking for.

85
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,473
To get to this point, we need what we call active listening,

86
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,935
where the story becomes something that they're involved with.

87
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:28,437
They're not just going, oh yeah, more words being spoken.

88
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:30,019
They're going, ah, these words are interesting.

89
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,201
This makes my actions more compelling.

90
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:34,563
This makes the world more interesting to play with.

91
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,236
So we want people to read between the lines.

92
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:40,478
We want people to be interpreting what's going on there.

93
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,159
What are the characters thinking

94
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,241
is obviously one of the big questions here.

95
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:45,482
Are they lying to themselves?

96
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:46,642
Or are they trying to lie to others?

97
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:49,064
These are really big questions

98
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:51,125
which you can play with in your dialogue

99
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,787
without having to add extra kind of gameplay mechanics

100
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:55,668
and extra parts in there.

101
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,910
Basically this idea of interpretation

102
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,551
is a form of engagement.

103
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:01,772
Storytelling doesn't have to be this passive thing.

104
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:02,993
It's a form of engagement

105
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:04,074
when people are trying to understand

106
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:05,535
and trying to get into the heads of.

107
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:06,835
of the characters.

108
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:10,237
So let's keep on going here.

109
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,938
The first technique I'm going to talk about is omissions in the text.

110
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,920
If we want to move on from this, we've got a couple of characters that are going to be

111
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,461
helping us today.

112
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:18,561
We've got Tess and Gemma.

113
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:19,942
There they are.

114
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:20,522
Meet Tess and Gemma.

115
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:22,723
We're going to be visiting them a few times.

116
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,244
Tess and Gemma are in a motel.

117
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,725
Very nice for them.

118
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,126
Except the motel is surrounded by zombies.

119
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:31,167
And so this is a fairly classic gameplay situation.

120
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,168
Got a couple of people holed up.

121
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:34,469
There's guns and there's things to shoot at.

122
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,888
We obviously want to have some good dialogue involved with all this kind of stuff.

123
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:42,532
Well, I think we've really got kind of three options of how we want to go about this

124
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,314
in terms of storytelling.

125
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:45,195
Now, one of the options

126
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:48,979
is that we don't actually really do storytelling here.

127
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:50,380
We just go, okay,

128
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,244
bring the zombies through the doors, through the windows, start shooting them,

129
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:56,887
and that's absolutely fine. If you want to go for a completely mechanics-driven

130
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,028
kind of game,

131
00:05:58,028 --> 00:05:58,449
go for it.

132
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:02,372
I'm not insisting you need to have cutscenes or storytelling and stuff like that.

133
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:03,953
If you want to make that game, go for it.

134
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:07,396
But today we're going to be talking more about the writing side of things and how we do this.

135
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:09,958
So option two is what people go for most of the time.

136
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,820
Probably a fairly standard dialogue interchange.

137
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,682
So let's look at sort of one of the things we might have here.

138
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,923
Perhaps Tess is going to say something like,

139
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:19,105
do you think we'll make it through till dawn?

140
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:21,006
And Gemma might come back with,

141
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,087
I don't know, but we'll try.

142
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:22,387
Okay.

143
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:30,389
I mean, it's alright, it's fine, that's that standard dialogue for a video game, that's

144
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,071
kind of how we would expect to hear a lot of these things.

145
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:38,153
But this is kind of quintessentially really passive listening.

146
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:41,815
There's nothing for you to really interrogate, what's going on inside their minds, they've

147
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:42,736
just told you everything.

148
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,192
And really, that's just building a wall.

149
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:47,873
That's just a few lines of dialogue

150
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,074
which are standing between you

151
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:50,474
and the game on the other side.

152
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:53,056
And so you want your player to be more involved with that.

153
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:54,777
You want to have it a little bit more engaging.

154
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:56,738
So we need to look at this third option

155
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:57,679
that we have available for us.

156
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:00,501
So let's go on to this point where I'm talking about this.

157
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:01,982
Let's go on to the omissions here.

158
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:03,082
Now, when I say omissions,

159
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:05,764
I mean that we are leaving out words or information

160
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:08,345
from the text, from the dialogue that's going on there.

161
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:12,227
I'm going to give you an example of how this kind of stuff can work.

162
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:13,668
Shakespeare's King Lear.

163
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:16,189
This is one of my favourite plays ever written.

164
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:18,010
It's one of the greatest tragedies in history.

165
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,950
This is an amazing, amazing play.

166
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,491
If you don't know it, I highly recommend reading it.

167
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,512
It starts off with the king, there he is.

168
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:26,633
These are my brilliant sketches, thank you.

169
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:30,074
And the king Lear has three daughters.

170
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,395
And to roughly paraphrase Shakespeare,

171
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,356
it starts off with him going something like,

172
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:36,937
Tell me how much you love me and you'll all get a third of my stuff.

173
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,331
roughly like that. And of course...

174
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:48,357
Mind stuff. I don't know. Of course you get two of the daughters, Goneril and Regan, who come back

175
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:52,781
with this kind of response of, well we love you more than anything, we love you more than stars,

176
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:57,605
the moon, our husbands, can all go screw themselves. It's really this kind of over the

177
00:07:57,605 --> 00:08:03,430
top, overblown, just pouring these words of love out to him. The king's like, awesome,

178
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,732
I feel very nice now, you feel like a very good king, excellent.

179
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:08,926
And then we get to Cordelia's turn.

180
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:10,788
Cordelia is the youngest.

181
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:13,309
Cordelia truly loves King Lear.

182
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,171
She truly, truly loves him.

183
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:17,672
And that's a wonderful thing.

184
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:20,114
And the audience understands this.

185
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:23,236
She has a lot of sides to the audience going,

186
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,038
how the hell am I supposed to say that?

187
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,179
After what they've said, whatever I say

188
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:28,900
is going to sound wrong.

189
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,722
And so we have the king say, what

190
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:33,564
can you say to draw a third more opulent than your sisters?

191
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:34,384
Speak.

192
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:34,805
Nothing, my lord.

193
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,225
Nothing.

194
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:40,865
Nothing.

195
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:42,647
Nothing will come of nothing.

196
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,569
Speak again.

197
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:55,517
If my slide changes over here.

198
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:56,358
Oh, slow computers.

199
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:59,160
Don't you just love it when they do that.

200
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,480
Excellent.

201
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,403
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave my heart into my mouth.

202
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:04,785
I love your majesty, according to my bond.

203
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:06,166
Nor more, nor less.

204
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,428
This is wonderful. She's saying, at some point I'm going to get married

205
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:13,289
and I'm going to love my husband probably more than I love you.

206
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:16,410
I'm going to have children. I'm going to love them absolutely dearly

207
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,391
and all of them will have a portion of my love.

208
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,353
I cannot say I love you alone

209
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,894
because there are so many people in my life that I'm going to love.

210
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:27,035
This is a difficult situation for her and the king doesn't get it.

211
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:30,379
You've had these other two sisters going,

212
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:33,783
everything is you, and then one comes back and goes,

213
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:35,125
I can't pour my heart out like that.

214
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,010
And the audience understands Cordelia's struggle.

215
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,273
They understand that it's difficult,

216
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:43,257
but Lear does not until it's way, way too late.

217
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:46,442
I mean, this is a difficult position.

218
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,703
How can you express the inexpressible?

219
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:49,183
Love beyond words.

220
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:50,884
How do you even talk about love?

221
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:52,845
I mean, Shakespeare himself,

222
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:54,426
shall I compare you to a summer's day?

223
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:57,287
This whole sonnet is about how it's almost impossible

224
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:58,788
to really quantify what love is.

225
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:00,929
And this is one of the greatest writers

226
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,771
in history of language.

227
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:04,811
Amazing, amazing words.

228
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,432
And he even says, I can't really do it.

229
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:12,144
So one of the ways we can do this is by using contrast, for example.

230
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,326
So we've got the contrast between the first two sisters and what they say,

231
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:20,449
and the true love that Cordelia feels, which is almost inexpressible.

232
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,971
And the audience then has to fill in the difference.

233
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,772
The audience begins to understand the difference between these two things.

234
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:29,734
What did King Lear hear compared to what Cordelia said?

235
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:32,055
When she said nothing, what did the king hear on the other end of that?

236
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:35,886
And that's really engaging, because as an audience,

237
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:36,727
we're always second guessing

238
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:37,748
where we're gonna end up here.

239
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:39,229
Quick note, I wanna say,

240
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,852
if you're writing like this for your actors,

241
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:43,834
please, please don't forget them.

242
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,036
They are people who need to understand

243
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:47,537
what the hell is going on with your dialogue

244
00:10:47,537 --> 00:10:48,919
when you're leaving things out here.

245
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,322
So tell them what's left unsaid within your script

246
00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:53,483
when you leave a line unfinished.

247
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:59,286
Those little ellipses that you might love putting at the end of your lines, don't forget to fill the actor in.

248
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,949
It's actually what's been missed out there, otherwise they're going to get lost

249
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,271
and you might get a terrible performance in the audio booth.

250
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:06,713
So do remember your actors when you're doing this kind of stuff.

251
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:10,493
Also I want to mention that implication is another form of omission.

252
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:12,273
The idea where you're implying lots of ideas.

253
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,034
This is an example used yesterday.

254
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:18,576
That's my excellent picture of Leia from Star Wars there.

255
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:22,977
She says I love you to Han and Han is kind of being smug.

256
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:25,898
And he kind of comes back with I know.

257
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:31,027
He almost feels like he has to be a little chink of light from his teeth when he says that.

258
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:35,209
It's a bit cheesy but the implication of what's said there is actually much more powerful than

259
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:40,851
if he just said I love you too which was in the script. That whole breadth of their experience

260
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:44,492
of Leia going I'm going to go to the end of the galaxy to find you, I will save you no matter

261
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:48,234
what happens here, I'm going to tell you I love you even though this is embarrassing almost to

262
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:52,055
say in front of every single other person it's the worst possible time to say it, I'm going to

263
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:54,176
declare my love for you right now and Han goes...

264
00:11:54,977 --> 00:12:00,100
There's no way I can ever come back from that. I really understand that you absolutely mean

265
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,724
everything that you've just said. The implication of that, I know. So much is put into those little

266
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,947
words. I think it's fantastic. It's really nice writing. So let's go back to Tess and Gemma.

267
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:12,389
Let's look at their kind of discussion here. Do you think we'll make it through to dawn?

268
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,649
I will try.

269
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:20,415
Now that's nicer, I think.

270
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:22,796
I mean, you've got to fill in what's going on there.

271
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:24,817
She hesitates, I'm sure, but then sounds determined.

272
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:27,078
And of course, don't forget your actors.

273
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:28,699
I don't know is the implication there.

274
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,719
So make sure everything's there for people.

275
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,080
Now, if we compare that to the first version,

276
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,621
where it's, I don't know, but we'll try,

277
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:36,002
I've only taken out a few words,

278
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,002
but it changes the meaning.

279
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:38,843
It changes the feel of that sentence a lot.

280
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,224
There's more emotions in there.

281
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:42,785
We've kind of doubled up on the amount of emotional content

282
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:45,346
without really expanding a lot of what's being said

283
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:46,647
in the amount of time.

284
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:47,627
I think that's nicer writing.

285
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:54,366
So, that was kind of our main option three there,

286
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,987
that was using emissions.

287
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:59,530
So let's go back to our original diagram

288
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,971
and we're gonna fill that in over the side there.

289
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:03,012
Any second now, there we go, awesome.

290
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:05,214
Cool, so let's go on to the second option

291
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:06,315
we've got available for us.

292
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:08,616
This is apparent non-secreteurs.

293
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:14,210
Now, you may know non sequiturs. Non sequiturs are awesome, often used in comedy and stuff like that.

294
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,854
Why did the chicken cross the road? Fish.

295
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:23,242
That's a non sequitur joke. It makes no sense because it's a sudden change of tone or subject.

296
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:25,766
Now what I'm talking about really is apparent non sequiturs.

297
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:31,028
So, although it seems like there's no reason for it to suddenly change, it actually is.

298
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:36,109
There's a deeper dialogue going on underneath there, and the non sequitur is a way of demonstrating

299
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:37,430
what that dialogue is.

300
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,151
I saw a piece in X-Files recently where Mulder was sitting there going, oh yes, the killer

301
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:45,693
did this kind of stuff, and Scully just goes, yeah, I'm not sure how long my mother's gonna

302
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:46,073
make it.

303
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:52,436
Complete break in tone of subject and it completely reveals without this big kind of conversation of like,

304
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:56,098
oh that's very interesting, we shouldn't think about that, but I'm more interested in my mother at this moment.

305
00:13:56,098 --> 00:13:58,319
You don't need this link between it.

306
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:03,401
Just that contrast is actually sometimes a more powerful way than trying to push these things together.

307
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:06,323
I think there's a nice example here in Girl Interrupted.

308
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:07,483
Susanna Kaysen writes this.

309
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:10,405
It was a spring day, the sort that gives people hope.

310
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,606
All soft winds and delicate smells of warm earth.

311
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:13,546
Suicide weather.

312
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,685
Tone is established and then that tone is disrupted,

313
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:24,707
violently breaking this, making a powerful portrait

314
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:26,128
of the character's internal state.

315
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:28,309
This is really, really powerful writing

316
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,871
and it's really short writing.

317
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:32,232
I mean, she could have taken pages to try and write

318
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:33,333
that same kind of break there,

319
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,294
that same kind of emotional experience.

320
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:36,916
But just doing that with a couple of lines,

321
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,277
very, very powerful stuff, very powerful.

322
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:45,740
Another one we've got from a little bit more light-hearted is Waiting for Godot, Samuel Beckett.

323
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,763
Lovely, lovely bit of work. Also mentioned so far in the conference.

324
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,765
Estragon, Turing, I ask you a question.

325
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,366
Vladimir. Ah.

326
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:52,946
Estragon, did you reply?

327
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:53,206
Vladimir.

328
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:54,127
How's the carrot?

329
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:04,902
It's a carrot.

330
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:05,162
Lovely.

331
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:05,983
I love Samuel Beckett.

332
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,685
It's really just weird stuff.

333
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:11,847
But it's got a lot going on in there.

334
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:14,448
It's got this kind of comic, tragic kind of thing to it.

335
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,270
You're asking questions that didn't probably get answered the first time.

336
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,132
And if it did, they'd forgotten what that answer was.

337
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:22,474
And there's this kind of loss of communication going on here.

338
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:26,156
They're stuck in this meaningless loop of trying to find out the answer

339
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,898
and not really knowing what the question was in the first place.

340
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:32,761
And that's basically the entire play summarized in two lines of writing.

341
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:38,906
that is really efficient writing a whole play in two lines i think that is brilliant that's the

342
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:44,692
power that you can have if you use this technique correctly however with great power comes great

343
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:50,077
responsibility it's the warning time hooray so there you are you're a brilliant genius writer

344
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:55,022
with your brilliant brilliant uh non-secretary in your script and this is awesome and then you

345
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,844
go to your producer and your producer can do

346
00:15:57,865 --> 00:15:59,707
I don't think so, no, no.

347
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:03,972
So a lot of people think that really, really direct writing is the only way to go for games.

348
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:09,459
This is the only way to write, it's like the really most obvious possible thing you could do.

349
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,201
I don't really agree with that.

350
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:14,585
I think apparent non sequiturs are really, really indirect.

351
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:17,268
These are possibly the least direct way of doing something possible.

352
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,792
But they're so powerful.

353
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,693
You're gonna get a lot of arguments about this.

354
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:24,034
So in every technique from this session

355
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:26,536
I'm talking about today, it is indirect writing.

356
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:29,379
It's giving story without saying absolutely

357
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,420
what's in the mind of the people.

358
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,402
It's more powerful for that, it uses their imagination,

359
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:34,783
but it's gonna trigger a lot of debates,

360
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:36,064
and I think this one is gonna trigger

361
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:37,826
the most debates out of a lot of them.

362
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:39,147
I think it's worth it, I think it's a really

363
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:40,808
powerful technique if you can get it right.

364
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:43,010
Once again, don't mess with gameplay information,

365
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,011
but if you get this right, it's a really

366
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:45,051
great insight to characters.

367
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:45,852
Let's go back to Tess and Gemma.

368
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,723
So, do you think we'll make it through till dawn, says Tess.

369
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:53,243
And Gemma comes back with, I...

370
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:53,664
Don't forget your coat.

371
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:54,885
Looks like rain in the morning.

372
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:56,086
That's kind of nice.

373
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:56,826
I like this one.

374
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:57,307
Sounds unsure to begin with.

375
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:15,490
Then she pauses for a moment, she looks out the window at the sky above the crowd of zombies

376
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,656
and in a conversational tone, as clearly covering some fear, she says,

377
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:22,340
Don't forget your coat, it looks like rain in the morning.

378
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,927
When everything else is going on, that's the thing she says instead.

379
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:31,976
So if we compare this to the other options that we had, we started off with that one

380
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:34,177
down the bottom there, I don't know, but we'll try.

381
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:37,658
And that's fine, that's resolved, it's very determined, that's great.

382
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:41,820
If we go to the next one, it's scared, but it's resolved, we've kind of doubled up on

383
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,602
our emotional content, so we're doing good work here.

384
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:48,904
And this third one, well, we've got fear, we've got a little bit of bravado, doesn't

385
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:50,884
matter, I don't care about the zombies.

386
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:52,785
It's this determination of, yeah, of course we'll make it.

387
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,646
There's a little bit of humour in there.

388
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:58,190
There's a little bit of fear in there. It's all these things mixed together.

389
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,953
And something that I think is really, really, really important to games,

390
00:18:00,953 --> 00:18:03,235
even games about shooting zombies in the face,

391
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:04,396
it's got a bit of love in there.

392
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:08,480
These people care about each other. They care about...

393
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,363
Gemma cares that Tess actually feels okay.

394
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:14,306
And she's put on a brave face for her friend.

395
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,489
Or her companion, or her partner.

396
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:22,205
I think this is a much more powerful way of writing, and I think there's a lot more complexity

397
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:24,988
with a similar length line as what we started from.

398
00:18:24,988 --> 00:18:28,171
I think that's the power of writing like this, and I think it's really worth looking into.

399
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:28,231
So...

400
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:28,731
Let's go back here.

401
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:31,214
Let's add that on to the bottom part there.

402
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,636
So we've got a change in tone of subject,

403
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:42,079
it's disjunction really reveals the internal dialogues.

404
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,221
It's great for complexity, it's great for being brief,

405
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,422
and it really gets right to the point

406
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:48,286
without these overall links of going this to this

407
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,288
to this to this to new subject.

408
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:51,849
It's a way of skipping out all that stuff

409
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:52,871
and smooshing them together,

410
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:54,793
and sometimes getting a much more powerful effect

411
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:55,473
because of that.

412
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:58,096
Okay, so the third one I want to talk to you about

413
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,298
is unreliable narrators.

414
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:03,733
I've got two major parts that I'm going to talk about here.

415
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:08,515
The first one is actually really quite small, so I'm going to divide them up here.

416
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:13,057
The first one is quite small on the left-hand side here, which is honest mistakes.

417
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:14,738
Fairly quick one, I'll just give you a quick example of that.

418
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:18,200
The next section, the big section really here, is deception.

419
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,401
And within deception, I'm actually going to split that up into two pieces as well.

420
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:26,124
I'm going to talk about deception, which is lying to yourself, self-deception, and I'm

421
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,904
going to talk a little bit about ungrounded realities.

422
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:29,465
I think they're both quite important.

423
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:35,099
And I've got the last one, which is the most obvious one, which is lying to people, deceiving

424
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:35,700
others.

425
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,029
Okay, so let's start ourselves off with honest mistakes to begin with.

426
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:43,217
As I mentioned at the start, I'm making a game called Fragments of Him.

427
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,778
In Fragments of Him, there's many stories told,

428
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,438
and one of them is from the perspective of Sarah.

429
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:49,519
There's my awesome drawing of Sarah.

430
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,800
Tino, if you're watching this, sorry, your artwork's much better than mine.

431
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,661
Sarah has a memory of her time going on a date with a character called Will.

432
00:19:58,661 --> 00:19:59,841
They went to a cinema.

433
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:03,962
Now, the player actually has a choice of where to sit in this cinema.

434
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:06,163
They've got to sit in the front, middle, or back.

435
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,163
Now, that's weird, if this is a memory.

436
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:14,781
Because, I mean, how can there be a player choice if it's just a memory?

437
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:19,145
There's always going to be kind of one right choice, and the others are going to be wrong choices.

438
00:20:19,145 --> 00:20:20,427
Isn't that right?

439
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,668
Feels like that should be correct.

440
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:25,534
Or it's just an honest mistake.

441
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:28,757
Maybe she did sit at the front and we chose sitting at the middle.

442
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:31,118
That's okay, but whatever she goes, yeah, that's fine.

443
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:32,539
We'll just keep on going with that.

444
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:36,022
Because which seat was chosen doesn't actually matter to Sarah.

445
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:37,643
That bit's irrelevant.

446
00:20:37,643 --> 00:20:40,265
It's like saying, well, the person shot me with a gun,

447
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:42,387
which was red or blue.

448
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:44,328
It doesn't matter whether the gun was red or blue.

449
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,589
What matters was you got shot by it.

450
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:48,031
And you're pretty sure certain about the being shot bit.

451
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:53,448
so you can understand the priorities of the characters by giving some uncertainty in other

452
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:54,051
parts of this.

453
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:59,033
So where we sat, player choice, that's kind of fuzzy.

454
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:00,173
It's not important to Sarah.

455
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:02,294
But what happened when she sat down there,

456
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,214
that's certain, that's very important.

457
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:05,715
And so you get these ideas of priorities

458
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,455
and what matters most to the character

459
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,536
inside their own head.

460
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:10,036
So those little simple mistakes,

461
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,497
they're tricky to use in your scripts,

462
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:12,437
tricky to use in your dialogue,

463
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,978
because it can seem like, ah, it's a clue, it's a clue,

464
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:16,138
they made a mistake, they said this,

465
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:17,279
but it was really that.

466
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,999
So be really careful using these.

467
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:21,620
They can fit in there, they can complement things.

468
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,000
But this is why I just said this

469
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,341
was one of the smaller sections.

470
00:21:24,977 --> 00:21:29,660
Basically, active listeners are rewarded with character insight from the contrast between

471
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,760
the certainty and the fuzziness.

472
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,722
And they kind of go, oh, so they didn't care about that, but this bit they're really certain

473
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:34,762
of.

474
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:40,605
Intuitively, using this kind of really emotional-driven thinking, they understand intuitively that's

475
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:41,786
the bit that matters.

476
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:45,487
And I think that's a nice thing, is getting people good character insight just with a

477
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:46,288
couple of lines of dialogue.

478
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:52,704
So let's move on to the next section there, self-deception, lying to yourself and ungrounded realities.

479
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:55,628
So one of my favourite games of all time is a game called Prince of Persia, Sands of Time.

480
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:59,632
I think it's a brilliant piece of level design, combat's a little bit new.

481
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:02,996
Puzzle design is absolutely brilliant, but the storytelling in it is genius.

482
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:06,080
It is so, so nicely done. If you've not played it, I highly recommend it.

483
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:10,862
It starts out with a very talented, a very petulant prince who thinks he's awesome,

484
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:14,044
he's gonna go steal his thing, and he's gonna do the thing over there, and he's gonna go

485
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:17,965
save the day, and he's gonna invade the city, and he's kind of really full of himself.

486
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:20,266
He really is quite full of himself.

487
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,568
Like a lot of game characters, to be honest.

488
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:24,308
From now on, I trust no one but myself.

489
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:26,889
It's one of the things he says to himself at the start of this.

490
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,656
That's okay, you know, it's fine.

491
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:35,280
But to be honest, the prince is lying to himself constantly at the start of this.

492
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,701
And as people are listening, we're kind of going,

493
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:41,984
yeah, that's not going to stay that way for the whole story, is it?

494
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:44,466
And we're all sitting there knowing this.

495
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:47,989
We know he's lying to himself and it's helping us feel smarter.

496
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:50,611
We are actively engaged and going, no, that's not true.

497
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:53,192
No, you can keep saying that, prince, but it's still not going to be true,

498
00:22:53,192 --> 00:22:54,874
no matter how many times you say it to yourself.

499
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:59,436
And isn't that lovely that we're listening to dialogue and engaging with it?

500
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:03,478
It's interactive dialogue without choices, without branching structures.

501
00:23:03,478 --> 00:23:07,900
It's interactive just by the nature of interpretation of dialogue.

502
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,221
That's the power of good writing.

503
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:13,998
And the player can enjoy anticipating the prince's self-discovery towards the end of it.

504
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:14,859
That's gameplay.

505
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:17,061
His self-deception adds to the fun of the game.

506
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:19,323
The writing adds to the experience.

507
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:21,645
And that's what we all want to do with our writing.

508
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:22,906
And the player's work is repaid.

509
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:24,808
By the end of the game, he's saying,

510
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:25,849
come with me, please.

511
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,990
He feels the meaning of love.

512
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,312
He needs companionship.

513
00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:31,874
He recognizes there is a world outside himself.

514
00:23:31,874 --> 00:23:33,395
Brilliant character growth,

515
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,797
demonstrated with really nice kind of part of self-deception.

516
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:38,320
And then that kind of veil falling away as the story goes on.

517
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:43,784
Mary Shelley also used this in Frankenstein, this kind of stuff, but we get a slightly

518
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:46,466
different version of this, of kind of ungrounded realities here.

519
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,049
So every aspect of the story is framed for us.

520
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:51,070
We never really see the truth.

521
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,874
There's no kind of authorial sort of structure sitting outside there, omnisciently looking

522
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:56,995
down and going, this is the story.

523
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:59,858
Because we've got this version of reality.

524
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:03,841
Now reality exists outside of this, but reality is actually framed by a character called Robert

525
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:08,045
Walton, who is writing Frankenstein, the story Frankenstein, to his sister in a series of

526
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:08,605
letters.

527
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:13,854
The thing is Robert Walton is actually writing what he was told by Victor Frankenstein.

528
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:17,296
So we've got Robert Walton interpreting Victor Frankenstein's letters when he's writing to

529
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:18,036
his sister.

530
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:21,178
The thing is Victor Frankenstein is actually sometimes telling Robert Walton what he was

531
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:22,538
told by the monster.

532
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:27,161
And so we've got all these different layers coming in here and for all we know Robert

533
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:30,382
Walton just thought his sister was a bit ill and she might fancy a cool story.

534
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:30,902
It could all be lies.

535
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:37,015
and we never know, we never know where the true reality of this is

536
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:39,076
the reality gets squished and squished and squished until

537
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:42,557
it might all be true but we really don't know

538
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:47,539
I think that's a really powerful kind of way of doing it, we only really see through the

539
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:48,960
reality that they see

540
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,441
and I think that's a really interesting thing because we're always questioning what that is

541
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:55,542
this is used in a lot of other things, so things like movies like Fight Club

542
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,883
uh... American Psycho of course is a big one

543
00:24:57,883 --> 00:24:57,923
uh...

544
00:24:57,923 --> 00:24:58,384
hello, thank you

545
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:07,129
We've got other games of course, we've got things like Eternal Darkness, a really great

546
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:10,411
game, you sort of see the world through the eyes of the characters, you're never quite

547
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:13,353
sure entirely what is real there.

548
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:17,556
Grand Theft Auto V, Trevor's Hallucinations, it's very clearly signposted, you're seeing

549
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:21,198
the world through Trevor's eyes, you don't think that all the gang members have got dog

550
00:25:21,198 --> 00:25:22,279
heads all of a sudden in the game.

551
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:28,906
SpecOps the line, of course, that's a whole game which plays with the unreliable narrator.

552
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:30,567
It's a brilliant, brilliant experience.

553
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:33,710
If you've not seen the talk from GDC in 2012, look it up on GDC Vault.

554
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,051
It's a really, really great talk about SpecOps the line.

555
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,392
Brilliant, brilliant story about that one.

556
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:42,613
And of course, Batman. I'm a really, really big fan of what was done with Batman Arkham Knight.

557
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:48,635
I think this is fantastic. Because really, in reality, the Joker is dead. There is no doubt

558
00:25:48,635 --> 00:25:53,557
about this. There's no question really what's going on here. But the thing is, Batman's reality

559
00:25:53,557 --> 00:26:00,659
isn't quite that one. He's slightly moved sideways from reality in this game. We only see the world

560
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,400
through Batman's eyes, and in that reality, the Joker isn't quite dead.

561
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:08,709
I think that's really interesting as a player, we can kind of think about this.

562
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:12,310
It's very, very engaging to try and understand what's going on in these.

563
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,751
What is actually real in Batman's world?

564
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:15,851
What's a hallucination?

565
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:16,751
Is any of it real?

566
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,352
And also, does it even matter?

567
00:26:18,352 --> 00:26:20,872
And that's a really nice question as well.

568
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,033
Is this a hallucination?

569
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:25,354
Is that person who we think it is, are they not?

570
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:26,774
Am I attacking the wrong person here?

571
00:26:26,774 --> 00:26:27,654
What's going on?

572
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:30,455
I think that's a really, really nice kind of dialogue for your players to engage with

573
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,155
in that game.

574
00:26:32,618 --> 00:26:36,843
So that's that one, that's about self-deception and the ungrounded realities when you're stepping

575
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:43,149
away from what is really true. Looking now at deceiving others, lying. I like Emily Bronte's

576
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:46,253
Wuthering Heights, that's a nice example of this one. Again we've got a couple of framing

577
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:49,917
narratives going on here, we've got Nellie who's talking to Lockwood who's then recording

578
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:54,301
his version of it, and there's a sense that Nellie might be kind of embellishing her story.

579
00:26:55,442 --> 00:27:01,745
She seems to enjoy telling this story. She seems to enjoy making it a bit more interesting and there's a sense that maybe

580
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,286
She's adding some stuff in but why is she adding this stuff in?

581
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:08,688
Is she bored?

582
00:27:08,688 --> 00:27:15,090
Is she looking for attention? Is she frustrated with her life? Why is she adding this stuff in and what is she actually adding?

583
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,972
There are scenes where it seems like it would be really weird for Nellie to have been there, but she says she was

584
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,761
but also maybe there's stuff being taken away.

585
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,422
So what do we see?

586
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:26,262
What don't we see?

587
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:28,543
What does this tell us actually about her as a character?

588
00:27:28,543 --> 00:27:30,443
Because the speaker is unintentionally

589
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:33,144
revealing the true selves by the lies that they tell

590
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:34,205
and the things that they make up.

591
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:35,945
I think that's a really nice way of playing this.

592
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,546
We see what concerns them.

593
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:39,066
We see what they're trying to hide

594
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:41,087
by the lies that they create.

595
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,327
Really, really interesting stuff.

596
00:27:44,168 --> 00:27:46,048
Of course, this is a great thing.

597
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,289
Cresting What Is Real is a really active listening mechanic.

598
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:51,410
It's a great way of playing with these.

599
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,570
It really rewards players who think about reality

600
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,331
outside the frame of the game that's being presented to them.

601
00:27:56,331 --> 00:27:58,312
They kind of go, this is the reality of Batman.

602
00:27:58,312 --> 00:27:59,312
This is the reality of Nelly.

603
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:01,733
This is the reality of Lockwood or Victor Frankenstein.

604
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:03,873
What's going on outside there?

605
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:05,654
What is the true reality beyond that?

606
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:08,814
Thinking outside that frame is a really, really powerful thing

607
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:11,255
for your players to do and a really great way

608
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:11,875
of engaging them.

609
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,845
So, that was our three options there.

610
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:18,390
And let's go back and have,

611
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,798
oh yes, let's have a warning again.

612
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:27,057
Because of course, everything I'm saying here, this is awesome.

613
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:27,958
Lie to your players.

614
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,140
I'm just telling you to lie to your players.

615
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,061
Whoops.

616
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:32,964
Inspire your characters to question

617
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:34,847
the reality that they're in.

618
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,310
Players need clues though, to begin speculating

619
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,092
that not all is as it seems.

620
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,335
This is a really, really important part.

621
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:43,277
Don't forget to let people come in on this one.

622
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:48,063
That's because you don't always have to be subtle about this either, you just need to

623
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:50,767
make sure people understand what's going on here.

624
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,530
So for example, Batman Arkham Knight.

625
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,434
This is not very subtle in telling us what's going on here.

626
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,196
It starts with the Joker's cremation.

627
00:28:57,196 --> 00:29:01,142
You literally press a button and set the Joker on fire in a coffin.

628
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:06,824
The Joker is very very definitely dead at this point, he's not coming out of this one.

629
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:12,546
But Bat still sees the Joker. This is really really a big clue that the reality is quite

630
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:18,588
subjective in this game because he's still seeing him, still seeing this person who we know is dead.

631
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:23,970
So give clues to what's going on here. Or it's just unintelligible lies and that doesn't add

632
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,731
anything. If people can't tell there's lies, people can't tell there's deception, they're

633
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,951
not going to be actively questioning that.

634
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:35,704
Right, so let's add that last little part to there and we're going to have one quick more section down at the end there

635
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:39,165
which is going a little bit further this into clues.

636
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:42,366
Clues are a really simple kind of part here.

637
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:46,807
Guide players with well-written dialogue, but if possible, for the best results, go beyond script.

638
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:51,148
So, there are many, many tools that you can use for storytelling in games.

639
00:29:51,148 --> 00:29:54,969
You've got how the world looks, environmental art, environmental storytelling of course.

640
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:58,750
How lines are spoken, acting. Don't forget your actors, tell them how to do this stuff.

641
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,792
How characters move, the animation, get your animation team on board with the story.

642
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:07,175
Interactions, interface, what can the player do, how does the player know how they're supposed to do it.

643
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:09,557
All of these things are ways you can tell your story.

644
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,679
And of course, please, please, please don't forget your audio team.

645
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,701
They are really, really important in telling your story.

646
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:20,324
And also, I would also say, just don't forget your marketing team.

647
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:24,083
there's actually a lot of storytelling you can do outside your game

648
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,904
to give hints, to give clues

649
00:30:25,904 --> 00:30:30,107
so alternate reality games, books, trailers, there's ways of giving clues

650
00:30:30,107 --> 00:30:30,707
about your story

651
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,088
outside of the game as well

652
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:35,089
so please get them involved with that kind of side of it

653
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:39,272
so just going through this very quickly at the end here, that's going beyond script

654
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:41,173
as we've added the last part in, so just to summarize this

655
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,735
and there will be a final screen where all this is nice high-resolution and moment

656
00:30:44,735 --> 00:30:44,915
for you

657
00:30:44,915 --> 00:30:47,516
before you get your cameras out, thank you

658
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:51,758
Don't compromise, add value with the story because that's really our goal here.

659
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:54,700
Look for active listening, this is really what we're trying to achieve here.

660
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,262
Leave some words out sometimes, that could be a way of adding a bit more depth, a bit more complexity.

661
00:30:59,262 --> 00:31:03,684
Changing tone and subject quite quickly can be a really powerful way of creating a sense of

662
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:08,586
internal dialogue going on there. Unreliable narrators are framing reality in their own way,

663
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:11,887
the player has to question what that reality truly is. And in the end of it, once you've

664
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:15,629
achieved all these things, think about going beyond script, find out other ways to support this.

665
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:20,956
And one really, really important question, which I'm sure you're all dying to know,

666
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:23,138
is that Tess and Gemma did survive until dawn.

667
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:25,860
That's obviously very, very important.

668
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,561
They didn't need their coat because it didn't rain.

669
00:31:27,561 --> 00:31:34,307
So yeah, I hope this talk's really inspired you for active listening in your audience.

670
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:35,088
Wow, thank you.

671
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:37,189
Sometimes you can say more by saying nothing.

672
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,652
Thank you very much for listening, everybody.

673
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:40,072
Thank you.

674
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:43,335
Don't forget to fill in the feedback.

675
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,477
And as promised...

676
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:53,442
There you go. Boom! That is so many cameras. Wow. Awesome. Thank you for listening everybody.
