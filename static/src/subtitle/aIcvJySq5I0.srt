00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:10,560
My name is Dr Jennifer Hazel. I've been a medical doctor for about eight years.

2
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:17,285
I studied and practiced in the UK, then I moved to Australia to practice emergency medicine,

3
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:19,366
and now I live in New Zealand.

4
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:24,668
I co-founded Checkpoint to provide mental health resources for the gaming community

5
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:32,512
and we exist to raise awareness, to reduce stigma and to create and distribute important

6
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:36,354
mental health services to those in need within the gaming community itself.

7
00:00:36,574 --> 00:00:39,256
You can find out more at checkpointorg.com.

8
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:45,139
As a Kiwi organisation, I do want to take just a very quick moment to extend my sorrow

9
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:47,740
and regret for what has happened in Christchurch.

10
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:53,723
over the last few days. Thank you for also doing so.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,434
So we're going to talk about models of team effectiveness,

12
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:03,777
and the title of this talk is How to Make Games and Influence People,

13
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:06,840
Leading Your Team Effectively and Healthily,

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,264
which is a mouthful and, on reflection,

15
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:15,207
could have just been said by saying how to be an indie leader,

16
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,449
but I decided I wanted to be clever,

17
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:19,791
and for some reason, the Indie Summit let me run with that.

18
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:26,068
So thank you so much for allowing my neurotic personality.

19
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:30,449
Independent game development, it's an odd beast.

20
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:36,010
It's different to not only the rest of game development

21
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,051
as an industry, but other industries in the world.

22
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:42,472
The different models and psychological profiles

23
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:46,073
that we kind of fit ourselves into in other industries

24
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:49,033
are kind of gone and replaced by something a bit more ad hoc,

25
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:49,953
a bit more...

26
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:57,003
on the go, hierarchies are a bit flatter, and everyone is in more intimate, intense

27
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:03,928
contact with one another. So, the traditional models, if you were to decide to go and Google

28
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:09,612
some of them, you would get about five gazillion of these models of team effectiveness, and

29
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:16,718
most of them become completely redundant to you as indies, because, I mean, as you can

30
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:19,480
see, triangles are definitely a core theme.

31
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:22,495
But they all involve different concepts,

32
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:24,656
and they're worded in different ways.

33
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:27,077
So here we have, and I'm just going to pop over here

34
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:28,017
to actually read the names.

35
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:31,658
Got the Rubin, Plovnik, and Fries GRPI model

36
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:32,679
of team effectiveness.

37
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,800
The Kaz and Buck and Smith model.

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,301
The T7 model.

39
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,542
The LaFasto and Larson model,

40
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:42,122
Hackman model of team effectiveness.

41
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:43,803
That had the word modeling twice.

42
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:49,587
I just want to point out, they really wanted to go for that, and then the Len Chione model.

43
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:51,228
So I thought, screw that.

44
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:58,251
I went through every single one, and I noted down in a spreadsheet what themes, concepts,

45
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:02,773
important take-home messages each of these psychological models were giving, and I tallied

46
00:03:02,793 --> 00:03:06,495
them up and put them in a handy nifty graph for you.

47
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,562
So there were a few things that were consistent amongst every single model.

48
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:16,805
There is a very clear theme of interpersonal relationships being exceptionally important

49
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:17,605
in leadership.

50
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,291
and work dynamics.

51
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:23,114
And what I thought would be the most helpful to you,

52
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:26,557
instead of me standing up here and kind of preaching

53
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:29,539
wax poetic about these psychological concepts,

54
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,001
was to make it real, to give you examples

55
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,043
that you can actually identify with from people

56
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:37,926
that you respect and who are seen as leaders

57
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:39,567
of the indie community.

58
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:46,528
talk to them, find out what they say about leadership and leading a team effectively,

59
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:54,814
and then relate that back to the real data. So, that's what I did. And we will start with

60
00:03:56,715 --> 00:04:04,321
our good friend, Ryan Clark, who introduced you to this talk. Ryan was really kind to

61
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:09,284
talk to me about what he felt were the top three.

62
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:17,380
ethical leadership tips. And there I've summarised the first paragraph in just this very short

63
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:21,284
sentence, but design a company that plays to the strengths of the team.

64
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:27,911
What Ryan actually said was that game design and team leadership have a lot in common with one

65
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:28,251
another.

66
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:34,426
When you design and test a game, you need to be simulating thousands or millions of people

67
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:39,869
in your mind and trying to anticipate what they would be experiencing if they were playing your

68
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:45,893
game. You can't just play it as yourself, because you would only optimise it for your own enjoyment.

69
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:54,158
And as a team leader, you can't just pay attention to what you want, the things that make you happy.

70
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,801
You have to design your team as though it was

71
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:01,074
like a game project.

72
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,797
And I thought it was really interesting that Ryan said

73
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,379
that he was designing a company that

74
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,220
plays to the strengths of the team instead

75
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,223
of the other way around, designing the studio based

76
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:16,906
on the individual's strengths and weaknesses

77
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,387
within that studio.

78
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:24,384
there was an aspect of fairness, equity and reward.

79
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:30,185
Ryan said that at BYG we share profits and have fair wages

80
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:32,006
because we think that's the right thing to do.

81
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:39,068
And there was also this really awesome sentence

82
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:42,489
that I will be using again and again in the future, I think.

83
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:46,958
There are two sides to every statement, what the speaker intended and what the hearer understood.

84
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:52,120
Ideally, the two are identical, but usually they're not.

85
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:57,223
And really, that is feeding back into that interpersonal communication

86
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,904
and the interpersonal relationships part of these models,

87
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:02,685
is being able to understand how communication affects

88
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:06,087
each individual in the team on a day-to-day basis.

89
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:10,789
And of course, when your co-workers feel like they're your teammates rather than your underlings,

90
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,650
the results are better for everybody involved.

91
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:17,197
So if we go back to that graph, what Ryan has hit on is interpersonal relationships,

92
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:25,924
organisational factors, accountability roles and reward. And what I'm going to do now is

93
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:34,690
actually reframe those tips which were practical on-the-floor examples into psychological concepts

94
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:41,875
and explain why that's happening and why it's important to know. Whenever we're managing

95
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,573
a interaction between two or more individuals,

96
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:49,914
whether it be a colleague, a loved one,

97
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:51,614
or a stranger in the street,

98
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,456
the person doing your checkout at the grocery store.

99
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:57,977
No matter who it is, every engagement

100
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:02,960
and every interaction between two people is a negotiation.

101
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,942
Each person coming into that interaction has a need.

102
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:10,903
They would like that need to be met.

103
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:16,066
Sometimes those two needs don't necessarily fit together,

104
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:19,408
and it's important when you're in that interaction

105
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:22,450
to be mindful, what is the other person's need?

106
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,411
What need are they bringing to this interaction?

107
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,472
What is my need?

108
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,474
And how can I best satisfy both of those things,

109
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:31,936
even if that might conflict with one another?

110
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:39,941
There's ways that we can start to think about how to do that.

111
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:43,995
One of them is a concept that we use in psychoanalysis,

112
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:47,138
which is called transactional analysis.

113
00:07:47,798 --> 00:07:51,641
And that is the concept that in a two-person interaction,

114
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:55,404
both people are taking one of three stances.

115
00:07:56,005 --> 00:08:00,248
They're either the adult, the parent, or the child.

116
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:03,711
Now, that doesn't mean literally, obviously.

117
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:06,774
It doesn't mean that you have to be a parent to understand

118
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,515
or you have to have a child.

119
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:08,935
You don't.

120
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:11,486
you're not regressing in that interaction.

121
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:15,769
But what this represents is our frame of mind,

122
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,172
because during this interaction, we're unlocking a part of us,

123
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:22,193
usually subconsciously,

124
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:26,777
that is reliving or replaying a past experience.

125
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:31,680
Two adults talking to one another are both in the here and now.

126
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,783
They are both having an interaction based on objective fact

127
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:36,783
without...

128
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:43,475
a significant amount of emotional weight, and it's something that is relevant to their

129
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:49,958
present situation. They understand each other's needs and are negotiating a way forward. A

130
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:56,522
parent is the authoritarian stance where someone is like, you will do this, and if you do it

131
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:02,564
good, you get rewards. If you do it badly, you get punishment. And the child can either

132
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:05,586
go into a rebellious or submissive phase.

133
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:09,776
And so the child responds, well, I don't want to do that.

134
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:12,397
Or, OK, sir, I'll do whatever you want.

135
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:17,179
We may start an interaction adult-adult.

136
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,640
One person may have a vulnerability

137
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:24,062
due to a variety of factors that often we're not aware of

138
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,983
to go into a child state.

139
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,674
and in response, the other person then has to make a decision,

140
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:34,096
well, am I going to stay as an adult and try to elevate that person back to adult,

141
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:36,177
or am I going to go into the parent stage

142
00:09:36,497 --> 00:09:38,117
where we're not actually going to achieve anything

143
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:40,739
because we're not having a grown-up communication anymore,

144
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:43,480
we're having a maladaptive interaction?

145
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,141
When we become aware of these things,

146
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:50,322
we can design and model our interpersonal interactions

147
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,603
to fit what we want out of the situation

148
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:54,404
in a way that gets everybody's needs met.

149
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:59,220
Another model of doing that is called information manipulation theory,

150
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:06,043
which essentially is the concept of only disclosing what is relevant

151
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:08,665
and within the person's capacity to understand.

152
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:12,127
So when you're in a position of leadership,

153
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:14,848
transparency becomes a bit blurry.

154
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:17,130
You're sharing information that is relevant

155
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,972
and you're withholding information that could be harmful.

156
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:23,973
So these two models together...

157
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:30,333
you can use in order to design your interpersonal relationships as a leader, not only with members

158
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:36,217
of your team, but with people who are on the same level as you, you can also model those

159
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:41,620
interactions to people that are within the team when they're talking to each other.

160
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:48,585
These are two acronyms that have come from dialectical behavioural therapy.

161
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:52,027
And if you take a picture of a slide, take a picture of this one,

162
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,448
because there's a lot of information on it.

163
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:56,270
There are two models that teach us,

164
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,672
remind us in the moment how to communicate effectively

165
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:02,513
in a way that meets the needs of both parties involved,

166
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:05,635
especially when the subject matter is difficult.

167
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:08,257
So the DEAR MAN acronym

168
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:11,699
reminds us to describe our current situation objectively,

169
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,281
to express our feelings or opinions about that situation

170
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:18,483
and assert what we are wanting, what our needs are.

171
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:20,351
that might mean saying no,

172
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:23,332
a need might be no I cannot achieve this thing

173
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:24,712
that you're asking me to achieve.

174
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:30,894
We then reward the person for cooperating,

175
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:33,054
or I guess cooperating is not the best word,

176
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:36,055
but for interacting in a way that's mutually beneficial

177
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,696
by letting them know what they're gonna get out

178
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:38,716
of that negotiation.

179
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:42,658
and be mindful of your objectives without being distracted.

180
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:45,240
And distracted are things like broken record techniques,

181
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,341
when someone isn't absorbing the information

182
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,323
and so they're saying the same thing over and over again,

183
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:50,803
hoping to get a different response,

184
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,785
bringing it back to the present.

185
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:55,527
Appearing effective and competent,

186
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,529
even when you don't feel effective and competent.

187
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:01,771
And so that's why I was in a hotel for five hours yesterday

188
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:03,012
practicing this talk.

189
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:06,857
So even if I don't feel like I know what I'm talking about,

190
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,218
even if I don't feel ready,

191
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:09,578
there's a muscle memory there

192
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:11,359
that's just doing it regardless.

193
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,341
Practice, talk to the mirror,

194
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:14,922
talk to your partner, role play.

195
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,903
It's really, really good, really effective.

196
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,845
And negotiate alternate solutions.

197
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:26,120
The build model is specifically designed to deal with conflict in the workplace,

198
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,002
particularly allegations of bullying and harassment, so this is a really, really good

199
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:37,164
model to use if you're in a leadership position and you're having to deal with a team complaint

200
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:44,907
or conflict between two members of your crew. So, B is labelling their behaviour.

201
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:51,421
not the person. So it's not the person that is bad, the behaviour was the thing that was

202
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:57,444
undesirable. Show that you understand why they did it in the context of the situation,

203
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:03,867
and explain to them the impact that that behaviour had. Listen to their point of view, and offer

204
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:07,329
a different solution. What could they do differently next time?

205
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:19,201
Emre Kandani, CEO of Mayday, previously founder and CEO of Opaque Space, he told me that leadership

206
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:25,384
is a form of service, that the leader's role is to remove any barriers that exist to the

207
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:27,705
employee achieving their full potential.

208
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:33,989
That hit a number of these concepts again.

209
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,830
This graph will be coming up a lot.

210
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:40,273
That's relevant to goals, to organizational factors,

211
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,573
to leadership as an important concept,

212
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,194
to accountability and procedures.

213
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,315
And I also spoke to an incredible, incredible woman

214
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,895
from New Zealand called Zoe Hobson,

215
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:51,776
who's the managing director of Runaway Play.

216
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:56,257
Zoe actually got the prime minister of New Zealand

217
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,097
to come to their studio.

218
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:04,899
to talk about video games and she was able to convince the Prime Minister of New Zealand

219
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,383
that video games are an awesome and valid medium worth investing in.

220
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:12,204
So basically my hero.

221
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:18,488
She said that you should surround yourself with great people whose skills complement

222
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:20,170
yours and trust them.

223
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,142
She got a tip from the previous director of Runaway called Tim.

224
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:28,644
She said, it sounds simple, but care about your people.

225
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:32,427
Believe and treat people like you are lucky to have them,

226
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:36,149
not that they are lucky to have a job at your company.

227
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,392
And that also ties in with something that Ryan said

228
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:42,013
about not saying that people are his team,

229
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:44,915
it's not my programmer, it's not my artist.

230
00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:47,737
They're all part of the same team,

231
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:49,558
and no one belongs to somebody else.

232
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:55,791
transparency, be honest and open with the people you lead, and they will be honest and

233
00:14:55,951 --> 00:15:03,575
open in return. Zoe hit on, again, interpersonal relationships. This is something that every

234
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:12,440
single person consistently brought up. Trust, skills, and commitment. And what both Zoe

235
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:19,984
and Emery were describing was an ethical leadership model. Within this model, you have

236
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:24,925
The light blue in the middle at the bottom there is the team, and the goal is that they

237
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,707
feel safe, supported, competent, and motivated.

238
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:33,292
They want to be able to come to work, to know that they're doing a good job, to be rewarded

239
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,634
and fulfilled by that job, and to know that there's a future in it.

240
00:15:37,074 --> 00:15:40,757
And there's a way of helping them to achieve that which, of course, increases productivity.

241
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:45,321
This means surrounding them in containment.

242
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:50,695
surrounding them in things that keep them safe, that keep them motivated, and making

243
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:57,320
sure that that's pervasive throughout the culture of the studio. So accountability and

244
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:04,326
trust being that big overarching theme, you have to be being made accountable for not

245
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:12,152
only what you're doing, but what the team is doing as well. If there is a problem happening,

246
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:18,038
That's your responsibility as the leader. The performance of the team is the product

247
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,442
of their environment, and you shape the environment. That might require a bit of rejigging of your

248
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:29,786
perspective about what makes a team functional. If there is one problem person, why is that?

249
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:35,430
Is it that they don't have the resources to do what they need to do? Is it that they were

250
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,373
a bad cultural fit for the team, and could your hiring processes be amended?

251
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:46,999
to actually account for that in the future, it all comes back to a singular person or

252
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:52,961
group of people taking whole accountability for everything that goes on in the team, never

253
00:16:53,021 --> 00:17:00,803
shirking responsibility. Behavioural modelling is an enormously important concept that we

254
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,604
do and are influenced by.

255
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:06,480
constantly, all day, every day.

256
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,961
We, have you ever had a friend

257
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,503
and you spend so much time together

258
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,024
that you start saying their little catchphrases?

259
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,266
You start like picking up words

260
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,967
and things that they do and using it?

261
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,908
That's behavioral modeling.

262
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,850
You have taken what you liked about that person

263
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:25,773
and integrated it into your own personality and character.

264
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:29,776
And we do that fluidly, constantly, all the time.

265
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,278
When you are in a leadership position,

266
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:36,063
Everyone is looking to you to set the example.

267
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:40,135
You have to be the team you want to see.

268
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:44,725
That was a rhyme that I made up on the fly and I'm quite proud of it.

269
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:46,266
Be the team you want to see.

270
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:50,790
It's that thing about never punishing the behaviour you want.

271
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,593
So the example being the teenager who's moody and won't come to have dinner

272
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:56,715
with the family or staying in their bedroom.

273
00:17:56,955 --> 00:18:00,538
The one day they come down to the dinner table and the mum or dad says,

274
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:02,119
oh, thanks for joining us.

275
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,842
That sort of sarcasm and criticism of their good deed

276
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:08,124
is not going to encourage them to do that again.

277
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:09,645
What this person has learned is, well,

278
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:13,467
if I behave in this way, I get punished, but if I behave in this other way, I also get

279
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:20,930
punished, so how do I win here? Be patient and tolerant. Be able to reward good behaviour,

280
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:26,813
and instead of punishing behaviour that you don't want to see, reframe it, remodel it,

281
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:32,196
and show the people in your team how to be that positive influence. If you've got someone

282
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:35,897
that is always complaining and whinging and bringing negativity to the team meetings or

283
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,659
stand-up every day, take what they say and validate it.

284
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:46,778
thank you for bringing that incredible insight. I wonder if we could think about it in this

285
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:53,243
way instead, or I wonder could I provide you with this resource that might make it better

286
00:18:53,623 --> 00:19:00,548
and show that you're not engaging and you're not indulging in the complaining, but you're

287
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:07,853
being productive, and you're assisting, you're giving them what you can. Other people will

288
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:08,313
copy that.

289
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:09,635
They will.

290
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:14,239
They will take it, they will copy it with each other, and that's how you shape company

291
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:14,699
culture.

292
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:20,123
It comes top-down, and it has to, because everybody looks up to ultimately one or a

293
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:24,887
small group of people at the end of the day, and you are going to be what the team needs

294
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:25,407
to become.

295
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,952
Curated transparency was a really interesting concept that Emre specifically said.

296
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:38,686
It's going back to this concept from the interpersonal relationship of the information manipulation

297
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:43,689
theory of only letting people know what they need to know, but having a transparent process,

298
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:50,953
so if they come and ask, you tell them, or if it's appropriate in your company protocols

299
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:56,195
and policies, you tell them, but you're withholding things that are going to cause them undue

300
00:19:56,235 --> 00:19:56,655
stress.

301
00:19:57,036 --> 00:20:01,358
They don't need to know the nitty-gritty details of the publishing deal.

302
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:05,694
That's not something that's going to help them by increasing their motivation.

303
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:07,795
That's just going to cause them stress and anxiety.

304
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:12,597
And what this is going back to is Herzberg's motivation hygiene theory.

305
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:15,519
And I don't really like the word hygiene,

306
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:21,482
but apparently hygiene is job satisfaction and motivation is satisfaction.

307
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:26,804
And you would think that job satisfaction and dissatisfaction are just opposites

308
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:28,025
of the same, but they're not.

309
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:29,766
So you can have a very.

310
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:35,137
satisfying job but still not like it because there are dissatisfying factors.

311
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:41,423
Or you can have a job that's very dissatisfying but you still enjoy it because it has satisfaction.

312
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:47,469
They're the same thing but these two things are different. So minimising dissatisfaction is what

313
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:52,053
Emery was saying about minimising barriers that people have to being their best self.

314
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:58,230
minimising and removing any obstacles that someone has to being productive, to being

315
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,494
motivated and to doing what they need to do in the studio. That's things like protecting

316
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:09,197
them against discrimination and tackling the disadvantage that they might be seeing. It's

317
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:15,041
accommodating for the variety of things that happen in people's life that they just cannot

318
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:19,303
control for, and, importantly, having a mental health protocol.

319
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,921
Now, I just did a talk about mental illness representation.

320
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:27,664
The figure is between 25 and 50 per cent of people have a mental health issue at some

321
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,464
point in their life.

322
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:29,885
That's huge.

323
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:31,266
That's half your workforce.

324
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:33,087
Have a mental health protocol.

325
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:37,789
If you don't know how to make one, talk to us at Checkpoint, checkpoint.org.com, or at

326
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,750
checkpoint.org on Twitter, or just email me.

327
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,251
I have a gazillion business cards.

328
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:47,374
We've got AAA model manuals which is our mental health protocol for studios, and it's a self-care

329
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:48,135
guide for developers.

330
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:48,395
Check it out.

331
00:21:48,947 --> 00:21:52,588
Just have it, just think about it, start thinking about it, start that dialogue.

332
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:55,289
Because if you're supporting people's mental health at work,

333
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,989
they're going to feel safe, they're going to feel competent,

334
00:21:58,009 --> 00:21:59,730
they're going to feel like you care.

335
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,211
Like, give a shit, basically.

336
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:05,551
One of my bosses, when I was working in the emergency department,

337
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,152
he was like, look, if I can't teach you anything else, just give a shit.

338
00:22:08,512 --> 00:22:11,033
That's all I want you to do, just give a shit.

339
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:18,823
maximising satisfaction much easier, maintaining goals and directions, ensuring resources are

340
00:22:18,863 --> 00:22:23,047
available to the best of your ability, giving responsibility and rewarding achievement. Now,

341
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:27,711
reward doesn't have to be financial, it can just be verbal validation, just you did a good job

342
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:33,216
can go so far with so many people, you don't know whether they've never heard that before.

343
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,344
Just tell people how good they're doing

344
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:37,887
and they feel like they're doing good

345
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:40,450
and then surprise, surprise, they wanna do even better.

346
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,872
They wanna keep going.

347
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:44,014
They wanna continue getting that validation.

348
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,918
It's a simple thing, but so easy to forget

349
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:47,819
when you're stressed out.

350
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:53,089
Finally, I was thrilled to talk to Blake from League of Geeks.

351
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:57,630
He was very kind to be able to give me some of his wisdom and knowledge.

352
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,152
Blake said, have a set of principles that you and your studio stand for

353
00:23:02,312 --> 00:23:04,792
and importantly understand why those are your principles

354
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:06,133
and why you stand by them.

355
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:11,054
Always act, speak, write like you're being watched, recorded

356
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:12,855
or any other party can hear you.

357
00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:15,595
There's only one path to the top of the mountain

358
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:17,436
and it's not taking the low road.

359
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:19,667
Always take the high road.

360
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:24,309
Surround yourself with intelligent, moral and caring people.

361
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:28,010
You are the sum of the people you surround yourself with

362
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:31,552
and you do have control over who you spend your time with.

363
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,013
So choose carefully.

364
00:23:33,973 --> 00:23:36,574
Blake also gave me a list of bonus advice.

365
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:39,796
Set healthy boundaries, consider risk, plan well,

366
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:42,997
govern responsibility and never take advantage of anyone.

367
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:48,828
So again, we're hitting things like organizational factors,

368
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,371
goals, trust, and importantly, procedures.

369
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:55,353
And what Blake has touched on

370
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:59,876
is a really awesome unified theory of leadership

371
00:24:00,057 --> 00:24:04,960
and the psychological approach to leadership

372
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,422
called transformational leadership theory.

373
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:11,445
Now, this is part of an overarching concept,

374
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:14,387
which is called full-range leadership model.

375
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,101
And that includes two other models of leadership.

376
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,762
One is called the, and excuse my French pronunciation,

377
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:24,043
the laissez-faire leadership,

378
00:24:25,343 --> 00:24:27,564
and also transactional leadership.

379
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:30,645
Now, laissez-faire means do what you want.

380
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:32,346
Literally, that's what it means in French.

381
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:36,587
It's a model of leadership where the person

382
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:38,368
who is in the leadership position,

383
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:41,369
instead of being in a democracy,

384
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,770
instead of saying, well, here are the options you choose,

385
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:49,203
there are no options. Everyone can just do whatever they want all the time. So that's

386
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:56,770
the very loose way of doing it. Transactional leadership is reward and punishment, so transactional

387
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:03,277
being that parent-child model that we were talking about earlier, and transformational

388
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:08,281
leadership is kind of renowned as being the most unified and

389
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:16,393
important, the most beneficial leadership model. It enhances team motivation, morale,

390
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:23,736
and job performance, because essentially what you're doing is you're not creating a company.

391
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:31,339
You're not creating a team. You're creating a collective of people that have a unified

392
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:36,921
identity. You're doing that as the leader. You're helping people to find

393
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:40,166
their individual place in a collective,

394
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:46,131
and you're modelling to them what you feel that that collective should be,

395
00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:50,855
essentially creating, like you would design a game,

396
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:54,158
the studio that you want to work in.

397
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:56,440
You have the power to do that,

398
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,223
and to me that is really, really cool.

399
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,647
I would really, really, really like to thank...

400
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:10,248
League of Geeks, Studio Mayday, Runaway, Play,

401
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,949
Embrace Yourself Games for contributing to this talk.

402
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,231
As I say, we have our self-care guide for game developers

403
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,052
here, which is called the AAA model.

404
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:24,673
You can find out more and find more mental health resources

405
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:25,954
at checkpointorg.com.

406
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:27,915
This has been a whirlwind tour.

407
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:34,496
of leadership. I hope it was helpful by applying some practical examples of studios that I

408
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:40,180
personally respect from people that I think are the bomb, and bringing them to you and

409
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:46,824
giving you the reasons why, in psychological models, their advice works. You have the power

410
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:53,348
to do this. You are going to do great. You are going to mould and model the teams around

411
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:58,211
you and make awesome things with awesome people. Thank you for coming.

412
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:00,632
I very much appreciate your time.

413
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:09,336
Thank you, Jennifer.

414
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:10,657
We have a few minutes for questions.

415
00:27:10,717 --> 00:27:13,719
If you'd like to ask Jennifer a question, please come to the mic in the aisle there.

416
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:18,261
And if no one else has one, I will start things off.

417
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:18,821
No, we do.

418
00:27:19,822 --> 00:27:20,062
Go ahead.

419
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:20,482
Hey.

420
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:21,243
Hi.

421
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,283
Hi, how are you?

422
00:27:22,703 --> 00:27:24,344
Very well, thank you.

423
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:25,205
Great talk.

424
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,946
So with the models that you're talking about, it...

425
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:32,844
feels very classical hierarchical type of model.

426
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:35,670
I guess with a lot of indies and stuff like that,

427
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,997
I guess it's very much like either a band mentality or like.

428
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,866
you know, a small group of people.

429
00:27:41,986 --> 00:27:45,948
Is there, I guess, models as well that kind of do this kind of

430
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:49,150
pass the baton type of leadership or, you know,

431
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,151
kind of like this small collective leadership?

432
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:52,111
Yeah, absolutely.

433
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:54,172
I mean, there's models for everything that you want there

434
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:54,912
to be a model for.

435
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:56,693
I'm sure someone somewhere has thought about it.

436
00:27:57,013 --> 00:27:58,754
The concepts to me are the same.

437
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:00,635
The take-home messages are the same.

438
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:02,596
It's that regardless of whether you're...

439
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:06,656
in a clear hierarchy and you're at the top of it, or if you're a mid-tier or low-tier,

440
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:11,181
or you're in a completely flat hierarchy and everybody is equal, you're still modelling

441
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:17,647
through your actions and behaviour what you want to be seen and what you want to be the

442
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:22,772
product of the people around you. So that's something that you can learn, not just in

443
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:25,495
a workplace but in relationships or in a family model.

444
00:28:26,514 --> 00:28:30,999
If you treat people the way that you want to be treated, if you treat and behave in

445
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,861
the way that you would like to see, people are going to see the benefits of that and

446
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:38,005
they're going to take as much as they can, pieces of that, and then reflect it back to

447
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:38,205
you.

448
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:39,587
Cool.

449
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:40,327
Thank you so much.

450
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:41,128
You're welcome.

451
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:44,111
Go ahead.

452
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:45,192
Hello, doctor.

453
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:46,073
Hi there.

454
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:47,134
I had a question.

455
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:48,015
It still feels weird.

456
00:28:48,055 --> 00:28:48,976
It's been nearly 10 years.

457
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:49,456
Go on.

458
00:28:49,756 --> 00:28:49,956
Of course.

459
00:28:50,457 --> 00:28:51,458
I had a question about...

460
00:28:52,473 --> 00:28:55,655
how you create that sense of safety and trust in your team.

461
00:28:56,355 --> 00:28:58,717
And if you have any recommendations on exercises

462
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:02,479
or certain things you can do with your team to build that.

463
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:04,860
Like trust building and stuff like that.

464
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:08,683
Well, look, I mean, I don't know if you have anything

465
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:11,944
to contribute there, Ryan, being the indie leader.

466
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,307
I always really, really enjoy.

467
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:20,495
mindfulness-based exercises.

468
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:23,997
Mindfulness has like a real strong basis

469
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:28,221
in not only mental health, but just in everyday life.

470
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:30,342
It can reduce stress, reduce anxiety,

471
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:32,624
and make people feel more productive and competent.

472
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:34,966
In terms of trust building,

473
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,128
this is just an example from my other life

474
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,270
when being a doctor, we had a team building day

475
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,872
where we all just sat around and we had an agenda

476
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:45,033
and we literally just were able to talk out.

477
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:50,895
everything that was bothering us about the current setup and then problem solved together.

478
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:57,081
And because we had people who were in very strong, they were very confident in being

479
00:29:57,101 --> 00:30:02,726
that kind of, in a position of everything will be okay, I'm happy to take all of this

480
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:06,409
anxiety, contain it and then deliver it back to you in a way that is digestible.

481
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:09,572
We were able to work through so much of that.

482
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:10,493
And it does take.

483
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:16,442
you know, someone or multiple someone's taking that role of, well, I'm going to be the one that absorbs everything.

484
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:19,725
And I'm going to be the person that molds what's happening around me.

485
00:30:20,826 --> 00:30:22,468
But I mean, that's a very vague example.

486
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:26,452
But Ryan, yeah, we try to do do things together as much as possible.

487
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:29,795
We go on trips and things like that and go to conventions and demo and whatnot together.

488
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,261
Some of them are like in exotic places.

489
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:34,722
We've gone recently to Taipei Game Show and to Shanghai

490
00:30:34,762 --> 00:30:35,442
and things like that.

491
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:38,203
And it's partly to demo our games and whatnot,

492
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:40,784
but it's also like so that we get to do something together

493
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:42,925
and afterwards like we really nailed that

494
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:44,626
and it feels good to know that you can rely

495
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:46,286
on the other people on your team and stuff like that.

496
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,587
So, you know, just doing stuff together like that

497
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,708
and being proud of what you did,

498
00:30:50,188 --> 00:30:52,068
I think builds a lot of trust.

499
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:54,949
Thank you.

500
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:55,510
Time for one more?

501
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:03,312
Hi, so one question I have is related to the interpersonal relationship part, especially

502
00:31:03,352 --> 00:31:04,633
working across distributed teams.

503
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:10,756
So we're expanding, we're adding teams across several continents, and I'm wondering if you

504
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:13,777
had any tips or suggestions in terms of how do you do that, because it's different when

505
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:16,399
you're in the office, obviously, or in the same geographic area.

506
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,540
You can get together, you can go for drinks, it's much easier to organize those sort of

507
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:19,821
things.

508
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:24,023
But I'm curious to hear your insights, if you had any recommendations on how to maintain

509
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:27,465
those interpersonal relationships more effectively across different geographies.

510
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:30,316
In terms of you've got a digital relationship,

511
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:35,099
so Checkpoint exists digitally.

512
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,279
Our team is spread out.

513
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:37,760
I live in Wellington, New Zealand.

514
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,983
My incredible, incredible colleague, Pritika,

515
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:43,923
lives in Melbourne.

516
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:46,024
She's just there and I love her and she's amazing,

517
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:47,825
but you can't have her, she's mine, sorry.

518
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,127
And we have a variety of other members

519
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:54,128
that some live in rural Victoria

520
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:57,810
and a variety of places in Australia and the US.

521
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:02,836
and we have, we used to just get on with stuff,

522
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:05,136
and it just wasn't working as well

523
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:08,437
as now we have online stand-ups twice a week,

524
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,418
where we all make the effort,

525
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,678
despite what time zone we're in,

526
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:14,158
to be there and talk to each other,

527
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:17,099
and having that consistency for us was really helpful,

528
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:19,859
of just like, we are going to do this right now,

529
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:22,420
and then it becomes, I mean,

530
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,360
we see each other at cons and stuff,

531
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,840
but those interpersonal things.

532
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:31,490
relationships still get played out, it just gets played out in a slightly different way

533
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:36,753
and it's finding how you can apply these same things but in the digital interactions.

534
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:39,054
And it still happens exactly the same.

535
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:42,656
Yeah, it's hard.

536
00:32:43,037 --> 00:32:45,078
It's not easy, I acknowledge that for sure.

537
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:48,700
Again, have you got any response to that?

538
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,241
Sorry, I didn't think of anything for that.

539
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:50,821
No worries.

540
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:52,995
Thank you.

541
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:53,797
Alright, thanks everyone.

542
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:57,166
Make sure that you fill out your email surveys to let Jennifer know what you thought.

543
00:32:57,246 --> 00:32:57,908
Thanks so much, Jennifer.
