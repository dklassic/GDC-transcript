1
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:06,683
All right, hello.

2
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:08,305
My name is Jason Grimblatt.

3
00:00:08,305 --> 00:00:10,467
I'm the co-founder of a small indie studio

4
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:12,069
called Freehold Games.

5
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:15,252
And we make a game called Caves of Qud,

6
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:20,978
which is a hybrid open world RPG science fantasy roguelike.

7
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,479
And we do a lot of experimentation

8
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:23,520
with procedural generation.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,682
So today I'm gonna tell you about a recent system

10
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:28,525
we designed for procedurally generating history

11
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:29,446
for our game world.

12
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,622
So if you could first imagine with me, if you will,

13
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:37,387
that you're a lore seeker in a wild and fractured world,

14
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:41,392
you've just come to a strange land called Kud

15
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:44,897
where poison jungles strangle rusted archways

16
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,459
and chrome steeples to the earth.

17
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,354
Your first stop is this oasis village called Jopa.

18
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:53,556
And as you arrive in Jopa, you notice

19
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:55,538
that in the northeast corner, there's

20
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:58,241
this vine swath stone shrine.

21
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:00,844
So you move up to approach it.

22
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:03,226
And as you examine it, you see that it's actually

23
00:01:03,226 --> 00:01:05,729
depicting a historical event from the region.

24
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,413
So it's a shrine to Umes II, Miraborn.

25
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:12,637
While leading a small army in the foreign province, Alep,

26
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:15,220
Umes II assassinated the Sultan of Qud

27
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,545
over an ordinance prohibiting the practice of staining glass.

28
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,347
She won and ascended to the crown.

29
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,488
She was six years old.

30
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:27,318
So this is an example of the procedural history

31
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:28,719
that was generated for one game.

32
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,560
So I'm gonna tell you about how we got here

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,221
and here's the path we're gonna take to do it.

34
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:35,883
I'm going to just talk about proceduralizing history

35
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:37,564
in general and give you some examples.

36
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:41,246
I'll set the context by giving you a little more information

37
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:43,567
about Caves of Qud and some of our constraints

38
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,989
and aesthetics that we followed

39
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:47,850
to arrive at the design we did.

40
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,194
I'll show you some more examples of our generated histories and talk about our model.

41
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:56,659
I'll give you a quick crash course on replacement grammars, and that'll segue into a discussion

42
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,761
of how we do our text generation.

43
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:01,805
I'll talk about the causality and narrative coherence for our histories.

44
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:06,310
And then finally, I'll just give you some resources and takeaways for generating histories

45
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,911
on your own systems.

46
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:14,606
Okay, so it's kind of corny to start with the dictionary definition in a talk,

47
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:16,867
but when we're talking about something as abstract as history,

48
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,627
I think it's useful to get on the same page.

49
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:23,109
So the definition that I best liked was from dictionary.com,

50
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,651
a continuous systematic narrative of past events

51
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,312
relating to a particular people, country, period, person, etc.

52
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:34,345
So when we started to think about how to proceduralize history,

53
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:37,587
when we started to really like study history and think about it deeply,

54
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:40,350
we came upon this model that I'm going to talk about now.

55
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,012
So this is a subfield of procedural generation

56
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:44,413
that I think is in its infancy.

57
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:49,357
There's no real canonical formulation for a procedural history system.

58
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:50,598
So this is what we came up with.

59
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:53,360
And the patterns I've sort of seen repeated

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,662
in some of the other games that are generating history,

61
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:58,664
including the examples I'll talk about.

62
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:03,528
So these type of systems, they tend to model historical entities.

63
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:09,812
These are things like people, places, items sometimes, like artifacts.

64
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:15,176
They model historical events which change the property of these entities,

65
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:17,538
these events that sort of act on these entities.

66
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:22,701
The events are related together via some sort of underlying logic,

67
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:26,604
and then the events are exposed to players often via text generation.

68
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:34,350
So probably the like canonical example of procedural history generation is

69
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,435
Tarrin and Zack Adams' dwarf settlement management game Dwarf Fortress.

70
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:42,398
So it's really like the most granular simulation.

71
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:45,181
It's simulation happening at the level of like individual dwarves and

72
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,743
like deep physical simulations and

73
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,826
they're sort of combining to give this emergent.

74
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:54,869
um, history. So there's Dwarf Fortune's Legends mode where you can just read like, you can

75
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:59,411
generate a world and just read the, the annals of the world, just, just kind of record of

76
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:05,994
the history. Their system is interesting because events are chosen from a, a larger pool of,

77
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:11,756
Basically, the events are these newsworthy events that are chosen from a larger pool

78
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:12,236
of events.

79
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:18,179
So, you know, a dwarf is going about his life, the simulation's running, and when the system

80
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:22,101
flags something as newsworthy, it gets, like, logged in the History Chronicle, and that's

81
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:26,823
what you end up seeing in the Dwarf Fortress Legends mode when you're reading through the

82
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:27,143
annuls.

83
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,901
Interestingly, this is kind of how real life works, right?

84
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:33,343
Like we have some, you know,

85
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,885
we're going about our everyday lives

86
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:38,768
and someone is marking some subset of the events

87
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:41,210
that happened to us as newsworthy and recording those,

88
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,911
and that's what becomes history.

89
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:46,863
And the events are related via the underlying logic

90
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:47,723
of the simulation.

91
00:04:47,723 --> 00:04:51,905
So if a dwarf goes, like the first event in this list

92
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:55,727
here is that this dwarf becomes queen of the unseen minds.

93
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:58,229
So if this dwarf becomes queen of the unseen minds

94
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:00,950
and then attracts some other dwarfs to her location

95
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,911
and one of them betrays her and goes and founds another city

96
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,352
and that city attacks the unseen minds

97
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:08,433
and that attack, that battle is flagged

98
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,514
as a newsworthy event and gets logged into history.

99
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:15,257
The way that those two events are related, the founding of the Unseen Minds and then

100
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:19,739
that battle, is through those interstitial events that are not recorded as history but

101
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,080
are still part of the simulation.

102
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:25,828
So this is a very granular, low-level simulation.

103
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,289
So on the other end of the spectrum,

104
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,691
I want to talk a little bit about Epitaph.

105
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:31,772
Epitaph is an idle game where you're sort of

106
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:35,255
directing the course of history for a civilization.

107
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:36,976
It was developed by Max Kraminski,

108
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:40,558
who's a game researcher at the Expressive Intelligence

109
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:42,780
Studio at UC Santa Cruz.

110
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,341
Whereas Dwarf Fortress is this very granular, low-level simulation,

111
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:49,382
Epitaph is a very coarse-grained simulation.

112
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,183
It's not simulating on the level of individual people,

113
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,224
it's simulating civilizations.

114
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:58,105
And the historic events in Epitaph are civilization-wide events,

115
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,566
like your civilization acquires a new technology

116
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:03,306
or has a famine that kills a lot of people.

117
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,154
Epitaph is interesting because the player actually is in the driver's seat.

118
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:11,837
They're directing the course of history.

119
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:15,742
What you're doing is you're choosing basically like the tech tree of the civilization.

120
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:20,508
You're choosing to give the civilization a certain technology and that influences the

121
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:21,770
course of history.

122
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,476
And the way that events are related in EPITAP is that they,

123
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:27,397
when an event happens,

124
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:29,419
it influences the likelihood of future events.

125
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:31,582
So there's sort of a weighted table of events

126
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:33,665
that can happen that gets updated

127
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:35,868
every time an event occurs.

128
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,780
Okay, so before I jump into Caves of Qud,

129
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,661
I just wanna talk a little bit about the challenges

130
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:47,162
of procedurally generating history that we came up with,

131
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:50,143
you know, came upon as we started to do this.

132
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,843
So probably first and foremost

133
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:54,584
is just history's immense complexity.

134
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:57,145
So history is this dense, tangled network

135
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:59,325
of people, places, and things.

136
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:02,126
The relational mechanics are often quite obscure.

137
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:04,287
It's hard to draw clear causality

138
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,027
between one event and another often.

139
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:10,809
And so that's something we needed to reckon with as we started to try to systemize history,

140
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,550
systematize history.

141
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,452
There's also this idea that history has a rhetorical function.

142
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:20,554
So I think unfortunately in games we tend to treat history fairly reductively.

143
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:27,137
We think of it as this sort of objective monolith of, you know, this monolith of objective events

144
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:30,699
that are just recorded and that we can rely on and are trustworthy.

145
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:37,921
When really all historical accounts are written by a person at a period in time that has some

146
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:42,062
biased perspective, there's always a sort of filtering through a particular lens.

147
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:48,484
And so capturing that inherent bias to the enterprise of history at all is something

148
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:49,484
that we wanted to think about.

149
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:53,239
And then there was this idea that we were integrating

150
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,942
this procedural history system with a game that already

151
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,943
had a lot of content in it, it was well-fleshed out.

152
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,844
So we needed to think about how we wanted to integrate it

153
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:03,406
with our other systems and how it would contribute

154
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:04,787
to the overall vision of the game.

155
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:07,846
Okay, so Caves of Qud.

156
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:10,308
So Caves of Qud is an open world science,

157
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:11,648
fantasy, roguelike, and RPG.

158
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:15,731
It's heavily inspired by an old pen and paper RPG

159
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:17,832
called Gamma World, which was a derivative

160
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:21,514
of Dungeons and Dragons, where a nuclear apocalypse

161
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,995
had sort of destroyed the world,

162
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:28,457
and nuclear radiation had mutated and uplifted animals

163
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:30,558
and plants to human-level sentience,

164
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:31,619
human-level intelligence.

165
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:35,308
There's a handcrafted narrative like the type you might see

166
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:36,689
in a Bethesda open world RPG,

167
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:39,671
but we've weaved it around these simulative systems.

168
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:41,293
So there are physical systems,

169
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,634
every wall has a melting point,

170
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:44,555
you could dig a tunnel anywhere in the world.

171
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:47,698
There are social systems, there are these 60 factions

172
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:49,340
that you can gain favor with

173
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,421
and navigate their relationships.

174
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:54,164
And then most recently is this historical simulation.

175
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:57,486
And the tagline is chisel through a layer cake

176
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:59,108
of thousand year old civilizations.

177
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:05,173
So I think it's not particularly meaningful

178
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,335
to talk about our design without talking about

179
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:09,056
the constraints and aesthetic principles

180
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:12,038
that led us to where we ended up with the design,

181
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:12,918
so I wanna do that a bit.

182
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,599
So on the left-hand side here,

183
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,581
I just have some constraints or aesthetics,

184
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:19,062
and then the right-hand side is the approach

185
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:21,464
that we took as a result of the constraint.

186
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:24,866
So one, we were interested in this idea

187
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:25,767
of history as an artifact,

188
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,888
and what I mean by that is that we were interested in,

189
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:35,037
The NPCs and players who are kind of working in the game world's present,

190
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:37,878
we were interested in how they engaged with that game world's past.

191
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,660
So specifically through the lens of the present.

192
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,463
So how they encountered historical text, how they engaged with

193
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:50,725
artifacts that were from a particular point in history, but

194
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,707
were being engaged with in the present.

195
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:57,471
And so to that end, we decided that what we really wanted to do was simulate historical

196
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:02,776
accounts, simulate these cultural artifacts that had some historical resonance or meaning

197
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,118
to them, simulate historical texts.

198
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:09,421
And if that meant that we could cheat a little bit on the actual historical logic that got

199
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:12,945
us there, that was okay as long as the historical accounts were authentic.

200
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:17,798
We were also constrained by resources and the game's voice.

201
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:19,179
So again, like I mentioned, Caves of Qud

202
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,160
is a game that was already quite fleshed out

203
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,741
when we decided to add procedural history.

204
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:26,123
Procedural history is really just kind of like

205
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:27,764
a tertiary system for the game.

206
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,725
And so we knew we didn't have the resources

207
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:33,467
to fully develop a generative history system

208
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,768
that we might have if we were building

209
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:35,988
a whole game around it.

210
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:41,092
There's also this idea that we've done a bunch of like hand-crafted world building for the game,

211
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:47,456
and so we needed the procedural histories to jive with the game's voice that we had already established.

212
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:53,581
So to that end, what we decided to do is we decided to condense the huge enterprise of...

213
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:58,189
proceduralizing history and just center the history around the mythic lives of

214
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:01,090
these five ancient rulers who are called sultans.

215
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,171
And in particular, the sultanate, the period where the sultans lived,

216
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:09,093
would take place before a lot of the handwritten lore in the game was set.

217
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:14,786
Okay, so we really value novelty in our output.

218
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:16,446
This is like an aesthetic principle of ours.

219
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,067
We like to let our generators run wild

220
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:21,007
and see what they tell us about our systems.

221
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:24,448
So to that end, we really wanted to avoid prescribing

222
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:27,149
any sort of narrative arc for the sultan's lives.

223
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,009
So we didn't wanna say that the sultan

224
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:32,590
has some formative experience in their early age

225
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,271
and then some trial or tribulation in their 20s

226
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,231
or something like that.

227
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:39,552
We wanted that life arc to sort of emerge organically

228
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:41,352
from the system, so we didn't wanna prescribe it.

229
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:44,057
We also knew we could rely on rich narrative context

230
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:46,923
and apophanea, I think I'm pronouncing that wrong,

231
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,246
apophanea is how to pronounce it.

232
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:51,906
So that's this phenomenon where humans, as humans,

233
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:54,046
were kind of primed to see patterns in things

234
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,667
that are not necessarily there.

235
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,348
So we knew that these histories would be generated

236
00:11:58,348 --> 00:12:01,869
in a game world that has been very lovingly handcrafted,

237
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:04,130
and there's a real rich narrative context there.

238
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,510
So whenever you engage with the history,

239
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,371
when the player was gonna engage with the history,

240
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:09,791
they would have that context,

241
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,492
and we knew we could rely on that, we could lean on that.

242
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:15,603
And then finally, we really wanted the histories to have

243
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:18,144
like these characteristic, we wanted the sultans in

244
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:20,485
particular to have this characteristic personality and

245
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:22,126
this mythic quality to them.

246
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:24,867
We wanted to blur the line between history and myth.

247
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:28,649
And so we decided to assign each sultan this archetypical

248
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,390
unit of culture that we call a domain.

249
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,850
And a domain can be sort of like a thematic,

250
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,051
resonant phenomenon, like fire or ice,

251
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:37,932
or it could be something a little more abstract,

252
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:39,653
like might or scholarship.

253
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:42,114
If you are familiar with epic poetry,

254
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:45,375
the epithets in epic poetry, like Wiley Odysseus,

255
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:49,556
they were sort of meant to communicate the same thing,

256
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:51,937
like associate the sultan with a particular trait.

257
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:57,105
Okay, so here's how we actually generate history.

258
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:59,206
So every time you start a new game of Caves of Qud,

259
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,467
we generate a new history.

260
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:03,408
The history is segmented into five distinct periods.

261
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,410
Each period is centered around one of these sultans.

262
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,252
The periods themselves are comprised

263
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,213
of these historical events,

264
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,234
and each historical event generates

265
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:17,236
a descriptive text snippet that describes the event,

266
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:20,178
and this is what the players actually engage with.

267
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:21,899
We call these gospels.

268
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,140
So gospels are the basic units of historical record in Qud.

269
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:28,950
So how do players engage with the gospels?

270
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,212
They're either shared by NPCs and dialogue,

271
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,793
or they're in the descriptions of cultural artifacts,

272
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:38,056
things like shrines, like we see the shrine here

273
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:39,697
that I read the description from

274
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:41,018
at the beginning of the talk.

275
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,259
Painted objects, engraved objects.

276
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:46,722
Here's another example, this is a painted picture.

277
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:49,123
So this item is painted with a scene

278
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:51,265
from the life of the ancient sultan Artarum.

279
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:55,964
At twilight under a strange and onyx sky, the people of the Hermitage of the Unfamiliar

280
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:59,766
saw an image on the horizon that looked like an atomic clock bathed in onyx.

281
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:04,328
It was Ottorum, and after he came and left the Hermitage of the Unfamiliar, the people

282
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:07,430
built a monument to him, and thenceforth called him Clock in Onyx.

283
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:12,469
So as you encounter more and more NPCs,

284
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:14,471
as you're reading more of the descriptions

285
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:16,052
of these culture artifacts,

286
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,755
these gospels get inscribed into a player journal

287
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:19,696
in chronological order.

288
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,878
And as you encounter more objects,

289
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:24,801
as you get more of these gospels inscribed,

290
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:26,163
a narrative starts to cohere

291
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:27,624
around the lives of the sultans.

292
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,658
The final thing we do is that we take any of the historic sites

293
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:35,240
or relics that came out of history generation.

294
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,662
Again, this is all happening at the start of the game

295
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:39,483
before you're actually placed in the world.

296
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:42,686
We take any of those interesting historic sites or relics,

297
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:44,848
and we actually instantiate them in the world.

298
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:47,390
We make them real places that you can visit.

299
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,253
We populate them with cults that worship

300
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:51,634
these ancient sultans.

301
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:53,376
So there's like a.

302
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:57,833
they're inhabited within the games present.

303
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,194
You can go interact with these cults

304
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:00,094
and talk about the sultans.

305
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:05,056
So, like I said, the model we use,

306
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:07,557
our history is really this interplay

307
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:10,578
between historical entities and events.

308
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,819
Historical entities are, in our case,

309
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:15,280
are places, items, and the sultans themselves,

310
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,201
and they're represented as data structures.

311
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:19,241
They're essentially these buckets of properties.

312
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,844
And then the events, the historical events,

313
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:25,207
actually modify the properties of those entities.

314
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:30,012
And some examples of historical events are sieges a city,

315
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,276
builds an important building, gets captured by bandits.

316
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:35,678
So really, these are event templates

317
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,500
that get their details populated

318
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,503
when we're actually running the history.

319
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,244
So we wrote a bunch of event templates.

320
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:44,386
And you can see here we're going for like an ancient world aesthetic, right?

321
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:48,307
You can think of each of these as like, if you were reading the biography of an ancient

322
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:53,189
king or queen, these might each correspond to a chapter in that biography.

323
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:56,650
But of course if you were writing a different type of history, if you were generating the

324
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,871
history of a high school, your event templates would look much different, right?

325
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:05,573
You might have character fails a test or two characters going on a first date.

326
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:09,943
This special thing about the system is that the way the events actually resolve,

327
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:13,664
when an event is deciding how to resolve,

328
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,885
it does so partially through randomness,

329
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:23,007
but also partially through looking at the state of the properties of the entities that it's modifying

330
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:25,548
and choosing an outcome based on those.

331
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:27,869
So I'll explain how that works.

332
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:32,730
Let me walk you through the process of actually generating one of these sultans.

333
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:36,460
So the first thing we do is that we generate a Sultan,

334
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,102
we initialize their property, so we give them a name,

335
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:42,465
we give them a birth region, we assign one of these

336
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:45,769
culturally resonant phenomenon, these domains to them.

337
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,852
And then we choose, from our bag of event templates

338
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:51,194
that we have, things like sieges a city,

339
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:52,655
or builds an important building,

340
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:55,478
we choose one of those completely at random.

341
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,362
We then move on, we go on to resolve the details of that event.

342
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:05,004
And again, the resolution, the way that's done, it's based on looking at the state

343
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:08,945
of the sultan, looking at the sultan's properties and deciding how to resolve.

344
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,927
And then we generate a gospel via grammar and we update the state.

345
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:17,268
So again, remember the point of these events is to actually change the state

346
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:19,029
of the historical entities at play.

347
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:22,916
So we repeat the process about 12 times.

348
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,017
Each sultan has about 12 significant life events

349
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:26,417
in their life, give or take a few.

350
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:29,298
And then finally, if the sultan's still alive,

351
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,959
we have this generic death event where they die.

352
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:35,080
They may be dead already because sometime

353
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,461
during the course of their 12 life events,

354
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:42,562
sometimes they can die as the outcome of one of those events.

355
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,503
So you might.

356
00:17:44,045 --> 00:17:48,689
have picked up on the fact that the interesting property of this system is that there's actually

357
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:50,271
no logic behind the choice of the events.

358
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:55,976
So when we're choosing an event, like, say, a sultan just built an important building,

359
00:17:55,976 --> 00:18:00,621
if we choose the next event to be siege of the city, there is no reason why that was

360
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,161
chosen.

361
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:02,122
It's completely random.

362
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,736
So cause and effect aren't intrinsic to the system,

363
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:08,219
but the interesting thing is that these gospels,

364
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:10,282
these text snippets that actually describe

365
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:13,366
what's happening in the event, they profess causes.

366
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:15,188
If there's a siege of the city event,

367
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:19,694
it will often say why the sultan has sieged the city.

368
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:20,635
So how does that happen?

369
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:26,482
Well, the causes are actually these rationalizations that are decided after the fact,

370
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:28,984
and they're mediated by the sultan's state.

371
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,967
I'm going to give you some examples to talk about, you know, what that means,

372
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:35,790
but first I'm going to give you a very quick crash course on grammars.

373
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,854
So, the simplest way to say it is just that grammars are a way of defining things

374
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:41,816
in terms of smaller things.

375
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:44,839
And a replacement grammar, I'm going to talk about replacement grammar.

376
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:49,421
Specifically, a replacement grammar is just a string of symbols and rules for replacing

377
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:54,864
those symbols, in our case with either text or with other symbols that themselves have

378
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:58,026
rules that can be replaced with text.

379
00:18:58,026 --> 00:19:04,169
So grammars are used to model language, so we can think about the English sentence structure.

380
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:07,210
A sentence is made up of a noun phrase and a verb phrase.

381
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,791
A noun phrase can be something as simple as just the proper noun, John.

382
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:15,772
And then a verb phrase is made up of a verb and a noun phrase, the object that the verb's

383
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:16,632
acting on.

384
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:19,253
The verb could be the verb hit.

385
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:24,314
A noun phrase is made up of a determiner, in this case just the definite article the,

386
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:26,714
and a noun, ball.

387
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:31,976
So we get a sentence like John hit the ball out of this, you know, sentence structure

388
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:33,356
that was modeled via grammars.

389
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,199
So the way that works in our system,

390
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:39,580
how text generation works in our system,

391
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,802
we can look at a text template like this.

392
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:44,003
So this is one of the text templates

393
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:46,165
for the Siege of the City event.

394
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,286
Acting against injustice,

395
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,368
Sultan name led an army to the gates of location.

396
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:52,409
And so if we were to expand this,

397
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,771
this is what actual text looks like

398
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:56,432
that comes out of our system.

399
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,313
This is what an actual gospel looks like.

400
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:00,374
Acting against the persecution of frogs,

401
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:02,476
Othra deities led an army to the gates of Upir.

402
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:09,126
So with that in mind, let's look at this same text snippet

403
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,927
through the lens of how the causality is generated.

404
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:14,828
So again, we have acting against injustice,

405
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:17,208
sultan name led an army to the gates of location.

406
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,829
So the injustice in this case is the cause,

407
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:24,530
the reason why the sultan decided to siege the city.

408
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,271
So how do we actually choose a reason?

409
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,652
Well, again, we look at the properties

410
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,248
that the Sultan has.

411
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:36,311
So here you see the Sultan has a couple properties.

412
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:38,253
They have a list of allied factions.

413
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:40,275
So these are just some factions that

414
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:41,856
throughout the course of their life,

415
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:45,159
the Sultan had gained an affinity

416
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,041
for a particular faction.

417
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,682
In this case, it was frogs.

418
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,184
We also see here that the Sultan had a profession.

419
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,386
They were a geologist at some point in their life.

420
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:57,515
And so for this particular event,

421
00:20:57,515 --> 00:20:58,976
for the Siege of the City event,

422
00:20:58,976 --> 00:21:01,716
there happens to be a grammar rule that says,

423
00:21:01,716 --> 00:21:03,977
hey, if you have an allied faction,

424
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:06,257
if you're friendly with one of these factions,

425
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:11,038
replace injustice with the persecution of faction name.

426
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,819
And then in turn, faction name gets replaced

427
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:16,839
with whatever faction the sultan is friendly with.

428
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,280
So in this case, we have the sultan is friendly with frogs,

429
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,221
and so the injustice that the sultan is fighting against

430
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:24,041
gets replaced with.

431
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:25,562
the persecution of frogs.

432
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:30,065
So I wanna talk a little bit about how

433
00:21:30,065 --> 00:21:32,906
narratives can cohere out of these

434
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:34,627
disparate historical events,

435
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,069
and to do that I'm gonna read this example.

436
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,531
These are two gospels from the same history,

437
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,111
they appear right after each other.

438
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,293
So after treating with cats,

439
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:45,034
Antixoper convinced them to help her

440
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:47,335
found a dig site in the Philosopher's Quarter

441
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:49,016
of Shane Rook for the purpose of

442
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,938
excavating ancient blocks of ice.

443
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:53,139
They named it the Freezing Dig Site.

444
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:57,800
At the battle of Old Tagesh, Antixeker fought to liberate cats.

445
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,424
She wielded a frosty hammer with such prowess that it became forever known as Frosticus

446
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:02,744
Cat's Friend.

447
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:11,390
So we can see here that a little narrative is kind of cohered, right?

448
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:15,599
And the reason we can interpret that narrative

449
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,262
is because we're bringing some narrative context

450
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:20,923
to reading these two gospels.

451
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,385
So we see that Aunt Sixapur had some sort of secret meeting

452
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,906
with cats where she convinced them

453
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:27,348
to help her found a dig site.

454
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:30,410
The very next event, she fights to liberate cats.

455
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,393
So because we know how tit-for-tat works, how deals work,

456
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:39,775
kind of surmise that what might have happened is the sultan met with cats, said, hey, if

457
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:44,537
you help me found this dig site, I'll fight for you, I'll try to liberate you. But really

458
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:49,299
that's not what happened at all, right? Because we know when we pick the event,

459
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,421
sieges a city that was done totally randomly and this cause was just sort of rationalized.

460
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:59,502
So how was it done? So again, here's the cause.

461
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:04,242
She fought to liberate cats and when we needed to decide

462
00:23:04,242 --> 00:23:10,504
to actually expand into that cause, how we generated this text, we looked at the Sultan's State.

463
00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:15,825
So this previous event actually set the Sultan's State. So when an event

464
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:18,707
When an event is resolving and it looks at a sultan state,

465
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:21,109
if there isn't anything satisfactory to actually

466
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:24,692
produce good text, it'll set the state itself.

467
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:27,054
So this event, this top event here,

468
00:23:27,054 --> 00:23:29,637
actually set Antiksapur's relationship

469
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:31,278
with cats to friendly.

470
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:34,681
It said, hey, Antiksapur's now friendly with cats.

471
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,102
She treated with cats in this event.

472
00:23:36,102 --> 00:23:40,566
And then when we got to the actual cause of the next event

473
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,608
when she sieged the city.

474
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:45,159
The system looked and said, hey, the sultan

475
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:46,420
has a relationship with cats.

476
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,384
Maybe they sieged the city in order to liberate cats.

477
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:53,348
We also, you see here that the name of the hammer

478
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,251
she was wielding is Frosikith's Cat's Friend.

479
00:23:56,251 --> 00:24:00,396
The reason we pick Cat's Friend as the suffix of that name

480
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:01,618
is because, again, this is an event

481
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:02,879
where cats were liberated.

482
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:09,413
I also want to point out, you might have noticed all this ice imagery, right?

483
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:13,758
She founds this dig site for the purpose of excavating ancient blocks of ice.

484
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:15,680
They name it the freezing dig site.

485
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,523
She's wielding a frosty hammer.

486
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,405
The hammer's called Frosticus, Kat's friend.

487
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:25,147
The reason there's all this ice imagery is that all of this text is generated as a result of this

488
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:30,890
sultan having the domain of ice. So when this domain was initialized, or when the sultan was

489
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:36,392
initialized, she was given a random domain, it happened to be ice, and so ice sort of permeates

490
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:41,854
the events of her life. So these, the sultan's state...

491
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:44,539
like her affiliation with a faction, in this case, Cats,

492
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,281
her domain, is acting as this sort of narrative glue

493
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:51,021
that's holding these disparate events together.

494
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:54,483
And the fact that the events, the resolution,

495
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:56,923
and the text generation is parameterized

496
00:24:56,923 --> 00:24:59,965
by the Sultan's state, it really promotes

497
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,065
these player-interpreted causalities.

498
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:07,609
Right, so we're bringing a lot of narrative context to our reading of those Gospels,

499
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:14,856
but it sort of makes sense, you know, if we get the idea that if this sultan made some sort of

500
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:18,480
deal with cats, if they helped her found a dig site, it makes sense that she might have fought

501
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,441
to liberate them.

502
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:24,303
And then domains in particular, they act as these sort of recurring narrative threads

503
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:25,164
in a sultan life.

504
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:29,269
So they really, they kind of just tie the sultan's life together, give them this nice

505
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:33,113
association with this kind of resonant phenomenon, in this case ice.

506
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:40,901
Okay, so some quick resources I want to tell you about for designing your own generative

507
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:41,722
history system.

508
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:42,583
So if you're...

509
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:47,312
interested in the details of our system, we wrote a paper about it, it's on our website.

510
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:51,335
So this is, you know, and this slide deck's gonna be up on the vault or whatever, or um,

511
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:55,358
you can take a picture of this and search for it. But, yeah, Generation of Mythic Biographies

512
00:25:55,358 --> 00:26:00,001
and Caves of Qud, it's a, it's like a very detailed paper about our system. Epitaph,

513
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:03,984
the game I told you about by Max Kremitsky, the source code's available, I highly recommend

514
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:08,408
it, it's really readable, it's really succinct, and you can just get your eyes on a system

515
00:26:08,408 --> 00:26:12,611
that just very, like in a very succinct way has this...

516
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:17,807
coded relationship between events and these entities, it's good.

517
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:22,350
Microscope is this tabletop role-playing game where you're creating epic histories.

518
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,333
It's a good tool to think about the proceduralization of history.

519
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:31,217
This Anchor Party game, Opera Omnia, which is so fantastic,

520
00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:35,800
which takes this idea of the subjectivity of history

521
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,022
that I was talking about that's so often lacking in games

522
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:41,404
and makes it the whole conceit of the game.

523
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:43,726
And it's a really great game.

524
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,807
If you were here last year, you may have heard

525
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:48,730
Kate Compton's talk on practical procedural generation.

526
00:26:49,022 --> 00:26:51,863
She also, it's an amazing talk, she also wrote a blog post

527
00:26:51,863 --> 00:26:54,904
where she goes through, she sort of enumerates

528
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,304
a bunch of generative techniques and talks about them.

529
00:26:57,304 --> 00:27:00,745
One of them is grammars, so I highly recommend that.

530
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,966
And then Bruno Diaz is a developer

531
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,827
who made this game called Voyager,

532
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:06,587
this sort of space travel game

533
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:08,468
where he procedurally generates history

534
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:09,348
and uses grammars to do it.

535
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:10,929
Does a lot of the same stuff we do.

536
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,110
And he wrote a design article in Game of Sutra about it.

537
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,470
So I recommend that as well.

538
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,116
So, four takeaways if you're going to generate your own histories.

539
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:24,341
I would recommend that you think carefully about your narrative context.

540
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:27,866
So really think about how you're going to be using your histories.

541
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:29,428
Who is telling the histories?

542
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:30,630
What are their biases?

543
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,393
How can you encode that into your system?

544
00:27:33,647 --> 00:27:35,869
break your histories up into entities and events.

545
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:37,691
So you can like sit down with some index cards

546
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:39,813
and think, what are the, you know,

547
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:42,055
who are the actors that are acting in this system?

548
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:44,918
Who are the people that are, you know,

549
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:46,940
the people or the places that are actually

550
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,161
the elements of my history?

551
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:51,084
You can also think like, what are my event templates?

552
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:53,466
What type of history am I writing?

553
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:55,528
Your event templates are where a lot of like

554
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:57,250
the essence of your history is encoded.

555
00:27:58,392 --> 00:28:00,333
create a logic to relate your events.

556
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,734
So again, you could do something like what Epitaph does,

557
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:05,096
which is to say, hey, if an event happens,

558
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:09,698
we change the likelihood that future events happen.

559
00:28:09,698 --> 00:28:12,060
You could also say that an event only happens

560
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,621
if certain requirements are met.

561
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:16,242
So if certain preconditions about the state

562
00:28:16,242 --> 00:28:19,845
of the historical entities are met,

563
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:21,966
then an event has a chance to happen.

564
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,167
Or you could do something like what we did,

565
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,268
which is kind of cheat and say,

566
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:27,569
we actually don't have a logic to our.

567
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,875
to our event selection, but we're going to rationalize it anyway.

568
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,712
and then use replacement grammars to generate text.

569
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,255
They're wonderful tools for generating text.

570
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:39,976
In particular, they're really good for taking

571
00:28:39,976 --> 00:28:44,280
some sort of state machine or like a simulation

572
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,463
and describing it via text because you can use variables

573
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:50,746
that get replaced with the actual text

574
00:28:50,746 --> 00:28:53,468
when you're resolving that generation

575
00:28:53,468 --> 00:28:56,931
where the details actually become alive

576
00:28:56,931 --> 00:28:58,833
and get encoded into your text.

577
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:01,932
And that's it, I'm Jason Grumblatt,

578
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:04,135
this is, you can follow me on Twitter,

579
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:08,960
and thank you for coming to the talk.

580
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,305
So we probably have time for one question,

581
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:16,328
if someone has a question.

582
00:29:16,328 --> 00:29:16,649
If not, I do.

583
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:20,713
All right, I'm doing it.

584
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:24,570
Uh, so how did you balance the amount of state that you gave to the sultans?

585
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,794
Cause if you had too much, you know, different factions that they could be friends with,

586
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:31,317
then there wouldn't be that thread of, you know, they're, they're dealing with cats a lot.

587
00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:34,320
But if you don't have enough, then it doesn't seem like there's variety.

588
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,540
Yeah.

589
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:39,821
So the way we did that was that state is only really set

590
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:43,425
during historic events, aside from the initial state

591
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:46,127
that we set when the sultan's initialized.

592
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:47,529
So when we initialize the sultan,

593
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:49,391
we only set a few pieces of state.

594
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:51,733
We say, this is your name, this is where you were born,

595
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:52,954
this is your domain.

596
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:54,216
We only give them one domain.

597
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:58,077
And then as the events unfold, that state can be set.

598
00:29:58,077 --> 00:29:58,998
But because there's only 12 events,

599
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,899
there's only so many meaningful things

600
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:03,319
that happen in the Sultan's light.

601
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,820
So it's very rare that a Sultan becomes friendly

602
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,841
with more than one or two factions.

603
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:10,362
When it does happen, when you get one of the outlier Sultan

604
00:30:10,362 --> 00:30:12,383
lives, and they're friends with six factions,

605
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:15,684
and they have three husbands because they married robots

606
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,185
and baboons, all this can happen,

607
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:20,386
then it's a real interesting outlier,

608
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,307
and it's kind of nice and delightful.

609
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:30,307
Alright, I think that wraps it up. So please make sure that you fill out your evaluation emails to let Jason know what you thought.

610
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:31,869
And let's give him one final round of applause.
