1
00:00:11,406 --> 00:00:15,387
Yeah, welcome to Ghost in the Empathy Machine, exploring the player-character connection

2
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,468
in Life is Strange, True Colors.

3
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:22,670
I'm Jon Zimmerman, the narrative director at Deck Nine Games.

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,691
Thank you so much for coming to our talk.

5
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:28,392
Especially considering that Wyrtle is happening next door.

6
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:29,733
It's pretty cool.

7
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:31,393
I would be there right now.

8
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:38,452
I'm Zach Garris, formerly the Chief Creative Officer at Deck9 and Creative Director of

9
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:42,035
True Colors and currently the VP of Story at Telltale Games.

10
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:48,119
So to kick things off, we have 30 minutes, let's do a brief history of narrative.

11
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:53,163
Three thousand years ago, storytelling consisted of basically one thing.

12
00:00:54,372 --> 00:01:01,295
was people hanging out around a fire and a poet singing about stuff that happened that

13
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:11,639
was inspiring or compelling, like Achilles' Rage and the Homeric origin.

14
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:18,602
2,500 years ago, poets realized they could start pretending to be Achilles, and story

15
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:20,163
became something that was performed.

16
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:24,969
Yeah, there we go.

17
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,671
And the audience went from hearing someone tell them

18
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,953
about a narrative experience to watching a narrative experience

19
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:34,675
unfold and seeing the drama and the comedy on the faces

20
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:40,778
and the body language and the vocal tones of the actors.

21
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:42,419
500 years ago, we invented the printing press,

22
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,160
which led to the novel.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,282
And now audience members could experience the interior spaces of Achilles or any other

24
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:54,944
character and they could imagine what was going on inside the hearts and minds of the

25
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:55,385
characters.

26
00:01:55,405 --> 00:02:00,687
A little over a century ago, motion pictures.

27
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:09,150
Now we can physically put the audience on the battlefield next to Achilles or other

28
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,370
things.

29
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:14,555
Few decades ago, video games.

30
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:19,559
And now digital media is something that the audience can directly interact with,

31
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,183
leading us to games like Life is Strange.

32
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:29,789
So when we're looking at this arc of storytelling's history, we just want to

33
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:34,013
call out the movement of the arc is one toward interiority.

34
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:35,935
It's toward empathy.

35
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:42,279
The audience has gone from hearing someone talk about a story, to watching people perform a story,

36
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,025
to imagining the story from the inside, to physically seeing the inside,

37
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:51,170
to now, through agency, participating in the story themselves.

38
00:02:55,605 --> 00:03:00,887
Yeah, great. So as Zach just laid out, all of narrative history and really human history

39
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:07,049
has led us to video games. So let's talk about what makes video game narratives distinct.

40
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:13,051
It starts with the controller. Video game narratives are about control. We control a

41
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:19,993
character usually, and we call that the player character. The player character is given tools

42
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:24,975
where they are able to act upon the world. We sometimes call these verbs or interacts.

43
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,640
And the world is usually filled with non-playable characters,

44
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,081
or NPCs, for the player character

45
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,742
to interact with or against.

46
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:37,745
One of the most crucial decisions

47
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,027
we make as game writers is the question of prescription.

48
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:45,710
How prescribed versus how open is the player character

49
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,231
experience?

50
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:49,414
So let's look at a spectrum.

51
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:53,097
On one end, you have Player Avatar from Stardew Valley.

52
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:57,540
He or she can be molded out of 24 skin tones, 73 hairstyles,

53
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:01,063
hundreds of combinations of clothing, whatever name you

54
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,065
wish, and of course, dog or cat preference.

55
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,968
And on the other end of the spectrum, you have Kratos.

56
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,047
Kratos is not an avatar.

57
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,088
Kratos is Kratos.

58
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:13,568
You do not customize Kratos.

59
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:15,289
You do not make choices for Kratos.

60
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,211
Kratos' verbs are move, jump, and smash.

61
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,673
So getting a little more nuanced,

62
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:26,674
here is a character like Max Caulfield

63
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:28,194
from the original Life is Strange.

64
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:35,880
Max is obviously a character, she's not an avatar. But as a character, she is designed

65
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,826
to be open for how the player wishes to interact with the story. She begins the game shy and

66
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:48,431
passive. Her relationships are mostly blank slates, giving us a lot of agency to craft them.

67
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,732
And her core objectives align perfectly with the players.

68
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,614
She is seeking to understand the world

69
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:57,436
and the people around her as we are.

70
00:04:58,016 --> 00:04:59,898
She's confused about her power

71
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:02,280
and wants to learn more, just like us.

72
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,662
And she's undecided about many things,

73
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:08,024
including her romantic entanglements,

74
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:09,846
giving us a lot of space

75
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,447
to get to make those choices for her.

76
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,970
Now let's compare that to Chloe

77
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,852
in Life is Strange Before the Storm, the game we made.

78
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:24,899
Chloe is far more toward the Kratos end of the spectrum than Max is, and this makes sense

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,222
because Chloe began her life as an NPC in the original game.

80
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:30,925
She wasn't created with player control in mind.

81
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:38,952
Instead, Chloe is really bold and really aggressive and often angry about one thing or another.

82
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,794
Not as angry as Kratos, but still angry.

83
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:47,897
She's opinionated about the people in her life and her backstory, the trauma she

84
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:51,718
suffered from her father's death is critical to who she is.

85
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:54,219
She's decidedly not a blank slate.

86
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,781
So despite sharing a franchise, the experiences of being Max and Chloe are

87
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,822
by necessity very different.

88
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:06,803
And this was something that we only really came to appreciate as we

89
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:07,984
were making Before the Storm.

90
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:10,725
At a certain point in the scripting process.

91
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:16,529
we really faced a choice of whether to soften Chloe's personality and try to turn her into more

92
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:23,114
of an open player character, or retain all of her personality, those wonderful rough edges,

93
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:27,237
and try to find other avenues for bringing the player into the story.

94
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:31,280
And you can see which one we chose.

95
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:40,240
So it turned out in the end that having a prescribed player character actually wasn't a hindrance.

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,502
It was a massive gift.

97
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:48,128
Because if we could get the player into the headspace of this very singular character,

98
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:52,513
we will have achieved, here it comes, empathy.

99
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,536
So how did we do this?

100
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:57,978
Let's talk about the building blocks.

101
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:06,469
Not having a power, like Max's rewind ability in the first game, our tools were very, very basic.

102
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:12,150
We would explore, interact, express ourselves, and make decisions.

103
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:19,872
So, explore, that's simply pathing around the spaces that Chloe lives in, the spaces that are important to her,

104
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:24,653
interacting with the objects that reflect her personality,

105
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:28,774
and being rewarded with her thoughts, and sometimes opportunities for action.

106
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:33,305
Expressing herself through dialogue,

107
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:35,187
through dialogue choices,

108
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:37,068
and through opportunities for play.

109
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,753
And then making decisions, sometimes big decisions,

110
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:44,715
about her personality, about her morality,

111
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,036
about the people she cares about.

112
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:50,300
Everything the player did in Before the Storm

113
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,741
was filtered through Chloe.

114
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,988
It's why the most important relationship in the game,

115
00:07:56,148 --> 00:07:58,350
we realized, wasn't between Chloe and Rachel

116
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,910
or anyone else in the story.

117
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,571
It was between the player and Chloe.

118
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:04,032
That was the relationship we came to care about the most.

119
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,174
With every interaction that we built,

120
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,935
we strove to build out Chloe's interiority.

121
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,396
That's the thing that we focused on.

122
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:13,557
And hopefully as we did that,

123
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:16,618
we were bringing the character along with her

124
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:19,640
into her headspace, cementing that empathic link

125
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,380
we were trying to build.

126
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:26,756
It's one thing to do that when it comes to elements of the story, like rebelling

127
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:31,759
against your mother's dickish boyfriend or falling for Rachel Amber, hopefully

128
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:34,741
most players are going to be ready to go along for that ride.

129
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:39,384
Uh, but it's more challenging when it comes to a deeper and

130
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,325
more complex emotion like grief.

131
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:49,911
So that's the, the, the foundational, uh, mechanical link between the player.

132
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:52,715
and the player character in Narrative Adventure,

133
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:55,195
but we want to focus on something we discovered

134
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,916
in Before the Storm, something that ultimately led

135
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:59,576
to why we made True Colors at all.

136
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:02,016
And that's a scene we call Junkyard Smash.

137
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:05,357
So this is the end of the first episode.

138
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:08,138
It's building suspense.

139
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:10,898
Chloe just spent the day

140
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:12,519
with the most popular girl in school.

141
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:14,919
Chloe is 16, her father recently died.

142
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,380
She is filled with anger, she is alienated, she's hurt,

143
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,260
and she just had this magical experience

144
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,780
for someone.

145
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:23,285
opposite to her in every way, took an interest in her life.

146
00:09:24,706 --> 00:09:29,590
And then they arrive at this junkyard, and inexplicably that person turns on her, hurts

147
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:30,691
her and abandons her.

148
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:36,136
And we enter the free-roam space where the player now is on the sticks and has control,

149
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:40,821
with the goal stated to them, fuck this place.

150
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:47,898
We replace traditional verbs that allow for choice in terms of how you want to interact with the world

151
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:52,441
with the loud interior voice of Chloe's need to smash things.

152
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:54,622
And she really does.

153
00:09:56,704 --> 00:10:01,307
In fact, she begins to project the people in her life that have hurt her the most

154
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:05,250
on the junk that she finds, and she smashes all of it.

155
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,116
A mannequin for Rachel.

156
00:10:07,136 --> 00:10:09,239
A camera for Max.

157
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:12,883
It's hard to see, but that's a toolbox for David.

158
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:17,088
And then something magical happens.

159
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:26,572
Up to this point, the relationship between the player and Chloe is one of spectator and angry girl.

160
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:30,273
Very few players are feeling the rage she's feeling.

161
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:38,898
In fact, the playfulness of the verbs themselves frame a kind of entertainment from watching her be angry.

162
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,200
And then she finds her father's car.

163
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:46,916
And we just found this working on the story,

164
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:49,118
trying to come up with what would be

165
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:52,019
the most compelling narrative movement to the scene.

166
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,122
And that relationship between the player and Chloe

167
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:03,985
in this moment shifts from spectator and subject

168
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:05,866
to a real alignment.

169
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,787
If people cried in Before the Storm,

170
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,188
they almost certainly cried in this scene.

171
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:13,480
We take minutes with it.

172
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,122
We frame it cinematically with the score.

173
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:21,966
We show Chloe taking in the car and reeling from it and players

174
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:23,767
slide right into that spot.

175
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:29,572
And then we gave them another smash and we ask you to pull the trigger.

176
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:32,994
And it destroys Chloe.

177
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:39,943
And when we discovered this, it really surprised us.

178
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:42,183
And we realized that there's a power

179
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:45,404
to interactive storytelling in terms of its ability

180
00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:49,186
to engender empathy that we didn't really understand.

181
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:55,127
Most of the fan letters we get are from people

182
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,869
who demographically don't have a lot in common with Chloe.

183
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:02,030
Some of my favorites are from people

184
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,710
who are 50 years old or older.

185
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:11,345
men who say their relationship with their father was improved or something they had closure from

186
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:16,790
because of experiencing Chloe's journey. That humbled us and blew us away and so

187
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:22,195
ultimately led us to wanting to make a game about empathy.

188
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,401
Yeah, so we were

189
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,503
fascinated by those letters we received, the reactions we received, by this extension of

190
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:40,546
empathy to all different kinds of people into, as we laid out, this really singular character

191
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:44,649
of Chloe, right? Not being an avatar, not being someone that you craft,

192
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:47,170
but someone that you role-play and you inhabit.

193
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:53,373
So when it came time to concept the next game, Life is Strange, True Colors, we

194
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:57,314
started with a set of questions and interests that we carried over from

195
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:01,935
before the storm, like what would it be like to experience that kind of empathic

196
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:04,536
connection in the real world, outside of games?

197
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:07,036
How would it shape you as a person?

198
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:11,478
And what would a power based on empathy allow us to do as storytellers?

199
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:17,439
So fast forwarding over many, many months of iteration, here's what we landed on.

200
00:13:19,477 --> 00:13:21,759
As before, we start with a player character.

201
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,141
This time she's named Alex,

202
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:27,464
and the player is going to control her the entire game

203
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:28,685
to interact with the world.

204
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:32,809
We get to explore as her, hear her thoughts, make choices,

205
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:35,111
but now we wanted to extend

206
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,473
that player character experience outward.

207
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:40,435
So we came up with this empathy power for Alex

208
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:41,876
that functioned like a prism,

209
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:46,120
projecting us through her into the interior spaces

210
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,981
of the NPCs in the world around her.

211
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:57,108
It starts with auras, showing us that an NPC is feeling an emotion,

212
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,971
and when we use our empathy power, we're rewarded with the NPC's thoughts

213
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:03,593
in their voice about the emotion that they're feeling.

214
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:06,756
And we actually discovered something really interesting

215
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:08,677
while we were writing these NPC insights.

216
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:11,340
Players enjoyed hearing them,

217
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,322
but with all the different voices coming into their head,

218
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:18,345
they would begin to feel lost and disconnected from Alex.

219
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:22,360
And we solved this in a really simple, but we think really interesting way,

220
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,803
which was capping every NPC insight with a short follow-up thought from Alex.

221
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:34,066
Sometimes it was just a couple words, but it would reflect or react in some way

222
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,387
to whatever emotion she just connected with.

223
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:40,949
And it was a really small shift, but it had the effect of realigning the player to Alex.

224
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:45,412
It brought them back into her as the player character after they'd taken that journey

225
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:48,053
into a different consciousness together.

226
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:52,855
They were side-by-side again, experiencing that emotion together rather than separately.

227
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,256
So let's look at how that relationship functioned in one of the bigger power moments, which we call NOVAs.

228
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:03,621
In this scene, Alex has asked Eleanor for help finding Mac.

229
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:08,447
And at one point, Eleanor seems to become confused, disoriented,

230
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:12,252
and she starts eliciting a surprisingly strong emotion of fear.

231
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,757
So we use our empathy power to connect with that fear.

232
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:19,779
And when we do, her aura suddenly explodes outward.

233
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,661
It literally colors the world around her.

234
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:24,263
And here's what that looks like when that happens.

235
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:31,550
She looks terrified.

236
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,752
I can't leave her like this.

237
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,280
Holy shit.

238
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:02,722
So the only part we missed at the end there was seeing that fear aura completely project

239
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:05,003
outward, seeing it surround the space.

240
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:08,745
And then we go back into a free room and we're exploring the space again, right?

241
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:14,688
So that's what gives us the entree into exploring Eleanor's emotion.

242
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:20,331
We're now going to path around and Alex and the player are going to be side by side exploring

243
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:21,351
Eleanor's fear together.

244
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:23,753
So we're going to interact with objects.

245
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:27,807
that are connected to it, we're gonna hear insights,

246
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:32,051
and ultimately, we're gonna be inside Eleanor's thoughts

247
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:35,214
and we're gonna fill out an understanding of that fear,

248
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:36,495
of that emotion of hers.

249
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:40,819
Now, once we've explored Eleanor's emotion,

250
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,961
we come away understanding the cause of it,

251
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,923
that she's suffering from dementia

252
00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:47,365
and she feels her grasp on reality slipping away.

253
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:53,646
And hopefully what we were really going for, the crux of all of the sound design,

254
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,909
the cinematics that you saw, was to try and engender some of that feeling that we

255
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:03,474
captured with Chloe in the junkyard of not just being the spectator, but

256
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:05,916
participating in the emotional experience.

257
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:09,018
Except now it's not just our player characters, right?

258
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:09,939
It's Eleanor's.

259
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,964
We are through Alex sharing in a different character's emotional experience.

260
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:17,645
We're projecting our empathy outward.

261
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:24,755
So now that we've been armed with this connection and this empathy for what Eleanor is going through,

262
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:29,619
we're set up to make a difficult choice on Eleanor's behalf. Alex realizes that Eleanor

263
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:35,543
has forgotten her brother's death and is unaware of his funeral that evening.

264
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:40,347
Do we remind her, even having felt how much pain that's going to cause her?

265
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,245
So all the fundamental tools from before the storm were all there in that experience.

266
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:48,586
They're just projected outward.

267
00:17:48,706 --> 00:17:50,849
We explore another's world.

268
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:53,391
We interact with the objects important to them.

269
00:17:53,832 --> 00:17:59,258
We express through another's voice and we make moral decisions that impact them.

270
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,332
We really loved using this power to explore

271
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:06,753
the empathic connections that games can build.

272
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,295
We loved getting to create power moments

273
00:18:09,475 --> 00:18:11,957
like the Eleanor power moment and explore something

274
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:14,679
that we would never get to do if we were tied

275
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,960
to just one player character experience.

276
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:23,427
And when we brought empathy from the meta in Before the Storm to the plot in True Colors,

277
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:28,049
we came to understand it far better and explore it far deeper than we did before.

278
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:32,712
The more we explored it and the more we read, we discovered something else about empathy

279
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:34,213
that really surprised us.

280
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:37,915
Empathy is complicated.

281
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:40,616
Who knew that?

282
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:44,378
Also, just side note, thanks for bearing with us with the tech.

283
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:45,359
I know it keeps cutting out.

284
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:50,662
It's GameDevs. I think we're 99% of the time we spend with tech is broken.

285
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:52,783
So maybe it feels familiar.

286
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:54,703
Did you plan it that way?

287
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:56,784
It's not, it's not intentional.

288
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,224
Okay. Yeah, empathy is complicated.

289
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:00,224
We read a lot.

290
00:19:01,304 --> 00:19:04,445
Organizational psychology, behavioral psychology, social science,

291
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,365
spiritualists, gurus.

292
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,726
Empathy is a bit of a buzzword lately too.

293
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:11,226
It's a positive. It's a net good.

294
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:11,827
It's a virtue.

295
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:16,857
I think often when people talk about the positive elements of empathy, what they're really talking

296
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:18,338
about is compassion.

297
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:23,762
Empathy is when someone else's emotional state overrides yours.

298
00:19:26,104 --> 00:19:33,589
When your best friend is mad at you and they say something dumb or a place of anger, what's

299
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,709
the best way to react to that?

300
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,832
It's probably not to immediately be as angry as they are.

301
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:42,535
It's equally wrong not to pay attention to what's making them angry.

302
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,620
But that's the complication.

303
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,222
That's the thing that really became interesting to us.

304
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:51,823
So as often happens with story development,

305
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:55,064
the thematic and conceptual exploration

306
00:19:56,085 --> 00:19:58,526
ultimately came full circle and influenced the plot.

307
00:19:58,726 --> 00:20:00,207
And the entirety of the fifth episode

308
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:01,387
of True Colors is about this.

309
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:06,289
So when we end four, Alex gets shot in the head

310
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:07,370
and thrown down a mine.

311
00:20:10,057 --> 00:20:15,800
She wakes up and she has to, in a very surreal series of exchanges,

312
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:18,142
perform the empathy power on herself,

313
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:24,466
and go through constellation points in her life that have wounded her the most,

314
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:27,808
and that have coded her to be the person she is.

315
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:31,890
Sadness over her mother's death.

316
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,793
It's the first time we're going to see Alex shooting a Nova out of her own.

317
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:42,467
the terror when their father abandoned her brother and her.

318
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,451
One of the harder moments in the game,

319
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:51,035
Alex has to sit in a version of the orphanage

320
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,897
she grew up in and watch as

321
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,862
potentially adopting parents would approach

322
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,645
and she would feel all the reasons they didn't pick her.

323
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:05,888
And she's sensitive.

324
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,576
I'm sure she's a sweet girl, she hears, but she's not for us.

325
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:14,119
It's the kid who's been in all those fights, right?

326
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:20,042
There's just something off, wrong with her.

327
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:24,645
And we watch Alex explode in anger.

328
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:27,507
I think it's my favorite shot in the game.

329
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:28,287
It's really cool.

330
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:30,849
Why do we do that?

331
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:36,792
It's because she needs to face the lies she's told herself

332
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:38,473
because of the wounds she suffered.

333
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,735
She needs to actually practice a kind of self-empathy.

334
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:46,699
And from that place, she finds peace.

335
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,982
She finds what we discovered in research

336
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:52,984
is known as emotional self-integrity.

337
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:55,986
She's contended with her demons,

338
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,769
which puts her in a place where she's actually ready

339
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,150
to deal with other people's.

340
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,122
And that's what the game became about.

341
00:22:05,962 --> 00:22:07,944
It's not to say empathy is bad, empathy is wonderful.

342
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:09,304
It's an extraordinary thing.

343
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,066
But like most powerful things,

344
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:15,068
there is risk associated with it.

345
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,372
So what does this mean for narrative adventure

346
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,293
or empathy in storytelling?

347
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:27,396
MLK says the arc of the universe bends toward justice.

348
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:36,731
I think the narrative arc of story over the last few thousand years bends toward empathy

349
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:37,652
in a certain way.

350
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:40,394
We're striving to get closer to each other.

351
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:44,037
Why do we love stories so much anyway?

352
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,339
What is it that they provide?

353
00:22:49,341 --> 00:22:50,322
I think they build maps.

354
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:52,003
It's not my idea, but...

355
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
A lot of writers think this.

356
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,140
They're maps.

357
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,621
They show us the way to go.

358
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:58,622
They show us how to find peace in our lives.

359
00:22:58,922 --> 00:23:00,963
That's how a 50-year-old man can play Chloe

360
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:03,224
and come away from that experience

361
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:05,945
enriched in his relationship with his dad.

362
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:11,427
So John, as he often does and has done for years,

363
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:12,587
challenged me last night.

364
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:14,548
He said the best talks he's seen at GDC

365
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:17,769
conclude with some kind of call to action.

366
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,931
And he asked like, what's our call to action?

367
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:21,471
We didn't have one.

368
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:24,765
We were just making a presentation about empathy

369
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:26,646
and I thought a lot about it.

370
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:29,747
And I don't think it was until right before this talk

371
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:32,329
that I realized what I wanted to kind of end on.

372
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:40,152
And I, pardon me for how dark this may sound,

373
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:42,473
especially when the Wordle presentation

374
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:43,254
is applauding right now.

375
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:47,816
Something I think a lot about as an entertainer

376
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:50,917
and as a game designer is the state of our kids.

377
00:23:53,101 --> 00:23:54,962
I think our kids are in a certain kind of crisis.

378
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:59,323
More than any other generation in history,

379
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:01,084
they are involved with tech.

380
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:04,486
They deal with interactive media every day

381
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:08,707
and more hours a day than we did when we were young.

382
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:15,890
And anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation,

383
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,212
and loneliness, loneliness are at all time highs.

384
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:28,806
And I'm not a doctor, few game devs are, and I don't know the answer to this, but

385
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:36,549
surely a part of it has to be that the places we build as devs, it's what we do.

386
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:37,049
We're builders.

387
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,291
The digital places we build are places that strengthen.

388
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:46,622
There are places that teach emotional self-integrity.

389
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:51,427
And from there, how to love across difference

390
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:53,208
and how to build meaningful relationships

391
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:56,611
and how to practice empathy in a healthy way.

392
00:24:58,073 --> 00:24:59,614
That's my hope for what we can do.

393
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:01,456
I think that's my call to action.

394
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:02,877
Thank you.

395
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:04,959
Thanks, everyone.

396
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:19,905
We have lots of time for questions, so please come ask them.

397
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:22,526
We have microphones on both sides.

398
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:29,489
Oh, there we go. Okay.

399
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,510
Hi, my name's Eric, and I was late, but great talk.

400
00:25:34,591 --> 00:25:38,513
Um, it's not exactly a question, it's more of an endorsement actually.

401
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:41,274
Um, I think you guys are doing great work. I think...

402
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,696
I haven't played this game, but I really want to.

403
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:48,077
And as game developers, we don't have time to play games.

404
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,078
And we just spoiled the ending for you.

405
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,259
No, I know, right? I'm just like, holy shit.

406
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,300
But, um, is everyone here, uh...

407
00:25:55,744 --> 00:26:01,069
I have a solution and I'm going to implement it one day and anyone wants to come along

408
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:01,469
the journey.

409
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,593
I actually volunteer on a suicide and crisis hotline and I've been doing that for about

410
00:26:05,653 --> 00:26:06,093
two years.

411
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:14,300
I've got about 500 hours and if the stars align and if everything works out, I would

412
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:22,147
like to make some sort of roleplaying suicide and hotline game to encourage everyone to

413
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,414
have empathy for our fellow human beings and our struggles.

414
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:30,498
And if anyone's interested in that,

415
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:32,960
they can contact me later.

416
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,481
What's your name?

417
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,184
My name's Eric Chow from Honor Games.

418
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:36,985
Thank you.

419
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:38,326
Yeah, thanks for sharing.

420
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,130
Any other questions?

421
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,091
We probably have time for one.

422
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:51,220
Great talk. I'm curious, like you depict kind of like the inside of the head of very different characters.

423
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:57,285
And what was your process to depict them authentically and the state of mind that they're going through?

424
00:26:57,305 --> 00:27:07,292
Yeah, I can start on that. We spent a lot of time, a lot of time, a lot of thought, a lot of reading, a lot of talking.

425
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,455
We have a writer's room. There's a talk.

426
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:13,857
a few days ago about the importance of writers room.

427
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:16,119
Maybe some of you were in that, yeah.

428
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,560
Yeah, our experience validates that.

429
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:25,504
You need a team of a diverse set of experiences

430
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:27,745
and perspectives to come together

431
00:27:28,185 --> 00:27:33,848
and consider something as nuanced and important

432
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:38,251
as the topics that we hope to deal with.

433
00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:47,467
So I always think about exploding the idea of write what you know and changing it to

434
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:48,507
know what you write, you know?

435
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:58,774
As a writer you have to feel a sense of not that you are ever a master with these topics

436
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,455
because how can you be?

437
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:05,618
But just that you know that you have immersed yourself to a point where.

438
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,690
where you feel comfortable being able to be in that world.

439
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,653
And if you don't, then you have a writer's room

440
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:14,417
to help you and share that burden.

441
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:16,721
Thank you.

442
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:17,703
Yeah, thank you.

443
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:19,285
Yeah, please.

444
00:28:20,305 --> 00:28:27,490
So you gave the example of the junkyard scene where what the player's doing and what the

445
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:31,473
player's feeling doesn't really match what the character's feeling and that was kind of

446
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:36,657
intentional because you brought it together later on. I'm wondering if there were any moments

447
00:28:37,778 --> 00:28:42,181
you have in mind where the player was unintentionally not feeling

448
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:47,485
in line with what the character was feeling and what kinds of things you did to address that?

449
00:28:50,322 --> 00:28:50,983
Do you stand by that?

450
00:28:51,483 --> 00:28:53,724
I mean, the first time we introduced Alex's power

451
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:57,466
in True Colors, it's deliberately off-putting,

452
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:59,407
strange, shocking, kind of overwhelming.

453
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,387
She flips out in anger and beats a guy up

454
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:02,388
and kind of ruins her day.

455
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:06,370
We were doing that to put the, on two levels.

456
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,170
Like on one level, you know,

457
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,551
you're not angry and punching Mac.

458
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:10,411
You're not doing that.

459
00:29:10,511 --> 00:29:11,352
That's not what's happening.

460
00:29:12,512 --> 00:29:13,573
So you're like, what the fuck?

461
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:17,435
But then neither is Alex.

462
00:29:18,677 --> 00:29:21,218
Like, Alex is also like, what the hell?

463
00:29:21,338 --> 00:29:22,419
Like, what did I just do?

464
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,300
I don't have control either.

465
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,080
And I think we found a harmony there.

466
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,801
We were a little bit concerned at that.

467
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:29,062
And there were voices on the team

468
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:30,463
who thought that would be really off-putting.

469
00:29:30,963 --> 00:29:32,564
But then we just leaned in and we decided

470
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,005
that's actually a pretty interesting way

471
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:35,986
to engender a closer connection

472
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:37,987
between the player and Alex out of the gate.

473
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:39,367
Yeah, I think also...

474
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:44,220
You know, we have different language that we use to talk about this idea.

475
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,865
Like, we're always talking about where's the player and where's the player character, and

476
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:50,727
how close are they, and when are they separate.

477
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:54,471
And the answer isn't always that they have to be in lockstep with each other.

478
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:59,777
Sometimes, like I think the junkyard scene is actually an example of this, you can find

479
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:00,858
a greater...

480
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:08,846
harmony by beginning from a place of dissonance, because you can't expect the player to be right

481
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:14,831
there with your player character experiencing something difficult or unique right at the

482
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:21,998
beginning of the scene. But that's where we get to use our tools and create a sense of play to draw

483
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:25,782
the player into it. So I think, you know, there's almost a musicality to it, where you can think

484
00:30:25,822 --> 00:30:26,983
about like a dissonance.

485
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:34,048
and an assonance that builds over the course of a sequence where you hopefully land at

486
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:39,973
a place that comes together and finds that poignancy.

487
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:41,554
I think we have time for one more question.

488
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:47,539
And then I want to remind everyone I was asked to remind you to fill out your surveys about

489
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,239
the quality of the talk.

490
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,682
And then we're probably going to head down the hallway and hang out in the main atrium

491
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:54,624
area if anyone has follow-ups or questions or want to talk about anything.

492
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,145
Please feel free.

493
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:58,972
Hey, I'm Blake from Gorilla.

494
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:02,756
I just wanted to ask you guys, based on my experience

495
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:04,737
building sequences like this, and you guys

496
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:05,819
do it extremely well.

497
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:11,498
it's very hard to get across exactly the kind of thing you want to get across in the early part

498
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:15,861
of the process when asset fidelity is really low. You know, you don't have that music yet,

499
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:20,544
you don't have that final interaction, you don't have those animations. How do you guys build this

500
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:24,827
stuff? What does it look like in the early days to make it sell, to get across the idea that it's

501
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:31,411
like going to be there eventually? Yeah. Can I do this one quickly? Yeah. I think about, I use this

502
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:32,772
phrase in the talk deliberately, I...

503
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:36,368
I think about the grammar of constellation points.

504
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:39,449
What galvanizes the room in an early idea

505
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:42,991
will be one particular moment, one concept, one thought.

506
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:44,832
What if Chloe finds her dad's car?

507
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,253
And everyone's like, fool, fool, oh my goodness.

508
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:50,674
Okay, let's start building around that.

509
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:51,855
Let's build from that.

510
00:31:52,275 --> 00:31:54,136
If the constellation points are strong

511
00:31:54,896 --> 00:31:56,877
and you learn to know and trust your instincts,

512
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:58,278
oh, this is a good framework.

513
00:31:58,925 --> 00:32:01,767
then the music that comes afterward, both actual score,

514
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:03,769
but also the music of all the artistic elements,

515
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,172
the performance, the actual dialogue, all of it,

516
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,353
it'll be fantastic.

517
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,515
And conversely, if the constellation points

518
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:11,716
are not clear early on,

519
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:13,558
that's really a page one problem,

520
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:14,458
and you wanna look at that again.

521
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:15,369
It takes time.

522
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:20,492
I'll just add too, like, we're very lucky that we have a tool set that lets us script

523
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:22,093
the entirety of the scene.

524
00:32:22,313 --> 00:32:30,338
So like a screenplay for a movie, we can show the power of the scene on the page or if it's

525
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:30,878
not working.

526
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:31,859
It goes both ways.

527
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:35,201
And that is the ultimate proving ground, right?

528
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:39,023
And that's, we encourage in our studio everyone to read the scripts.

529
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:41,564
even when they're in their rougher states,

530
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:45,526
because we want to use that as kind of the ultimate litmus

531
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,667
of like, is this hitting people?

532
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:48,167
Is this galvanizing people?

533
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:49,328
Do the artists want to make this?

534
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:50,769
Do the animators want to animate this?

535
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,630
If not, then we know there's something wrong.

536
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:58,292
Okay, yeah, no, I just wanted to say, that's it.

537
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:58,832
We have to go.

538
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:00,173
Thank you very much.
