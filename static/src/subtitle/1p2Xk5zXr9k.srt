Hi everyone, my name is Emmy Jonasen and I'm the co-founder and CMO of Snowcannon Games,

2
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:10,910
an independent video game publisher.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,613
I'm also the creator of IndieGameGirl.com, a blog that offers marketing advice for independent

4
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:17,173
developers.

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:23,836
My GDC lecture is going to be about marketing, Steam, and Vikings, or what we're calling

6
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:25,137
Viking enthusiasts.

7
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:31,165
More specifically, though, my lecture is about how Steam has become, especially over the past five years,

8
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:35,247
one of the most competitive platforms that developers can publish to today,

9
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:41,249
and how because of this, it's becoming more and more important that developers expand their game's

10
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:46,450
audience outside of just traditional Steam gamers to increase their chances of success.

11
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:51,552
Using the example of The Frost Rune, which is our point-and-click Viking adventure

12
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:53,413
developed by our clients Grimnir,

13
00:00:53,875 --> 00:01:00,379
I'm going to illustrate how we tapped into a non-traditional Steam gamer audience of Viking enthusiasts

14
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,840
to generate results for our Steam campaign.

15
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,663
And while we think Viking enthusiasts are the best,

16
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:11,765
this lecture is not about us recommending that everybody market to this audience.

17
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:17,869
It's about detailing the scientific approach we took to identifying Viking enthusiasts

18
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:19,470
as a viable target market.

19
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:23,920
and the campaign that we crafted that generated results among them,

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,282
so that you can do the same with your game.

21
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:32,108
I'd also like to add that my lecture is not going to be a bunch of marketing fluff.

22
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:36,412
I'm going to show concrete examples of our campaign execution,

23
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:39,035
as well as real data from our campaign,

24
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:42,498
so that you can leave my lecture with actual advice

25
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:44,920
that can help you improve your own games marketing.

26
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:50,215
So if that sounds good, or maybe you just want to learn a thing or two about Vikings

27
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:56,738
and Viking enthusiasts, my lecture is going to be on Wednesday, March 1st from 11.30am

28
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:57,738
to 12pm.

29
00:01:58,498 --> 00:01:59,539
And I hope to see you there.

30
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:00,419
Thank you.

31
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:00,499
Bye.
