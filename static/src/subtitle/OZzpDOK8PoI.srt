00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:08,291
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,274
I'm Zach Johnson.

3
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:12,156
I'm the creative director of Asymmetric.

4
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:15,439
We made a game 15 years ago that some of you

5
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:16,901
might remember called Kingdom of Loathing.

6
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:22,106
It was a browser-based multiplayer role-playing game,

7
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:24,108
stick figure art, a lot of goofy jokes.

8
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:26,511
And a couple of years ago, a couple of years ago,

9
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:27,212
a few months ago,

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,811
Forgot how long it's been.

11
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:31,492
A couple of years ago, we started working

12
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:32,952
on a follow-up game, West of Loathing.

13
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:34,112
A few months ago, we released it.

14
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:35,573
It's a lot of the same team in common.

15
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:37,554
A few new people brought on to make this,

16
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:41,395
but yeah, that's who I am and what we're doing.

17
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:47,277
Because talking about comedy

18
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:51,038
is one of the least funny things I can imagine doing.

19
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:52,119
When they asked me to do this talk,

20
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,039
I kind of didn't want to,

21
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,300
and then the more I thought about it,

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,140
the more I didn't want to.

23
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:00,754
And then in February, I got lucky because Tim Schafer

24
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:03,864
accidentally wrote my entire talk for me in this tweet.

25
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,423
And that's pretty much the secret.

26
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:14,105
We decided when we started making this thing

27
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,627
that it was going to be a comedy game.

28
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,248
It wasn't gonna be an adventure game

29
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:20,010
or an RPG with comedy elements,

30
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,452
but it was going to straight up be a comedy game.

31
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:24,834
Instead of a game with jokes in it,

32
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:26,015
which happens all the time,

33
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:29,017
this was sort of a game made out of jokes.

34
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,755
we didn't like consciously arrive at a bunch of bullet point

35
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:37,336
lists of how we were doing this, right?

36
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:39,217
We, when it came time to write this talk,

37
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:41,039
we were just like, wait, how did we do it?

38
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,240
Like, what was our approach to this?

39
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,263
And we kind of started with the fundamental basis

40
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:50,045
of all of the writing that happens in the game

41
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:52,928
is this relationship between the narrator and the player.

42
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:55,670
Because it's a Western RPG.

43
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,074
in both senses.

44
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:02,037
The character, we wanted as much as possible

45
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:04,199
for the character to just be a kind of a cypher,

46
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:05,701
an avatar of the player.

47
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:07,442
We didn't wanna have,

48
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:09,244
they didn't have a real strong character,

49
00:02:09,284 --> 00:02:10,605
they didn't have strong opinions about things.

50
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,147
Like, we wanted to write them as the way

51
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,569
that you wanna write, or the way that we wanted to write it,

52
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:18,212
which was sort of neutral and friendly,

53
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,733
and like, you can make some assumptions about them,

54
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:22,175
like they wanna be here, you know, they like their parents.

55
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:25,158
they don't like being annoyed or beaten up or whatever.

56
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:27,920
But for the most part, just let the player

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,961
kind of inhabit that character.

58
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:33,685
But the narrator, and so this is nothing super novel.

59
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:35,907
I think if you looked up narrator in the dictionary,

60
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:37,448
it would probably just say this,

61
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:40,411
but the narrator is me and Riff, the other writer,

62
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:41,772
sort of talking to the player.

63
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,333
But what's cool about that is that it allows us

64
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:48,715
to just kind of treat the narrator as a character.

65
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,176
And because we've been doing this for so long,

66
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,558
it's a character that we've been developing for 15 years.

67
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,064
And having the entirety of the sort of non-spoken text

68
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,567
in the game be a dialogue between us and the player

69
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:05,728
in the form of the player character

70
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:07,329
has a lot of advantages in.

71
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:11,073
in terms of being able to just cram jokes

72
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,434
into literally everywhere.

73
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:15,075
Like, every piece of text you see in the game,

74
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:17,717
whether it's in the options menu, item description,

75
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:20,538
exposition about what happens when you open a door,

76
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:23,119
or whatever, it's all this character that you get used to.

77
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,921
And so, literally every piece of text

78
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:29,322
becomes the opportunity for us to at least try to be funny.

79
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:32,564
It's a real quantity over quality kind of approach.

80
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:36,766
But it works because it, you know, if you have a game with four jokes in it and one

81
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:40,067
of them is bad, your game is only 75% funny.

82
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:44,929
If you have a game with a thousand jokes in it and 250 of them are bad, then your game

83
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,710
is 75% funny.

84
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:54,954
The narrator as a sort of like honest character, an honest reflection of who we are as writers.

85
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:58,665
also lets us be a little self-deprecating about stuff,

86
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,847
which is a fantastic way to cover up

87
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:02,929
fundamental flaws with your game,

88
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,091
act like they're on purpose and like they were,

89
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:07,373
we meant to do that because isn't that funny?

90
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:09,495
You don't wanna overdo it, but.

91
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:12,834
Honestly, because of the way the game looks,

92
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:14,795
people come in with a set of expectations

93
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,476
that is not, this is gonna be this amazing,

94
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:19,377
sweeping, epic thing, right?

95
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:22,198
And so it's okay to be a little goofy about it

96
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:23,419
because it is a little goofy.

97
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,100
Like, it's not about being the biggest video game

98
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,620
that it can be.

99
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,661
It's about sitting around with us,

100
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:29,641
having a fun conversation.

101
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:33,503
Having the narrator talk to the character

102
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:36,864
as its own character lets you also,

103
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:39,320
you don't want to tell the character,

104
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,465
you don't want to tell the player character how they feel,

105
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:42,728
right, but what you can do is say,

106
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,252
wow, that was pretty scary, huh?

107
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,488
that the saying you know what if that happened to me I would be pretty angry

108
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:51,950
right now how do you know how you feel about that and it lets you it lets you

109
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,212
convey emotion and opinions about stuff without undermining the players ability

110
00:04:56,252 --> 00:05:00,394
to inhabit the player character and the other the nice thing about that is when

111
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,976
it's so silly it also doesn't have to be consistent like if the narrator likes

112
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:07,418
catch up if when it's funny for the narrator like catch up they can not like

113
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,179
catch up later if it's funnier for them to not like catch up depending on what

114
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:12,420
you're trying to do with catch up.

115
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:18,785
Typically, in interactions between the player

116
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:21,626
and the narrator, we have the player

117
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:23,907
as kind of the straight man, and the narrator just

118
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,948
sort of messes with you, and you push back against it,

119
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:27,529
and that's where a lot of the humor of that interaction

120
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:27,869
comes from.

121
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:30,030
Every once in a while, and I think I do this a little bit

122
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,491
more than Riff does, I like to give the player the opportunity

123
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,832
to be the sort of annoying kid brother that just kind of

124
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:36,393
repeats everything that the narrator says

125
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,953
until the narrator gets really aggravated,

126
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:38,834
and you move on from there.

127
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:45,959
But for the most part, when the entire game takes place in this kind of jokey, buddy cop

128
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,643
sort of conversation between the narrator and the character, just the default means

129
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:54,426
of exposition for what's happening in the game becomes an opportunity for comedy.

130
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:59,510
And also sometimes, so there's a moment in the prologue of the game where we introduce

131
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,710
the

132
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,655
sort of minor equivalent of a morality system we have where there's this guy

133
00:06:03,715 --> 00:06:06,738
sleeping outside of a outside of a cave that you're supposed to arrest some dudes

134
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:11,964
in and you can decide whether you want to just kill him while he's sleeping and

135
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,589
the narrator kind of pushes back against that because we don't want it to be easy

136
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,913
for the player to get into this sort of like well I'm a cold-blooded killer

137
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:19,093
because

138
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,973
We didn't really want to write a lot of stuff

139
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,874
to support the player as a cold-blooded killer,

140
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:23,994
because that's less funny.

141
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:26,295
So you get a lot of opportunities

142
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:28,235
to be talked out of murdering this kid.

143
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:31,336
And the thing that I noticed, which was weird,

144
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:33,617
is that when we were demoing this at PAX and stuff,

145
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:35,917
every time somebody went through that,

146
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:40,198
they did it with this huge grin on their face the entire time.

147
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,679
And I'm just sitting there at first thinking, no, I don't.

148
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,100
I thought we were going to remove this from the game because this is not funny.

149
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,662
This is like trying to warn you that the stuff that you are doing is not on tone with what

150
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:52,722
we want you to do, but people just loved it.

151
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:56,043
And so I think as a result of that, we ended up doing a lot more kind of stuff where the

152
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:59,805
narrator argues with the player and just sort of tries to get in the way of stuff.

153
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:06,487
It's hard to tell when to stop doing that because it's gotten annoying, but we're usually

154
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,947
not there when people are playing, so we don't really care.

155
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:15,006
It also allows you to break the fourth wall without it being super obnoxious.

156
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:21,269
Like, we try to do it sparingly because it's, you know, you just don't want to get too...

157
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:24,910
We don't want the player to constantly be acknowledging that they're in a video game.

158
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,792
We don't really want the narrator to constantly be acknowledging that it's a video game, but

159
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:30,172
sometimes it helps.

160
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,693
There's the kind of in-fiction way where...

161
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:39,156
So there's a series of spittoons in the game that are really gross to get into, and...

162
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:43,398
I remember I wrote that I set the first one in there and I and I told ref okay

163
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,519
right this there's going to be 6 or 7 of these and they should get grosser and

164
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:52,321
grosser as the game goes on and he wrote the first one so gross that I had no

165
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:55,363
idea how he was going to move on from there but what he did was a thing that

166
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:57,844
turned out to be one of the things that people like the most about this which

167
00:07:57,884 --> 00:08:02,486
was that it turns into this weird series of kind of arguments between the player

168
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:04,186
and the narrator where the narrator

169
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,048
gradually just starts acknowledging,

170
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:09,029
like, look, I don't want to save this.

171
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,669
Like, I don't want you to do this.

172
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,450
I don't want to have to describe this stuff to you.

173
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,192
And it's cool just because by the time you get there,

174
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,233
you've gotten used to the voice of the narrator,

175
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:19,613
and so the fourth wall breaking becomes,

176
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,934
you know, just like a little bit of a surprise.

177
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,635
The thing that I like about it,

178
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,336
and this is not funny at all,

179
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,677
but it also lets you do things like

180
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:31,498
there's a hat that you can find that's kind of hidden in the prologue that

181
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:35,381
unlocks a really hard combat mode and you can't get away from it and the

182
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:40,886
narrator can just tell you that and the thing that I sort of feel like was the

183
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:45,190
the best use of this was at the end once you've finished the main storyline of

184
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,713
the game and you can click the thing to like get the ending cutscene it just

185
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:49,093
tells you

186
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,396
this is not going to change anything about your character or the state of the

187
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:55,078
world. You can just watch this cutscene and then you can leave and do something

188
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,420
else and come back and do it again. Like you don't you don't need to save.

189
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:03,586
You can't save. But I wish games sort of had the confidence to let you know

190
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:06,328
stuff like that because there's nothing more annoying to me than getting

191
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,633
40 hours into some RPG and then not knowing that I'm about to do something

192
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:14,476
that means I should have saved or I have to revert to an hour ago.

193
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:20,885
Biggest advantage is that when everything that we write in the game has this voice that

194
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:24,072
is trying to be funny, writing it is not a chore, because it's great.

195
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:26,116
We just get to write jokes all day, and what could be better than that?

196
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:31,753
Obviously it's work. I mean, you make games, you know that even the fun parts of it are work.

197
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:38,295
But it is nice that essentially everything that we do becomes, at worst,

198
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:42,856
a puzzle that we have to solve to figure out a way to make some boring thing funny.

199
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:46,317
How do we make the graphics quality options funny?

200
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:48,958
And then that was another thing. It was like a few minutes of work and then people loved it.

201
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:53,443
It also, the fact that we had to do it this way

202
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:55,485
sort of talked us out of the idea of having

203
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:58,907
some kind of codex that you would unlock

204
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,269
encyclopedia entries about stuff.

205
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:02,650
We were sort of worried moving from

206
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,291
Kingdom of Loathing to West of Loathing,

207
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:06,313
well this game has animation and the combat

208
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:07,594
is like stuff's moving around.

209
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,875
We're not gonna have enough opportunities to write stuff.

210
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,057
We should add some structures that let us

211
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:13,758
just put a bunch of text in front of people.

212
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,880
And I'm really glad that we didn't do that.

213
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,201
Instead, we found other little cracks to put it in.

214
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,682
And I don't think anybody's going

215
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,283
to criticize West of Loathing for not

216
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:22,284
having enough writing in it.

217
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,105
So that's it.

218
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:26,586
So this is going to be longer because there's

219
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,827
a lot of stuff we don't do.

220
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:36,275
the game is made out of comedy,

221
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,438
the reward for the player for doing everything

222
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:42,400
is more or less just gonna be more jokes.

223
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,661
Like you walk into a room,

224
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,302
you see that it has five objects in it,

225
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,024
you know that you can probably click them

226
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:49,286
to at least get an attempt at something funny.

227
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,047
Maybe just a pun, whatever.

228
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,004
We don't want the systems of the game to get in the way of that.

229
00:10:57,084 --> 00:11:00,808
We don't want to make you feel bad by blocking you from finding this stuff.

230
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:04,711
So I mean, we did stuff like putting really good gear in all the spittoons,

231
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:08,014
which are not hard to find and they're not hard to get through, right?

232
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:09,475
We just kind of wanted the...

233
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:14,333
we had one of the game to not be particularly challenging we added an

234
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:15,854
optional hard mode just in case but

235
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:21,478
it we needed to stick to the core this game is made of jokes and so

236
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:25,861
we don't we didn't want to do adventure game kind of puzzles where

237
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,182
if you with essentially decided

238
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:28,842
well

239
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,204
We didn't start out making an adventure game, actually,

240
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:33,085
because none of us really like adventure games that much

241
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:34,206
because of this kind of stuff.

242
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:37,027
But it gradually dawned on us that we were accidentally

243
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:37,968
making an adventure game.

244
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,129
So then we were kind of stuck in it.

245
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,110
And so we decided, all right, if there's a puzzle that

246
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,172
requires a needle as its solution, we don't want the

247
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:46,553
player to live in a world where there is only one needle.

248
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:49,355
And if you didn't find it, you can't get past the puzzle.

249
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:51,516
So we just decided to put a needle in every haystack.

250
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:55,439
There are occasional hard puzzles, right?

251
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,461
There are some math puzzles, there are some weird

252
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:01,344
Morse code and Braille stuff hidden in some of the stuff

253
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:05,407
that Kevin put in, but they're either so out of the way

254
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:07,168
that people aren't gonna feel bad about missing them,

255
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:09,370
or we put in some kind of just brute force,

256
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,791
like you can eventually get a stat high enough

257
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,492
to just skip this and it's fine.

258
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:16,575
I had a brief aside that I'm gonna skip.

259
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:17,516
Combat.

260
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,831
The system, like this is definitely

261
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:23,092
the weakest part of the game, and we all know this, right?

262
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:25,514
And if we didn't know it, a bunch of reviews told us.

263
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:31,098
The system is great and flexible,

264
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:34,060
and it's capable of doing a lot of cool stuff,

265
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,541
but we kind of just didn't,

266
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:37,622
we ran out of time and we ran out of money,

267
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:40,804
and so we ended up with combat not in fantastic shape.

268
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:48,467
And we decided, well, given that there's not really any way

269
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:50,728
to make this super funny just on its own,

270
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:54,790
and we don't have time to make it super satisfying,

271
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,051
let's just make it really easy.

272
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:56,891
People will like that.

273
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:59,133
I thought that would be a happy face at the end there,

274
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:00,013
but it was a sad face.

275
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:03,395
But, and it's important when you find something

276
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,276
that contradicts everybody and makes you feel better

277
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:06,837
about yourself that you put it in a bigger font.

278
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:14,977
I think that making the combat easy and just getting it out of the way really served our

279
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:17,381
goal of making the game be a game that is about jokes.

280
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:26,075
In a video game like this, there's going to be a bunch of stuff that you have to do over

281
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:29,677
and over and over again, and moving between areas on the map in this game is a thing that

282
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:30,377
happens all the time.

283
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:35,040
And so one of the things that we had to do was write a tremendous number of random encounters

284
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,481
so that that stuff didn't get repetitive.

285
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:41,704
And pretty early on, we realized that the scope of what was going to happen in random

286
00:13:41,724 --> 00:13:45,046
encounters had to go way down so that it was essentially just writing.

287
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:48,027
We had thought that maybe random encounters would be like a room that you went into with

288
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,668
some stuff that you could interact with, but that got...

289
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:51,249
that would have taken way too long.

290
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:54,930
So we ended up able to cram like 200 of them in there

291
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,011
because a lot of them were somewhat formulaic,

292
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:00,711
but like three different crates that you open

293
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,672
with three different jokes, that's three different jokes.

294
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:06,373
It's a game about jokes, so that counts as three encounters.

295
00:14:09,254 --> 00:14:12,135
Segway, it's important if you don't have a segway

296
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:13,515
to just say segway, so you know

297
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:14,395
there's supposed to be one there.

298
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:19,428
And I'm doing another talk about our tool chain

299
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:21,968
and the design post-mortem for West of Loading tomorrow

300
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:22,689
in the main conference,

301
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,329
so I'll get way more into this there.

302
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,569
But the tools that we built on the back end

303
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,070
and the engine that was built on the front end

304
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,090
were really optimized to just let us cram

305
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,771
as much stuff in there as quickly as we could.

306
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:37,172
And that was very important to avoiding repetition,

307
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:38,912
to being able to get all those random encounters in there,

308
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:43,933
to being able to just maximize the text.

309
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:47,195
so that there were just as many jokes as possible,

310
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,136
so that one of them was funny, then we win.

311
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,679
Colorblind mode is a joke

312
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,980
that a bunch of reviews picked up on,

313
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,102
a bunch of people just, you know, thought was funny.

314
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:00,304
And what was cool about that is that

315
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:02,205
the amount of work that it took

316
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:05,747
to add that option to the game was literally typing this.

317
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:10,598
into a text bucket that we had, and it added the option.

318
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:15,282
And every system in the backend of the development tools

319
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:16,904
for this stuff was like that.

320
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:19,326
Everything just made it as easy as possible

321
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,709
for us to do stuff before we talked ourselves out of it.

322
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:25,371
Another important axiom.

323
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:34,213
And what I mean to say here is that because the game is about jokes, often a joke is better

324
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:38,359
than a good thing that's harder to make than a joke.

325
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,624
We had two sort of big towns in the game,

326
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:48,066
and I wanted there to be gambling mini-games

327
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:49,187
in both of them.

328
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:51,868
And I didn't really have a good idea for either of them,

329
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:55,850
and so like the poker game in the opening town's saloon,

330
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,471
like I agonized over it, and I put it off,

331
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,592
and I put it off, and I put it off,

332
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:02,093
and then I did all this work making this system

333
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:03,554
that it just...

334
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:07,657
It's not bad exactly, but it's just not good.

335
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:08,818
It was a bunch of work.

336
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,681
It didn't, I probably could have just omitted that room

337
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:14,502
from the saloon and nobody but me would have known

338
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:15,923
that there was ever supposed to be anything there.

339
00:16:16,204 --> 00:16:18,245
And I didn't even know what was supposed to be there.

340
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:20,107
So it would have been fine to just omit it,

341
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:22,569
but it was a bunch of work and it resulted in this thing

342
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:23,629
that was not particularly,

343
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,971
not particularly interesting to anybody.

344
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:27,232
Just, it's, nobody talks about it.

345
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:35,681
I knew from the exhaustive research that I did watching HBO's Deadwood several years

346
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:40,643
ago that in Deadwood, Pharaoh was a card game that was more popular than poker.

347
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,765
So we decided in the Breadwood camp that we would have a version of Pharaoh.

348
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,665
I especially didn't have an idea for that.

349
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:51,167
So what I ended up doing was like, what if this is just a game where you name as many

350
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:57,669
pharaohs as you can and how you do is determined by how well you can lie to the other people

351
00:16:57,709 --> 00:16:58,229
that are playing.

352
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,184
That works, right?

353
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:03,524
That is actually kind of funny.

354
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:07,226
And the poker game was like 268 lines of script,

355
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:07,946
not funny at all.

356
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,766
The pharaoh game was 89 lines of script.

357
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,227
And we also ended up with this random pharaoh name generator

358
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:13,908
that I'm hoping to license to Campo Santo

359
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,188
for in the Valley of Gods.

360
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,769
They haven't gotten back to me yet.

361
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:23,092
So Rif, the other writer, he's the one who does

362
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:26,115
almost all of the NPC dialogue,

363
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:28,017
because when I write an NPC, it's usually me

364
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,939
with some sort of weird vocal technique,

365
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:32,281
and an errand they're not willing to run.

366
00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:36,486
So I asked him, hey, pretend you have a list of things

367
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:37,927
that you do when you're writing an NPC

368
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:38,868
and tell me what those things are

369
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:39,949
so that I can put them in this talk.

370
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:45,841
So first thing he talked about was the voice of the NPC

371
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:47,522
and what they would sound like if they were talking.

372
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:49,063
Like, do they have an accent?

373
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:50,604
Do they drop H's?

374
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:52,665
Do they clip G's at the end of words?

375
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:55,727
Do they say um or uh or er?

376
00:17:58,448 --> 00:17:59,369
Going on further from that,

377
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,871
how much of that can we put in

378
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:03,512
before it becomes too annoying to read?

379
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,033
Does it even work in text?

380
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,494
Because one thing we absolutely were never gonna do was VO.

381
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:10,136
So we needed to make sure it wasn't annoying

382
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:10,856
to actually like.

383
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:13,585
be able to imagine what the character sounded like.

384
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:16,608
For major characters, we had these really short,

385
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:18,129
and it's important in presentations

386
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:19,611
to have a lot of text on a slide.

387
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,491
That's one thing I've read.

388
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,554
We wrote these sort of short Bibles

389
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,918
about what kind of, like, what's this character like?

390
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:27,819
What do they sound like?

391
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:30,121
And doing those early,

392
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,943
because these were like the partners

393
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:32,643
that you can take with you,

394
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:34,285
so there were gonna be hundreds of conversations

395
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:34,825
with these guys.

396
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:40,864
Another thing to determine about them is generally just a mood, which determines, like, all right,

397
00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:44,329
what's the sort of overall flavor of the jokes that you're going to get from these guys.

398
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:50,133
An important thing about them that I would never have thought about actually

399
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,014
until riff pointed this out was

400
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:56,235
like essentially how much of the players B s is this character willing

401
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,816
to put up with because that kind of determines whether the humor of the

402
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:01,718
interaction comes from something that's funny about the NPC

403
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:05,419
or some or the sort of resistance of the NPC

404
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,960
to what the players is trying to bring to the table.

405
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,101
Few other random things like you know imagine what they look like

406
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:14,263
and then it's easier to imagine them saying stuff for us that's easy because

407
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:16,887
it's just a very, it's very abstract, right?

408
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,309
Like they don't, they look like stick figures

409
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:19,491
and so in our imagination,

410
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:20,472
they can look like whatever they want.

411
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:22,596
What do they want?

412
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:23,978
Maybe it's something stupid.

413
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:24,739
That would be funny.

414
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,381
Maybe it's something weird

415
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,224
and then you can ask them why they want that weird thing

416
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:29,566
and then maybe there's a funny reason for it.

417
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,481
Why don't they already have it?

418
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:33,643
Maybe they're afraid of something that's not scary.

419
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:35,724
You know, maybe they're too drunk or too lazy

420
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:36,645
to go get it themselves.

421
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:39,407
That lets the player make fun of the person a little bit.

422
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,610
What are they doing when you find them?

423
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,911
Especially for random encounters,

424
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,492
this is where just a lot of the sort of,

425
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:49,295
the stuff that I remember most as funny moments in the games

426
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:50,996
is these things that I would encounter

427
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:52,838
when I was play testing that Riff had written

428
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,818
and I had never seen before.

429
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:56,320
And so it was cool to just find these weird characters

430
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,322
in different parts of the world doing weird stuff.

431
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,573
How do they feel about you interrupting them?

432
00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:03,815
Another source of like, either them being annoyed with you

433
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,536
or them being annoyed with you is funnier

434
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:06,677
than them being grateful to you,

435
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:08,298
so we probably erred on the side of that a little bit.

436
00:20:09,553 --> 00:20:14,395
If you have just a one-off interaction with somebody that doesn't need to have any mechanical effect or anything,

437
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:17,235
you can often just do, like, a real easy thing, like,

438
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:20,636
maybe it's funny because they can't hear you and you keep having to repeat yourself,

439
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:24,977
or maybe they have a weird accent or aren't from around here and so you have a hard time understanding them,

440
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:28,418
or maybe there's some, like, outrageous thing about the environment,

441
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:32,619
or some outrageous thing about them, sort of Saturday Night Live character, and you can lean into that for...

442
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:34,320
the duration of a short conversation,

443
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,481
or maybe they're really bad at their job

444
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:38,342
and they don't understand that they're bad at their job,

445
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:40,062
and that's funny, like Monty Python is funny.

446
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:43,504
Doing this makes it kind of hard

447
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:45,145
to hang anything important on the character,

448
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:46,525
but it's pretty easy,

449
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,986
and if you're just trying to make a lot of them,

450
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:52,168
then it's a nice way to make kind of a fun interlude.

451
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:52,228
In...

452
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:58,640
In writing jokes on the internet for 15 years,

453
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,481
we've had a lot of chances to look at stuff we wrote

454
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:04,323
a year ago or five years ago or 10 years ago

455
00:21:04,803 --> 00:21:07,605
and see how they hold up and see how we feel about them.

456
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:09,125
And so we've kind of learned.

457
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:11,267
And there are a lot of examples of all of these things

458
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:12,527
that I'm about to say that we don't do

459
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,829
in Kingdom of Loathing, don't at me.

460
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:18,883
We try to avoid topical stuff,

461
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:21,426
like this happened while we were making the game,

462
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,068
and it's funny and everybody likes it,

463
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,811
but it would be nonsense if the game,

464
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:28,935
which came out in August, had a thing that was about this

465
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,357
and required you to understand this, right?

466
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:30,998
Like there's just.

467
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:34,608
you never know which things are gonna last.

468
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:37,909
And it's like some joke equivalent to this from 10 years ago.

469
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:39,149
Maybe we'll put in a thing about it

470
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,189
and if you get it, you get it.

471
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,170
But we try not to, we try in general with references

472
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,430
to not make it such that it would just be nonsense

473
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:47,531
if you don't get the reference.

474
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:49,071
Like it's okay if it's a little weird,

475
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:50,431
but it shouldn't just be like,

476
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:53,052
hey look, this is just, remember this thing?

477
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:58,453
Just using somebody else's joke verbatim.

478
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:01,393
Like this was funny once.

479
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,660
And now it's just like nothing makes me groan more than just

480
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,381
kind of, yes, OK, all right, all right, yes, that

481
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,901
was funny when they did it however many years ago.

482
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:19,143
Something that we, as we got older, gradually

483
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:23,644
got more and more, felt more and more strongly about

484
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:26,244
is that we just shouldn't be mean, right?

485
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:27,904
Like there's no reason to.

486
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,701
The tone that we established with Kingdom of Loathing was basically we didn't ever want

487
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:38,423
to make fun of anything that somebody didn't choose.

488
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:43,185
Like we can make a joke about, you know, he's a hippie, he smells bad or whatever, but we

489
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:47,946
kept religion out of it, you know, but we obviously, it's pretty easy to not make jokes

490
00:22:47,986 --> 00:22:49,807
about race when everything is a stick figure.

491
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:53,870
But that said we did say well we're making a Western.

492
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:59,354
There are some problems with this genre that we don't really

493
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:03,296
have anything important to say about right and so we were a

494
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:07,459
little worried that by just completely omitting the genocide

495
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:11,102
of Native Americans from the from our game that we would

496
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:14,144
catch some heat for maybe whitewashing it.

497
00:23:14,424 --> 00:23:15,985
But then it turns out when you make a dumb comedy game.

498
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:17,126
Nobody seems to care about that.

499
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:17,326
So

500
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:21,890
I guess we dodged a bullet by thinking about that more than anybody else ever did.

501
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:28,116
When, and this is just a little rougher in general,

502
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:31,819
and I couldn't quite figure out what I was going to say while this slide was up,

503
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,101
and I still don't know, so I'm eager to find out.

504
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:40,226
We kind of determined in Kingdom of Loathing that...

505
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,768
we're not making fun of things that people didn't choose.

506
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:47,871
And we're like, well, people don't necessarily

507
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:50,533
choose their religion, and people don't necessarily

508
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:52,054
choose their politics.

509
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:58,619
And so what I like to think of is, say, a 17-year-old kid

510
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,501
raised in a conservative household

511
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:04,344
playing a game that's warm and funny

512
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:08,187
and comes from a place where we all

513
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,449
think of ourselves as right-thinking progressives.

514
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:10,969
But.

515
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,290
So does this kid.

516
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,031
This kid doesn't know.

517
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:16,633
And then suddenly, he gets to some specific political thing

518
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:18,814
where we say, hey, kid, turns out you're an asshole.

519
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:19,915
And he had no idea.

520
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:25,219
And now the entire message is just kind of wasted on him,

521
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:29,361
as opposed to just being like ambiently the right stuff,

522
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:33,224
as opposed to actively sort of aggressively aligned

523
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:34,365
against the wrong stuff.

524
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:39,528
That said, this is a very cowardly approach to politics.

525
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:40,028
And I.

526
00:24:41,534 --> 00:24:42,696
kind of just have to own that.

527
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,143
And that also was a very bad choice for where to end the talk.

528
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:56,955
So you might have questions like about the cake, for instance, and whether it's true

529
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:57,255
or not.

530
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:22,019
Hi, I just want to say as a comedy writer,

531
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:24,919
I'm really excited to talk to you

532
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:28,860
because just a year ago, my comedy partner accused me

533
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,020
of stealing the name of my killer guitar

534
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,021
from his stab bat from Kingdom of Loathing.

535
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:38,062
But I was wondering about,

536
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:43,943
I write games that are not funny, but I put funny in them.

537
00:25:44,973 --> 00:25:47,914
What kind of feedback do you look for?

538
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,315
Do you even look for when you're play testing?

539
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:51,915
How funny is it?

540
00:25:52,255 --> 00:25:54,556
Is it, you know, does anybody say,

541
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,036
that's not funny and you take it out?

542
00:25:56,056 --> 00:26:00,718
Yeah, the question is how we deal with

543
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:02,498
and how we look for feedback

544
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:04,779
about the actual comedy aspects of it.

545
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,759
And, you know, we kind of don't.

546
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,280
Like we've been doing it the same way for so long

547
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,961
that like our voice is what it is.

548
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:16,363
the players are kind of either here for it or they're not.

549
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:17,884
And it's like, it's like if somebody comes up

550
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:19,085
and criticizes the graphics,

551
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:20,746
like I don't know what to tell you, buddy.

552
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:24,108
Like, like you either, you can either put up with this

553
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:25,910
and see it for what it is or you can't.

554
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,231
There, every once in a while,

555
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:31,474
there will be some internal argument about whether,

556
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,895
like I will, it's usually me.

557
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:35,537
I will put in a joke that says,

558
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:37,458
that's something that doesn't make,

559
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:41,800
kinda doesn't make any sense, and so many people will report it like thinking it's a

560
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:48,063
typo or a bug that Kevin will just constantly exhort me to change it.

561
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:53,245
When you drink a cup of coffee in this game, it says, like let's say your character's name

562
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:58,427
is Susan, it says, you drink the cup of Joe, and your reply is, my name's Susan.

563
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:03,812
which I think that's funny because the insinuation is that you've misunderstood

564
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:06,876
what the narrator is saying and think that the narrator thinks that your name is Joe,

565
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:09,799
but then if that's the case, then why did they put it in this weird sentence that...

566
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,783
And it got reported as a bug a bunch of times, but I just sort of insisted...

567
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:13,883
Yeah.

568
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,084
Right?

569
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:16,366
Because it just looks like a typo, right?

570
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:16,686
If you don't...

571
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:17,107
If you don't...

572
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:22,562
And it's not like a totally reasonable joke to get, right?

573
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:27,068
Like, what you're getting about this is that it's just sort of a weird thing that doesn't make a ton of sense.

574
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:30,233
But I always ended up sticking to my guns on those things.

575
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,938
I don't think we changed a single joke as a result of feedback in all of this.

576
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:34,439
So, uh...

577
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,724
So I noticed in the podcast you whenever some player asks like to ask you guys to make a joke like a clothing pun

578
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,765
you guys iterate and

579
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:55,509
Try and try again to find the right one. So how do you guys know when you're you find the right funny?

580
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:02,592
Either you get tired of looking or you find one that we just all sort of agree, like,

581
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:03,733
okay, that's it, we're done.

582
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:08,575
Like it's usually pretty clear if you found a really good one, and it also becomes clear

583
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:13,018
if you're not going to find a good one, so you just kind of stop, basically stop wherever

584
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,378
you were when you realize that.

585
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:17,900
You know, might have been better to back up a couple to a slightly funnier one, but who

586
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,340
has the time?

587
00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:24,976
So you mentioned in the talk that you shouldn't let gameplay

588
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,077
get in the way of humor if you're trying to make just a

589
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:31,040
straight-up comedy game, and also that you sort of made the

590
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,261
combat easier to not make it get in the way of the comedy.

591
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:39,604
Do you think there are any notable experiences in your

592
00:28:39,624 --> 00:28:43,166
time developing games where the gameplay or the mechanic

593
00:28:43,907 --> 00:28:46,768
worked extremely well in service of the humor?

594
00:28:49,164 --> 00:28:51,066
That's hard to say, actually.

595
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:54,628
I, seems like the kind of thing I should have an answer for,

596
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:55,950
but I think I don't.

597
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,833
You know, we just try to make that the default mode,

598
00:28:59,853 --> 00:29:01,914
but it doesn't ever, I don't think there's any moments

599
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:07,559
where the game becomes really transcendently a comedy game.

600
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:10,741
Like something like, like Jazz Punk is another game

601
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:13,103
that I would say is just definitely a comedy game.

602
00:29:15,124 --> 00:29:17,906
Given that they are a first-person shooter,

603
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,729
I think it is easier to turn tropes upside down

604
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:25,592
than our thing where it's just,

605
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:27,913
like, it's always gonna be you're walking around in a room

606
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:29,314
having conversations about stuff.

607
00:29:29,354 --> 00:29:30,955
So it's really more just,

608
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,777
here's a bunch of standard delivery for jokes

609
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:35,118
than it is like.

610
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:39,850
we did something weird and expensive on the technical side.

611
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,812
But, you know, I mean, I guess like the Norton,

612
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,934
when he throws the antivirus into your eyes

613
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:49,276
and it messes up the screen, like, that's a thing, right?

614
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:52,018
That's like, oh, now everything looks really annoying

615
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,119
until I figure out how to solve this quest.

616
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,881
But I'm reluctant to draw attention to that

617
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:59,082
because while I think it's funny,

618
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:00,663
that's kind of a joke on the player

619
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,744
rather than a joke at the player.

620
00:30:02,825 --> 00:30:04,966
So, yeah, I don't know.

621
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:09,287
30 minutes.

622
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:11,574
Thanks, everyone.
