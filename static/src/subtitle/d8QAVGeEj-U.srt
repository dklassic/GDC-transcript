1
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:11,709
Hello, hello. I think we're going to get started here. Thanks

2
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:13,370
everybody for coming. I'm supposed to remind you to turn

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:19,816
off your noise-making devices before we go. So where do you

4
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:23,459
get your ideas? Isn't this the question that every writer

5
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,181
dreads, as if there's some magical place where these ideas

6
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:28,743
come from? Anyone who's been working in a creative field for

7
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:31,805
long enough knows that, like writing or like games, knows

8
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,307
that ideas are a dime or a dozen.

9
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:37,089
implementation is hard. Don't get me wrong, good ideas do

10
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,930
help, but the devil is in the details of implementation.

11
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:42,812
Writers get asked this so often that they come up with pithy

12
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:45,554
answers, like Harlan Ellison would say, Schenectady, there's

13
00:00:45,594 --> 00:00:47,695
a nice shop there where you can order ideas and they come in a

14
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:52,297
tidy box and then you use them. Neil Gaiman had a pithy answer

15
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:56,319
to this as well until he shifted to just saying, honestly, I make

16
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,440
them up out of my head.

17
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:01,466
So anyone who's been doing game design well enough has probably

18
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:05,934
heard our version of this, where do you get your game ideas? Or

19
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:10,582
maybe the slightly better but still not great question, how do

20
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:11,544
you make your games fun?

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,821
Pro tip for anyone who is just getting into game design

22
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,443
professionally, we don't like the word fun very much because

23
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:21,345
it's too amorphous, too broad, too hard to define what exactly

24
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:24,187
you mean. Of course we want people to have fun, but it's not

25
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:27,429
a very useful descriptor. But this is a better question. Or

26
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,492
maybe how do you make your games work? That's the question I like

27
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:34,294
to ask veteran game designers to try to figure out what their

28
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:37,316
process is, how they go from those interesting ideas to a

29
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:40,518
game that's good and that players enjoy.

30
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,960
because it's going from the idea to the working game that's the

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,182
hard part. How do you get your prototypes to work? How do you

32
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:49,684
make them quickly enough that they solve those big risky

33
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:51,985
questions early before production starts? How do you

34
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:54,487
get your systems to work so that people are hooked, so that

35
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:56,929
people keep playing, so that they understand what's going on?

36
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:59,831
How do you make your enemies work so that they're challenging

37
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,792
enough? How do you make your teams work so that everyone's

38
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,693
turning, going in the same direction?

39
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:06,566
So this is the rules of the game session.

40
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:09,367
My name's Richard Rouse.

41
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:10,667
I will be your host today.

42
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:13,548
I'm a director, designer, writer at Paranoid Productions,

43
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:15,989
where we're working on an action infiltration game

44
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,329
with a shifting narrative called The Church in the Darkness.

45
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:20,530
Our format today is simple.

46
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,430
Five designers get 10 minutes each

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,311
to talk about a game design rule that is personal to them.

48
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,752
We did this session first last year

49
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:30,072
with five other game designers.

50
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,615
and this turned out pretty well and you can go watch it on the

51
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:35,977
vault, it's up there for free, if you go to GDC vault and

52
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:39,540
search for five rules, this will come up at the top. And that

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,202
session went pretty well and was really interesting. So we

54
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:45,585
thought, hey, let's do it again and get a new set of designers.

55
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:49,489
So as I said last year, game design rules are personal, not

56
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:50,029
universal.

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,329
That means a lot of the rules you'll hear today are things

58
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:56,011
that these specific designers really enjoy using that help

59
00:02:56,051 --> 00:03:00,153
them make their games, whatever genre, whatever team situation

60
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:03,515
they may be in. Just because you hear a rule here today doesn't

61
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:06,697
mean it's necessarily the final word on this subject. But I

62
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:09,779
don't know about you, but I find it interesting to hear from

63
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,720
people who have worked on great games like some of the ones

64
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,242
behind me now what rules they used when making them.

65
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:18,105
not so I can copy them, so I can try to understand what my own

66
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:21,148
versions of those rules might be. You can think of your game

67
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:24,811
design rules as like a deck of cards that we as game designers

68
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:28,475
can choose to play and deploy when the time is right. I've

69
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:30,397
been working as a game designer for a while.

70
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,244
So naturally I have my own deck of these rules. Sometimes those

71
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:38,749
rules are specific to a project. So for example on the suffering

72
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:42,275
game, these might be some of the rules that I used. I wanted a

73
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:45,240
consistent rules-based world. I wanted a narrative that changed

74
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,502
the future and the past.

75
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:50,324
I said to everyone all the time, the game is always too hard.

76
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:54,287
And sometimes these rules will change project to project for a

77
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:55,048
few different reasons.

78
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:57,369
For example, on the church in the darkness, the game I'm

79
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,231
working on now, a lot of the rules stay the same, but

80
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,533
obviously not every game has horrific creatures in it.

81
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:03,473
So we took that out.

82
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:07,155
some of the rules change because I realize the old version

83
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:09,757
wasn't wrong. It wasn't your game is too hard. Your game

84
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:12,999
should be hard enough. And sometimes new rules come up. So

85
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,060
these can shift project to project, studio to studio. So

86
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,642
bear that in mind. In the throws of development, nothing is

87
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:21,283
absolute. It's an act of constant compromise with the

88
00:04:21,323 --> 00:04:23,805
team and the schedule and the budget and the technology and so

89
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:24,485
many factors.

90
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,407
But I still find it useful that when you're floating out to sea

91
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:32,589
wondering what the heck is going on in your project, you can look

92
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:35,150
to some of those sign post rules to help pull you back to calm

93
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,812
waters. So today we're going to have a series of speakers get up

94
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:41,654
here. A little later on, Emily Short is going to tell us how

95
00:04:41,694 --> 00:04:44,255
she tests her game before it's maybe even ready for testing.

96
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:47,457
George Fan is going to tell us how your enemies are not as

97
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:50,278
different as you think they are. Liz England is going to tell us

98
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:53,481
who you should make your game design documents for,

99
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,942
and Michael DePlater is going to tell us

100
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,644
how systems can bring about some human stories.

101
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,587
But up first, we have Lee Perry.

102
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:03,789
He is an experienced game designer,

103
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,891
having worked on everything from the Gears of War franchise

104
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:08,913
to the mobile title Lily, to now, of course,

105
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:11,095
working on a VR title, Moonstrike,

106
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:12,716
like so many are working on VR titles.

107
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:16,179
And he's gonna tell us how everything you know is wrong

108
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,921
when it comes to when to add pizzazz to your game.

109
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:20,062
For you, Lee Perry.

110
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:21,619
Thank you.

111
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,180
Hey everybody.

112
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:28,981
So this is my talk.

113
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:31,522
Call it Pizazz First, Polish Later.

114
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:37,384
So when I first started making games, like a lot of people, I used to think that games

115
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:42,306
were about these high concepts and big ideas about the settings and character bios and

116
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:45,507
all the kind of classic things that kind of get people into games early on.

117
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:55,662
But as you start getting more experience, you start to realize that so many games have something kind of special about them that make them endearing beyond just their concepts.

118
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:58,426
And it kind of becomes less about this.

119
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,768
and more about what this means and this means

120
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:04,689
and how just interacting with the controller

121
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,692
and having things coming at you that you're instigating

122
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,374
and getting this really good feedback is super rewarding.

123
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:12,015
And it's this huge part of your game

124
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:13,276
in addition to the concepts.

125
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,078
So generally, when I'm talking about feedback,

126
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,400
most of us know what we're talking about,

127
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,221
but for the most part, I'm talking about things

128
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:22,404
like how satisfying it is in a Mario game

129
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:25,106
where you jump and there's a little screen shake

130
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:27,268
and his little particle cloud on his feet.

131
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:36,842
Or how like the guys who make Peggle kind of blaze the trail on neat little sounds escalating as things happen,

132
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:41,846
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, or exploding particles everywhere, or slow motion.

133
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:45,470
And, you know, they're kind of the godfathers of really good player feedback.

134
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:50,455
If you want more specific details on that, there's a couple of great talks online.

135
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:53,318
The grapefruit guy called Juice It or Lose It.

136
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,742
There's a really good flambier talk called The Art of Screen Shake.

137
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:59,485
Really good feedback techniques.

138
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:05,414
So, it's very easy, and for a long time I kind of associated these feedback techniques

139
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,076
with kind of polish on a game.

140
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:11,341
And part of the problem is that you save a lot of polish until the end of your game,

141
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:16,367
which as we all know from kind of practically speaking, it's really easy to cut a lot of

142
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,290
things at the end of the game when time starts getting squished in there.

143
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,124
Sometimes you might have a game where you've got a big deadline in the middle of it like a big press show or you know

144
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:31,749
Demos etc. And so you have this kind of spike in the amount of polish that you have earlier in the game

145
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,594
And when we were working on Gears of War we ended up with this kind of level of polish

146
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:40,217
it kind of looked like this through production and it was because

147
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,369
we would have these debates about all these features.

148
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:46,430
Like early on, we could talk about things

149
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,931
like a cover system, but people weren't really sold on it

150
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:53,133
until somebody would go in and add a bunch of feedback to it,

151
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,874
like little particles and screen shakes,

152
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:57,955
and Mark is going, ugh, and all kinds of crazy stuff.

153
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:59,856
And so then people would be like, oh, yeah,

154
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,237
this is a cool feature, and I get it.

155
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:05,639
And so the feedback became an instrumental tool

156
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,580
in selling features to the team.

157
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,561
And so consequently, we constantly

158
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:10,721
had this ratcheting up.

159
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:13,455
version of feedback and polish in the game.

160
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,581
And so that was pretty cool.

161
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,983
It turned out that the feedback wasn't just a tool

162
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:22,105
for the players, it was a tool for the developers as well,

163
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:23,986
for kind of internal salesmanship.

164
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,047
And that was pretty cool.

165
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:27,989
So a couple years ago, I started doing kind of solo games

166
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,530
and kind of this quest for self-sufficiency.

167
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:34,212
And being kind of a strong advocate of this,

168
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,214
I didn't really know what that meant for me

169
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:40,376
as a single person for adding feedback in my game.

170
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:41,437
And so...

171
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:47,647
I started working with this and realizing that adding feedback in your game, even if

172
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:50,268
it's just for you, is another great tool.

173
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:54,289
It's not just for the players, it's not just for a team, but it's also for you, because

174
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,631
as many of you may know, if you're working a small game, it's easy to be plagued by this

175
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,912
like crippling self-doubt about what you're working on at every turn.

176
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:08,314
So adding feedback early on is a way to give yourself kind of an additional kind of clarity

177
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:09,255
about what you're working on.

178
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:17,211
So in like some crazy ideal world, it would be awesome if we could all take our games and just drive the polish through the roof early on.

179
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:22,834
But obviously, that's freaking insane. You can't just take the first things you start adding in your game and polishing them.

180
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,936
I think they would call that polishing a turd, perhaps.

181
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:34,439
But what we had to do is kind of detach the concept of good player feedback from the entire

182
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,981
concept of polish.

183
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:42,367
So it's not, feedback is not polish, it's pizzazz, is what I call it, and you can throw

184
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:43,968
jazz hands when you say that to somebody.

185
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,972
When I'm talking about pizzazz, I'm talking about things that are...

186
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:54,337
Really help how visceral your game is but it's not necessarily like this is the final

187
00:09:54,937 --> 00:10:01,081
Particle effect we're going to use or whatever what matters is that it's really super catchy and it makes your game just feel better

188
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:03,482
But it's stuff you can totally throw away at some point

189
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:09,086
But what matters is you put something in and when you're doing these kind of core loop elements of your game early on

190
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,328
And so it's really critical, as early as possible in your game,

191
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:15,449
to get this feeling like you're the kid going, wow,

192
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:18,251
or taking cars and smashing them together, and whatever.

193
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:19,952
Anything that gives you this kind of joy

194
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,052
when you're playing your game.

195
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,134
So it's not enough to have these elements.

196
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:26,775
There's benefits from when you do this.

197
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:29,156
I don't know if a lot of you work with concept artists,

198
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:32,218
but I keep finding good concept artists often make

199
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,639
stupid noises when they're drawing.

200
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:36,540
That's awesome.

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,583
Anyway, so there's a lot of easy things you can do for this.

202
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,003
They don't have to be final elements.

203
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:45,045
You can have particle libraries from God knows where,

204
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:48,107
super punchy over-the-top sounds, screen shakes,

205
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,729
all of these things, good placeholder music, post-processing.

206
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:55,251
These are all elements of good feedback,

207
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:57,353
but again, these don't have to be final things.

208
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:00,594
Just put them in early, and they will help the project as you go.

209
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:05,817
Because that timing is going to allow you to develop your core loop better and to kind

210
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:07,639
of like figure out what the soul of your game is.

211
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:11,281
And you're going to find all these kind of emergent like things like, oh man, I didn't

212
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,802
realize this was going to be so fun, but it is.

213
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,963
We need to expand on that.

214
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:18,044
It also encourages you to show your game, which is critical.

215
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,849
critical thing when you're working on your game.

216
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,313
Not just a press, but it's also about your internal

217
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,915
confidence of what you're working on,

218
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,197
which helps team morale, et cetera.

219
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,201
When people feel good about your game, it's huge.

220
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,644
Obviously now we're working with a lot of VR stuff.

221
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:40,287
And there's a couple of things with that, like VR is all about being intuitive and what can you generally teach the player

222
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:47,150
without needing a tutorial. And good player feedback early on is critical for making that happen and developing your game.

223
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,273
And all of these like known techniques like flashy stuff and particles and sounds and stuff all work in VR

224
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,254
for the most part. Stay away from screen shakes.

225
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:06,048
Also, early on in this VR thing, as you can tell from the show around us, there's a ton of elevator

226
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:13,793
pitches and concepts going around. But it's really easy to elevate your pitch and elevate your game

227
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:17,716
right now by having some of these elements, because not a lot of people are going that extra mile.

228
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:23,060
My current game, Moonstrike, prepare yourself for virtual, virtual reality.

229
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,426
So this is one example like early on

230
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:33,970
I kind of had these really basic selection tools in my game where I'd kind of paint these selections

231
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,771
and it kind of worked and spawned these little fleets and it's kind of Galcom-like.

232
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:41,213
But it was cool, it was really simple, it wasn't super compelling.

233
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:47,015
And so I'd go in and make kind of little models, like little selection dotted lines and you

234
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:53,198
know, just kind of placeholder assets to make this kind of sequence feel a lot better.

235
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:57,979
Then I'd add sounds, all a peggle.

236
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:00,718
which you can never have enough of.

237
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,028
And again, it started to escalate how fun it was

238
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,573
just to do this basic thing.

239
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,452
Then I added support for both controllers,

240
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:10,993
even though it's totally redundant,

241
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:12,534
because it's just freaking fun,

242
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:13,675
like a kid when you're sitting there

243
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:14,575
waving your hands around,

244
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:15,396
and you're like, yeah,

245
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:16,516
and I'm gonna select this thing,

246
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,137
and I'm gonna select this kind of thing.

247
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,719
And just adding these kind of basic elements to it

248
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,001
drove the project really far early on.

249
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,943
I got a lot of really good early results for it.

250
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:27,424
In addition to all the normal

251
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:29,105
kind of confidence issues with it,

252
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,466
I got support from Valve and Super Early Hardware

253
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,187
because they were like,

254
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,688
oh man, this could be a thing, that's cool.

255
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:39,270
I became an official Oculus partner in one of the launch games for the touch controllers

256
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,851
and crazy limited hardware.

257
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:42,911
It was awesome.

258
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:47,293
I attracted a really great development partner, Tiffany Smith, who's helping me on the program

259
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:50,214
because she saw what I was doing, and some really great articles.

260
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:54,276
But none of this would have happened if I would have still stuck with cubes and spheres

261
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:54,696
and stuff.

262
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:58,758
So, my point, you're going to add feedback to your game anyway, right?

263
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:03,980
because you should. So just front load some, even if you're going to throw it away. Don't wait

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,822
until the end. It's not polished. It doesn't have to be perfect. You can totally throw it away, but

265
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:12,804
it's going to help you while you work on your game. So it's not polished, it's pizzazz, and do

266
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:15,885
some jazz hands when you show it to people. Yeah. Thanks.

267
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:19,167
APPLAUSE

268
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:23,784
Thank you, Lee.

269
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,325
I think he's just reminded us, when

270
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,906
talking about working with big teams, just how political

271
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:30,567
the act of game design can sometimes

272
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,548
be when you're not only convincing the publishers,

273
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:34,269
but also the team itself.

274
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,390
So next up, we have Emily Short.

275
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,712
She is a veteran of the world of interactive fiction,

276
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:43,653
having worked on everything from the classic Galatea,

277
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:46,154
to doing some writing in Sunless Sea,

278
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:48,855
to working on the innovative interactive fiction system

279
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:49,676
Versu.

280
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,738
And she's going to tell us how she tests her game before she

281
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:53,699
even has testers.

282
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:54,459
Emily Short.

283
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:58,743
Hello.

284
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,444
I'm Emily Short.

285
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:05,327
And that was a really good point to segue from into my talk.

286
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,709
Because I'm going to tell you something else that you should

287
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,431
be doing right at the beginning of your project.

288
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,435
Since I'm a freelance consultant in interactive

289
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:17,138
narrative, I spend a lot of time with different tool sets

290
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,680
for writing and for managing content and dialogue.

291
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:21,782
Sometimes I'm building my own tools.

292
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:24,104
Sometimes I'm working with other people's freeware tools.

293
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:25,365
And sometimes I'm working with.

294
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:28,307
proprietary tools that my client has come up with.

295
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:31,248
And I'm here to argue for a pretty simple principle,

296
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:32,929
visualize early.

297
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:35,490
So when you're designing a new system,

298
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,111
you need to think about how you're going

299
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:38,411
to visualize its behavior.

300
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:41,633
If you're working on something with dialogue

301
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,514
or narrative structure, that might mean

302
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:45,294
visualizing how pieces of the story

303
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,255
or the conversation are gonna feed into one another.

304
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,019
If you're working on a dynamic system,

305
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,521
that might mean heat maps,

306
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:54,706
it might mean taking traces of many consecutive runs

307
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,829
through the system and laying them on top of each other.

308
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:59,474
It might mean a dynamic visualization tool

309
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:01,837
that projects movement in response to variables

310
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:02,659
that you're changing.

311
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,967
If you're building a procedural narrative system

312
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,630
that uses a lot of content data,

313
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,252
or perhaps not narrative system,

314
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,215
a procedural system that uses a lot of other kinds

315
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:13,738
of content data, that might mean coming up with ways

316
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,681
to picture how much data you have,

317
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:17,484
what categories it breaks into,

318
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,707
and how you will know when you have enough.

319
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:23,428
And this is not a game example, but it's a piece of really

320
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:27,949
beautiful visualization that shows an analysis of the words

321
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:31,269
in English translations of major religious texts and how

322
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:34,190
often those particular terms appear that allows you to

323
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,251
really quickly kind of grasp where those texts are showing

324
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:41,912
up and what the relative significance of them can be.

325
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:45,612
So that kind of thinking about your procedural data can be

326
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:48,073
very useful in sort of refining your system.

327
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:51,140
So I'd like to take us through how I've used early

328
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:54,203
visualization in several of my own projects, and then expand

329
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,166
a little bit to talk about how that same approach might apply

330
00:16:57,206 --> 00:17:00,509
to other kinds of work besides narrative-focused projects.

331
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:04,659
So here's an in progress visualization of a chapter in

332
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:07,460
Platinum Package, which is a story I'm writing for Choice of

333
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,401
Games line of branching novels.

334
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:12,702
And it might look like a design document of some kind,

335
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:15,323
but this is actually the result of running a Python

336
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:18,444
script that I wrote against the code for this story and

337
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:21,545
automatically generating a dot format file that can be read

338
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:22,446
into GraphViz.

339
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:25,247
The visualization shows us the structure, and it's a little

340
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,867
bit simplified for this talk, but the

341
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,088
structure of one chapter.

342
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,281
And in that picture, I don't just have sort of

343
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,902
here are the nodes and where they're going,

344
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:35,924
but also a distinction between which of these pieces

345
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:38,865
are player choices, which are represented by solid lines,

346
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:41,146
and which are automatic transitions,

347
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,907
which are represented by the dotted lines.

348
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:45,209
I can immediately see by looking at my chart

349
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,930
that I have a mix of player choice and consequence,

350
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,811
and the consequences are clustered

351
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,972
towards the end of the chapter, which is what I want.

352
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:55,279
Meanwhile, the colors of the lines are showing me

353
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:57,200
what kinds of stat changes are happening

354
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,842
when the player makes those decisions.

355
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:01,264
Each color corresponds to a different stat

356
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:02,705
that could be going up and down.

357
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,127
The transitions that are in red

358
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:06,948
are ones that have no stat effects,

359
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:08,089
and that's important to call out

360
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:11,932
because part of the spec, the brand commission for this game

361
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,714
is that there have to be stat changes

362
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:15,755
for every single choice the player is making.

363
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:17,897
So I need to be able to instantly see

364
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:20,359
that that is the case, that I've left something out

365
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:21,260
that I need to correct.

366
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:26,989
So the chart keeps up with the changes that I've made in the

367
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,092
story. So unlike a hand generated design document, it's

368
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:33,374
not going out of date. That's important because I'm responding

369
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:36,196
to feedback from my editor as the story progresses and over

370
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,998
those iterations the game is diverging from the original

371
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:42,660
document. So I could do meticulous upkeep on a design

372
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,742
document or I could just have a way of seeing directly into the

373
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:46,923
code and that's much better.

374
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:50,903
Now here's a case where the visualization I'm doing

375
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,904
is farther from being a spec document

376
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:54,785
and closer to being a play test report.

377
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:57,887
Versu is a project that I worked on for several years

378
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,869
that involved characters with an AI driven approach

379
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:02,129
to social interaction.

380
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,191
And that meant that at the high level,

381
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:05,672
there was an authored structure

382
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:06,992
of a number of different scenes,

383
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:10,955
but within each scene, what happened was very, very dynamic

384
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:13,416
depending on the moods and relationships of the characters

385
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:15,697
and what dialogue the player chose to drill into

386
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:16,518
and what they ignored.

387
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:21,268
From a QA perspective, that meant we needed to go far

388
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:23,850
beyond just having play testers play the game a number

389
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,772
of times in order to verify the quality of what we were

390
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,213
building, we needed to run through thousands of trial

391
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:32,255
play throughs with an additional AI agent making the

392
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:33,756
players choices randomly.

393
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,294
And we needed not just to have that information,

394
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:38,855
but be able to look at that information

395
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:41,637
and instantly see what was broken or what was working.

396
00:19:41,717 --> 00:19:44,139
So this chart shows the way that we visualized

397
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,660
the resulting information.

398
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,562
And this is just the beginning of the story.

399
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:50,264
It actually continues for many, many more scenes

400
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:51,464
with much broader branching.

401
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:55,007
But even if it's tough to read on this slide,

402
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,128
so let's zoom in here.

403
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:59,529
So here we're seeing just the first few scenes of the game.

404
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:02,370
The first scene can end one of a couple of ways.

405
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,451
The percentages on this diagram indicate how many times

406
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:07,212
the randomized player has reached

407
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:09,293
each of these optional scenes.

408
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:13,274
Scenes that the AI reaches frequently are light gray.

409
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,717
scenes that they are reaching more seldom are dark gray. If

410
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,839
there are any scenes, and there are no examples of this on this

411
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,941
slide, but if there are any scenes that the AI never

412
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:24,805
reaches, that's almost certainly a bad sign. A sign of some sort

413
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,288
of implementation problem. So those would be called out by,

414
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:28,609
again, by coloring them in red.

415
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:33,897
And in fact, in this case, I had some help from the tool designer, so we were able to

416
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:36,920
build a visualization tool that was itself dynamic.

417
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,243
So if I looked in at one of these story nodes and wanted more information about what was

418
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:45,787
happening, how has the player reached this point, how are the randomized traces leaving

419
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:50,351
this point, I could click through and open it up and get a description of here are all

420
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:50,851
the different...

421
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:53,235
roots into this, here are the roots out,

422
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:55,278
and I can quickly see if something is getting 0%,

423
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,583
that means that root through the story isn't being used,

424
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:00,185
even if the node is being hit,

425
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:01,928
there's something probably wrong

426
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:04,011
with the logic that I've set up for this.

427
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:07,196
So I can see all the possible transition states.

428
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:11,735
And finally, I think it's important to make the point that your visualization does not

429
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:13,436
have to be even a little bit attractive.

430
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:18,739
So I started this slideshow with a bunch of pictures from processing.org by people who

431
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:22,721
are very skilled and artistic and much better at visualization than I am, but it doesn't

432
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,582
have to be like that to be functional.

433
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:28,604
And if this picture is unsexy, that's actually part of my point.

434
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:31,886
This is a simplified version of how I looked into

435
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:35,728
an experimental procedural narrative system that used a lot

436
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:38,830
of event data. So we had written a number of events that could be

437
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,512
selected to occur next depending on whether the protagonist had

438
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,333
certain status features. And of course the event could also

439
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:48,374
change the protagonist status. So running a simple script to

440
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:48,735
count.

441
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:52,977
checking and setting of these statuses for each quality

442
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:54,718
and then charting the result in Excel

443
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:57,140
helped us get a visual sense of what was happening.

444
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,021
So for instance, in this representation,

445
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,462
the wealth equals rich attribute

446
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:03,283
is being checked very frequently,

447
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:05,185
but set very infrequently.

448
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,966
which is a warning that the system contains a lot of data

449
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:09,767
that might rarely have a chance to fire.

450
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:12,049
And I have been in many, many situations

451
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:13,950
working on procedural systems

452
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,811
where we spent a lot of time trying to figure out

453
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:17,072
what was wrong with the code

454
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:18,633
when the problem was really that

455
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:20,314
we had the wrong distribution of data.

456
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:23,256
So being able to see that quickly is very, very important.

457
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,237
Even conditional self-formatted counts.

458
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:29,498
Another question I had about this data set

459
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:31,338
was how specialized the events were.

460
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:33,419
So an event might be checking multiple

461
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:35,040
prerequisite qualities at a time.

462
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,540
And in order to get a sense of whether I was getting

463
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,942
good coverage for all the values of different qualities,

464
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,042
I just threw some count data into a

465
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:44,603
conditionally formatted Excel sheet.

466
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:49,728
And that didn't look particularly good, but I could instantly see where the dead zones were.

467
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:54,734
There are zero of this, zero of that, they're colored red, I know I need to build more of that kind of thing.

468
00:22:56,234 --> 00:23:00,539
So it might seem like this is a really, really open-ended piece of advice that might work

469
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,982
out wildly differently for different kinds of projects.

470
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:07,388
And it might also seem to people who are mostly designers that I'm asking you to gain new

471
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:09,791
expertise that isn't necessarily in your wheelhouse.

472
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:14,897
But personally I find that even asking myself the question, what would a picture of this

473
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:15,938
system look like?

474
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:20,120
gives me a really useful new angle on thinking about the quality of the design.

475
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:26,922
Because a visualization puts its emphasis, like color, size, priority on the page, all of those kinds of things,

476
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:31,484
it puts its emphasis on what's wrong or what's important about your design.

477
00:23:31,564 --> 00:23:34,325
So asking those questions about whatever system you're building,

478
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:38,466
what is here is important and what can go wrong is really useful.

479
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,077
If you have a system with a large amount of data,

480
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:43,359
thinking about visualizing that data means

481
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:45,640
that you're gonna have to think about things like data types,

482
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,162
what might characterize good or bad data,

483
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,843
how much data you're going to need,

484
00:23:51,104 --> 00:23:52,845
and whether you have adequate coverage

485
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:55,166
for different aspects of your game world.

486
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:57,988
And if you're not a programmer, but you have one handy,

487
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,189
you might wanna talk to them at this stage

488
00:24:00,229 --> 00:24:01,430
about how they would approach this.

489
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,940
Second, the sooner you have these ideas,

490
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,860
the sooner you can build them into your tools

491
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,361
or specify them so that your tool programmer

492
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:10,941
can start building them in for you.

493
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:13,281
So it is very, very much harder,

494
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:15,102
and again, this gets back into team dynamics.

495
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,062
If you're at the point where you're sort of

496
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:19,483
working 80 hour weeks to get enough content

497
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,744
into your system, it's way harder at that point to say,

498
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:25,244
it would really help me if I had an extra tool

499
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,304
to see what's going on here.

500
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,105
Even if that would actually speed up your experience,

501
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:31,766
convincing anybody on your team to actually take a break

502
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:32,566
and do that for you.

503
00:24:33,186 --> 00:24:37,169
impossible. So you're not going to necessarily anticipate

504
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,091
everything that could possibly happen as the system evolves.

505
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,014
But one of the useful things about a visualization is that it

506
00:24:44,054 --> 00:24:46,596
helps you instantly recognize issues in whatever it is that

507
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:49,918
you've just built. So anything you can do that highlights

508
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,141
content problems while they're being generated will save you

509
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:55,763
huge amounts of time later catching and debugging them.

510
00:24:56,383 --> 00:24:59,045
And conversely, anything that makes content creators

511
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:01,187
feel confident about what they've built

512
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:02,128
while they're building it,

513
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,711
leads to faster and better content.

514
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:07,353
So this is how to make future you

515
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,915
really, really hate current you.

516
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,439
Well, just rely on the content creators

517
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,220
to make sure this data is formatted correctly.

518
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:18,996
Your content team may be geniuses, but they will make

519
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:22,361
mistakes. And you want as many ways as you can to find their

520
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:25,507
mistakes anyway. We all know why spell checkers are useful.

521
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,552
Putting in more visualization options gives you more

522
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:29,453
corrective tools.

523
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:33,508
So I'm not by any means the first person to stand up at GDC

524
00:25:33,528 --> 00:25:36,149
and talk about how to visualize particular aspects of what you

525
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:38,110
might be building as a designer.

526
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,931
So here's Noah Falstein talking at a narrative summit

527
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:43,652
a couple of years ago about puzzle dependency graphs.

528
00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:46,153
This is a great talk from Alex Schambendart

529
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:48,814
at the 2012 AI Summit, which includes

530
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:51,615
some discussion of how to visualize behavior of squad AI.

531
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:54,517
And there's a whole panel from the AI Summit in 2011.

532
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:56,659
AI tends to do a lot of this.

533
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,562
Rez Graham, Michael Daw, and Brian Schwab

534
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:02,184
talking about visualizing expected AI behavior

535
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:04,986
and how to see when something is going wrong.

536
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:06,628
So if you want sort of more deep dives

537
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:09,410
in how people do this, these are great places to look.

538
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:12,013
And then outside the world of GDC Talks,

539
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:14,355
you might also get some visualization ideas

540
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:18,338
from Edward Tufte's books or from Brett Victor's websites.

541
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:20,989
But whatever you're trying to do,

542
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:23,650
thinking about the visualization from the beginning

543
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,130
does some really useful things for your design process.

544
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,891
Visualization forces you to think about categories,

545
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:30,732
what are the components of your system

546
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:31,652
and how do they relate?

547
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:34,893
It forces you to consider what the failure conditions are

548
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,933
so that you can draw visual attention to them.

549
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:40,271
and forces you to think about what success would look like.

550
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:41,672
What is a finished system?

551
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:43,775
How do you know when you've got enough content

552
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:44,896
and in the right places?

553
00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:48,780
And if you visualize early, you can either build

554
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,683
or better yet make someone else build a better tool

555
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:53,445
that will help you find your bugs faster

556
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:54,867
and streamline your workflow.

557
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:09,047
Thank you, Emily. I think all of us as designers have been known to say,

558
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:13,697
but it's not ready yet for testing. And I think Emily has just provided us one more thing we

559
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:15,420
should be doing that maybe we aren't.

560
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:19,785
So next up we have George Phan who's been developing games for

561
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:22,847
many years. He actually started with one of his earlier games

562
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:25,789
was the San Aquarium, which was a winner in the early days of

563
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:28,872
the IGF. But you probably know him for a little game he made

564
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:32,454
called Plants vs. Zombies. George will be telling us how

565
00:27:32,494 --> 00:27:36,077
your enemies aren't as different as you think they are. And a fun

566
00:27:36,117 --> 00:27:39,200
fact about George, when you want to find a picture of him on the

567
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,762
Internet, because you haven't met him before, you're very

568
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:43,483
likely to come up with a bunch of pictures like this.

569
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:49,326
him to know that George, you're the only George that I'm a fan

570
00:27:49,406 --> 00:28:04,952
of. George fan. All right. Time to talk about my rule which is

571
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:09,433
make your enemies actually different. First let's zoom into

572
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:11,534
this word actually. What do I mean by that?

573
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:20,288
In this case, I mean making it so each new enemy is tackled in a different way. Think of some of

574
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:25,294
the games you played where the enemy design was exceptional. I bet in each case there was a high

575
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:30,279
density of enemies that you had to use different methods to defeat. The reason I have Super Mario

576
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,803
in this slide here is because it does such a great job of meeting this criteria.

577
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:37,105
Take note of the feeling you have right now when looking at

578
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,225
this set of bad guys. Remembering all the different

579
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:42,546
ways you used to defeat them. If you are ever unsure about

580
00:28:42,606 --> 00:28:45,846
enemy design, I recommend analyzing the first Super Mario

581
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:49,087
and see how it did things as a clean example of enemy design

582
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:53,348
done right. Sometimes we set out to make a game with a lot of

583
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:57,209
enemy variety. On the surface they look different enough. And

584
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:58,269
they seem to do different things.

585
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:02,529
but to the player fighting enemies becomes monotonous and

586
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:04,991
each new encounter doesn't bring enough uniqueness to the table.

587
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:08,733
And we're left with a game that feels like you just fought a

588
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:11,676
bunch of the same thing. Today I want to teach you how to avoid

589
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:15,418
that. To help us along I'm going to introduce a tool called

590
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:19,221
player brain-o-vision. It's a way for us to remember to get

591
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:22,323
into the player's brain as this is the most important

592
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:28,468
perspective. So let's meet our player. Naturally our player has

593
00:29:28,528 --> 00:29:28,828
a brain.

594
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:33,394
Let's try using player brain o vision and imagine what this

595
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:38,055
guy is thinking. Let's try to see what his brain sees. Based

596
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:41,016
on this guy's expression, I'm going to say he's playing Bill

597
00:29:42,037 --> 00:29:46,818
and Ted's excellent video game adventure. All right. So let's

598
00:29:46,838 --> 00:29:50,039
get into this. I'm going to start with some don't dos. Here

599
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,480
are things you don't want to do when your goal is to make

600
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,101
enemies actually different.

601
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,751
First pitfall happens when we have two enemies that are

602
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:01,233
identical and think, oh, we'll just change the look of one of

603
00:30:01,253 --> 00:30:05,475
them. That will be enough. Do this over and over again and

604
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:08,856
you'll have the most boring game of all time. The problem here is

605
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:11,477
that the two enemies are doing the same thing. The player

606
00:30:11,497 --> 00:30:15,079
doesn't handle the skeleton any differently than the mummy. So

607
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:17,720
they'll store both of these in their brain occupying the same

608
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,382
space and our brains tend to clump things together in order

609
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,683
to keep up with all the information we need to process.

610
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:28,234
Now the player's goal is to beat the game. To that extent, the

611
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:30,836
player doesn't care that the mummy looks different from the

612
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:34,539
skeleton. In its efficiency, the brain will squeeze these two

613
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:38,262
together into just one enemy. And that's what we want to

614
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:42,245
avoid as we're not adding any true enemy variety here.

615
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:47,110
Even lazier than changing just the look is changing one color

616
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,793
to another. I certainly didn't think of this gray fish from

617
00:30:50,853 --> 00:30:54,415
super Mario as a brand new enemy type. I'll cut them some slack

618
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,117
because they were up against some extreme memory limitations

619
00:30:57,377 --> 00:31:00,840
at the time. But nowadays color shifts, they just don't pass for

620
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,683
brand new enemies anymore. An abundance of them can often make

621
00:31:04,703 --> 00:31:07,405
your game feel cheap and most of the time you're better off with

622
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:10,267
just one solid enemy instead of two pallet swapped enemies.

623
00:31:11,796 --> 00:31:15,318
One more thing is to not think of small changes in HP, damage

624
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:19,501
and speed as brand new enemies. A little bit is okay, but if

625
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:22,503
every bad guy in your game can be defined as just some degree

626
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:25,605
of these three variables, you're doing something wrong. The

627
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:29,267
difference between 500 and 510 is small enough that once again,

628
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,530
the player's brain will meld these two together into just one

629
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,052
bad guy with about 500 HP. All right. Now that we've covered

630
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:37,813
some don't dos,

631
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:42,122
It's time to take a look at some doodoos. I've got a big doodoo

632
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:45,605
for you to take a look at. And I'm going to call it attributes

633
00:31:45,765 --> 00:31:49,648
of differentiation. Basically these are qualities enemies

634
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:52,090
might have that would make them play differently from one

635
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,813
another. You might think of them as sort of avenues to explore

636
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:59,396
while you're trying to make your enemies actually different. In

637
00:31:59,436 --> 00:32:02,098
this section of the talk I'll provide you with some examples

638
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:05,841
of attributes I find myself using again and again. The first

639
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:06,702
one of these is movement.

640
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:10,097
We can often make the player handle the enemy differently by

641
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:13,560
simply introducing new movement patterns. In Super Mario, these

642
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,062
enemies all have distinct styles of movement and the player needs

643
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:19,145
to account for each one differently. But be careful you

644
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:21,828
don't spend time making things have special movement when in

645
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:24,490
the end it gets handled by the player just the same as

646
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,834
something else. In this hypothetical game, we've designed

647
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:32,058
two enemies, a bird that moves in a zigzag and a bat that moves

648
00:32:32,098 --> 00:32:32,698
in a sine wave.

649
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,420
There might be cases where this difference is significant, but

650
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,021
for the most part I see players handling these two movement

651
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,723
patterns in the exact same way. Again, not good if our goal is

652
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:46,804
to make enemies actually different. Stuff like this can

653
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:49,985
be found out through play testing, but using player

654
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:54,888
brain-o-vision we can often catch it earlier. Another

655
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:58,729
attribute I like to consider is priority. Meaning when seeing

656
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,631
lots of enemies on screen, which order to defeat them in.

657
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,402
How urgently do I need to defeat this enemy relative to others?

658
00:33:06,302 --> 00:33:08,843
An example of a high priority enemy is the generator from

659
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:12,044
gauntlet. It doesn't matter how many ghosts you kill, if you

660
00:33:12,064 --> 00:33:14,384
don't kill the bone piles first, they'll keep spawning more

661
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:18,225
ghosts. The UFO from space invaders is an interesting case.

662
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:21,626
You prioritize it not because it's threatening, but because

663
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,947
it's worth a bunch of points and only on screen for a limited

664
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:29,008
time. Let's think about priority some more. Suppose we have a

665
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,108
group of basic grunts.

666
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:32,745
Now let's add a healer to the group.

667
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:34,365
If we try killing the grunts first,

668
00:33:34,785 --> 00:33:35,546
it'll take a long time,

669
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:36,786
because the healer will keep them healed.

670
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:41,448
So the correct play is to focus on killing the healer first,

671
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,788
then take care of the grunts

672
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:43,869
after the healer's been dealt with.

673
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:45,389
But what about this?

674
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,871
Let's instead add a high damage dealing archer to the group.

675
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:53,232
In this case, the archer becomes our number one priority,

676
00:33:53,252 --> 00:33:54,793
because it's the more threatening unit.

677
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:57,174
Again, it makes sense to prioritize

678
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:58,514
killing the archer over the grunts.

679
00:33:59,452 --> 00:34:02,776
Now, as long as in this weird hypothetical game we're only

680
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:05,899
presented with units in these two formations of healers and

681
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,744
grunts and archers and grunts, the healer and the archer would

682
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:14,228
seem as the exact same unit in terms of priority. Even though

683
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:17,252
they perform vastly different roles. Just something to keep in

684
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:17,412
mind.

685
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:21,165
Fact is a lot of enemies we design tend to fall into this

686
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:24,726
high priority deal with me first category. That's why it's good

687
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:27,466
to explore the other end of the spectrum and design enemies

688
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:30,667
that are best dealt with last. Both these guys get mad and

689
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,907
become more deadly after you damage them. So it's best to

690
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:35,688
ignore them as long as you have other enemies to deal with.

691
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:40,449
Enemies that have lots of HP and do low amounts of damage also

692
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,090
fit into this deal with me last category.

693
00:34:43,636 --> 00:34:46,218
Another attribute we can consider is timing. It often

694
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:48,580
involves having an enemy that's more dangerous during certain

695
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,702
times or likewise more vulnerable during certain times.

696
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:54,925
A prime example of this is the piranha plant from Super Mario.

697
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:58,147
It's safe to pass while it's retracted into the pipe but

698
00:34:58,187 --> 00:35:01,850
dangerous otherwise. The lava bubble is another bad guy from

699
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,012
Super Mario that hops in and out of the lava and requires timing

700
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:05,433
to avoid.

701
00:35:07,095 --> 00:35:09,577
If we're observant and we use player brain vision, we might

702
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:12,320
discover some similarities between these two units. I

703
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,262
initially didn't think of these as being very similar, but in

704
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,705
researching this talk, I realized they're both timing

705
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:21,168
based enemies with up and down movement. The only differences

706
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:24,651
are the lava bubble is immune to Mario's fireball and only found

707
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:28,275
in lava. Now this is our own game. It would then be up to us

708
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:30,817
to decide if these small differences were enough.

709
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,797
All right. On to the next attribute. When most games in

710
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:39,500
your game do close range attacks, you should shake things

711
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,422
up by offering some enemies that are long ranged. The catapult

712
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:45,283
zombie and hammer brothers are examples of long range enemies

713
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,945
in games where most enemies are close ranged. Likewise, if most

714
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:51,607
of the enemies in your game are long range, consider throwing in

715
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:55,529
a close range enemy to liven things up. A lot of these

716
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:58,911
attributes come down to being observant of what happens often

717
00:35:58,931 --> 00:36:01,252
in your game and designing things to disrupt that.

718
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:03,476
Which brings us to our next attribute.

719
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:07,260
A good way of coming up with new enemies is to think about what

720
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,862
actions the player does most often in your game, then come

721
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:12,144
up with an enemy that counters that action to shake things up.

722
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:15,987
In Super Mario, the most common action to defeat enemies is to

723
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,610
stomp on them. So halfway through the game, the spiny

724
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,013
enemy is introduced, which you obviously can't stomp on. Along

725
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:24,555
the same lines, the buzzy beetle is immune to fireballs, another

726
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:28,118
common action of Mario's. Both enemies do their job of keeping

727
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:30,860
Mario on his toes and not letting him perform the same

728
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:31,821
actions over and over.

729
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:35,833
In plants versus zombies I had the early issue of walnuts being

730
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:39,094
really good and noticed players falling into a rut of using

731
00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:42,135
walnuts to solve everything. So I designed these pole vaulting

732
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:45,095
zombies that would leap over the first plant they ran into thus

733
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:47,476
making walnuts a little less universally good and mixing

734
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:51,496
things up for the player. A good exercise is to think about what

735
00:36:51,536 --> 00:36:54,077
your players do often then come up with ways for your enemies to

736
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:57,437
disrupt that. For example, if you notice in your game your

737
00:36:57,477 --> 00:36:59,138
players are just constantly spamming AOE.

738
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:03,125
You could design a unit that counters AOE. These eggs when

739
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:06,346
damaged release extremely powerful demons punishing the

740
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:08,606
player who just goes around AOE attacking everything willy

741
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,687
nilly. Unleashing all the demons at once is a bad move and the

742
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:14,067
demons become too overwhelming for the player to deal with.

743
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:17,308
Instead the correct play is to break the eggs one at a time

744
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:19,849
dealing with each demon individually before breaking the

745
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:23,849
next egg. With this one enemy type we've added a nice beat to

746
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,730
our game where players play carefully for a bit and then

747
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,170
they go back to constantly spamming AOE.

748
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:31,824
In PVZ I knew players had gotten used to zombies coming in from

749
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:35,165
the right side of the screen. So I threw them a curve ball and

750
00:37:35,205 --> 00:37:37,606
introduced the digger zombie which surprise attacks your

751
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:41,007
plants from the left. On the flip side we can design enemies

752
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:43,808
by giving them a weakness offering a power to the player

753
00:37:43,848 --> 00:37:48,029
that exploits that weakness. It often feels satisfying to face

754
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,330
down an enemy that's tough to deal with initially but then

755
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,191
you're given a power that helps you defeat it with ease.

756
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:56,732
Finally we have the attribute of player attention which mostly

757
00:37:56,772 --> 00:37:59,316
comes in the form of telegraphed attacks. This involves

758
00:37:59,336 --> 00:38:02,762
designing enemies who deal a ton of damage not avoided but give

759
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:05,527
you ample warning so you have the opportunity to avoid them.

760
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:10,679
they function in groups of enemies is to demand your

761
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,522
attention for some amount of time. An example of this is from

762
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,185
super Mario 3 where this sledge brother will jump up into the

763
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:19,429
air forecasting a ground slam. If you're still on the ground

764
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:22,252
when they slam into it you'll get stunned for some time. This

765
00:38:22,312 --> 00:38:24,935
forces you to pay attention and react by jumping.

766
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:28,571
All right. To sum things up, here's an effective way to make

767
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:33,035
your enemies actually different. First, try to design each new

768
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:36,337
enemy with an attribute of differentiation in mind. I've

769
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:40,060
given you some examples of attributes you can explore. Once

770
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,203
you've done that, pass the enemy through player brain vision to

771
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:45,625
see if it actually makes the player do something different.

772
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,728
Do this and your enemies will be awesome. I'm looking forward to

773
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:52,330
playing your upcoming games with truly diverse sets of enemies.

774
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:55,022
If you want to talk more about this, my info is right here. I

775
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,544
will be coming out with a game later this year that has its own

776
00:38:57,644 --> 00:39:00,346
share of enemies that are actually different. So follow me

777
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:02,348
on Twitter for updates on that. All right. Thanks.

778
00:39:10,162 --> 00:39:15,127
Thank you, George, and I feel right now everyone in the room has opened their laptop and is ripping out their palette-swapping code.

779
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:16,388
I hope you are, anyway.

780
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:21,992
So next up we have Liz England. She's a game design veteran, having worked on everything from Scribblenauts to Resistance

781
00:39:22,513 --> 00:39:28,999
to Sunset Overdrive, a game we both worked on, but due to the modern nature of large game development, we didn't meet until this week.

782
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:33,786
Now, for another modern reality, if you've been doing game design for a while, you may

783
00:39:33,826 --> 00:39:38,474
know that no one is reading your precious game design documents, and, well, good news,

784
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:40,617
Liz has a solution for that. Liz England.

785
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:50,851
Thank you. Can everyone hear me? Yes. Excellent. Yes, so I am

786
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:53,993
talking about probably the most riveting topic that you could

787
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:57,116
possibly discuss in game design, which is about documentation.

788
00:39:58,537 --> 00:40:02,761
Now, this talk is a little bit advanced, maybe sort of. And it

789
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:04,643
kind of assumes you already know a lot of the trials and

790
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:06,905
tribulations of dealing with game design documentation,

791
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:07,946
especially on a big team.

792
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:13,971
There are several talks prior to this that I recommend that you

793
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:16,493
can find on the GDC vault or you can find on YouTube because I'm

794
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:18,915
going to spend my ten minutes talking about a very specific

795
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:23,438
kind of subtopic and my personal take on this, which is my

796
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:27,422
thesis, which is make actionable documentation. Actionable here

797
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:29,904
is a very specific term, and I'm going to break it down for you,

798
00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:34,548
which is to make documentation for people that people can act

799
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:35,528
on. And...

800
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,652
For me, that's what actionable means.

801
00:40:38,692 --> 00:40:40,035
It means people can act on it.

802
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:41,737
And I'm gonna separate this down

803
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:43,020
and we're gonna talk about people first.

804
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,963
So, why do we care about people?

805
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:47,828
So, well, yes, I heard.

806
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:55,754
A lot of times when we make documentation, we make it to be comprehensive and exhaustive

807
00:40:55,874 --> 00:40:56,535
about a game.

808
00:40:56,555 --> 00:41:00,318
We're documenting a game and we're trying to plan out all the details.

809
00:41:01,078 --> 00:41:04,661
And then you look at the documentation and it was never meant for a human to read it.

810
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:11,106
So my first step is to say when you make documentation, you don't document a feature.

811
00:41:11,186 --> 00:41:14,428
You don't document a game because the game is not reading your documentation.

812
00:41:14,488 --> 00:41:15,889
It doesn't care if you document it.

813
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,651
It's the people that care if you document it.

814
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:24,313
And when I talk about people, let me, blah, blah, blah.

815
00:41:24,893 --> 00:41:27,094
So instead of asking what feature are you documenting,

816
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:28,955
ask who is this document for,

817
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:32,276
and then try to answer that who question, right?

818
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:33,816
And when I talk about people,

819
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:36,197
I'm obviously talking about the members of your team,

820
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:37,697
and sometimes that means your whole team.

821
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:40,158
A lot of documents are written for the whole team.

822
00:41:40,218 --> 00:41:41,798
A lot of times you write a document

823
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:44,259
for one department or multiple departments.

824
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:47,700
But I would say, get a lot more specific than that.

825
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:51,043
Because when you write for an entire department,

826
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:53,826
for example, you end up having a lot of extra information

827
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:54,887
that's not very relevant.

828
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:56,589
And nobody wants to go through a document

829
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:58,851
that's 90% irrelevant just to find the 10%

830
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,052
that they care about.

831
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,234
They're just gonna bother you at your desk instead.

832
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,016
And maybe you prefer that.

833
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:07,740
So instead I would say, you know, instead of just writing

834
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,543
for the team or maybe the department, maybe you go to the

835
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:13,566
one person who's going to do something with this document

836
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:17,670
and you say, hey, Adam, that guy in AI, you know,

837
00:42:18,091 --> 00:42:19,652
what does he need in order to?

838
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,814
you know, read this document. So you sit down with him and you

839
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:26,195
get his buy in the first place. I like to think of a document as

840
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:30,997
this like special handcrafted bespoke artisanal gift that I'm

841
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:34,618
giving to another developer. And it's like made perfectly for

842
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:39,059
them. And maybe in this case Adam, right, likes use cases.

843
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,760
So, yeah, he loves use cases and we use a ton of use cases.

844
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,281
and somebody else would prefer just a one page,

845
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:46,802
high level document and go over the details in person.

846
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:50,423
And when you write documents this way,

847
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:52,044
you're getting a lot of buy-in from other people

848
00:42:52,064 --> 00:42:54,244
on your team and you're making sure that the information

849
00:42:54,264 --> 00:42:56,065
that they're getting is actually relevant to them

850
00:42:56,505 --> 00:42:57,925
instead of handing them a document

851
00:42:57,945 --> 00:42:58,986
that they've never seen before

852
00:42:59,006 --> 00:43:00,886
and then they're just, their eyes glaze over,

853
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:03,107
which many of us would be familiar with.

854
00:43:04,627 --> 00:43:07,889
So the next question is, what do I want them to do with it?

855
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:09,489
Well what do you do with design documents, right?

856
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:10,289
What do you want people to do?

857
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:11,390
You want them to read them, right?

858
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:14,218
wrong, wrong.

859
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,179
That makes me so mad.

860
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,940
So it's like giving someone a game and saying,

861
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,721
well, what do I do with this?

862
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:20,301
Will you play it?

863
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:22,522
I'm like, well, what am I doing with the game?

864
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:25,923
You know, am I, how am I interacting with it?

865
00:43:26,244 --> 00:43:28,845
So when I say act, I'm saying,

866
00:43:29,845 --> 00:43:32,506
reading is a very passive way of dealing with documentation.

867
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:34,669
You don't write documentation for the purpose to be read.

868
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:38,332
Documentation doesn't exist for the purpose to exist, right?

869
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:41,395
It should have an explicit purpose, right?

870
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:44,538
If I write a documentation for someone,

871
00:43:44,558 --> 00:43:47,661
a doc for someone, you want them to do something with it.

872
00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:52,028
And that's where I get into a little bit of game design.

873
00:43:52,068 --> 00:43:54,370
We all should be familiar with use our verbs, right?

874
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,091
Like run, jump, shoot.

875
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:57,853
We should use those kinds of verbs

876
00:43:57,873 --> 00:43:59,334
with our documentation as well.

877
00:43:59,694 --> 00:44:01,236
So read is a bad verb.

878
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:02,497
You don't use that verb.

879
00:44:03,998 --> 00:44:08,783
But use verbs like maybe you need to inform the team, right, on a very basic level.

880
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:13,848
Maybe you need to write a document that needs to get approved by the leads, right, and that's

881
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:17,311
going to have a very different format than a doc that you write for QA so that they can

882
00:44:17,351 --> 00:44:21,856
debug your feature or for a program in order to implement it and so on and so forth.

883
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:24,478
The important lesson here is that

884
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,121
your documents are going to have a very different form

885
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:30,322
depending on what the purpose of that document is,

886
00:44:30,603 --> 00:44:32,384
and also depending on who you're writing it for.

887
00:44:32,444 --> 00:44:34,185
So there's a lot of different variables

888
00:44:34,225 --> 00:44:35,125
that go into your document.

889
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:39,328
There's no one set kind of perfect design document

890
00:44:39,368 --> 00:44:39,968
to follow.

891
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:41,950
So that's sort of like my summary

892
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,371
of make actionable documentation.

893
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:46,112
And again, actionable here is the important word.

894
00:44:46,152 --> 00:44:47,913
It means people can act on it.

895
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:50,975
So I'm going to go over a bunch of practical considerations.

896
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,250
And there's a lot of them, right?

897
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,591
Because when you actually try to put this into action,

898
00:44:58,011 --> 00:44:59,352
there's pros and there's cons, right?

899
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:02,013
So the first one is different styles for different needs.

900
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:05,034
You know, some people work best with visual documentation.

901
00:45:05,074 --> 00:45:07,254
Some people work best with like flow charts

902
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:08,335
or just a Word document.

903
00:45:08,615 --> 00:45:10,235
And as designers, we should be familiar

904
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:11,876
with being able to make all different kinds

905
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:12,956
of these documents for them.

906
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,021
Also, this means, you know, you have smaller documents, more

907
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,302
concise documents, because you stripped out all this extra

908
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,543
information that you don't need to give somebody. But that does

909
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:26,244
mean you have one feature, but you might have to make several

910
00:45:26,284 --> 00:45:30,006
documentation, several docs for that feature. So I'll give you

911
00:45:30,026 --> 00:45:33,807
a couple of examples. So this is a map from most of my examples

912
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:36,568
are from sunset overdrive. This is a map from sunset overdrive.

913
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:40,210
And it was great because it might make zero or

914
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,471
almost zero sense to you guys, but it was built with the people who needed to use it

915
00:45:45,551 --> 00:45:50,152
together in the same room. And this was basically leads from all the department got together

916
00:45:50,212 --> 00:45:55,494
and we built this map. And so it worked great for the team to track it. Maybe not so much

917
00:45:55,534 --> 00:45:59,875
like QA couldn't use this map to do anything and like if you were new to the team, maybe

918
00:45:59,895 --> 00:46:00,655
you can't use this map.

919
00:46:01,596 --> 00:46:04,800
it was updated and it was used a lot because it was created with

920
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,765
a bunch of people invested in the first place. And I want to

921
00:46:07,785 --> 00:46:10,048
compare that to a different map. This is a map that was sitting

922
00:46:10,088 --> 00:46:13,173
on my desk for about a year. And it just has a bunch of Post-it

923
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,816
notes. And this was our way of organizing side content in the

924
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:16,037
game.

925
00:46:17,118 --> 00:46:19,800
because instead of trying to deal with an unwieldy

926
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,363
Photoshop map and we're just a bunch of designers,

927
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:24,825
we work really well with paper, so we use Post-it notes

928
00:46:25,145 --> 00:46:26,286
and we moved information around.

929
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:29,469
And so Quest designers could use this to help plan out

930
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:31,050
all that side content in the game.

931
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:33,392
But I couldn't hand this to QA and be like,

932
00:46:33,412 --> 00:46:34,874
yeah, do something with this, right?

933
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:37,076
So I had to make another document, right?

934
00:46:37,096 --> 00:46:38,237
And that was just a flowchart.

935
00:46:38,657 --> 00:46:39,478
Now keep in mind,

936
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:42,621
So this flowchart worked really well for various people on the

937
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:46,084
team, especially for QA so that they could debug when do the

938
00:46:46,124 --> 00:46:49,227
side content roll out. But when you look at it, you realize none

939
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:51,869
of the location information is here. There's no map, right? So

940
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,992
we stripped out the information that we didn't need because it

941
00:46:55,012 --> 00:47:01,058
would just essentially clutter the rest of the ‑‑ clutter

942
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,400
the document for other people on other teams.

943
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:07,576
And then I'm going to go real quick because I'm taking too much time.

944
00:47:08,436 --> 00:47:09,857
So this is another document I wrote.

945
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:11,558
It's a big flow chart, lots of detail.

946
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:15,119
It worked extremely well for programmers in order to implement stuff off of this.

947
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:18,681
This is our mission flow, what happens when you fail a mission, what happens when you

948
00:47:18,701 --> 00:47:19,361
abandon a mission.

949
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:22,663
But I handed it to the designers and their eyes just glazed over and they just looked

950
00:47:22,703 --> 00:47:23,263
at me with...

951
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:29,283
what was going on. And so I basically reskinned it, took away a lot of quantitative information

952
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:33,825
and replaced it with some qualitative information, you know, with the context that designers

953
00:47:33,845 --> 00:47:37,347
understood, which was I understand what a mission is, so how does it fit into these

954
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:41,389
different slots. And that ended up working well for them. So I could not find a single

955
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:46,932
document that was one size fits all. I had to make several that were, that suited each

956
00:47:46,972 --> 00:47:47,632
person's needs.

957
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:51,874
So some other practical considerations. It's okay not to

958
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,916
update docs if they've served their purpose. Go ahead and

959
00:47:55,956 --> 00:48:00,678
retire them, you know. No one likes updating documents that

960
00:48:00,718 --> 00:48:03,459
have been old from six months old. Just make a new one.

961
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,681
Sometimes the game is its own best documentation. So here's a

962
00:48:07,902 --> 00:48:10,003
good example of that. In Sunset Overdrive we

963
00:48:10,663 --> 00:48:12,464
made a bunch of changes to our traversal system.

964
00:48:13,044 --> 00:48:14,866
And then we had to communicate that to the whole team.

965
00:48:14,886 --> 00:48:17,207
So we got this awesome visual design document.

966
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,968
And everyone kind of understood, oh, so this

967
00:48:19,008 --> 00:48:20,249
is the direction traversal is going.

968
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,030
And that was great.

969
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,071
So they started implementing it.

970
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,532
And then a few months later, it's like, OK,

971
00:48:25,552 --> 00:48:26,573
so what's going on with traversal?

972
00:48:26,953 --> 00:48:29,975
Well, go play the game.

973
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:32,637
Because at that point, the game was the best documentation

974
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:33,857
you could have for this system.

975
00:48:33,957 --> 00:48:35,638
And when it changed, there was no reason

976
00:48:35,678 --> 00:48:37,660
to change documentation and inform the whole team.

977
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,041
You just go and you play the game.

978
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:43,963
some other considerations to deal with. Write docs when

979
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:48,325
needed, not before. Don't write for an audience that doesn't

980
00:48:48,365 --> 00:48:51,086
exist yet. So some people might not like this one. What it

981
00:48:51,146 --> 00:48:54,447
means is let's say you're designing a boss and you have

982
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:57,429
your high level approval. Well, you can go in and you can write

983
00:48:57,529 --> 00:48:59,810
all the details for it, but it might not get implemented for

984
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:02,811
six months. And everyone knows that in those six months, a ton

985
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:06,633
of things are going to change. So I would argue that you wait

986
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:09,334
until the last possible practical.

987
00:49:09,854 --> 00:49:12,575
minute before you write that documentation. So you know who

988
00:49:12,595 --> 00:49:14,836
is actually implementing it so you can write for that person.

989
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:18,818
Obviously the flip side of this is that suddenly you get

990
00:49:18,858 --> 00:49:22,359
documentation. And that means you have to have a really fast

991
00:49:22,399 --> 00:49:24,900
turnaround and be able to do documentation and be really

992
00:49:24,941 --> 00:49:29,242
flexible with it. So that's one of the downsides. And this also

993
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:32,744
runs counter to a plan it out first mentality or it appears to

994
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:36,445
on the surface at least. Because there's the idea that we want to

995
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:37,406
plan everything and then.

996
00:49:37,426 --> 00:49:39,287
We're working on this stuff through the software team.

997
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:42,512
Plan it out first as much as possible before you start

998
00:49:42,832 --> 00:49:44,053
investing the money to implement it.

999
00:49:44,373 --> 00:49:48,657
But I would argue that you are your own reader, so you should

1000
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:52,960
be able to and you can write documentation as yourself as the

1001
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:55,763
reader and the purpose is to plan, right?

1002
00:49:55,863 --> 00:49:59,766
So it doesn't entirely strip out the idea of plan it out first.

1003
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:04,991
So it's not an excuse to avoid documentation.

1004
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,735
Even if you're waiting up to the last practical minute, you're still writing more documents,

1005
00:50:09,795 --> 00:50:10,395
not fewer.

1006
00:50:11,456 --> 00:50:13,498
It doesn't replace every document that you make.

1007
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:16,501
There's still going to be times where you need to make that, you know.

1008
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:23,366
20 page document that some people may or may not read. And it's sad when they don't read it. But I

1009
00:50:23,406 --> 00:50:29,851
would argue that we should try and make it as actionable as possible. So this is an example of a

1010
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:36,677
document for scribble knots that I made. And I had to be 25 pages. So I just said, okay, every page

1011
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:40,500
needs to have sort of an actionable thing that you can do with it. And split it up.

1012
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,801
And then just to wrap up, I just want to acknowledge that this talk may not work so well if you're

1013
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:51,042
an indie or you work alone, because you are making all the documentation for yourself

1014
00:50:51,122 --> 00:50:51,943
and not a big team.

1015
00:50:52,903 --> 00:50:57,744
And then the last thing is that sometimes it's difficult to onboard new people if you

1016
00:50:57,884 --> 00:51:01,865
don't have any documentation for features that exist, but we already have the problem

1017
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:05,986
where our documentation that exists is either out of date or it doesn't exist.

1018
00:51:06,026 --> 00:51:10,367
So it's sort of like which is your least worst case scenario.

1019
00:51:10,627 --> 00:51:13,793
So that's it. That's my argument for make actionable

1020
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:15,255
documentation. Thank you.

1021
00:51:20,505 --> 00:51:21,447
It's all good.

1022
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:24,258
So thank you, Liz.

1023
00:51:24,298 --> 00:51:25,919
We are running a little low on time.

1024
00:51:25,939 --> 00:51:28,239
So I'm going to move right along here to our final speaker,

1025
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,401
is Michael DePlatter, talking about a subject dear to my

1026
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:31,601
heart.

1027
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:33,801
Often we think about game systems as intuitive or sticky

1028
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:36,002
or challenging or good for flow.

1029
00:51:36,102 --> 00:51:38,583
But what if they are good for producing humanity?

1030
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:41,064
Michael has been working in games for some time, worked on

1031
00:51:41,084 --> 00:51:44,085
everything from sports games to Total War franchise to

1032
00:51:44,145 --> 00:51:46,106
2014's Game of the Year, Shadow of Mordor.

1033
00:51:46,226 --> 00:51:46,806
Michael DePlatter.

1034
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,421
Hello, is that coming through?

1035
00:51:52,441 --> 00:51:55,844
Yeah, I just love GDC so much.

1036
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,726
All these talks are so inspiring,

1037
00:51:57,746 --> 00:51:59,948
and I guess really that's probably the number one

1038
00:52:00,148 --> 00:52:03,512
takeaway from this talk is how much

1039
00:52:04,352 --> 00:52:06,715
other games and multiple genres can inform

1040
00:52:07,556 --> 00:52:08,598
every game you're working on.

1041
00:52:08,638 --> 00:52:11,601
So this is really, as Richard was saying before,

1042
00:52:12,102 --> 00:52:16,027
a personal story in the sense of a specific case study

1043
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:18,330
of how did sports games and war games

1044
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:21,033
and real world references inform the Nemesis system.

1045
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,351
And it's sort of a two-way street.

1046
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:29,592
So the Nemesis system was something where we wanted players,

1047
00:52:29,952 --> 00:52:33,413
sorry, I should just explain, it was the key feature

1048
00:52:33,453 --> 00:52:35,974
of Shadow of Mordor, the open world action adventure game

1049
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:38,715
we did last year where players have their own

1050
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:40,696
unique and personal enemies.

1051
00:52:40,736 --> 00:52:43,077
We wanted to make it a villain simulator

1052
00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:44,917
and we wanted to make these really diverse

1053
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:45,758
and meaningful enemies.

1054
00:52:47,694 --> 00:52:51,535
And what we wanted to do was to make them operate

1055
00:52:51,575 --> 00:52:54,777
according to the most real world intuitive rule set

1056
00:52:54,817 --> 00:52:58,919
that we could, so to find out about how do these

1057
00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:01,040
kind of stories get created in the real world

1058
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,521
and how could we actually apply that

1059
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:04,102
to the creation of our game.

1060
00:53:05,623 --> 00:53:08,444
And as we're looking at that, we really went back

1061
00:53:08,804 --> 00:53:12,186
and looked not just at action adventure games,

1062
00:53:12,226 --> 00:53:14,147
not just at games within our genres,

1063
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:16,088
but also sports games, war games,

1064
00:53:16,228 --> 00:53:17,168
all sorts of different things.

1065
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:24,708
And in particular, what we sort of looked at

1066
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:29,111
was the way that sports is a real world system

1067
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:30,492
that is actively designed.

1068
00:53:30,512 --> 00:53:34,334
You know, game designers work in sports.

1069
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:37,576
You know, they design seasons, they design formats,

1070
00:53:37,616 --> 00:53:38,597
they design rules.

1071
00:53:39,357 --> 00:53:41,779
And the things that those seasons and rules do

1072
00:53:42,379 --> 00:53:44,380
is they generate stories.

1073
00:53:47,112 --> 00:53:48,852
The ways in which they generate stories

1074
00:53:49,132 --> 00:53:50,953
are through a lot of the same mechanics

1075
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:53,614
that we see in books and movies and other media.

1076
00:53:54,134 --> 00:53:56,774
So they create and set up conflicts.

1077
00:53:58,015 --> 00:53:59,775
One of the things that was very important for us

1078
00:54:00,095 --> 00:54:04,037
is you don't have save game mechanics in sports.

1079
00:54:04,717 --> 00:54:07,658
The failure and the way in which time moves forward

1080
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:11,519
is actually a key component of creating the drama

1081
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,179
and creating the story.

1082
00:54:13,259 --> 00:54:15,880
So for example, if you lose the third match of the season,

1083
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:18,442
you don't roll it back and play it again,

1084
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:20,164
you have to overcome that loss.

1085
00:54:20,564 --> 00:54:25,028
And those sort of real world passage of time

1086
00:54:25,148 --> 00:54:27,350
is great for drama, it creates rivalries,

1087
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,992
it creates comebacks, it creates underdogs,

1088
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:32,074
it creates all of these.

1089
00:54:33,075 --> 00:54:34,996
personal dramas for players to overcome.

1090
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:37,759
And that was something that we focused on a lot

1091
00:54:37,939 --> 00:54:41,782
with our system as well, and finding ways to

1092
00:54:42,503 --> 00:54:44,805
make that treatment of time tie together

1093
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:48,808
with our fiction, which in this case was Lord of the Rings,

1094
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:52,031
and a system of death and resurrection.

1095
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:54,673
So time would move forward, and we would be creating

1096
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:56,094
these personal stories with enemies.

1097
00:54:57,075 --> 00:54:59,117
And another thing, oh, excuse me, sorry,

1098
00:54:59,357 --> 00:55:01,999
end of the week, I'm finally hitting puberty.

1099
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:07,315
And another thing that's very common

1100
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:11,038
and we can see in sports, but also very much in drama,

1101
00:55:11,118 --> 00:55:14,401
whether it's Jane Austen or whether it's Patton

1102
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:17,443
or whether it's Star Wars, is social structures

1103
00:55:17,483 --> 00:55:21,026
and social hierarchies underlie a lot of the most

1104
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,887
emotionally affecting stories.

1105
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:25,109
People that start on top and they have a fall

1106
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:26,450
and move down in society.

1107
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,432
People start at the bottom as a poor, innocent farm boy

1108
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,413
and make their way up.

1109
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:33,416
And so that was again something that was really interesting

1110
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:35,478
for us to be able to simulate.

1111
00:55:35,518 --> 00:55:37,600
And by simulating these social structures,

1112
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,323
time, these relationships, conflict,

1113
00:55:40,743 --> 00:55:43,806
to try and make something that's not a structured narrative

1114
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:45,808
but creates the same sort of emotion

1115
00:55:45,848 --> 00:55:46,850
and the same connection.

1116
00:55:51,993 --> 00:55:56,276
And then as a specific example, going back to sports,

1117
00:55:56,776 --> 00:56:00,299
sports seasons are basically a three-act narrative structure.

1118
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,861
You have Act One, where we see who the various teams are,

1119
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:05,262
who are the favorites, what's going on,

1120
00:56:05,602 --> 00:56:07,003
and we have Act Two with this.

1121
00:56:07,643 --> 00:56:10,284
the sort of constant buildup of the action,

1122
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:12,845
the highs and lows, and then act three,

1123
00:56:12,925 --> 00:56:15,506
they generally have a structure of the finals

1124
00:56:15,566 --> 00:56:17,406
and the final climax and the grand final.

1125
00:56:17,446 --> 00:56:21,027
So even though the plot is basically the same every year,

1126
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:24,168
the stories and the dramas of it are incredibly dynamic.

1127
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,729
And that was a model which we wanted to take

1128
00:56:26,769 --> 00:56:30,350
and apply into our genre, which was action adventure.

1129
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,010
And the other one.

1130
00:56:32,371 --> 00:56:33,573
which was very important for us

1131
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:35,436
and often isn't the case in games.

1132
00:56:35,736 --> 00:56:38,580
In games, there's the tendency when you fail

1133
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:40,143
to say, okay, go back and do that again.

1134
00:56:40,183 --> 00:56:42,066
We're going to wave our hands and say it didn't happen.

1135
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:45,410
But, as I say, in sports, whether it's an injury or a loss,

1136
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:48,853
that failure is actually embraced and used

1137
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:52,435
to create more drama, and that was absolutely core to us.

1138
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,976
We wanted, when you died, not to say,

1139
00:56:55,136 --> 00:56:56,717
okay, that's a failure, you should go back

1140
00:56:56,777 --> 00:56:59,699
and do that again, but you've actually created the seed

1141
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:02,400
of an exciting and personal story and this vendetta

1142
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,481
and this personal relationship against the guy

1143
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:05,201
that defeated you.

1144
00:57:05,842 --> 00:57:08,363
And of course, the other place that that happens constantly

1145
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:11,564
and time moves forward, we create these personal rivalries

1146
00:57:11,644 --> 00:57:14,166
is multiplayer games, so, you know, Call of Duty.

1147
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:18,210
and so on, which was another, we were sort of trying

1148
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,213
to create the types of relatedness and grudges

1149
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:24,697
you get against other human beings onto our NPCs.

1150
00:57:24,717 --> 00:57:26,499
We wanted to make them as human as possible

1151
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:29,462
with the goal of maximizing players' emotion.

1152
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:33,706
And all of these sort of systems for creating stories

1153
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:36,669
and drama aren't within the framework of

1154
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,934
Even non-linear narratives or branching narratives

1155
00:57:40,974 --> 00:57:43,237
are the sorts of things that we can see in RPGs.

1156
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:46,321
It's generally trying to actually make a system

1157
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:48,424
that generates drama and relationships.

1158
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,393
And something else we looked at from sports and took is

1159
00:57:54,254 --> 00:57:57,317
that it does, it creates stories at two scales.

1160
00:57:57,357 --> 00:58:00,760
You have this overarching narrative of the conflict

1161
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,163
between the teams, who's going to win, who's going to lose.

1162
00:58:03,723 --> 00:58:05,905
But then within that, you also have the creation

1163
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:07,167
of very personal narratives.

1164
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:09,148
So you have heroes and villains emerging,

1165
00:58:09,168 --> 00:58:11,070
you have revenge stories emerging,

1166
00:58:11,351 --> 00:58:12,652
you have underdogs that come up.

1167
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:15,993
You have grudges, but all of these individual

1168
00:58:16,053 --> 00:58:19,015
personal stories are taking place within this framework

1169
00:58:19,235 --> 00:58:20,815
of a larger conflict.

1170
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:24,117
And again, although we see it in the real world,

1171
00:58:24,237 --> 00:58:26,858
in sports, it's something that mapped very nicely

1172
00:58:26,898 --> 00:58:28,739
to Mordor and Orc society for us.

1173
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,120
And then.

1174
00:58:33,773 --> 00:58:35,494
Another thing that's really interesting is there's whole

1175
00:58:35,694 --> 00:58:39,575
sections of journalism basically that are dedicated

1176
00:58:40,035 --> 00:58:43,716
to creating and narrativizing and weaving written stories

1177
00:58:43,956 --> 00:58:46,456
out of what is basically statistical analysis.

1178
00:58:47,016 --> 00:58:50,077
People take stats of the results of different players,

1179
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:52,197
different teams, and they'll turn those

1180
00:58:52,257 --> 00:58:53,778
into written narratives that people find

1181
00:58:53,798 --> 00:58:55,958
really emotionally engaging and will follow.

1182
00:58:57,339 --> 00:58:59,240
Everything that we did, even though the underlying

1183
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,402
complexity of the whole system and the Nemesis system

1184
00:59:03,363 --> 00:59:05,624
under the hood is obviously enormously complex,

1185
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:08,386
the way we always wanted to surface that to people

1186
00:59:08,446 --> 00:59:10,868
is in a naturalistic story.

1187
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:13,590
One of the ways we sort of test that ourselves is,

1188
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:16,011
and we did this on Total War as well,

1189
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:17,892
and you also see this on sports games,

1190
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:21,074
is if people are writing stories about our game,

1191
00:59:21,255 --> 00:59:23,836
is the language they're using to express their story

1192
00:59:23,956 --> 00:59:24,897
sound like they're really...

1193
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:26,998
invested in that world.

1194
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,861
And then, we have to speed up a bit,

1195
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:36,183
but war shares a lot of the same structures,

1196
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:40,385
and again, war, like sports, not only creates these stories,

1197
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:44,087
but is very often a reference point for

1198
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,729
for entire genres of fiction.

1199
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:49,790
So we have entire genres of movies around sports,

1200
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:51,111
we obviously have a lot of genres,

1201
00:59:52,112 --> 00:59:53,413
and a lot of films around war,

1202
00:59:53,453 --> 00:59:56,314
because they share those dramatic traits of conflict,

1203
00:59:56,354 --> 01:00:00,877
of escalation towards a epic finale, a personal story.

1204
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:02,638
So, you know, Band of Brothers,

1205
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:07,181
Platoon, within the context of this larger epic conflict.

1206
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:10,082
So games like Civilization are obviously very good

1207
01:00:10,102 --> 01:00:11,984
at simulating these large-scale conflicts,

1208
01:00:12,004 --> 01:00:12,664
but we wanted to see,

1209
01:00:12,684 --> 01:00:13,324
where else can we put...

1210
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:16,025
personal stories and nest them within that,

1211
01:00:16,705 --> 01:00:21,087
and an emphasis on human hierarchies and social structures,

1212
01:00:21,147 --> 01:00:22,627
whether that's generals and troops

1213
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:25,008
in the military hierarchies or sports teams.

1214
01:00:27,288 --> 01:00:30,489
And then just quickly, a couple of specific examples

1215
01:00:30,649 --> 01:00:34,910
of how we use real world references to create stories,

1216
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,651
even going back to Total War,

1217
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:39,811
which was where I was working before Shadow of Mordor.

1218
01:00:41,491 --> 01:00:45,574
People are also very, very keen to project agency

1219
01:00:45,614 --> 01:00:49,376
and project character onto NPCs.

1220
01:00:49,436 --> 01:00:53,479
So by applying traits, personality traits,

1221
01:00:53,539 --> 01:00:54,940
onto our generals and our characters,

1222
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,622
it just changed them from being collections of stats.

1223
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:00,223
into being characters people could relate to.

1224
01:01:00,343 --> 01:01:02,323
And Darkest Dungeons, obviously another game

1225
01:01:02,363 --> 01:01:03,604
that does that extremely well.

1226
01:01:04,384 --> 01:01:05,704
And we tried to do that with our Orcs,

1227
01:01:05,744 --> 01:01:07,365
in particular their hates and fears,

1228
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:09,665
which was simultaneously trying to make them

1229
01:01:09,865 --> 01:01:11,466
do something that George spoke to before

1230
01:01:11,486 --> 01:01:13,026
of differentiating them as enemies

1231
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,047
by making them block your different abilities.

1232
01:01:16,327 --> 01:01:18,547
Our equivalent, we had players spreading fires everywhere,

1233
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,108
so we gave guys that hated fire,

1234
01:01:20,188 --> 01:01:23,289
so now they could block and come back at you as a result

1235
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:24,349
and punish you for doing that.

1236
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:30,412
Another example we had of using sort of a drama mechanic

1237
01:01:31,073 --> 01:01:35,296
in concert with the balancing mechanics was in Rome,

1238
01:01:35,336 --> 01:01:37,778
very often the Roman Empire from the start of the game

1239
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:40,320
would cross the world, start dominating the world,

1240
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,882
and then you'd get to this point in the game,

1241
01:01:41,922 --> 01:01:44,844
we found, where the final stages of a strategy game

1242
01:01:44,884 --> 01:01:46,866
could be relatively boring, mopping up.

1243
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:49,648
So we injected this drama of the civil war.

1244
01:01:49,688 --> 01:01:52,190
At that point, Rome would turn on itself, it would split,

1245
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,672
you'd have all these family dramas and rivalries.

1246
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:59,091
Of course, the big difference with Shadow of Mordor

1247
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:00,691
from big strategy games like Rome

1248
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:03,132
is that we wanted to make it personal.

1249
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:06,073
And as I say, we built it around those principles

1250
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:09,834
that we see in these real world story creating systems

1251
01:02:10,034 --> 01:02:13,355
of sports and warfare, which is basing it around conflict,

1252
01:02:13,815 --> 01:02:15,776
making the time always move forward

1253
01:02:15,796 --> 01:02:17,656
so we can build these personal relationships,

1254
01:02:18,216 --> 01:02:21,697
embracing failure as a chance to create stories.

1255
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:28,203
and also focusing on social structures and human hierarchies.

1256
01:02:28,343 --> 01:02:33,809
And again, we can see that in Jane Austen, we can see it in Mexican prisons, we can see it in sports teams.

1257
01:02:36,484 --> 01:02:39,146
But then the other thing we had to do is figure

1258
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:41,209
how do we surface that to the player?

1259
01:02:41,249 --> 01:02:43,051
How do we narrativize that in a way

1260
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:45,193
that feels really powerfully like a story?

1261
01:02:47,255 --> 01:02:49,878
And that was where we put an enormous amount of emphasis

1262
01:02:50,218 --> 01:02:54,703
in basically the clashes and the showdowns

1263
01:02:54,783 --> 01:02:56,746
and having these guys actually remember you.

1264
01:02:58,427 --> 01:03:00,571
Players are always creating stories in their own heads

1265
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:03,175
and are really willing to have you reinforce

1266
01:03:03,215 --> 01:03:05,118
the meaning of those stories by speaking to them.

1267
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:06,641
If you say, you did this to me,

1268
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:08,483
players are absolutely like, oh my god, I did.

1269
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:09,846
I am the center of the universe.

1270
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,911
Human beings are amazingly egocentric and it's great.

1271
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:17,568
And so, then this was just other examples.

1272
01:03:17,588 --> 01:03:19,688
You know, we were obviously focused on a single player

1273
01:03:19,748 --> 01:03:24,069
action adventure game, but there's so many other games now

1274
01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:26,770
where you see this possibility of people creating narratives

1275
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:28,470
about what they've done within these worlds.

1276
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:30,811
And what's exciting about something like DayZ

1277
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:32,251
is when people write their narratives

1278
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,712
of their game experience, it reads exactly like

1279
01:03:35,452 --> 01:03:38,073
a post-apocalyptic zombie horror.

1280
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:40,173
So the same psychological forces,

1281
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,594
the same stories are getting triggered by the same events.

1282
01:03:43,674 --> 01:03:43,974
And that's...

1283
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:47,838
That takes me to the last slide, which is that Monolith,

1284
01:03:48,238 --> 01:03:50,100
the way we work and our framework,

1285
01:03:50,941 --> 01:03:53,144
is very much represented, you can, in this book,

1286
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:55,406
glue to games, but there's a theory,

1287
01:03:55,466 --> 01:03:57,528
player engagement through need satisfaction,

1288
01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:00,031
which is a theory of player engagement

1289
01:04:00,071 --> 01:04:02,894
based on the psychological self-determination theory.

1290
01:04:03,415 --> 01:04:05,017
And basically what it boils down to,

1291
01:04:05,897 --> 01:04:07,858
is that the things that motivate people

1292
01:04:07,898 --> 01:04:09,759
to keep playing your game are the same things

1293
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:12,520
that motivate people to do things in the rest of their life,

1294
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,401
which is autonomy, people want their decisions

1295
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:18,683
to have the ability to make meaningful decisions,

1296
01:04:19,163 --> 01:04:21,704
competence, people want to learn

1297
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,685
and sometimes they want to feel like they're kicking ass,

1298
01:04:24,405 --> 01:04:27,206
and relatedness, people want to connect

1299
01:04:27,326 --> 01:04:28,487
with other living things.

1300
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:31,809
that emotion actually doesn't really differentiate

1301
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:33,891
very much whether it's an NPC or a human.

1302
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:36,774
You're actually filling the same psychological needs.

1303
01:04:36,854 --> 01:04:39,876
So what we were really doing is looking at the real world

1304
01:04:39,956 --> 01:04:41,938
to inform what we did in the game.

1305
01:04:41,998 --> 01:04:44,460
So strongly recommend glued to games.

1306
01:04:46,121 --> 01:04:49,824
And then see how you can use real world systems like that

1307
01:04:49,864 --> 01:04:52,907
to maybe inform getting players to get invested

1308
01:04:52,947 --> 01:04:54,168
in the stories within your game.

1309
01:04:54,368 --> 01:04:54,668
Thank you.

1310
01:04:54,688 --> 01:04:57,450
Thank you.

1311
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:57,651
Thank you.

1312
01:04:57,671 --> 01:04:57,891
Thank you.

1313
01:04:57,911 --> 01:04:58,351
And we're hiring.

1314
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:01,288
Thank you.

1315
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:03,209
All right.

1316
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,432
So that's Michael DePlater, our final speaker.

1317
01:05:05,452 --> 01:05:05,892
Thank you.

1318
01:05:05,912 --> 01:05:08,975
I know as you're thinking about your own deck of rules

1319
01:05:09,015 --> 01:05:10,757
that you may be building, it's kind of like building

1320
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:11,598
your own magic deck.

1321
01:05:11,998 --> 01:05:14,120
The cards you choose will affect how you develop games,

1322
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,143
and different decks will work differently, better or worse,

1323
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:18,024
in different situations.

1324
01:05:18,384 --> 01:05:20,466
But more important is that the deck you have feels good.

1325
01:05:20,486 --> 01:05:22,188
That's one you enjoy developing with.

1326
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:24,230
So these have been our sessions. There were a lot of

1327
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:26,691
references in this talk. If you want to download the slides,

1328
01:05:26,731 --> 01:05:30,374
they're up at that URL right now. So you can go grab them or

1329
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:32,455
go grab them later. If you go to the writing section on my

1330
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,537
website, you can download these, get all those cool references

1331
01:05:35,497 --> 01:05:38,339
to go do some more research. We're not going to do Q&A, but

1332
01:05:38,379 --> 01:05:41,001
we'll be around for a bit either here or outside in the hallway

1333
01:05:41,061 --> 01:05:43,263
probably because we're a little over time. If you want to come

1334
01:05:43,283 --> 01:05:45,885
talk to one of us, we would love that. That would be fantastic.

1335
01:05:45,945 --> 01:05:48,166
And please remember to fill out your surveys. Thank you for

1336
01:05:48,186 --> 01:05:48,386
coming.
