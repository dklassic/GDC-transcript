1
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:10,761
Hi everyone, thank you so much for being here, because we, honestly, we should all be drinking beer at that time.

2
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:12,982
So I really appreciate you being here.

3
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:17,366
My name is Celia, I've been in this industry for about 10 years now.

4
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:22,089
I've been working at Ubisoft, LucasArts, and I've been at Epic Games for the past four years.

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,852
Before I start, I would like to warmly thank you from the bottom of my heart,

6
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:32,195
because this is the third part of a Gamers Brain Trilogy,

7
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:37,198
and I wouldn't be here without your feedback,

8
00:00:37,478 --> 00:00:38,939
without your encouragement and your support.

9
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:42,361
So I'm really honored to be part of such an amazing community,

10
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:45,063
and that you find my shit interesting.

11
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,304
So thank you very much.

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,094
Alright, um, I'm going to do a quick explanation about cognitive psychology principles and

13
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:59,239
about UX, um, that I talked about in my previous talk, so I'm not going to explain any of this,

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,383
uh, but I just want to make sure that you have the basic understanding so we can be all on the

15
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:05,065
same page if you haven't seen these talks.

16
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:08,783
So what UX is about is all about making sure

17
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:11,204
that your user is going to experience the game

18
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:14,344
the way you, as a designer, as a developer, intended.

19
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:18,025
So you want the image of the system, the game,

20
00:01:18,386 --> 00:01:21,246
to convey truthfully the experience you want to offer.

21
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,827
To do that, we explore how player perceives,

22
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:27,448
interacts with the game, and the satisfaction

23
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,309
and emotions elicited via this interaction.

24
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,210
So UX takes its roots in cognitive science.

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,692
in human factors and in human computer interaction.

26
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:41,114
UX principles rely on cognitive science knowledge.

27
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:43,276
So this is why you need to understand

28
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:45,257
how the brain processes information.

29
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:48,979
Today we're going to look into motivation more specifically,

30
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,121
and motivation is one of the variables

31
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:53,182
influencing information processing.

32
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:59,368
Um, disclaimer, this is highly simplified. The brain is not working like that. It's not in

33
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:04,514
separate buckets. Uh, but it's just a way, uh, for me to communicate about what we're talking

34
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:08,458
about. Uh, making games is very complex and so is the brain. Surprise.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,001
All right, so the main purpose of this talk today

36
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,743
is to understand better the mechanisms of retention.

37
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:18,326
And the reason why we care for free-to-play games

38
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,189
is that to make money, you need to first retain players.

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,011
Paid up-front games also care about retention

40
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:27,612
because players who retain are more

41
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:30,515
likely to convince their friends to buy the game as well.

42
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:33,777
So retention at its core means engagement.

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,341
Also, if you're engaged in an activity as a player,

44
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:39,602
it's more pleasurable.

45
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:42,063
So not only is it good business practice for you,

46
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:46,485
but it's also a good UX practice for the player, or when.

47
00:02:48,326 --> 00:02:50,727
Okay, so the part of UX that is more specifically

48
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:54,228
relevant to retention is what I now call engageability.

49
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,329
So I used to call this part game flow

50
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:59,751
because it's a familiar concept in game development.

51
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:06,009
However, it didn't quite encompass all what's important to engage players and retain them.

52
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,794
This is why I'm now using that weird term that some of my colleagues call bullshit,

53
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:11,835
looking at you Ben.

54
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:17,881
And it's fair because it sounds a bit pompous, but it has the advantage of expressing the

55
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:23,847
ability of a game to be engaging, just like usability is the ability of the game to be

56
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:24,148
used.

57
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,482
don't really like it, so maybe it's gonna be okay.

58
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:31,525
So usability and engageability are not working in silos.

59
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,345
They interact with each other.

60
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:37,087
Just like the brain, there's interaction everywhere,

61
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,269
but we're separating the buckets

62
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:40,789
to make it easier to talk about.

63
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:45,032
All right, so here's how I'm breaking down engageability.

64
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:46,412
These three pillars.

65
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,835
You have motivation, emotion, and game flow.

66
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:56,309
So please note that this is my mapping of how to make games more engaging.

67
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:03,033
It's based on academic research on one hand, and on my own game dev experience with various teams.

68
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:10,237
So motivation is at the origin of all human behavior, and ultimately engagement is all about motivation.

69
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:13,719
Emotion and game flow contribute to motivation.

70
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:19,036
Emotions serve motivation in the sense that they help us choose the right behavior.

71
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:22,900
So if you see something that scares you, you flee.

72
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:28,946
Game flow is a state of deep focus and immersion, which is a concept often used in games.

73
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:31,148
And it's also important for engagement.

74
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:33,654
Alright, a little warning here.

75
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:36,517
This talk is going, I'm going to cover a lot of shit

76
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:37,678
super fast in that talk.

77
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,201
The reason why I'm doing this is,

78
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:41,962
one, you're an expert audience,

79
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:43,424
and you should have a good understanding

80
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:45,826
about a lot of these concepts I'm gonna present here.

81
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:48,909
And two, even though rewards and motivation have very.

82
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:54,690
popular topics at GDC, it's pretty rare to see these topics tackled, um, having a bigger

83
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,452
picture in mind. And this is what I want to do today. I'm giving you the big picture, uh, and

84
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:04,993
I will dive more deeply into a few of these concepts for each pillars, uh, and more

85
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:09,354
specifically regarding motivation. But the idea really, I want you to have the big picture

86
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:16,075
rather than like look just at one thing. Um, but it's going to go fast and, uh, by the way,

87
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,656
these slides are going to be on my blog.

88
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:22,037
this weekend so you don't have to write down everything.

89
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:24,257
You're gonna have all these this weekend.

90
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:28,598
Alright, so motivation is that the origin of any behavior.

91
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:31,039
Without motivation, there is no action.

92
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,640
So it's pretty cool for the survival of organisms

93
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,920
needing movement to survive.

94
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,681
Therefore, it's key to understand

95
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:39,521
where human behavior come from

96
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,862
and by extension to understand what players,

97
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,082
what make players tick.

98
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:47,696
So I'm using a tree here because we often talk about meaningful choices when referring

99
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:52,660
to motivation, and games often have skill trees to offer meaningful choices to players.

100
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:56,740
So motivation is super interesting,

101
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,501
but the problem is that there are a lot

102
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:02,323
of motivational theories in psychology, and I mean a lot.

103
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,104
So this is a Wikipedia screenshot,

104
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,706
and this does not list them all, not even close.

105
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:12,148
So you need to understand this about motivational theories.

106
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:14,850
There are countless theories that have been proposed

107
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,911
to explain human motivation,

108
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,193
but a solid meta-analysis is still missing

109
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:21,494
to make sense of it all.

110
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,269
So remember there is no current consensus,

111
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,371
nor there is a unified theory of human motivation

112
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,092
that can account for all of our drives and behaviors

113
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,432
in a clear mapping.

114
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:34,093
So keep that in mind,

115
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:36,674
because we always talk about one or two

116
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:38,354
motivational theories,

117
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:41,695
but you have to keep in mind that there's a lot out there

118
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:43,376
and there's no consensus at all.

119
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,382
So here's what I propose.

120
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:49,425
This is an attempt to organize human motivation

121
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,147
in a simple mapping, therefore inaccurate

122
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:55,029
because science is complex, but to help game development

123
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:57,051
to, again, help to talk about these things.

124
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:00,113
So here are the four buckets.

125
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:04,237
You have implicit motivation and biological drives.

126
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:07,458
So, basically it's impulses.

127
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,060
You have personality and individual needs.

128
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,661
So you might have heard of one of the personality model which is ocean.

129
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:22,063
Then you have environmental shaped motivation and learned drives.

130
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,181
So basically, it's behaviorism.

131
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:29,145
And the last one that usually people talk about a lot

132
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:33,270
is intrinsic motivation and cognitive needs.

133
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,153
So intrinsic motivation is when you intrinsically

134
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:38,475
want to do something for its own sake

135
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,038
because it's inherently pleasurable to you.

136
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:51,515
Another disclaimer here, SDT is the motivational theory that is usually named here.

137
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:56,900
These are not really separate buckets, again, they are not independent from one another

138
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:02,486
and they are not hierarchical, contrary to what maybe you've heard of Maslow Pyramid,

139
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:07,210
it's called the hierarchy of needs and actually they are not hierarchical.

140
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:12,799
So, I wanted to very briefly introduce the top two, but very, very briefly again just

141
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,602
for you to have a clear mapping of it all.

142
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:20,272
But I'll move on to the two bottom for the sake of time, since these are more particularly

143
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:20,853
relevant to us.

144
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,512
Okay, so biological drives are very basic needs

145
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,993
that we share with other mammals.

146
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,035
For example, hunger, thirst, a need for sleep,

147
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:33,797
pain avoidance, and sex are powerful,

148
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:35,698
innate physiological motives

149
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:37,839
aimed to satisfy our biological drive.

150
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,521
There's other implicit motives

151
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,003
that also can influence our social behavior,

152
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:45,604
which is more relevant to us.

153
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:48,025
Three of these implicit drives

154
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,726
have been more particularly studied.

155
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:55,239
You have the power motive, it's one's motivation to dominate others.

156
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:00,145
You have the achievement motive, it's the motivation to improve on a task.

157
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:04,069
And you have the affiliation motive, it's the motivation for

158
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,632
close and harmonious social relationships.

159
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:13,121
So, depending on how strong these drives are within individuals, they will influence the

160
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:18,166
pleasure we feel from certain situations differently, which in turn will influence our behavior.

161
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:23,250
So not everyone is super excited at the idea of dominating others, for example.

162
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,395
So keep that in mind if you really truly appreciate to dominate and humiliate others, it might

163
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,556
not be the case for everyone.

164
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:30,917
Just a tip.

165
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:33,972
Alright, moving on to the next bucket,

166
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:36,813
I told you I would just describe it very briefly.

167
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:41,175
So generally when you talk about individual differences,

168
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:43,196
we mainly think about personality.

169
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:47,378
So Ocean or Big Five is about personality differences

170
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,699
measured against five traits.

171
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,560
You see these five traits here.

172
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,002
For example, some people who score high in extraversion

173
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:58,903
mean that they are more outgoing

174
00:09:58,983 --> 00:10:00,804
than people who score low on that trait.

175
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:06,782
Ocean model, like all the personality model, has a lot of limitations.

176
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:10,506
First, it's not stable during your lifetime.

177
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:16,512
It means that the personality that you have at 17 years old is not going to be the same

178
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:19,435
personality that you have at 65, for example.

179
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:20,777
So it's not stable over time.

180
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:24,142
Also, it cannot accurately predict behavior.

181
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,308
So it's not because you understand the personality of someone

182
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:30,593
and you have a clear mapping of that personality

183
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,737
that you can predict what that person is going to do.

184
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,889
And lastly, it does not explain all of human personality.

185
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:40,330
However, it's the most robust model we currently have,

186
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,750
and it's certainly interesting to keep it in mind

187
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,451
to account for human motivation.

188
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,891
For example, an individual who scores high in openness

189
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:51,192
might be more motivated to accomplish a creative task

190
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:53,112
than a low score on that trait.

191
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,873
Nikki from Quantic Foundry is using this model

192
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:58,153
to account for gamers' preferences,

193
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,174
so you might have heard of that.

194
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:02,034
All right, moving on.

195
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:06,850
Okay, so this one is really interesting.

196
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,431
The reason is it's video games are,

197
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,032
it's a specific environment

198
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,792
that is shaping players' behavior.

199
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:18,754
So this learn drive bucket is really important for us.

200
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:21,635
And it's mainly about rewards and punishments.

201
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:24,156
So here you are.

202
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:28,057
I'm going to have to describe this a little bit.

203
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:30,398
It's a bit boring, but after that it's going to be better.

204
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:35,581
So, rest means from the environment, the game is the environment, after player's action,

205
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:39,383
the behavior, can either be positive or negative.

206
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,525
When it's positive, it means that we're adding, we're adding something.

207
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,946
The player receives a carrot or is hit by a stick.

208
00:11:47,782 --> 00:11:50,705
When it's negative, it simply means that we subtract

209
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:52,386
something from the environment.

210
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:56,050
We subtract a stick, a stick or a carrot

211
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,972
is removed from players.

212
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:00,714
So depending on how this feedback from the environment

213
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:04,558
is perceived by players, the player's behavior

214
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:07,180
will either increase, be repeated,

215
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:10,063
they're gonna do the action again, or decrease, stop.

216
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:14,709
Here are some examples for the positive reward example.

217
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,192
You kill an enemy, you get a reward.

218
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:20,255
So it feels rewarding, therefore you are likely

219
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:21,797
to do that behavior again.

220
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:26,081
A negative reward example would be you equip a shield on you

221
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,704
and therefore you don't get one shot killed anymore

222
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:31,867
by an enemy, so we remove the pain of dying,

223
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:34,430
therefore you're likely to keep that shield again.

224
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:43,438
Um, a positive punishment would be you tower dive in a MOBA, you die. Uh, so if you

225
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:48,380
understood what happened here, you are likely not doing that behavior again. And a

226
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,282
negative punishment would be you commit toxic behavior in a MOBA. Uh, for example, you

227
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:57,263
get banned from the game. So we remove the game from you.

228
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:00,527
or you did not manage to retrieve your souls

229
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:01,948
and you lose them all.

230
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:05,709
By extension, a negative punishment could happen

231
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:09,330
if you collect, say, 100 flags in Assassin's Creed

232
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,471
and you don't get any meaningful reward for that.

233
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:14,672
So even though it's not really something

234
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:16,652
that will remove some player technically,

235
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,553
if an expected reward doesn't come,

236
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,354
it can be felt as a punishment.

237
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:24,475
So, yeah, I love Ubisoft, but that traumatized me

238
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:27,056
a little bit, getting these flags.

239
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,456
Okay, so this is just a mapping of these rewards and punishments.

240
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,358
Now you have different types of rewards.

241
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,284
Rewards can be given either continuously or intermittently.

242
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:49,509
So continuous rewards is when player action is always rewarded.

243
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:54,153
So that's really important for learning and for game feel, which we're going to talk a

244
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:54,633
little bit later.

245
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:59,300
Intermittent reward is when player action is sometimes rewarded.

246
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:02,703
So that's more important for sustained engagement.

247
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:07,167
So let's dig deeper in this kind, this one,

248
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,208
because it's very frequently used in game.

249
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:10,489
All right.

250
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,433
Rewards can be intermittent, either based on time,

251
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:18,916
it's called interval, or based on player action,

252
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:19,876
it's called ratio.

253
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:24,347
Both of these reward types can be given expectedly,

254
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,210
so at a fixed interval or ratio,

255
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,834
or unexpectedly, at a certain interval or ratio.

256
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:33,257
All right, let's use some examples from games,

257
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:36,140
because I understand it's getting a bit complicated.

258
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:44,163
Okay so this is an example of a fixed interval reward. So in a game like Fortnite when you have

259
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:48,885
daily rewards, like everyday you come back in the game you have a reward that's waiting for you.

260
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:52,866
That's a fixed interval reward. Another example would be in Clash of Clans.

261
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,267
when you're starting building something

262
00:14:55,348 --> 00:14:56,408
or you're waiting for your reward,

263
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,930
you have a clear timer on it.

264
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,751
So you know that after that time,

265
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:02,592
you can come back and collect your reward.

266
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:05,995
So this is good to lure players back in the game.

267
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,315
But once they're here,

268
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,856
you need to have something else from them to do.

269
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:12,239
So either the multiple rewards happening,

270
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,519
so like in Clash of Clans,

271
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,101
or once you're in the game in Fortnite,

272
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,922
you have a quest that's waiting for you

273
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:18,243
or you have a message saying,

274
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:19,383
hey, your friend is playing,

275
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:22,265
do you wanna join him or her in that game?

276
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:25,805
Sometimes it can be a fixed interval

277
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,046
before removing a reward.

278
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:31,007
So this is an example you have in stores.

279
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,988
It could be, you can get that thing,

280
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:35,668
rent it, you pay for it,

281
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:39,309
but it's gonna be removed in whatever, in 24 hours.

282
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,270
So this is creating.

283
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:47,638
uh, I, you know that you're not, uh, gonna have the opportunity to have that, uh, reward

284
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:53,446
at all times, uh, so you, you don't want to see that window of opportunity, uh, closing,

285
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:59,174
so it brings you, motivates you to try to get that thing, uh, before it's gone. Okay.

286
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:07,100
So now a variable interval example would be the cherry bonus in Pac-Man for example.

287
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,223
It comes at a certain time but you don't know exactly when.

288
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,986
You know that it's going to be here at some point but you don't know when.

289
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:19,409
Same thing in MMOs when you know that a certain mob can spawn at a certain place

290
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:22,431
but you don't know exactly when. It's unpredictable.

291
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:26,214
So the reward appears over time unexpectedly.

292
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:30,472
And fixed ratio example.

293
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:34,614
So this is all about when the player is doing

294
00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:36,235
a certain action, certain actions,

295
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:38,736
certain amount of actions.

296
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,877
So quests, for example, skill trees,

297
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:42,817
are example of fixed ratio.

298
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:45,078
You need to do a certain number of actions

299
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,240
before getting the reward or getting the next skill.

300
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:54,366
Progression bars are kind of fixed ratio.

301
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:55,787
It's not exactly fixed.

302
00:16:56,187 --> 00:17:00,309
It's fixed because you have a certain number of points

303
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:02,830
that you need to collect in order to get at the next level.

304
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,851
But the rate at which you're getting these points

305
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,792
is not always predictable.

306
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:10,093
So it's sort of, but not entirely.

307
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,742
And the last one is variable ratio examples.

308
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:14,663
It's of course gambling.

309
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:15,944
Slot machines.

310
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:17,806
You want something valuable to you,

311
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,048
but you never know exactly when you're gonna get it.

312
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:23,352
So it's loot crates, card packs, chests in the world,

313
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:23,912
et cetera.

314
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:26,134
All right, so now that we've seen

315
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:28,597
all of these different types of rewards,

316
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:32,640
let's see how it can differently impact behavior,

317
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,402
how it can impact player action.

318
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:35,683
So.

319
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:41,326
You see that this is how, this is the response rate.

320
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:43,567
So this is all the actions that the player do.

321
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:48,588
If you look at the top left one, it's a fixed interval.

322
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,889
So you know that at some point you're gonna get the reward.

323
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:53,909
So you don't really do anything until you had that window

324
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,450
and then you know that the reward is here.

325
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,230
When the window is open, then you do the action

326
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,631
and as soon as you had the reward,

327
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,851
you stop doing that action until the next time.

328
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,812
So this is what these graphs are saying.

329
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:06,432
So if you look at this.

330
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:14,799
You look at all the fixed type and you see that the behavior pauses after you get the reward.

331
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:21,606
And if the reward stops coming, this is really when you have a fast response extinction.

332
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:27,992
If you look at all the variable wins, they are the most steady response rate

333
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:29,953
because you don't really know when it's going to happen.

334
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:33,030
Now if you look at the ratio one,

335
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,172
when the player needs to do something,

336
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:37,876
it's not just about time you have to do something,

337
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:40,359
it's creating a higher response rate.

338
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,982
And the highest response rate

339
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,785
and the most steady of all is very low ratio.

340
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,171
As you can see, these different types of reward

341
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:53,193
affect player behavior very differently.

342
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:56,675
So when researchers say that extrinsic rewards

343
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,456
can deter intrinsic motivation, yes.

344
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,898
But really, it depends on many things.

345
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:03,739
It depends on the type of reward,

346
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,180
it depends on the context, whether or not

347
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,901
the person was intrinsically motivated

348
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,902
to do the task without consideration

349
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,083
of any rewards to begin with.

350
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:15,767
If the reward is money, or if it's a verbal pat on the back,

351
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:17,869
is it an item that you receive, et cetera.

352
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,173
So it's really hard to anticipate what's going to happen

353
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:24,136
because it depends on so many variables.

354
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,361
Also, usually you see a decrease in intrinsic motivation

355
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:32,563
and behavior when a reward is introduced and then removed.

356
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,644
And that doesn't happen that often in games.

357
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:38,665
So I don't know if you were at the session

358
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:40,766
from Travis Day from Blizzard yesterday,

359
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:43,807
and he mentioned in his super interesting talk

360
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:47,569
that when players reach max level in WoW, for example,

361
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,470
then it seems that the rewards stop arriving

362
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,250
because you reach.

363
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:58,335
the highest uh XP level. The highest level. And so XP don't really matter anymore. But it's

364
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:03,419
not really that rewards stop arriving. Um there's still you know you still receive stuff for

365
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:06,722
doing uh what you're doing. Um but it's more that

366
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:11,996
you have reached an end goal already, the max level,

367
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:14,897
and you might not have another meaningful goal

368
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:15,818
to work towards.

369
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:18,959
So, hence the importance of community events

370
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,820
and new quests and content,

371
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,540
because you always want the player

372
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:25,222
to be looking forward something.

373
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:29,263
This is why rewards are highly related to goals,

374
00:20:29,743 --> 00:20:32,484
and both must be meaningful to keep players engaged,

375
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:35,085
and a reward must be not an end goal,

376
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,727
but it should be a means for the next goal.

377
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,034
Okay, so, these are not mutually exclusive,

378
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:45,915
the list I'm gonna give right now,

379
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,357
and these are really broad guidelines.

380
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:50,019
In practice, like I said, there's a lot of subtleties

381
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:53,843
depending on the context, but consider all rewards

382
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,344
and punishment your game provide,

383
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:56,606
because everything in your game,

384
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,427
all the feedback that's happening in your game

385
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:00,930
are either gonna be perceived as a reward

386
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,851
or as a punishment.

387
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,003
Always give feedback to all player actions.

388
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:07,186
We're gonna talk about that in game feel.

389
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:11,552
But give consistent reward for most meaningful actions.

390
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:15,449
And remember that the more time and effort

391
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,051
it's taking for the player to accomplish a task,

392
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:21,994
the greater the reward is gonna be expected.

393
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,396
And an absence of these rewards

394
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:27,539
will likely be felt as punishments.

395
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,421
Also use rewards at intermittent intervals

396
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,683
for player habit formation and player strategy.

397
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:34,844
You can use rewards at fixed ratio

398
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,586
to create a sense of mastery.

399
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:39,208
You can use rewards at variable ratio

400
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:41,469
for some chests to create excitement.

401
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:44,110
and remember to mix it all.

402
00:21:44,451 --> 00:21:46,354
So this is the reason why it's complicated

403
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:48,057
because there's so many different types

404
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:51,423
and so many different contexts and variables

405
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,246
that are at play here.

406
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:55,610
All right.

407
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,586
So the last bucket, we're gonna talk about

408
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:00,707
intrinsic motivation, about SDT,

409
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:02,589
so self-determination theory,

410
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:05,251
that you probably have heard a lot

411
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:08,093
because there's minimum two talks per GDC,

412
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:10,495
if not more than that, that talk about SDT

413
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:11,416
at some point or another.

414
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,938
So I'm pretty sure that you know what this is.

415
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,801
So you have competence, autonomy, and relatedness.

416
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,964
Intrinsic motivation is all about the need.

417
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:26,641
for these three things. So competence is about a sense of progression, a sense of being in control,

418
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:32,402
autonomy is a sense of volition, having meaningful choices and being able to express yourself.

419
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:37,064
And relatedness is a sense of meaningful social relationships,

420
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:39,905
either through cooperation or competition.

421
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:45,462
And when we talk about undermining effect of intrinsic reward,

422
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:49,666
it can take place when they thwart more and more of these three needs.

423
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:54,210
So this is why, for example, we give the illusion of control to gamblers,

424
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,232
so they can feel a sense of autonomy,

425
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,355
even though the outcome is ultimately completely random.

426
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:07,462
So the thing with SDT is it alone cannot account for all

427
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:08,343
human behavior.

428
00:23:08,963 --> 00:23:11,405
You have to take behaviorism and individual needs and

429
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:12,645
drives into account.

430
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:16,448
Undermining effect of intrinsic reward on intrinsic

431
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:18,369
motivation depends on the context.

432
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:24,412
Some self-determination theories moved away from the intrinsic-extrinsic motivation dichotomy

433
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:32,197
and talk, um, now they talk instead about, they have a focus on distinction between autonomous and controlled motivation

434
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,200
which, uh, with different types of reward. So I'm going to talk about that right after.

435
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,663
Um, but ultimately it depends like how you perceive, how...

436
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:42,924
Ultimately what the reward is going to be,

437
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:45,426
if it's going to be more intrinsic, more extrinsic,

438
00:23:45,486 --> 00:23:47,607
controlling or not controlling,

439
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:49,989
really depends on how the player is going to perceive it.

440
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:53,071
And the most important thing you need to remember

441
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:56,553
is goals and rewards must be meaningful to players.

442
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:03,397
So the autonomous versus control rewards.

443
00:24:03,757 --> 00:24:06,719
So you can have different types of rewards

444
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,021
that are either controlling or felt as more autonomous.

445
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:13,975
Let's see the different types of rewards.

446
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:16,656
See, there's a lot of different types.

447
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:20,038
You have one, the non-contingent rewards.

448
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:22,079
So these rewards are not related

449
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:24,580
to any particular behavior from the player.

450
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,842
So you have a surprise gift just because

451
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:29,883
the player did not do anything to get a reward.

452
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:33,012
Now, you also have task contingent rewards.

453
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,653
These are the rewards that you get for doing something.

454
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:40,736
So either you get a reward for engage in an activity.

455
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:42,336
For example, you're in the world,

456
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:44,317
you just accepted a quest or whatever,

457
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:46,038
and you find stuff in the world

458
00:24:46,058 --> 00:24:48,179
that's rewarding your engagement.

459
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:51,130
They can be rewarding completion.

460
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,851
You have to finish a mission to complete a mission

461
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:55,172
before getting a reward.

462
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:57,913
Or they can reward performance.

463
00:24:57,933 --> 00:24:59,453
So you have to complete a mission,

464
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:01,214
but you get a different reward

465
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,336
depending on how well you completed the mission.

466
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:06,897
So this is an example with the stars.

467
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:09,178
You have to have a high performance

468
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:10,478
to get all the three stars.

469
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,379
Otherwise, you get less stars.

470
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,680
So the...

471
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:23,118
Performance contingent rewards that are given specifically for matching some standard of

472
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:28,345
excellence are likely to be experienced as the most controlling because you really have

473
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:32,571
to perform something at a certain level to get the reward.

474
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:38,820
However, since they also can act as a feedback on competence and give you a powerful sense

475
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:46,044
of mastery, the negative effect of the control can be counteracted by the expression of a

476
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,966
sense of progression, when there is such progression.

477
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:55,910
So, in the end, rewards that are task contingent but simply given for completing a task might

478
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:01,292
be felt as less controlling on one hand, but they also do not offer any perceived increase

479
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:05,594
of competence and could therefore ultimately be the worst kind of all as far as intrinsic

480
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:06,435
motivation is concerned.

481
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:10,518
So this is just an illustration that it's complicated

482
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:12,778
and not easily predictable.

483
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:14,419
There's a lot of stuff happening

484
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:16,699
and it's really not easy to have

485
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:17,879
a clear understanding of it all.

486
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,440
You need to have all these clear mapping in your head

487
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,241
and there's no just one recipe that you can apply everywhere.

488
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:31,382
So try to make sure that the incentives are not trying to,

489
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:32,903
well at least make sure that the player

490
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:36,303
doesn't feel controlled by these incentives.

491
00:26:37,257 --> 00:26:41,358
Which is not easy to do, but anyway.

492
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:43,278
Swimming in rewards.

493
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:45,959
Again, Travis Day yesterday mentioned

494
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:48,319
that making players swim in rewards,

495
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:51,460
being generous with them and give them a lot of rewards

496
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,141
was increasing engagement.

497
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,761
Which I totally agree.

498
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,882
Like he was taking the example of Diablo III

499
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:01,183
and they were seeing that if they're giving more rewards,

500
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:02,943
players were actually more excited

501
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,464
and felt more rewarded and were engaging more.

502
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:06,965
I totally agree with that.

503
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,326
The problem is it's only if these rewards

504
00:27:10,386 --> 00:27:12,447
have a meaningful value for players.

505
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,048
So I'm gonna take the example from Paragon here.

506
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17,009
And you're gonna see what's happening

507
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,750
after the first match that you play.

508
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,410
So it's a batch against bots.

509
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:23,712
And you get a bunch of reward after your first game.

510
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:24,372
It looks like that.

511
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:45,217
All right, so you saw here that the rewards are flowing.

512
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:50,358
So the intent was to make the player feel rewarded.

513
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,538
But the problem is that the player at some point

514
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:54,618
is just dismissing all these rewards.

515
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:58,239
So it could actually be perceived as more punishing

516
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,020
or overwhelming than truly rewarding.

517
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,440
Because at that point, the player doesn't know

518
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,100
what all these rewards are for.

519
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,421
It doesn't have the need for looking into these rewards.

520
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:11,001
It doesn't understand the value of these rewards yet.

521
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:15,002
So it can be really tricky to do that.

522
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:16,643
You have to make sure that the rewards

523
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:17,803
are meaningful to the player,

524
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:19,563
because if you receive all these rewards,

525
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:22,804
it can be a bit, it can rise as anxiety,

526
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:24,465
because you can feel like, oh shit,

527
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:26,665
I have to learn all that stuff at some point,

528
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:28,686
and what it means, and what I can use them for.

529
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,426
So you have to be careful with that,

530
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:32,206
because giving a lot of rewards, it's cool,

531
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:35,407
only if players understand what they're for.

532
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:42,840
So show the lock, show the purpose, show the goal before giving them a key or giving them

533
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,702
rewards which are means to an end.

534
00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:54,929
Okay, so just to wrap up this part because I know it's a big part and I apologize to go

535
00:28:55,049 --> 00:29:01,213
through that very quickly but again I really want you to have a big picture of it. So

536
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:03,014
remember you have to give clear goals. So

537
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:08,159
yeah short term, mid term and long term, it's really important.

538
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,470
Offer non-controlling rewards that give feedback on player competence.

539
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,892
Goals and rewards must be meaningful,

540
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,492
which means that players must understand

541
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:22,394
their sense of purpose, value, and impact for the game.

542
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,215
And receiving a key reward should not be perceived

543
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:30,677
as an ending point, but as a starting point for a new goal.

544
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:32,037
So this is really important.

545
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:34,158
If you're receiving a reward and it's the end of it,

546
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,899
then you don't need to engage anymore.

547
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,480
The reward must be perceived that you get something

548
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,421
and with that you're gonna do something else.

549
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:48,949
So meaning can also be a sense of purpose

550
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:50,629
greater than the self.

551
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,672
And this is why being a part of guilds or factions,

552
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,453
it's really highly meaningful.

553
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:00,114
So in For Honor, for example, you have

554
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:03,056
a faction war that's persistent, cross-platform,

555
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,818
that's a conflict between knights, vikings, and samurai,

556
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,839
and you're part of one of these factions,

557
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,441
so whatever you do in the game,

558
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:11,602
it's not only just gonna impact you,

559
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:12,923
but it's gonna impact your faction,

560
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:15,725
so it's a meaning that's greater than just yourself.

561
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:18,567
Same thing in Pokemon, you have the different teams.

562
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:21,930
There's another game that maybe you played.

563
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,430
It's called Noby Noby Boy.

564
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,731
So in that game, the player controls the character

565
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:29,792
called Boy, and you have to stretch

566
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:31,113
his body on the planet.

567
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:35,034
And the player accumulates points by how much they stretch

568
00:30:35,114 --> 00:30:36,334
Boy during gameplay.

569
00:30:36,775 --> 00:30:38,775
And these points that the players earn at the end

570
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:42,616
can be submitted online to Girl, another character that

571
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:43,737
goes out of space.

572
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:45,918
The points submitted online by players.

573
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,261
to girl are added cumulatively across all players,

574
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:52,383
causing girl to stretch into the Milky Way.

575
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:54,224
So girl starts on Earth,

576
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:56,406
and the more players are doing their stuff

577
00:30:56,466 --> 00:30:59,269
and winning in their own games, it's growing girl.

578
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:01,871
And it took, for example, seven years

579
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:06,875
for Toonobi players to make girl reach Pluto together.

580
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:08,717
So that, again, is another example

581
00:31:09,097 --> 00:31:10,678
than whatever you do in the game

582
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:13,601
as a meaning that is greater than yourself.

583
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:22,936
All right, so you need to consider motivation as a whole,

584
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:26,397
with all its complexity, to maybe be able to anticipate

585
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,878
your player's behavior and projected engagement.

586
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,799
So please, if you hear a simplistic,

587
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:34,120
one-fits-all solution about motivation, be dubious.

588
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:40,245
Yes it might sound seducing to get a magic peel to solve all of your problems, but it doesn't

589
00:31:40,286 --> 00:31:45,790
work that way and ultimately it could mislead you if you don't consider all the complexities of

590
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:55,199
human motivation. Yes I know it sucks, but it's the way it is. It's complicated. Okay, um,

591
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,677
So now I'm going to briefly talk about motivation and game flow.

592
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:01,281
As I said earlier, these both elements

593
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,384
are contributing to motivation.

594
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:05,507
So emotion serves motivation.

595
00:32:05,627 --> 00:32:09,051
When you detect a danger, you feel an emotion, fear,

596
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:11,374
and that gets you to run away.

597
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:18,930
Like you know, I'm sure emotions are critical to learning and survival because they guide

598
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:23,772
us through our interaction with the environment as we seek pleasure and avoid pain.

599
00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:26,813
But emotion is also influenced by cognition.

600
00:32:27,394 --> 00:32:33,916
So top-down processing involving prior knowledge, expectation, and judgment, like appraisal

601
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:39,398
of a situation, is changing the way the emotions are going to feel.

602
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:41,888
That's why presentation is important.

603
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:44,910
If something looks good, that is a nice bottle of champagne,

604
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:48,913
you expect to have pleasure, and indeed you're going to get greater pleasure

605
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:54,337
by drinking from that bottle of champagne rather than drinking from one that doesn't look as good.

606
00:32:55,377 --> 00:32:59,780
So this is how your cognition, your expectation, your prior knowledge

607
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,523
is going to impact what you feel about something.

608
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:06,145
It's going to impact your emotion.

609
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,692
Similarly, if you experience something frustrating

610
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:12,594
in a game, for example, such as losing a PvP match,

611
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:14,495
you might attribute your frustration

612
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:17,837
not to just the outcome of the match,

613
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:20,919
but to the whole experience, to the whole gameplay.

614
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:24,761
So you have to be careful with frustration to the players

615
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:28,183
because they can generalize what they feel,

616
00:33:28,904 --> 00:33:31,405
but not to just the element that made them felt that way,

617
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:32,806
but to the whole experience.

618
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:36,878
And so that's the appraisal of a situation.

619
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:39,622
And the interesting thing is what we call reappraisal.

620
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:43,488
So appraisal can modify how we feel about a situation.

621
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:47,173
Helping players to reappraise their cognitive feelings

622
00:33:47,554 --> 00:33:48,776
might also have some benefits.

623
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:51,978
So for example, instead of letting them feel bad

624
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:54,679
as they see in big red letters that their team has lost

625
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,900
and that they suck, you could instead emphasize

626
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,881
that they did better than the winning team in some metrics

627
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:03,082
or that despite losing, they have improved

628
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:05,083
on some of their personal metrics.

629
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,524
Overwatch is an example that is particularly good at that.

630
00:34:09,144 --> 00:34:11,825
And whenever you finish a match, you see all...

631
00:34:13,957 --> 00:34:15,478
whether you win or you lose.

632
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:18,881
I tried to lose before going to GDC and get the picture.

633
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:19,721
I couldn't lose.

634
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:20,842
But anyway, it's...

635
00:34:23,984 --> 00:34:26,366
But you see the same screen.

636
00:34:27,046 --> 00:34:29,148
You see all these badges that you get,

637
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:30,669
whether you win or you lose.

638
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:35,172
And it's telling you whether you beat your career average

639
00:34:35,892 --> 00:34:38,214
on different metrics such as number of kills,

640
00:34:38,254 --> 00:34:39,134
like here, elimination.

641
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:46,861
time stayed on the objective area, healing that you did, weapon accuracy, etc. So this is

642
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:53,346
helping you even if you lost and you feel bad, what makes you reappraise that negative

643
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:58,850
feelings to look at, oh, okay, it was not all bad. At least, you know, I did that stuff good

644
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,371
and oh, I'm getting better at this.

645
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:03,814
So think about ways to do that because in multiplayer games,

646
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:06,996
there's usually half of the players that feel miserable at the end of a match.

647
00:35:07,276 --> 00:35:11,599
So if you find a way to make them reappraise their judgment of their negative feeling,

648
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:12,520
it's really all win.

649
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:18,110
Okay, so in games, in game design,

650
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,492
usually when we talk about emotion,

651
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:21,694
we talk about two things.

652
00:35:22,174 --> 00:35:23,256
We talk about game feel,

653
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:27,521
so how it feels to interact with the game.

654
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:29,022
And when we talk about that,

655
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:31,145
we mainly talk about the three Cs,

656
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:32,046
so character,

657
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:36,107
control, camera, we talk about presence,

658
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:40,569
as the presence experience when players have the illusion that there's nothing

659
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:44,691
in between them and their virtual world when they perceive that there is

660
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,732
simply inside the game without mediation,

661
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:51,274
about physical reality, so it's all about

662
00:35:52,854 --> 00:35:56,916
it means it seems real when you shoot on something because you

663
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:01,518
have particle effect or you have like some some visual effect and sound effect and it feels real.

664
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:07,133
So all of that contributes to the player to feel emotions when they play.

665
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:12,979
So it's a big bucket and that's the reason why I'm not going to really talk about it,

666
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,901
but it's really, really important.

667
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:18,865
The other one is all about bringing discoveries.

668
00:36:19,465 --> 00:36:25,806
bringing surprises because this is going to impact the level of engagement and awareness.

669
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:33,108
The brain usually is, when we see something surprising, it's going to wake us all up because

670
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:33,988
it might be dangerous.

671
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:39,730
So just overall, this is helping awareness to have surprises.

672
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,370
It's not everything all the same.

673
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:47,500
So just to illustrate game feel a little bit,

674
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:52,121
this is why our direction, animation, music, sound

675
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:54,261
effects, all that is really, truly important

676
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:57,342
because it's going to make the game feel

677
00:36:57,702 --> 00:36:58,983
good to interact with.

678
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:03,143
And so in Fortnite, what we do when you open card packs,

679
00:37:03,424 --> 00:37:04,804
we actually, it doesn't look like card packs,

680
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:07,064
it looks like a piñata, which is really

681
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,385
close to the environment, the game world.

682
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:12,186
And you don't just click on something.

683
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:13,426
You have a stick or a.

684
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:20,208
uh, sword in that case, to bid the f- shit out of it. Uh, so it's really compelling, uh, you really, you

685
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:24,689
really feel that you're gonna do something interesting. Um, I'm gonna show a vi- show you a

686
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:31,491
video of that, and you're gonna see that, uh, the- the eye of the piñata, as, uh, of the llama is

687
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:38,093
actually following the mouse, and as soon as you click on the button to, uh, to, like, hit it, uh,

688
00:37:38,253 --> 00:37:39,634
the eyes are retracting.

689
00:37:42,454 --> 00:37:43,455
It's a lovely day for loot.

690
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,381
Have at it.

691
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:53,949
Oh, I am feeling lucky.

692
00:37:57,616 --> 00:37:59,519
Hey, check out this nice loot.

693
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:15,988
Super loud. And so what you saw here is that it's sort of the red circle by the way, it's eye

694
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:21,733
tracking. That's where the players are looking at. It's really making this part of the game like a

695
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:25,516
toy within the game itself. So it's helping game feel.

696
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:29,217
Also, just like the lever and slot machines,

697
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:31,779
it gives you the illusion of control to open a pack.

698
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,461
So we would see players trying to hit the limelight

699
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:37,243
in a certain way because they might believe

700
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:39,344
that they're gonna get an upgrade if they do that.

701
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:42,327
They don't, but they believe they do,

702
00:38:42,427 --> 00:38:44,188
and this is giving you the illusion of control,

703
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:46,450
which brings you some autonomy,

704
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,391
and it's good for intrinsic motivation.

705
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:53,436
Alright, here's another example of game feel.

706
00:38:54,237 --> 00:38:57,018
So in Fortnite, it's an action building game

707
00:38:57,078 --> 00:39:01,760
and you need to harvest a lot of stuff to build later on.

708
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,181
There's a lot of RPG mechanics in that game.

709
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:07,082
And so you spend a good amount of time

710
00:39:07,202 --> 00:39:08,223
harvesting in the world,

711
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:10,324
especially if you're the outlander,

712
00:39:10,384 --> 00:39:12,425
which is the hero that goes out to harvest everything.

713
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:19,113
And when you harvest, we actually have, again, a mini game when you harvest.

714
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:22,436
And you're going to see that you have a little blue target.

715
00:39:23,437 --> 00:39:24,337
It's called a weak point.

716
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:29,702
And if you hit that weak point, it's actually harvesting faster the item.

717
00:39:29,962 --> 00:39:32,464
And it's also, each time you hit one of these targets,

718
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:34,626
you hear a very nice, rewarding sound.

719
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:35,947
And it goes up in tone.

720
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,108
So it's been doo-doo-doo-doo.

721
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:39,970
We're not going to be able to hear it that well, but it looks like that.

722
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:52,276
The sound is not great because all these videos are coming from playtests, so it's pretty

723
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:55,118
compressed and the sound is not terrible.

724
00:39:55,198 --> 00:39:59,981
But this is giving you an idea of when you harvest, you have the mini-game that's included

725
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:00,221
in there.

726
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:10,536
An example of surprise, so in Fortnite you wander around in the game, in the world,

727
00:40:10,956 --> 00:40:14,219
and you sometimes find some chests and it's always pretty exciting.

728
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,984
But at some point in the game, it's fairly late in the game, this is what can happen.

729
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:29,311
Not a chest!

730
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:43,274
So the first time that happens to a player,

731
00:40:43,594 --> 00:40:44,815
they're usually pretty surprised,

732
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:45,416
you know, they're like,

733
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:46,837
oh okay, what am I gonna get in loot?

734
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:47,877
They sometimes, you know, like,

735
00:40:48,138 --> 00:40:51,080
take a sip on their, whatever stuff they're drinking,

736
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,682
and then there's, oh no, it's actually an anatomy,

737
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,823
and they need to do something about it.

738
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,504
That makes them feel that, actually,

739
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:00,046
they cannot take everything from Fortnite,

740
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:02,668
and so it's raising their awareness.

741
00:41:03,188 --> 00:41:05,530
So, surprise like that only work once,

742
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,592
but you can do that across different stuff in the game.

743
00:41:10,782 --> 00:41:12,102
All right, that's all for emotion,

744
00:41:12,182 --> 00:41:13,223
I told you it would go fast.

745
00:41:14,143 --> 00:41:15,624
Let's look at game flow.

746
00:41:17,165 --> 00:41:19,506
Game flow is all about putting the player in the zone

747
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:22,107
where it's not too easy, not too difficult.

748
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:24,688
I'm sure you know that already,

749
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,009
so I'm not gonna describe this in detail,

750
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,471
but there are three components to game flow

751
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:31,431
that are really important.

752
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:33,812
So the first one is difficulty curve.

753
00:41:35,153 --> 00:41:37,938
You want to make sure that the challenge is not too easy, not too difficult.

754
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,542
It's all about pacing as well.

755
00:41:41,143 --> 00:41:45,089
You want the rhythm of the game not to be, the pressure not to be too strong,

756
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,114
and the stress not too strong, not too low.

757
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:50,796
And it's all about the learning curve.

758
00:41:51,096 --> 00:41:52,938
So learning curve is really, really important.

759
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,039
It's all about onboarding.

760
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:57,321
You want to onboard the player in a meaningful way.

761
00:41:58,102 --> 00:41:59,923
You want to distribute learning over time.

762
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:04,086
It's not too compacted, everything at the beginning.

763
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:07,048
I had a whole talk last year about onboarding,

764
00:42:07,088 --> 00:42:08,449
so I'm not gonna talk too much about it,

765
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:09,610
but it's really, really critical.

766
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,003
And so you know, I'm pretty sure you've seen

767
00:42:14,043 --> 00:42:15,523
that graph many times.

768
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:17,744
But one thing I want to emphasize here

769
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:20,324
is you don't have, like in the flow zone,

770
00:42:20,364 --> 00:42:21,524
it's not a straight line.

771
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:24,945
Because if the challenge increases at the same time

772
00:42:25,145 --> 00:42:29,486
as the player mastery is increasing as well,

773
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,987
it never feels that you're getting better.

774
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:35,167
Because if it's really growing in a straight line,

775
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:36,448
it's not working that well.

776
00:42:37,028 --> 00:42:44,098
So you need to have some times when you feel extra challenged and sometimes that you feel like super powerful and you're destroying everybody

777
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:50,547
So that's the reason why it goes in waves and it's not a straight line. So you need to approach game flow like a

778
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:54,372
Wave you need to think about it as a sawtooth

779
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:58,036
difficulty progression, as game designers call it,

780
00:42:58,496 --> 00:43:00,638
and to create situations where old ability

781
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,099
can be compared to new ability.

782
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,382
It makes a player realize that progress was made.

783
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,224
It makes them feel competent,

784
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:08,665
and it's really important for motivation.

785
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,268
Here's an example from Shadow of Mordor.

786
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,212
So you have these nasty Uruks, captains,

787
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,133
that are pretty difficult to beat at the beginning,

788
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:18,815
and actually most of the time,

789
00:43:19,075 --> 00:43:20,316
they're the ones who will kill you.

790
00:43:20,937 --> 00:43:23,721
but had all that nemesis system that you can remember.

791
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:26,145
You can see clearly who killed you.

792
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:31,292
It's not great for reprisal of feelings

793
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,936
because they're all like boasting that they killed you

794
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:35,258
and they're like, hey, you suck.

795
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,641
But on the other hand, at some point, you're getting super powerful and you can kill these

796
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:46,823
motherfuckers. And then it feels really, yeah, this is really how it felt when I played that

797
00:43:46,863 --> 00:43:53,026
game. And it's really compelling because you remember how difficult it was to kill them. So

798
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:57,928
now clearly you've become super powerful. And at some point you can even control their

799
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,889
minds. So anyway.

800
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:02,690
You got that.

801
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:06,013
So you really need to give players a reference point

802
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:07,814
to make them feel their growth.

803
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:10,536
Because if it's growing always at the same level,

804
00:44:10,616 --> 00:44:12,858
you're never gonna feel extra powerful at some point.

805
00:44:12,878 --> 00:44:14,960
So you need to have that sawtooth challenge.

806
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:26,586
Pacing. Pacing is all about stress. You need stress. Stress is important. If there's no stress at all, it's not meaningful.

807
00:44:26,606 --> 00:44:31,491
You're not willing to learn about anything. You're not willing to pay attention to anything if you don't have any stress.

808
00:44:32,692 --> 00:44:35,875
So the problem is that if it's too stressful,

809
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:37,337
if a situation is too stressful,

810
00:44:38,638 --> 00:44:41,421
you might be less efficient because you're losing your shit

811
00:44:42,442 --> 00:44:44,003
because it's so overwhelming

812
00:44:44,204 --> 00:44:46,926
and so it impacts your feel of competence.

813
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:49,609
So you need to find the nice balance,

814
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:50,970
all about balance in games,

815
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,574
not too stressful but not low on stress either.

816
00:44:56,423 --> 00:45:00,306
To do that, for example, in Fortnite, the first time that you actually, after the introduction,

817
00:45:00,346 --> 00:45:05,310
the first time that you can play the game, we place you in a situation where it's a little

818
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,833
bit stressful because enemies are just spawning right away.

819
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:13,137
So you don't have to, you know, you can't just like hang out like that.

820
00:45:13,957 --> 00:45:14,618
Enemies are here.

821
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:19,221
However, they are behind a low wall, so they can't really get at you right away.

822
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:21,744
So you have a little bit of pressure, but it's not too much.

823
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:42,320
You see that?

824
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:42,640
No, you don't.

825
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:43,401
Yeah.

826
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:43,541
Yeah.

827
00:45:43,661 --> 00:45:43,761
Yeah.

828
00:45:43,781 --> 00:45:43,901
Yeah.

829
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:44,322
Yeah.

830
00:45:44,962 --> 00:45:45,984
Yeah.

831
00:45:46,384 --> 00:45:47,205
Yeah.

832
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:47,445
Yeah.

833
00:45:47,465 --> 00:45:47,746
Yeah.

834
00:45:48,066 --> 00:45:48,627
Yeah.

835
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:49,528
Yeah.

836
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,008
Yeah.

837
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:50,429
Yeah.

838
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:51,710
All right.

839
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,871
So you get the idea.

840
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:56,335
So you really need a little bit of pressure, but not too much.

841
00:45:57,598 --> 00:46:00,639
Another example in this one, we're now going to talk about onboarding.

842
00:46:00,979 --> 00:46:03,260
Okay, I'm going to talk a little bit about it, but not too much, I promise.

843
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,801
But it's really important because if you don't onboard the player well,

844
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:11,062
if the tutorials are not made properly,

845
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:13,142
then the player is not going to feel competent

846
00:46:13,182 --> 00:46:14,723
because he's going to get his ass killed.

847
00:46:15,883 --> 00:46:19,284
So you want to make sure that this matters way more than you think.

848
00:46:19,784 --> 00:46:20,024
And, um...

849
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:24,847
When we look at the analytics in Paragon,

850
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:28,150
we show that the most impactful factors for churn

851
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,612
were related to actually lack of competence.

852
00:46:30,912 --> 00:46:32,934
Like people dying from towers, for example,

853
00:46:32,994 --> 00:46:36,417
or not equipping cards were the most impactful factors

854
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:38,058
correlated with churning early.

855
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:41,281
So we would see in playtests a lot of core players

856
00:46:41,681 --> 00:46:42,942
that would tower dive.

857
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:44,664
So it looked like that.

858
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:55,572
Time for a good old DU front A

859
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:56,714
Time for a good old DU front A Take that toward the stop

860
00:46:56,735 --> 00:46:57,476
Take that toward the stop

861
00:46:57,556 --> 00:46:58,098
Take that toward the stop

862
00:46:58,118 --> 00:46:58,639
Take that toward the stop

863
00:46:58,659 --> 00:46:59,160
Take that toward the stop

864
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,681
Take that toward the stop

865
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:01,566
Take that toward the stop

866
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:02,107
Take that toward the stop

867
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:02,688
Take that toward the stop

868
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:03,250
Take that toward the stop

869
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,831
Take that toward the stop

870
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:13,405
So I don't know if you know that, in a MOBA, you need to destroy towers, but the towers,

871
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:18,046
you're going to get aggro from the towers if you don't let minions get in first, or

872
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:25,229
if you're trying to destroy the tower to actually try to aim at some enemies while within the

873
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:29,610
radius of the tower, then you get the aggro to you. And this is something that would happen

874
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,752
over and over and over again. We had players that were core players that would do these

875
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:37,493
things because they didn't know exactly all these rules, the tower aggro rules.

876
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:41,715
So what we did later on is we had a tutorial level

877
00:47:42,035 --> 00:47:44,717
where we teach a little bit about the towers

878
00:47:44,757 --> 00:47:47,179
and tower agro, and once we did that,

879
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:49,900
we saw that retention got a little bit higher.

880
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:51,621
So it's really, really important,

881
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,883
and this is where the top five issues

882
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:55,164
that we saw in UX testing,

883
00:47:55,184 --> 00:47:57,185
so it was all about understanding the game,

884
00:47:57,505 --> 00:47:59,546
all about you being competent in the game.

885
00:47:59,806 --> 00:48:01,588
These were actually, months before launch,

886
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,809
were identified as later on

887
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:06,731
as the most impactful factors for churning.

888
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:10,856
So keep that in mind, like it's really important to nail your tutorials.

889
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:17,085
Alright, yeah, that was the game flow part.

890
00:48:17,485 --> 00:48:20,630
So this is all that we saw today, I'm going to wrap this up really quickly.

891
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:23,509
I'm going to try to at least.

892
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:28,273
So retention, engageability, is all about motivation,

893
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:33,037
which entails managing goals, so quests, events, and rewards.

894
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,038
But not only.

895
00:48:34,618 --> 00:48:37,441
Motivation has a lot to do with moment-to-moment emotions.

896
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,123
So this is all about game feel and surprises.

897
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:43,125
It's also mostly about feeling competent

898
00:48:43,986 --> 00:48:46,268
and feeling a sense of growing mastery.

899
00:48:46,668 --> 00:48:48,970
So game flow, and especially onboarding,

900
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,071
is really paramount.

901
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:56,112
And for all these things, usability has actually a critical impact on all of the above.

902
00:48:57,032 --> 00:49:00,594
Because it impacts the level of friction and the sense of being in control.

903
00:49:01,094 --> 00:49:05,976
If you have too many usability issues, it's likely that players are not going to feel any sense of mastery.

904
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:09,018
If they don't understand the value of certain rewards,

905
00:49:09,198 --> 00:49:10,639
they actually don't even see,

906
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:12,340
perceive that they're receiving a reward.

907
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,981
They don't see that there's a new goal,

908
00:49:15,241 --> 00:49:17,723
or they don't understand why they need to do whatever,

909
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:20,405
it's certainly not gonna help their motivation.

910
00:49:20,785 --> 00:49:22,746
So please do not neglect usability,

911
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:25,027
because usually a lot of problems are actually there.

912
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:30,011
It's not that there's motivation design missing,

913
00:49:30,091 --> 00:49:31,992
it's that the players don't understand it.

914
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:34,473
So it's really critical to engagement too.

915
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:39,198
And if you, I don't know if you noticed,

916
00:49:39,238 --> 00:49:43,501
but the commanding lady here is you always have to think

917
00:49:43,562 --> 00:49:46,003
about what is the meaning for players?

918
00:49:46,344 --> 00:49:48,445
Like really, truly there's one thing to remember

919
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,887
is always think about the meaning for the players.

920
00:49:51,307 --> 00:49:53,129
Why would they care about your goals

921
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:54,049
that you're setting for them?

922
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,791
What would they care about that reward

923
00:49:55,811 --> 00:49:57,012
that you're giving them?

924
00:49:57,532 --> 00:49:58,933
Is there a purpose for them to get it?

925
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,895
Do they understand the value to get it?

926
00:50:02,897 --> 00:50:05,698
So let me take one last example to illustrate this.

927
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:09,559
And it's also illustrating how to find out

928
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:10,679
what's going on in your game.

929
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:14,080
So when you identify an issue in your game,

930
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,662
for example, when you're designed for the loot,

931
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:19,942
all the nice math that you're doing,

932
00:50:19,962 --> 00:50:21,743
it's actually not really perceived

933
00:50:21,763 --> 00:50:23,764
the way you intended by the players

934
00:50:23,804 --> 00:50:27,285
because when they say about how they felt about the loot,

935
00:50:27,385 --> 00:50:28,805
if it was compelling or not compelling,

936
00:50:29,385 --> 00:50:31,826
it's not necessarily working the way you intended.

937
00:50:32,226 --> 00:50:32,366
So.

938
00:50:33,287 --> 00:50:37,149
a few things can happen here. You have three main possibilities. Either something is

939
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:41,212
missing in the design. Uh one system has not been implemented yet so it's fucking

940
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:46,575
everything else. The balance is off etc. Um so this is when it's difficult because until

941
00:50:46,615 --> 00:50:49,297
the system is here you can't really see how players react.

942
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:52,999
Or it could be here, but it's not yet balanced well.

943
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,401
The last possibility is the systems are all in well-balanced,

944
00:50:57,682 --> 00:50:59,843
but they're not conveyed properly to the players.

945
00:50:59,903 --> 00:51:02,704
So they cannot really perceive the true value of it.

946
00:51:03,225 --> 00:51:06,006
And so when that happens, you need to figure out what's going on

947
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:08,508
and where is the problem coming from.

948
00:51:09,707 --> 00:51:15,569
Do you remember when I was talking about the mini game when you harvest and you hit these little weak points?

949
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:20,750
Actually, I'm going to talk about that first. So in Fortnite we have a

950
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,811
One of the feedback that we get from players and they feel that it's too grindy

951
00:51:26,952 --> 00:51:34,133
You have to harvest all in Fortnite, but they really have that strong feeling that it's taking too much to grind to get all the stuff etc

952
00:51:34,914 --> 00:51:37,374
And if you look at just the signs and feedback,

953
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:41,435
when you harvest, you see that each time you hit something,

954
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:42,435
like a car for example,

955
00:51:42,855 --> 00:51:45,236
you see that there's one material popping, it's metal.

956
00:51:45,296 --> 00:51:48,177
So you get that you are getting metal from the car,

957
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:50,077
but this is the biggest thing that you see,

958
00:51:50,137 --> 00:51:51,378
it's the closest to the reticle,

959
00:51:51,578 --> 00:51:53,258
and you just see one piece of metal.

960
00:51:53,758 --> 00:51:56,559
But in fact, you actually just, with one hit,

961
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:59,660
you're actually getting like 13 of these pieces.

962
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:04,204
So it might be that just the players are not truly understanding that each time they're

963
00:52:04,284 --> 00:52:09,210
harvesting something they're getting way more than they actually perceive just because it's

964
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,132
not clear on the feedback on screen.

965
00:52:13,155 --> 00:52:16,819
And we also had another problem for a long time with the weak points.

966
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:18,541
So,

967
00:52:19,362 --> 00:52:22,284
when you saw the player like hitting the weak points and it was actually

968
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:30,273
rewarding, it actually took us a while to get there. At the very beginning the weak points looked like that. It was yellow.

969
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,316
And this is what we would see players do.

970
00:52:42,388 --> 00:52:43,510
Not getting the point.

971
00:52:44,592 --> 00:52:45,233
Don't care. Nope.

972
00:52:49,824 --> 00:52:51,645
So what I initially thought was, okay,

973
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:53,665
it's probably just a usability problem.

974
00:52:53,725 --> 00:52:56,186
It's not perceived as something you need to hit

975
00:52:56,886 --> 00:52:58,166
because it looks like a feedback,

976
00:52:58,246 --> 00:52:59,786
like yeah, you're destroying shit

977
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,687
and it's the same color, it's yellow.

978
00:53:01,727 --> 00:53:03,387
It's usually the color that you show

979
00:53:03,427 --> 00:53:05,288
like you're damaging something, it's yellow-orange.

980
00:53:06,008 --> 00:53:08,668
So what we did is we changed the color of it.

981
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,489
We changed how it looked like to make it feel more like,

982
00:53:11,529 --> 00:53:12,689
hey, you need to hit that stuff.

983
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,430
And so it changed and now it's blue.

984
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,331
It's way more in your face and this is what happened.

985
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:25,974
Still not hitting it.

986
00:53:29,136 --> 00:53:31,037
And so this is like, what's going on?

987
00:53:31,137 --> 00:53:32,377
It's right in your face.

988
00:53:32,437 --> 00:53:32,957
It's blue.

989
00:53:32,997 --> 00:53:33,718
Why don't you hit it?

990
00:53:34,158 --> 00:53:38,560
And what we're asking players, we're just showing the little hit point, the weak point,

991
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,041
and we're asking them, what do you think that is?

992
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:44,543
And they were saying, well, it's just saying that I'm targeting that item when I'm harvesting.

993
00:53:45,023 --> 00:53:46,684
And you're like, oh, OK.

994
00:53:47,165 --> 00:53:50,907
So in the end, what the designers did, the team did,

995
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,869
is instead of having that waypoint from the get-go,

996
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:56,631
you would not actually have it at the very beginning.

997
00:53:56,951 --> 00:53:59,313
You would have to unlock it in the skill tree.

998
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:01,714
At some point, you get a mission,

999
00:54:01,734 --> 00:54:05,476
and you need to unlock this thing.

1000
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:08,578
You see it in the skill tree.

1001
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:09,959
You pay for it.

1002
00:54:13,425 --> 00:54:14,867
and then you do it with a sabre, and then you get it.

1003
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:17,829
And this is only when that the players truly understood

1004
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,832
the value of this thing, because they experienced

1005
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:24,295
what it is to harvest before getting that thing.

1006
00:54:24,756 --> 00:54:27,158
We made it more meaningful to get that thing.

1007
00:54:27,178 --> 00:54:30,041
And so therefore, they immediately understood

1008
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:30,701
what it was for.

1009
00:54:30,942 --> 00:54:31,943
We gave meaning.

1010
00:54:32,343 --> 00:54:35,684
to the weak point, and this is when we solve that problem.

1011
00:54:36,464 --> 00:54:39,405
So you always need to think about the purpose,

1012
00:54:39,785 --> 00:54:41,525
and you always need to give a reference point

1013
00:54:41,785 --> 00:54:44,846
to the players before giving something that is cool.

1014
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:48,107
So the real challenge, usually in games,

1015
00:54:48,847 --> 00:54:50,427
is to find the real issue

1016
00:54:50,927 --> 00:54:52,588
before you can actually solve the problem.

1017
00:54:53,268 --> 00:54:55,491
So having a clear overall mapping of player engagement,

1018
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:58,675
know all these ingredients, and have hypotheses

1019
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,577
at the beginning, which you can test

1020
00:55:00,637 --> 00:55:03,080
as you develop the game, will help you identify

1021
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,643
the real issues and fix them appropriately.

1022
00:55:06,624 --> 00:55:07,345
So we always think.

1023
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,511
We always talk about players' motivation.

1024
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,632
But what about game developers' motivation?

1025
00:55:13,513 --> 00:55:15,593
Intrinsic motivation is important for creativity.

1026
00:55:16,054 --> 00:55:18,935
Guess what happens when you are given a motivation recipe

1027
00:55:18,955 --> 00:55:19,975
that you have to follow?

1028
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:22,536
When games end up being all the same,

1029
00:55:22,576 --> 00:55:24,377
so players can now see the matrix,

1030
00:55:24,957 --> 00:55:26,698
and everything is too predictable.

1031
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:29,419
The brain likes some changes and surprises,

1032
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,040
and so you don't have that emotion

1033
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,181
if it's too predictable.

1034
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:36,902
And the other thing is developers feel less volition

1035
00:55:37,302 --> 00:55:39,723
creating the game, therefore they don't put

1036
00:55:39,743 --> 00:55:40,903
their heart and soul in it.

1037
00:55:41,683 --> 00:55:43,244
So even if there was a secret sauce

1038
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:46,985
or perfect recipe for game engagement, there isn't.

1039
00:55:47,485 --> 00:55:50,026
But even if it were existent, game development

1040
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:53,027
is mostly a creative endeavor, so developers need

1041
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:57,248
to find their own recipe to be motivated and ship quality.

1042
00:55:57,728 --> 00:56:00,589
So the ingredient approach works better for animation.

1043
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:03,764
And so as UX practitioners, we are here,

1044
00:56:03,784 --> 00:56:05,985
we're only here to provide guidance.

1045
00:56:06,005 --> 00:56:07,245
We can provide game developers with a methodology,

1046
00:56:07,265 --> 00:56:08,465
like user research, and guidelines such as these UX pillars,

1047
00:56:08,485 --> 00:56:09,266
the ingredients that are important

1048
00:56:09,286 --> 00:56:10,166
for offering great user experience.

1049
00:56:10,206 --> 00:56:11,166
But in the end, it's gonna be up to you

1050
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:12,027
to make your own recipe.

1051
00:56:12,047 --> 00:56:12,727
And that's it for today.

1052
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:12,967
Thank you.

1053
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:13,267
Thank you.

1054
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:13,507
Thank you.

1055
00:56:13,847 --> 00:56:14,048
Thank you.

1056
00:56:14,068 --> 00:56:14,268
Thank you.

1057
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:14,588
Thank you.

1058
00:56:14,608 --> 00:56:14,788
Thank you.

1059
00:56:14,808 --> 00:56:15,008
Thank you.

1060
00:56:15,028 --> 00:56:15,228
Thank you.

1061
00:56:15,428 --> 00:56:15,628
Thank you.

1062
00:56:15,648 --> 00:56:15,868
Thank you.

1063
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:16,108
Thank you.

1064
00:56:16,128 --> 00:56:16,588
Thank you.

1065
00:56:16,608 --> 00:56:16,829
Thank you.

1066
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:17,029
Thank you.

1067
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:17,389
Thank you.

1068
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:17,609
Thank you.

1069
00:56:17,629 --> 00:56:17,829
Thank you.

1070
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:18,029
Thank you.

1071
00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:18,249
Thank you.

1072
00:56:18,289 --> 00:56:18,489
Thank you.

1073
00:56:18,529 --> 00:56:18,809
Thank you.

1074
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:19,009
Thank you.

1075
00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:19,289
Thank you.

1076
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,390
Thank you.

1077
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:20,690
Thank you.

1078
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:20,930
Thank you.

1079
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:21,170
Thank you.

1080
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:21,390
Thank you.

1081
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:22,391
Thank you.

1082
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:29,793
Thank you.

1083
00:56:29,813 --> 00:56:29,993
Thank you.

1084
00:56:30,782 --> 00:56:35,185
I talked a lot, but there's still five minutes for questions if you want to come up to the

1085
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:35,485
mics.

1086
00:56:38,787 --> 00:56:39,287
Hi, Celia.

1087
00:56:39,307 --> 00:56:39,848
Hi.

1088
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:40,328
Great talk.

1089
00:56:40,868 --> 00:56:44,911
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, how do I want to phrase this?

1090
00:56:45,855 --> 00:56:50,836
difficulty adjustment in a game that applies to like a wide audience. So an example would be like

1091
00:56:50,856 --> 00:56:55,398
an Uncharted, if I'm wandering around and I'm lost, it'll put like a little tip on the screen

1092
00:56:55,438 --> 00:57:00,479
and say you actually have to go over here. Um I'm just wondering like when a game apply applies to

1093
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:04,721
a wide audience like how do you make that decision when you're developing the game like to actually

1094
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:09,442
like improve the level design versus actually like pointing out stuff to the person that's struggling?

1095
00:57:09,813 --> 00:57:10,873
Yeah, that's a great question.

1096
00:57:11,634 --> 00:57:13,714
So overall, it's usually a good practice

1097
00:57:13,774 --> 00:57:15,595
to have contextual tips.

1098
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:17,816
So you don't necessarily, depending

1099
00:57:17,856 --> 00:57:19,716
on how complex a certain behavior it

1100
00:57:20,477 --> 00:57:23,398
is for the player to learn, you can just get away with it,

1101
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,959
not have a cool, big tutorial about it,

1102
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:29,200
but just give a contextual tip so only the players who

1103
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,380
are lost see it.

1104
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,841
Or it could be you had a tutorial about it,

1105
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:35,062
but at some point later in the game, you forget about it.

1106
00:57:35,722 --> 00:57:37,323
So having a contextual tip is helping.

1107
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:45,186
So usually if it's done well, it is cool because feeling lost and not knowing where to go can be very frustrating

1108
00:57:45,386 --> 00:57:49,709
and so you feel that sense of autonomy and control, you know, feeling in control of the game.

1109
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:53,350
On the other hand, if it's happening too early,

1110
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,371
it can feel controlling.

1111
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:59,052
So the problem is that everything in game

1112
00:57:59,092 --> 00:58:00,693
is all about balancing.

1113
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:04,034
So you don't want players to be lost,

1114
00:58:04,454 --> 00:58:06,775
but you don't want them to feel controlled

1115
00:58:07,295 --> 00:58:08,676
by some pesky comments.

1116
00:58:08,696 --> 00:58:09,416
So it's all about.

1117
00:58:09,856 --> 00:58:16,783
If you can make it more subtle, try to draw their attention to something rather than just having a text, it could work as well.

1118
00:58:16,843 --> 00:58:18,645
It really depends on the context.

1119
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:26,233
But if really they've been wondering for five minutes, it's better to give them a solution so they don't stay stuck, for sure.

1120
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:35,032
Hi there. You talked about the motivation that having things like clans or teams like For Honor with...

1121
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:36,794
I can't really hear you. What can you...

1122
00:58:37,074 --> 00:58:41,557
Sorry. You talked about the motivation that having things like clans can add to the game,

1123
00:58:42,058 --> 00:58:45,460
for using For Honor as an example, the Samurais and the Watchers and all that.

1124
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:51,885
How do you manage the balance between the emotional connection to losing that battle

1125
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,727
with providing that motivation for the player?

1126
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,561
Yeah, it's all about trade-offs yet again.

1127
00:59:00,622 --> 00:59:03,342
So yeah, if you're in the clan, it's always losing.

1128
00:59:03,862 --> 00:59:05,623
It can be feel a bit hard.

1129
00:59:06,603 --> 00:59:10,024
So you have to make sure that you have ways

1130
00:59:10,084 --> 00:59:12,445
to help the player to, like I was talking about,

1131
00:59:12,545 --> 00:59:14,645
reappraise what's going on.

1132
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:16,226
So them negative feelings, just like,

1133
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:18,326
okay, your guild sucks, but hey,

1134
00:59:18,526 --> 00:59:19,727
you're the best of this guild.

1135
00:59:19,747 --> 00:59:22,767
So it could be either that, or making sure that

1136
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:26,448
the team, if there's one that's really overpowered.

1137
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:29,169
you give them more difficulty,

1138
00:59:29,209 --> 00:59:30,990
like you increase their difficulty or give them.

1139
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,812
That's the reason why we have handicap in games like golf.

1140
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,853
So everybody can be at a certain level.

1141
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:39,753
It's not, you don't feel like you really,

1142
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,094
you're really a loser or like games like Go,

1143
00:59:43,095 --> 00:59:45,356
you have a handicap, so it's balanced.

1144
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:47,316
So we can think about doing stuff like that,

1145
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:49,877
but there's always trade-offs for everything.

1146
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:52,638
And like you say, we need to design for it

1147
00:59:52,698 --> 00:59:53,419
and to think about it.

1148
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:54,179
Yeah.

1149
01:00:00,211 --> 01:00:07,136
I would like to ask you to give me the analysis of an example I give to my students.

1150
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:14,202
When you play Shadow of the Colossus, when you kill the Colossus one after the other,

1151
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:17,785
you understand that you are making something which is wrong.

1152
01:00:20,147 --> 01:00:23,150
There is a feeling of guilt that goes all around the games.

1153
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:26,733
I would like to ask you to give me the analysis of an example I give to my students.

1154
01:00:27,302 --> 01:00:32,003
After a certain time, you understand that you are going to be punished for what you

1155
01:00:32,063 --> 01:00:32,483
are doing.

1156
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:38,344
But if you want to know the story, the end of the story, you have no choice.

1157
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:39,965
You have to kill the colossus.

1158
01:00:41,285 --> 01:00:43,686
So it's very strange motivation.

1159
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:45,186
It's narrative motivation.

1160
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:49,947
I give this to show the long-term motivation in the game can be purely narrative.

1161
01:00:51,707 --> 01:00:54,208
But how you put it in...

1162
01:00:55,028 --> 01:00:57,629
the analysis of the motivation of the player?

1163
01:00:57,729 --> 01:00:59,770
So it's a little bit different, because like you said,

1164
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,871
it's really about narrative, and it's

1165
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:04,352
about making you feel guilt, which

1166
01:01:04,392 --> 01:01:06,613
is the point of that game in that case.

1167
01:01:06,633 --> 01:01:08,413
So if it's the point of the game,

1168
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:10,514
if it's the experience that you intend for players,

1169
01:01:11,094 --> 01:01:11,635
then it's fine.

1170
01:01:12,255 --> 01:01:13,515
You have to think about the trade-off,

1171
01:01:13,535 --> 01:01:15,956
but usually you feel that towards the end of the game.

1172
01:01:16,717 --> 01:01:20,198
It's also a paid up front game, so you don't necessarily need

1173
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:23,640
retention as much as in free-to-play games.

1174
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,941
And so there's another great example from Brenda Romero,

1175
01:01:28,001 --> 01:01:30,442
like she's, remember the game like Train,

1176
01:01:30,502 --> 01:01:34,364
and you have to make sure that you place as many people

1177
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:38,286
as you can in the train and to make the space.

1178
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:42,932
efficient, until you realize that the train is going to Auschwitz.

1179
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:46,236
And that was the whole point of the game, to make you feel guilt.

1180
01:01:46,797 --> 01:01:50,642
And only games can make you feel emotions like that.

1181
01:01:50,682 --> 01:01:52,865
You don't necessarily feel guilt from watching a movie.

1182
01:01:53,206 --> 01:01:54,708
So if it's your intent...

1183
01:01:55,612 --> 01:02:00,336
You know that maybe the player is going to not feel super motivated to finish the game,

1184
01:02:00,396 --> 01:02:06,201
but you're playing with that feeling of guilt.

1185
01:02:06,701 --> 01:02:10,164
So when it's the point of the game, then go for it,

1186
01:02:10,744 --> 01:02:12,485
as long as you know the trade-offs you're making.

1187
01:02:12,906 --> 01:02:16,148
Now, if it's not the point of the game, you should avoid it,

1188
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:17,910
especially if it's a free-to-play game.

1189
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,478
Hi Celia, thank you for the talk.

1190
01:02:23,718 --> 01:02:28,361
It happens that I work on the math model of slot machines.

1191
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:34,965
So it turns out slot machines, all the rewards come from the real money that is the payout.

1192
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:40,268
So how can we apply all the theories of the rewards and events

1193
01:02:40,908 --> 01:02:44,070
when the payout and the hit rates are all fixed in the math model?

1194
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,264
Yeah, it's a whole different beast.

1195
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:51,388
And like I said, there's no real recipe.

1196
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:57,394
It's hard for me to just give you an answer just like that.

1197
01:02:57,595 --> 01:03:00,157
It takes a lot of different variables.

1198
01:03:00,938 --> 01:03:03,761
Any tips on the whistles or the game flows?

01:03:04,172 --> 01:03:09,156
Yeah, yeah. And that lady here maybe would have some tips for you.

1200
01:03:10,197 --> 01:03:11,197
Okay, thank you.

1201
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:12,038
You're welcome.

1202
01:03:12,058 --> 01:03:14,079
Alright, one last question?

1203
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,201
No, if there are no more questions.

1204
01:03:16,221 --> 01:03:17,582
Okay. Are you good?

1205
01:03:17,722 --> 01:03:20,604
I thought we had all the time, but the Game Audio Awards are...

1206
01:03:20,624 --> 01:03:22,966
What do you mean we have all the time? We want drinks now.

1207
01:03:22,986 --> 01:03:24,027
Right, exactly.

1208
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:26,228
Thank you very much, everyone.
