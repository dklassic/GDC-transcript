1
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:08,833
So I'm Matthias Borch, and I'm a lead designer at LucasArts.

2
00:00:08,873 --> 00:00:10,254
I'm not at Visceral Games anymore,

3
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:13,377
as you might have seen in the schedule.

4
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:15,239
So I'm currently working on an unannounced game

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,602
at LucasArts with Clint Hocking and Kent Hudson.

6
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:20,403
But obviously, I can't talk about that yet.

7
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:22,545
So these are some of the games I did work on.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,869
I really want to thank all of you guys coming to this talk

9
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:29,471
on a Friday morning, because Friday morning at GDC

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,873
usually feels like Saturday or Sunday morning

11
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:32,794
during regular times.

12
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:38,298
I figure the only way we can really deal with this is to just fucking own it, right?

13
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:42,741
Acknowledge the fact our mental state is probably like that of a six-year-old right now, and

14
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:44,202
well, pretend it's Saturday morning.

15
00:00:44,842 --> 00:00:47,424
To me that means watching Saturday morning cartoons, right?

16
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:51,346
Maybe we can do this while people are still filing in and getting seated.

17
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:56,529
So grab some breakfast and actually do a cartoon here that I want to watch while everybody's

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,690
filing in.

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:58,991
Let's see if this works.

20
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:12,356
no sound

21
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:12,596
uh...

22
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:17,518
my pony express stamps

23
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,419
you'll ruin my pony express stamps

24
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:23,421
not to mention five years of therapy

25
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,261
get out of my room

26
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:29,563
jeez what a grump

27
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:33,045
he should really try to find some outlet for those

28
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:38,455
Negative feelings.

29
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,804
It looks like all the inks disappeared now.

30
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:52,769
Get out of here.

31
00:01:52,789 --> 00:02:02,218
Hey, you fixed it. I guess I can forgive you now.

32
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:06,554
Sometimes I do stupid stuff and I don't even know why.

33
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:11,617
As if my body were being controlled by some demented, sadistic puppet master.

34
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:15,220
Well, we all feel that way sometimes.

35
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:18,562
Alrighty.

36
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:24,186
So this talk is called the Identity Bubble and I build it as a design approach to character

37
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:25,207
and story development.

38
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:28,169
On a deeper level, it's actually about what you just saw in the video, right?

39
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:32,472
It's about identity concepts in games, understanding them and using them to full effect.

40
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:38,343
And more specifically, to talk about motivation and how writing for games is different from writing for other media.

41
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:43,724
And I figured I could have filled slide after slide with examples of bad game writing, bad game identity.

42
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:48,045
In fact, I did that at one point, but I realized that we only have to give you one example.

43
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:51,325
And that's from a game that I worked on like four years ago, which was Lair.

44
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:55,766
So Lair had this huge disconnect between the player and the player character.

45
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:58,947
As I was playing the game, I didn't believe in the mission.

46
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:01,307
I didn't believe in the reasons why I was doing things.

47
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:05,698
And it culminated in this mission, I think somewhere halfway in the game, where you're

48
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,579
bombing this supposedly evil city.

49
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:12,240
And the player character that Yavatar is going at it with gusto, he's totally into it, except

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,741
as the player, I've already realized that's exactly the wrong thing to do.

51
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:17,442
Those guys aren't evil at all.

52
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:19,102
And that mission fell completely flat.

53
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:23,464
So this is a somewhat personal talk, because ever since Leia, I've been looking for help

54
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,044
in this area.

55
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:29,126
And I think the problem we have in this industry is that we don't even seem to be able to agree

56
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,626
on what the actual problem is.

57
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:35,605
So what I've come to realize or think is that it's not a singular problem,

58
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,486
there's actually two distinctly different approaches to character creation.

59
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,226
And both have their own philosophical baggage attached,

60
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,667
they all have their own ideologies,

61
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:45,588
which makes it kind of difficult to talk about the subject, right?

62
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:46,568
Because it's kind of divisive.

63
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,909
I'm probably going to split the room right down half the middle.

64
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:51,710
Half... whatever.

65
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,590
You know, I'm going to split the room right down the middle,

66
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,811
because, you know, for every fallout...

67
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:01,270
as a Final Fantasy, whatever fucking number they're up to.

68
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,292
For every portal, there's an Uncharted 2, right?

69
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:08,417
In both cases, there's very different approaches to player identity.

70
00:04:09,278 --> 00:04:12,361
So what I'm going to try to do here is dig up the commonalities,

71
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:15,685
like, unearth the foundation that these games are based on,

72
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:19,068
and try to reconcile those different identity approaches

73
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,531
into something that hopefully we can use as a framework.

74
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:23,797
So I'm going to do this in five parts.

75
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,639
In part one, I'm going to establish an identity range.

76
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,461
It's going to be this graph that captures both extremes of how

77
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,762
we may choose to offer player identity.

78
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:34,343
And part two is going to look at double consciousness,

79
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:37,625
understanding it and seeing why it makes writing for games

80
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:39,727
different from other media, and then hopefully using

81
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,608
that knowledge to create some good player identity.

82
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,829
And that's what part three is going to be about.

83
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:46,330
I have three specific examples, kind of showing you

84
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,451
how we can use those lessons.

85
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:53,139
And then part four, which is actually wedged into part three, because it kind of flows in there, is about myth reinforcement.

86
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,803
What it means and how we can use it to make better stories.

87
00:04:57,144 --> 00:05:01,088
And then part five is going to be takeaway, and we're going to see if we can learn some lessons from all of this.

88
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,157
So we're going to talk, we're going to start by talking about identity approaches, and to do that we should talk about avatars.

89
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:14,725
So I think we all know that we use avatars to enter a game world, right?

90
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:18,586
And it's usually an abstract concept, but Ultima, the beauty of Ultima was that

91
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:24,169
it's actually an awesome example of exactly how this school of thought looks at the player-avatar relationship, right?

92
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,792
Rules of Play has a definition for this, and it describes the avatar and its identity approach as, quote,

93
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:35,153
a puppet, an object for the player to manipulate according to the rules of the game.

94
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,422
I think we all easily understand what that means.

95
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:40,002
We treat the avatar as a lifeless puppet,

96
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:41,743
as our extension into the world,

97
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:43,683
and then we project ourselves onto this puppet.

98
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:46,764
Puppet doesn't have any character traits

99
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,804
or opinions of its own.

100
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,304
It's literally that of the player.

101
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,865
So this analogy works really good

102
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:54,185
for games with weakly defined characters, right?

103
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:56,885
And usually these games put a really high premium

104
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,986
on high agency and on the player's story.

105
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:00,826
So in my identity range,

106
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:02,907
I'm gonna put it on the left side right over there.

107
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:07,677
And while this is a very common approach to player identity, especially early on,

108
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:09,778
this doesn't tell the whole story, right?

109
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,601
Especially recently, there's this exactly opposite approach,

110
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:16,024
where we use strongly characterized, fully fleshed-out avatars

111
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:19,767
who have their own motivation and their own backstory, like Nathan Drake, right?

112
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:22,289
I mean, he's not really a puppet. Yes, every so often I play him,

113
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:26,453
but he talks, he sets directions, he adds some cutscenes, he goes after the girl,

114
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,555
a lot of stuff that I, as the player, don't actually affect.

115
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:34,758
So that's a completely different approach to authoring player identity, and we need to understand that one as well.

116
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:41,180
So a great metaphor I have found for this approach comes from Nick Montfort, and it's from this essay,

117
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,961
Threading the Player Character, and it was published in this book, Second Person.

118
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:49,722
So what Nick Montfort is saying is that the player is steering the avatar like, quote,

119
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:53,923
a sort of vehicle from which the world can be seen and otherwise experienced.

120
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:57,483
This character both constrains us, we have to remain in the vehicle.

121
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:59,426
and also opens up possibilities.

122
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,247
We can use the vehicle to get around and even affect changes

123
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:02,687
in the world.

124
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,368
So what I love about this analogy

125
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:07,549
is that it completely visualizes how

126
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,809
an active cinematic experience like Unshutter 2 works.

127
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,050
Unshutter 2 is very strongly structured.

128
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,290
It's locking the player into this very specific story

129
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,711
progression.

130
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:17,791
So if we visualize the structure as a road network, which

131
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,272
is connected by tunnels, which of course represents

132
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:22,393
the story cut scenes and the structural points that

133
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,193
structure the experience, we can see

134
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:25,994
that we're driving Nathan Drake across the road.

135
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,274
That's him driving right there.

136
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,368
And it shows us that there is some choice and expression

137
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:32,869
that we have during play, but it also shows us the limitations.

138
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,910
We cannot drive off the map in whatever direction we choose to.

139
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,991
And our progression is predetermined.

140
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:40,271
It's always gated by these tunnels, which connect

141
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:41,312
each piece of the road.

142
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:43,773
So in our identity range, we're going

143
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:46,974
to put vehicles on the opposite side right here.

144
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:49,195
And I think these are two really good cornerstones

145
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,055
to anchor our spectrum.

146
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:58,356
So regardless of how we look at it, if it's the player exerting his will on a puppet,

147
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,817
or if it's a player driving a vehicle through an experience,

148
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:05,340
the one thing we have to always keep in mind is that player and avatar always remain separate entities.

149
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,861
This is something that Rules of Play calls double consciousness.

150
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:11,383
It's this idea that players, even when they're fully immersed in an experience,

151
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,405
are always aware of the fact that they're playing a game.

152
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:17,827
And that in playing a character, they're always manipulating an artificial construct.

153
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:19,968
So what's interesting about this is...

154
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,900
that the player himself establishes this double consciousness, right?

155
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,582
Because he makes the choice to enter the magic circle of the game.

156
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:30,905
He chooses to push aside parts of his identity that will prevent him from enjoying or acting

157
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,446
appropriately within the game.

158
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:37,369
So in a way, the player willingly turns himself into a schizophrenic, and he willingly submits

159
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,351
himself to all these different voices, which different points of views and different agendas

160
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:42,792
which are all whispering inside his head.

161
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:45,294
So this is probably the key to this topic.

162
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:48,516
As game writers and game designers, we need to understand double consciousness.

163
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:49,336
And

164
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:49,557
that's it.

165
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:54,661
This knowledge is out there, it's in multiple books, it's in multiple GDC talks.

166
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:59,385
The reason, I think, why we still don't really seem to have an institutionalized knowledge

167
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,928
in this industry is because it's a little bit difficult to understand.

168
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:06,851
Because double consciousness is multi-layered, it's kind of like a dream within a dream within

169
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:07,232
a dream.

170
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:12,056
And even in this lecture, we have to drill down into the concept not once, but twice.

171
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,480
So if we dig deeper into double consciousness once...

172
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,317
we get to Gary Fine and the book Shared Fantasy.

173
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,699
So this was a book that was written, I think, even in the 70s.

174
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,801
It's about real-life tabletop RPG groups,

175
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:28,702
but it applies to digital games as well.

176
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,404
And Gary Fine splits double consciousness,

177
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:33,345
well, the chronology is wrong here,

178
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:35,206
but we can say he splits double consciousness

179
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:36,767
into three parts of identity

180
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:39,129
that players experience when they're playing a game.

181
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,150
So we have the character.

182
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,192
This is the fictional character embodied by the player,

183
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:45,813
you know, Ogre, the dwarf, or whoever he chooses to play.

184
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:47,154
Then we have the player.

185
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,755
So this is the player himself.

186
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,223
acting within and exploring the framework and the rules of the games, like rolling dice,

187
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:55,924
and, you know, actually understanding the rules and using them.

188
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:57,565
Then we also have the person.

189
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:00,046
And this is the player as a person with life demands,

190
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:02,508
which we push aside while we're playing, right?

191
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:04,949
We're trying to immerse ourselves in Ogre or the Dwarf or whatever.

192
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,092
But they're never forgotten, because if I have to leave at 6pm and have to catch a train,

193
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:11,253
that's always going to be somewhere on the back of my conscious.

194
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:17,082
there's this inherent ambiguity here, right?

195
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,003
On the one hand, we have the player actual,

196
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:21,204
the way we usually talk about the player and what he does,

197
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:23,225
but you also have this identity frame player.

198
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:26,166
So what I'm gonna try to do for the rest of this talk

199
00:10:26,186 --> 00:10:28,227
to avoid ambiguity is to,

200
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:31,368
what call Gary finds identity part the player,

201
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,429
and whenever I'm talking about the player actual,

202
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:34,930
I'm gonna try to call him gamer.

203
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,430
So we have a distinction right there.

204
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,331
But see how well I succeed,

205
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,352
because this is totally ingrained in me as well,

206
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:41,252
like saying player.

207
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,016
So in psychology, I guess, we call these frames.

208
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,959
It's the character frame, the player frame, and the person frame.

209
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,122
And these are those schizophrenia-induced voices that I was talking about,

210
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:52,843
which are whispering to the player inside his head.

211
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,906
These are voices that want to be satisfied, they have their own goals,

212
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:57,047
they have their own motivations.

213
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,130
And if you want to know how to motivate somebody, how to keep them satisfied,

214
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:03,732
we need to know what defines them, right?

215
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,253
How we actually hook into them.

216
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:09,217
So this is where we drill one level deeper into double consciousness,

217
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:11,418
and where it gets a little bit weird.

218
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,992
It doesn't get weird because of this guy.

219
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:15,232
This is Harvey Smith.

220
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:18,353
He's the co-creative director at Arkane Studios in Austin.

221
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:20,274
And last year, I had the good fortune

222
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:22,675
of doing a lecture on environmental storytelling

223
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:23,015
with him.

224
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,836
But before that, 2006, I believe,

225
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,937
Harvey did a talk called the Imago Effect,

226
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:31,018
which a lot of the material so far actually has been based on.

227
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,479
It kind of opened up my eye to all of that.

228
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,100
So in this talk, Harvey psychoanalyzed

229
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,600
Gary Fiennes' identity frames, right?

230
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,141
And he came up with a more detailed list.

231
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:41,857
We could call these frames as well, because this is all incredibly fractal, but then we

232
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:43,238
would have frames inside frames.

233
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:46,721
So what I'm going to try to do is call Harvey's list fragments.

234
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:51,025
So these are Harvey's identity fragments, and you can see them on the screen right here.

235
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:56,310
So if we take this list, we just slightly adjust it, we can map Harvey's identity frames

236
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:02,815
back onto Harvey's identity fragments, and we can map them back onto Harvey's identity

237
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,176
frames.

238
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:04,757
And we come up with something like this.

239
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,332
And where we have the character, which is the fictional protagonist of the game.

240
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,995
And he might be based on a literary, pop, or mythic archetype.

241
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:17,138
Then we have the player, and this is the player himself solving problems and completing tasks.

242
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:19,159
So this talks about moment-to-moment gameplay, right?

243
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,520
Really tight motivational loops.

244
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,623
Pure games, pretty much, the reason why we start playing them.

245
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:26,705
And we have the player with a sense of skill level and reputation.

246
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:31,909
And I'm using this to kind of map his sense of mastery and his progress as he's going through the game.

247
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:35,071
Kind of tracking how far along we are in the entire game.

248
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:41,687
And then we have the player who just brings primal emotions like fear, anger, and various other things into the experience.

249
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:45,450
So character and player exist within the magic circle of the game, right?

250
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,812
When we're playing the game, this is, that needs to be there.

251
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:52,877
Then we also have the person who usually exists outside the magic circle.

252
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:58,301
So we have the, um, we have the person as a player with a sense of skill level and reputation,

253
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:01,064
but I don't want to talk too much about that, we're going to ignore that one.

254
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,385
We do have a person who has a perceived sense of idealized self, right?

255
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:07,707
We all like to see ourselves in a certain way.

256
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,448
We all aspire to be somebody.

257
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:13,250
So this is who we want to be or how we think other people perceive us.

258
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,452
And of course, we do have the self as a person with life demands

259
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:20,715
who has to catch the bus at 6 or various other things that just define our life.

260
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,878
So we're going to ignore the person frame for the time being, right?

261
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,279
I mean, this is double consciousness deconstructed, right?

262
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:28,920
This is your player when he's playing the game.

263
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,582
But because the person exists outside the magic circle.

264
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:35,426
and it's going to make it a little bit more difficult to figure out the concepts and talk about them.

265
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,888
We're just going to forget about them for the time being.

266
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,933
So the concept behind the identity bubble is just reconciling those identity fragments.

267
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,496
It's this idea that we can imagine identity in games as a bubble

268
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:49,657
in which character and player follow along.

269
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:55,282
And identity during play is maintained when the character and the player frames drift in the same direction, right?

270
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:59,625
But as soon as one of them lags behind or starts floating in a completely different direction,

271
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,407
the bubble pops and identity is lost.

272
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:13,390
What's important to me is that this identity bubble needs to be maintained, because we have to do that both during runtime, right, we have to keep reinforcing identity as we're playing, but this also includes development.

273
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,813
And to me, writing for games means cooperation between writer and designer for the entire duration of development.

274
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:31,519
We can actually see that right here in the bubble, because we have a representation for both the writer, right, he's down there, caring about the character, and for the game designers as well, who are up there and caring for, you know,

275
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:33,544
the actual player experience.

276
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:35,664
So this practice of hiring a writer

277
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:37,505
towards the end of development just to write the story

278
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:37,965
doesn't work.

279
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:41,986
And more importantly, hiring a writer

280
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,886
who doesn't understand player identity

281
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:46,227
is going to open this huge can of worms.

282
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:50,768
And well, hopefully you can use this talk to teach some people.

283
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:54,189
So because I think in this room we all understand this.

284
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,710
I mean, at least intuitively, but it doesn't really

285
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,810
protect us from an executive coming in and having

286
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,671
hired this famous comic writer, something like that.

287
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:01,851
So.

288
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:05,172
Every time that happens, we kind of need to figure out how to deal with that.

289
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:09,754
And I think one way to actually do that, you know, if you are in this situation, is to

290
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:14,755
just very quickly talk about what makes writing for games different from writing for other

291
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:15,155
media.

292
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:17,376
Like my high-level summary is actually very simple.

293
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:20,816
Games are participatory, and movies and books are reflective.

294
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:22,717
Let me show you what I mean by that.

295
00:15:25,518 --> 00:15:27,218
So this is linear media, right?

296
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:27,958
This is a movie.

297
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:31,906
In linear media, motivation is created in the character frame.

298
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:33,127
Like it's created over there.

299
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,587
I will take the ring tomorrow.

300
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:37,028
This is propelling the entire experience forward.

301
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,369
So now we have the player, which in this case,

302
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:40,249
of course, is the viewer.

303
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:42,970
And he's observing the character's actions on the screen.

304
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,210
He's doing this right here.

305
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,351
This is the reflective part.

306
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:47,251
The viewer compares his own values,

307
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:50,212
his own frame of reference to the depicted situation.

308
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:53,794
So meaning emerges because the viewer

309
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:56,194
is engaged in this internal dialogue about what's

310
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:57,035
happening on the screen.

311
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:00,302
Like in this case, he's edging Frodo on.

312
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:01,022
Go Frodo!

313
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:02,783
But he's also reflecting on himself.

314
00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:03,684
He's going, you know what?

315
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:06,185
If I was a hobbit, I could do exactly the same thing.

316
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:07,325
I wouldn't succumb to the ring.

317
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,206
So it's kind of self-assuring.

318
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,927
Or we're testing ourselves to see if what's going on

319
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,648
on the screen would be true for us as well.

320
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,309
This is actually very straightforward.

321
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:18,090
If we're looking at the flow of consumption

322
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,191
that's going on here, that's pretty straight.

323
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,472
And we've mastered this over thousands of years.

324
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:25,373
There's a bunch of experience, you know, like

325
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:30,234
the never-ending story here, which played with this character-viewer relationship in kind of interesting ways, but

326
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:33,174
ultimately, this experience is always reflective.

327
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:35,895
That's awesome, except that games don't work that way.

328
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:37,616
They actually work pretty much oppositely.

329
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:39,236
Games are participatory.

330
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:43,397
We're looking at motivation in games, well, it's created in the player, right over there.

331
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,178
I mean, that's the reason we play games, right?

332
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:46,558
We want to drive the action.

333
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:47,619
We want to express ourselves.

334
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:48,659
We want to lead.

335
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:55,450
What becomes tricky is that now we want to use storylines and character motivation to fictionalize the player's goals.

336
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,712
So all of a sudden we're creating motivation over here as well.

337
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,754
So now the player starts reflecting on the character's actions until he realizes,

338
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:05,037
well, wait a second, why am I reflecting actually on the character?

339
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,038
So I don't know, what the fuck does that mean?

340
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:11,661
So we have this duality, right, where motivation is created in one identity frame.

341
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:15,084
There's a different identity frame we use to fictionalize this motivation.

342
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:17,265
And we need to figure it out.

343
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:20,383
So a result of this is a very confused player, right?

344
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:21,384
And we've all been there.

345
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:23,025
We've all had this nagging feeling of,

346
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:24,866
why am I doing this again?

347
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:26,707
It's this feeling of not really feeling

348
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:27,987
like you're driving the action,

349
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:29,408
of not really understanding

350
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,929
why the character is doing something.

351
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,790
Not really caring about the avatar's motivation.

352
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:36,152
So there's actually a term for this,

353
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:39,353
for this hollow feeling, this feeling of disconnect

354
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,555
that Clint Hocking came up with a few years ago.

355
00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:44,776
I guess he's a kind of questionable character,

356
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:45,677
the way I put this up.

357
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:49,543
Clint called this feeling Lulu narrative dissonance.

358
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,964
It came out of talking about Bioshock.

359
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,685
So Lulu narrative dissonance is something that we as designers and writers create

360
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:01,325
when we don't understand player identity.

361
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:03,666
We open this rift between player and character

362
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:05,946
and we don't even understand it's there

363
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,467
and we don't know how to manage the problem.

364
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:09,287
Because it is a manageable problem

365
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,447
and that's what the identity bubble is about.

366
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,528
It's just this expression of the problem.

367
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,208
It's the idea that

368
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:18,020
we have to keep all identity frames aligned by somehow hooking them together

369
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,062
so they keep drifting in the same direction and keep the bubble from popping.

370
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:24,965
And the way we do this is by controlling this identity gap,

371
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,608
being aware of it and then doing something about it.

372
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:31,271
So there's three examples of how this can be done that I want to look at.

373
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,073
So there's us hooking them together.

374
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:41,039
What's nice about it is that all three examples coincide with this identity range that we established earlier.

375
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:45,211
What's important to know about this range is that it's completely analog, right?

376
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:47,193
I mean, your approach might be wedged somewhere in the middle.

377
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:49,935
You might not be making a pure puppet or pure vehicle game.

378
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:54,037
You might be the poor crash test dummy, like somewhere right in the middle.

379
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:56,439
But so the three approaches I want to talk about is

380
00:18:56,979 --> 00:19:00,081
to either create what I would call a Lulu narrative parity, right?

381
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:01,182
Using a puppet avatar.

382
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:05,345
We might be using a hybrid approach, using something like complementary goals,

383
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:06,386
which goes somewhere in the middle.

384
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,469
If you want to use a strongly characterized avatar,

385
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,970
well, we might have to change the player's expectations

386
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,551
of why he plays the game in the first place.

387
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:16,092
And we do that using a mythic archetype.

388
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,534
So I think the best way to talk about this

389
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:21,615
is to just look at examples for each case here.

390
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:23,756
And then once we're done, hopefully we

391
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:26,198
can find some commonalities and then specific tools

392
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:26,878
and takeaways.

393
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,602
So we should start by looking at puppet games.

394
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,277
Not this puppet game, unfortunately. It would be awesome talking about these kind of puppet games, right?

395
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:44,003
The idea behind Ludo Narrative Parity is to align gameplay and story goals so closely

396
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:47,346
that the player's agency is synonymous with the game's narrative progression.

397
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:52,572
And anybody who's looked into this topic knows exactly which game I'm going to use now as an example.

398
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:57,617
It's going to be Portal, because it's a great example of Ludo Narrative Parity.

399
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:02,005
I'm not here to analyze Portal and how it creates gameplay per se, right?

400
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,486
Countless people have done that before me.

401
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:06,747
I just want to show how the game engages the different fragments of player identity.

402
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:09,408
So this is me playing Portal, right?

403
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:12,270
So, if I'm playing Portal, well, I want to get to GLaDOS, right?

404
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,690
Because that means I've finished the game.

405
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:17,272
I do that by finishing each test chamber, right?

406
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:21,834
Which means solving all the puzzles in each chamber with the gameplay mechanisms provided to me.

407
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,875
Now, for all of this, GLaDOS keeps talking to me.

408
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:25,796
It keeps deriding me.

409
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,622
creating a sense of anger and a sense of indignity as she talks to me, edging me on to get to the very end of this, and

410
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:35,243
well, killing that computer bitch, right? Because she needs to die.

411
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:38,484
So if we compare this to what the avatar wants to do,

412
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,205
and her name is Chell, by the way,

413
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:44,086
but that's not important. What's important is that you probably didn't know that, and

414
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:45,707
her name isn't important, right?

415
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:51,409
Well, Chell wants to get to GLaDOS because she wants to get out of this fucked-up situation that she's in, right?

416
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:52,509
She wants to be free.

417
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:58,840
So she does this by finishing each test chamber, which means solving all the puzzles in each chamber with the tools provided to her.

418
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,383
And through all of this, GLaDOS keeps talking to her. She keeps deriding her, which reinforces this anger and this sense of indignity

419
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:10,346
that's been inflicted through her capture, giving her the righteous fury to get to the end and kill that fucking computer bitch, right?

420
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:14,588
So both examples are pretty much identical. They're remarkably similar.

421
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:20,170
So in Portal, there's never an identity gap because the game maintains LULU narrative parity.

422
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,741
What it means to play the game is exactly the same thing as what it means to be Chell in that situation.

423
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:34,103
So a player and avatar are united in a situation where they're incarcerated by a sadistic computer, right?

424
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:38,364
And they have this overwhelming urge to escape in the hope of sticking it to GLaDOS in the end.

425
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:44,225
So the player knows exactly what it's like, what it means to be the avatar, what his or her motivation is,

426
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,906
and how to act on that motivation. That's the important part right here.

427
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:50,884
If we're looking at the identity bubble here, we see this ludonarrative parity, right?

428
00:21:50,904 --> 00:21:53,286
Because player and character are pulling each other along.

429
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:57,569
Both identity frames are working towards exactly the same game, the same goals.

430
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,852
So the bubble never pops, at least for me, and identity is strong.

431
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:06,056
So fictionally, Chell is her own person, I guess, but in gameplay terms, she's identical to the player.

432
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:08,578
If we are looking at the writing of Portal,

433
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:13,062
doing the entire game, GLaDOS's commentaries, addressing player and character alike, right?

434
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:13,742
There's no gap.

435
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:22,564
And the brilliance of Portal's writing, beyond just having really good characterizations and all that stuff, is that it's constantly reminding the player of the shared situation, right?

436
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:25,125
It's constantly keeping these identity frames aligned.

437
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:35,132
Every time GLaDOS addresses Chell or the player or whatever, it reminds them that they're both the same, and it kind of starts hooking these frames together again, even though they might have drifted apart a little bit.

438
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:43,007
So Lulu narrative parity works in Portal, I think mostly because it's based on primal motivation, right?

439
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:45,948
It's something we inherently understand, something we don't like.

440
00:22:46,688 --> 00:22:50,429
There aren't even objectives in Portal, you know, GLaDOS talks at us, but mostly

441
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,051
every goal in the game flows from this primal motivation of getting to the end.

442
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:58,973
Things get a little bit trickier when we want to add external, like more nuanced motivation,

443
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:00,073
something with bigger ideas.

444
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:02,734
And if we want that to drive the story progression.

445
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:06,435
Now we're talking about this duality that I talked about earlier, right?

446
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,772
We motivate one identity frame with gameplay, but then another identity frame is used to contextualize that motivation somehow.

447
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:16,154
So one way we can deal with this problem is complementary goals.

448
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:19,616
We want to weave the player's identity into the core gameplay loop.

449
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:22,557
And to me Fallout 3 is a great example of this.

450
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:23,738
Fallout 3.

451
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,960
In Fallout 3, the avatar, him or herself, is also an empty vessel.

452
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,163
I think even more so than in Portal, because we can customize our avatar, right?

453
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:35,563
Both statistically and visually.

454
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:38,035
Portal's gameplay is driven by the player.

455
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:40,735
It's his motivation to explore the world for resources.

456
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:42,996
It's the joy of systemic advancement, which just means

457
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:45,176
gaining levels and that kind of stuff.

458
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:46,776
That's why we play the game.

459
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,717
When we pick it up, that's what we expect.

460
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:51,477
The problem is that this systemic exploration doesn't

461
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:55,438
drive Fallout 3's story, because that goal is introduced

462
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,158
externally over here in the character.

463
00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:01,039
As Fallout 3's pre-offered story goes, the avatar wants

464
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,379
to find her dad.

465
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:05,480
And once she's successful, she wants to help him on his

466
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:05,960
quest to find his dad.

467
00:24:06,256 --> 00:24:07,756
to bring clean water to the wasteland.

468
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:13,077
So this opens up this identity gap if we don't deal with it because those

469
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:17,338
goals, they're not fundamentally derived from Fallout's gameplay mechanics.

470
00:24:18,478 --> 00:24:21,299
And beyond experience points, which I guess are a motivator,

471
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:25,840
helping my dad on his quest doesn't really reward me on a systemic level.

472
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,121
So in the identity range, Fallout falls somewhere right in the middle, right? It's a puppet

473
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:33,882
that the player completely controls, projects himself on, but

474
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:39,375
this puppet does have this pre-authored backstory which establishes fundamental gameplay goals.

475
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:44,298
So Fallout 3 deals with this setup, well, when it comes to base motivation in a very

476
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:50,301
clever way, because it establishes the father very early on as an instrumental figure in

477
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:51,061
the gamer's life.

478
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:55,423
Like, he's literally the guy who teaches us how to deal with the world.

479
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:56,804
He delivers all the tutorials.

480
00:24:56,884 --> 00:25:01,587
When you're beginning Fallout 3, you're growing up, and he teaches you how to walk, how to

481
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:03,828
jump, gives you a name and all that stuff.

482
00:25:03,888 --> 00:25:03,988
So...

483
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,172
Once the dad goes missing, we actually care about his fate a little bit because at least

484
00:25:08,252 --> 00:25:09,772
we know him and he's helped us.

485
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:15,255
But that only takes us so far once we're out on our own and we're in the capital of the

486
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:19,418
wasteland and the world is our oyster and there's tons of open world points of interest

487
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,499
which are available to me and I could do whatever the hell I want.

488
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:28,002
So at this point, Paul needs to do more to maintain his identity bubble, making sure

489
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:31,864
that the character's quest match the player's gameplay actions.

490
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:37,024
So it does this by making player and character actions fundamentally complementary.

491
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:43,046
As a player, building up an RPG character in a post-apocalyptic wasteland means what?

492
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:44,566
It means scrapping and exploring.

493
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:47,367
I'm going around, I'm finding shit, I'm digging it up, I'm killing guys.

494
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:54,029
As a fictional character, looking for my dad somewhere in the wasteland in a post-apocalyptic

495
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:57,570
world, well, it means scrapping and exploring, because I don't want to die and I'm looking

496
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:57,950
for him.

497
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,991
I'm just digging up the entire wasteland.

498
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:01,911
So we create alignment right here.

499
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:04,932
It's not Lulu narrative, it's not parody, right?

500
00:26:05,112 --> 00:26:05,752
But it's harmony.

501
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:09,454
Lulu narrative harmony, because the character's identity

502
00:26:09,654 --> 00:26:12,675
is mirrored in the game's fundamental systemic play actions.

503
00:26:13,636 --> 00:26:16,617
Like, even if the player doesn't care about finding her father,

504
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:19,739
she still kind of follows the story anyway, because, you know,

505
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:23,440
she does it automatically by exploring the wasteland.

506
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:27,082
So the spatial exploration of the wasteland,

507
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,543
which ties together all the other gameplay mechanics,

508
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:32,649
books play on character identity frames together.

509
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:34,689
And we see this right here in the identity bubble.

510
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,350
So the player explores to go in power,

511
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,430
the character explores to find her father.

512
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,111
And every time we enter a new location,

513
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:42,551
even if we're off the beaten path,

514
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:44,691
we are reminded of our story goal.

515
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,792
I've actually talked to somebody, I think last year,

516
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:50,192
who told me he sidestepped like 60% of the main quest

517
00:26:50,272 --> 00:26:51,673
because he completely ignored it

518
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:54,453
and just found his dad by accident

519
00:26:54,553 --> 00:26:56,393
somewhere where he's actually hiding,

520
00:26:56,553 --> 00:26:57,894
like way off the beaten path.

521
00:26:58,134 --> 00:26:59,394
And I think that's awesome, right?

522
00:26:59,414 --> 00:26:59,614
I mean.

523
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:02,603
We didn't destroy the story in any way.

524
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:04,725
We were playing the story the entire time.

525
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:07,067
It's just our player story, and we managed to play it

526
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:08,128
in a way nobody else did.

527
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,972
So this is exploration, and we're fundamentally

528
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:14,254
weaving the character identity into play actions.

529
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:16,536
But I think there's actually something else that

530
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:18,718
holds together this identity bubble in Fallout.

531
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:22,441
And it's something you might not expect in this context.

532
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:23,442
It's the American dream.

533
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:27,005
If we're looking at what Fallout 3's gameplay arc really

534
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:27,485
represents.

535
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:30,201
It's actually the typical story of the American Dream.

536
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:31,242
It's Rags to Riches.

537
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,262
It's coming from nowhere and going somewhere, right?

538
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:35,242
You have the freedom of what you want to do.

539
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:38,003
And there's a promise of prosperity and success

540
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:38,723
if you do it right.

541
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:41,224
The sky, well, level 20 is the limit, right?

542
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:42,504
But the sky is the limit.

543
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:45,085
And that promise is expressed in the character

544
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,045
and in the player equally.

545
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:49,045
Oops, sorry.

546
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:51,626
I lost my slides here.

547
00:27:56,239 --> 00:28:00,842
I mean, a character enters the Capital Wasteland as nobody, working their way up to the top.

548
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:03,724
As the player, we're grinding.

549
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:07,426
We're putting in all the hard work, we're doing fetch quests and all the stupid little

550
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:11,168
stuff you do in RPG games, all the hard work, and, you know, we're making something out

551
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:11,728
of ourselves.

552
00:28:11,988 --> 00:28:14,570
So there's alignment right there, and we're both growing in power equally.

553
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:19,893
What's cool about it is that it brings the person frame back into the picture.

554
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:20,594
Right?

555
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:23,335
I mean, I kicked him out earlier because the person frame wasn't needed.

556
00:28:23,732 --> 00:28:26,993
It just made it easier to understand or to deal with it, but this is where we can bring it back.

557
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:31,474
Because as a person, if we're talking about the American dream and how we know about it,

558
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:38,095
well, it's something that we know as a person, right? It's something that we want to believe in. It's something that's very prevalent

559
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:39,575
in our culture.

560
00:28:40,716 --> 00:28:46,597
So we're playing an activity like Fallout 3, and this proves to ourselves that all these values that we hold dear, that we want to

561
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:48,597
believe in, they might actually be true.

562
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:52,766
You know, I'm not a dishwasher. I came here like 13 years ago. I didn't start washing dishes.

563
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:55,967
But hey, maybe I can become a millionaire too. And playing something like that,

564
00:28:57,348 --> 00:28:59,729
well, it stays with me, right? After I stop playing.

565
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:03,911
It actually transcends the game. It reinforces our beliefs.

566
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:07,392
And this is something that's going to become more important as we go on.

567
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:11,294
So I actually want to explore this in more detail before we come back to the third example right here.

568
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:18,577
So this is my former boss at Legend, Bob Bates, who's sitting right over there.

569
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:24,426
He did a talk in 2005 called Into the Woods, A Practical Guide to the Hero's Journey, and

570
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:29,367
he presented this idea that, just like other media by the way, quote, games are essentially

571
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:33,989
myth-reinforcing activities, and I believe that players tend to choose the kinds of games

572
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:36,749
that reaffirm their own personal myths, end quote.

573
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,390
So Bob then goes through this talk, or the first part of the talk, and he quotes the

574
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:45,232
who is who of the psychological world to show that the reason why we consume media is a

575
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:47,973
way to reaffirm our own personal belief systems of the world.

576
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:55,096
And it's the reason we have fairy tales. It's the reason why small children watch Disney movies until they can recite them backwards.

577
00:29:55,497 --> 00:30:03,204
It's the reason my wife watched Sweet Home Alabama about a hundred times because it was reassuring her that Mr. Wright was out there somewhere just waiting for her.

578
00:30:03,224 --> 00:30:05,506
Well, then she met me, but that's a different story.

579
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:14,314
It's the reason you guys can't get enough of Die Hard, and it's the reason I literally watched the San Francisco Giants win the 2010 World Series like 20 times.

580
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,295
I have it on DVD and I have a subscription because...

581
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:22,992
That was fucking cool. I mean, my hometown warriors, my San Francisco Giants, were bringing home the World Series trophy.

582
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:24,473
So myths are important.

583
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:29,175
They reinforce our views of the world, and we gain psychological well-being from this,

584
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:31,896
because it's comforting to know that we can trust in our beliefs.

585
00:30:33,617 --> 00:30:37,159
So Bob then goes on and he argues that games are myth-reinforcing entities as well.

586
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,261
What he says is that, for some, it might simply be the need to bring order out of chaos.

587
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:44,062
For them, Tetris is a fine way to reassert that belief.

588
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:49,346
But Tetris can reinforce the belief, for example, that it is better to have loved and lost than

589
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:50,387
to never have loved at all.

590
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:55,550
If we want to reinforce deeper, more complex myths, which in turn can create deeper and

591
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,852
more satisfying gameplay experiences, then we need to turn to stories.

592
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:05,315
So reinforcing myths tickles our perceived sense of idealized self, right?

593
00:31:05,495 --> 00:31:08,537
Over there in the person frame, which you might be able to see.

594
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:14,537
And we see this in Fallout 3. Fallout 3 is an interactive way of reliving the American dream.

595
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:16,758
And you're actually building and you're shaping your own myth.

596
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,381
So for Fallout 3, I would argue that if we're looking at the identity bubble, that this myth of the American dream

597
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:29,484
and how fundamentally it's anchored in all identity frames unifies this identity bubble and pulls everything together.

598
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:32,745
And I can actually make the same argument for Portal if you want to go back to it,

599
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:35,987
because Portal at its very core is a monster in the house story.

600
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:39,325
You know, we might say it's a retelling of the Labyrinth of Minos,

601
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,865
but I think, like, this situation from Saw might resonate more, right?

602
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:45,146
I mean, I still remember the first trailer for Saw.

603
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,066
It was just a bunch of footage, and in the end it just says,

604
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:48,527
this is fucked up.

605
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:50,647
And I believe that.

606
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:53,608
I mean, I'm so deeply afraid of a situation like this,

607
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:55,588
where I'm trapped by this nihilistic monster,

608
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:59,449
that the reason why I'm watching Saw is because I want to steal myself.

609
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:01,169
And I want to reinforce this belief that,

610
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,430
if I'm in some situation like that,

611
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,930
I would be able to survive.

612
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:08,054
It's also about making you appreciate life and all that stuff, right?

613
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:11,356
But Portal is more humorous in the way it tells its story,

614
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,697
but fundamentally it's actually exactly the same story.

615
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:18,561
It's a nihilistic monster, and finishing Portal reinforces exactly the same belief,

616
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:20,081
but it does so interactively.

617
00:32:22,363 --> 00:32:25,845
This might be pretentious, but I actually believe that that's what we do in stuff.

618
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:30,848
So, I had ignored the person frame up to this point because it wasn't part of the Magic Circle.

619
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:33,130
You know, it wasn't required for a working identity bubble.

620
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,971
I think we can completely ignore it and create...

621
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,411
just games which are engrossment, like games that are fun for their own sake.

622
00:32:41,412 --> 00:32:45,252
So we were able to hook together a player and character without the person they are

623
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:46,013
and without its help.

624
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:50,854
With that said, we should see that engaging the person with its yearning for positive

625
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:53,794
reinforcement can actually add meaning to our play experience.

626
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:58,215
So that optional nature I think changes now because we're going to talk about vehicle

627
00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:01,956
games and we're going to talk about Unshutter 2 specifically, and I think we want to see

628
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:03,777
how important this person is going to become.

629
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:14,109
I think I've already talked about the fact that Uncharted 2 is pretty much the exact opposite from something like Fallout 3.

630
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:17,810
Like both in structure and also in its identity approach, right?

631
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:23,412
It's an active cinematic experience, highly structured, it's a story-driven game with strongly authored characters

632
00:33:24,073 --> 00:33:28,715
who constantly speak for themselves, they actually set goals, they propel the story forward and so on.

633
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:33,076
So, just from everything we've seen so far, with such a strongly characterized avatar,

634
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:35,777
we pretty much automatically opened Pandora's box right there, right?

635
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:38,198
I mean, we're opening this identity gap in the middle right there.

636
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:45,286
Because with every self-motivated, unexpected step that the player didn't initiate and that the character takes,

637
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:47,626
character and player are going to start drifting apart, right?

638
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:52,168
It's hard to feel a sense of agency when your destiny isn't driven by your own actions,

639
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:54,828
but the on-screen character just keeps doing his own thing.

640
00:33:55,068 --> 00:34:00,030
So, the connection between player and character, I think, is going to be stretched very thin.

641
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,231
It might even snap at times, right? Go away.

642
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:07,252
So, I think this is where the gamer's understanding of myths, like his collective unconscious,

643
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,833
can come in and hold everything together.

644
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:15,979
And the reason this works in the first place, well, it's explained in Bob's talk, right?

645
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:18,021
We consume media to reinforce beliefs.

646
00:34:18,702 --> 00:34:22,365
So what I believe, then, is that the gamer's identity expectations are actually different

647
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:23,767
for these kinds of story-driven games.

648
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:27,870
I mean, we've seen how Fallout 3 lets us build our own myth in an interactive way, which

649
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:31,854
is awesome for our medium, because it does something different, but there is this traditional

650
00:34:31,894 --> 00:34:32,435
way as well.

651
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:35,678
While we're watching movies, for example, it's going on somebody else's journey.

652
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:36,538
I mean...

653
00:34:36,996 --> 00:34:43,199
And I think many players are going to willingly sacrifice agency, or their player story, to experience this kind of journey.

654
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:47,902
We might call it myth recall, if the other one is called myth building or myth shaping, right?

655
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:52,344
We're going on somebody else's journey, and we're driving him through the experience, well, like a vehicle.

656
00:34:53,865 --> 00:34:56,947
So what this does is flipping around the way we create motivation in games.

657
00:34:57,007 --> 00:35:01,129
Like, up until now, I've always stressed that motivation should be created in the player.

658
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,630
Now, if we turn this around...

659
00:35:04,162 --> 00:35:07,824
we're putting the player in a frame of mind where he doesn't mind following Nathan Drake

660
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,645
well because he wants to be Nathan Drake, right?

661
00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:14,148
he knows Nathan Drake maybe not personally but he's watched so much Indiana Jones movies

662
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:16,209
that he knows exactly what this journey is about, right?

663
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:16,950
guess what?

664
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,952
he wants to be Indiana Jones he wants to be Nathan Drake

665
00:35:20,612 --> 00:35:21,913
so this is wish fulfillment, right?

666
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:26,095
and all games cater to this on a basic, in some shape or form, on a basic level

667
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:30,798
but this doesn't mean that it actually solves anything unless we execute it perfectly

668
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,860
like I don't want people to come away from this thinking

669
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:37,335
we just create a strongly characterized avatar based on a mythic archetype

670
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:39,296
and we're closing the identity gap.

671
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:40,716
It's actually quite the opposite.

672
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:43,857
I mean, this is where most bad stories come from in our games

673
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:46,837
because we keep acting like these guys instead of these guys.

674
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:50,858
And as a result, we keep creating this kind of shit instead of this.

675
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:56,019
So I didn't work on Uncharted 2.

676
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:01,180
The guys who did, did some awesome presentations last year on the development of the game.

677
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,800
So once again, I'm not here to analyze.

678
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:04,339
how they actually made the game.

679
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:07,080
I just want to show how all of this fits into the idea

680
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,001
of the identity bubble.

681
00:36:08,982 --> 00:36:12,144
So the thing is that gamers play games like Unshuttered 2

682
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:14,285
because they want to experience what it's like to be Nathan

683
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:14,826
Drake, right?

684
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:17,247
And they understand this long list of archetypes

685
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:19,929
that he's based on, most notably probably Alan

686
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:21,830
Quartermaine and Indiana Jones.

687
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:25,413
So as developers, then, we engage the perceived sense

688
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:27,294
of idealized self-identity fragment, right?

689
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:29,676
The player sees qualities of himself in a character

690
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:30,716
like Nathan Drake.

691
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:32,758
And then he looks for opportunity.

692
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:35,963
to reinforce this belief by playing the game.

693
00:36:37,684 --> 00:36:40,686
So the gamers' expectations of how this game should play out

694
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:43,548
are very much shaped by its inherent knowledge

695
00:36:43,688 --> 00:36:44,669
of the underlying story.

696
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:47,651
So we need to create a story that actually follows

697
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:48,231
those rules.

698
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:51,373
If I was to sum up Uncharted 2's narrative,

699
00:36:51,954 --> 00:36:54,576
or the rules underlying with just three screenshots,

700
00:36:54,956 --> 00:36:57,658
I could use Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade.

701
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,962
This is pretty much the story.

702
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:02,823
So Uncharted 2 is a road movie.

703
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:05,005
It's a story in which the journey is more important

704
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:05,906
than the destination.

705
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:08,007
And the fun thing is that it actually

706
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:10,669
works in Uncharted 2's favor, because while the same goes

707
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,730
for the gamer's agency expectations,

708
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:14,572
the journey is probably more important

709
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:15,692
than unlimited expression.

710
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:19,255
So our mystic understanding of the story

711
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:21,496
is the glue that's holding all of this stuff together.

712
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:25,199
It buys us a bit of leeway, because the journey isn't

713
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:27,561
actually quite as unpredictable and unexpected

714
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:28,721
as we think it might be.

715
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,242
I mean, we know we're going to get to Shambhala in the end, right?

716
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,662
The question is, how do we get there?

717
00:37:33,282 --> 00:37:35,563
And in fact, the one time Identity didn't work for me,

718
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:39,264
in Uncharted 2, is when Nathan Drake was trying to end the journey.

719
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:41,204
He was like somewhere in the Himalayans and he's saying,

720
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:42,065
you know, I've had enough.

721
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:43,345
I knew that wasn't true.

722
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:44,905
That was the one time it actually didn't work.

723
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:48,607
So, on top of this, then Naughty Dog comes in

724
00:37:48,787 --> 00:37:51,047
and they invest an ungodly amount of attention

725
00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:53,028
to actually realign player and character as well.

726
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:57,751
I think one of them is what Naughty Dog called the gap in one of those talks.

727
00:37:57,891 --> 00:38:02,693
It's this idea that for each unexpected obstacle that we're throwing in the player's way,

728
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:05,754
well, it wipes out all the information about the journey.

729
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:06,955
It levels the playing field.

730
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:09,376
It actually puts player and character on the same page,

731
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:12,277
because the information of what's ahead is actually wiped out.

732
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:16,119
The other thing they do is that when Nathan Drake does set a direction,

733
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,840
like he says, we have to go over there, it's always tied to a landmark.

734
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,801
So now the player can dig his teeth into that.

735
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:25,017
he can drive the action towards that landmark because he knows exactly where he's going.

736
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:31,802
So all of this already brings character and player closely together, but it's very low

737
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:32,362
frequency.

738
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:35,984
It only happens like every 30 seconds or 30 minutes or something like that, right?

739
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:37,485
So we need to do even more.

740
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:41,869
And this is very similar to what we saw in Fallout 3.

741
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:46,292
We also have to hook character and player together by fundamentally weaving the character's

742
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:49,714
identity into what it means to play the game, into the core gameplay actions.

743
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:53,822
So Nathan Drake is a treasure hunter at heart, right?

744
00:38:53,842 --> 00:38:55,822
The player acts out this character trait

745
00:38:55,842 --> 00:38:57,763
by searching for hidden treasure all over the place.

746
00:38:59,023 --> 00:38:59,723
Drake is clever.

747
00:38:59,823 --> 00:39:03,164
He has a knack for unraveling historic mysteries.

748
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:05,024
And this is a trait that we act out as the player

749
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:06,204
when we're solving all these puzzles.

750
00:39:06,704 --> 00:39:09,105
Now he's doing it, but we're doing it with him.

751
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:11,205
And finally, Drake is very resourceful.

752
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:13,305
And I think that's fundamentally woven

753
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:14,646
into the game's traversal gameplay.

754
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,346
Because we always get around situations

755
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:17,746
nobody else was able to pass.

756
00:39:18,186 --> 00:39:20,147
We always find the most clever way to get somewhere.

757
00:39:21,103 --> 00:39:26,146
On a base level, Unshuttered 2's gameplay actions are all geared towards reinforcing Nathan Drake's character, right?

758
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:29,808
And they're all geared towards making this guy very happy.

759
00:39:30,188 --> 00:39:33,849
Like, when the player plays this game, he knows what it's like to be Drake.

760
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:36,491
He almost feels like he's Nathan Drake, which is what he came for.

761
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:39,772
So there's a very high level of identification here, but...

762
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:45,075
Well, identification isn't a great term, because I don't think it quite expresses what it means to play this game.

763
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:47,916
What I want to call it instead is identity absorption.

764
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:51,814
And this is a term that's coming from Understanding Comics.

765
00:39:52,295 --> 00:39:55,195
It's a concept where Scott McCloud talks about the fact

766
00:39:55,215 --> 00:39:56,936
that when we're driving a car, we always

767
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:58,557
remain a separate entity from the car,

768
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,077
and we understand that, right?

769
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:03,878
But we often become so immersed in the driving experience

770
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:05,719
that we start talking about the car in first person.

771
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:07,339
We start saying, oh my god, he hit me.

772
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:09,240
He's cutting me off.

773
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,320
Well, guess what?

774
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,181
Nathan Drake is a vehicle, right?

775
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:12,741
He's a car.

776
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:15,162
So I think exactly the same thing is happening right here.

777
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:18,443
We don't become Nathan Drake, but we absorb his identity.

778
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:23,757
I think that's a good explanation of how we actually relate to a very strongly characterized avatar like this.

779
00:40:23,897 --> 00:40:27,517
If I had to state the design goals for both of these identity approaches,

780
00:40:28,418 --> 00:40:31,278
I would say that puppet avatars are about creating high agency,

781
00:40:31,978 --> 00:40:34,759
and vehicle avatars are about creating high identity absorption.

782
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:36,859
And that's the reason why Unshuttered 2 works.

783
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,340
Alright. So, I hope these have been very divergent examples, right,

784
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,041
of how we're actually creating player identity.

785
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:46,781
And hopefully you've seen the underlying identity concepts,

786
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:49,102
the double consciousness, and all that stuff shine through.

787
00:40:49,995 --> 00:40:53,918
So I want to finish this talk by just looking at some advice, some things that we can come

788
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:55,459
take away from this.

789
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,983
So before you're even writing the story, just ask yourself the question, what does it mean

790
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:00,464
to be X?

791
00:41:00,484 --> 00:41:01,925
What does it mean to be this character?

792
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:06,268
And then try to fundamentally express that identity in gameplay.

793
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:11,793
Because this way, like this feeling of character is constantly reinforced because the player's

794
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:13,695
gameplay actions keep

795
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:16,165
well, I keep aligning these two consciousness, right?

796
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:18,447
I mean, this is not something where we just establish a hook

797
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:20,729
between two identity frames and then they stay hooked together.

798
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,230
These are impulses that we send.

799
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,973
Those frames are always going to slowly drift apart,

800
00:41:24,993 --> 00:41:27,154
so we have to keep sending these little impulses that

801
00:41:27,214 --> 00:41:28,355
keep hooking them back together.

802
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:31,618
And if your character identity is fundamentally

803
00:41:31,718 --> 00:41:32,919
anchored in the gameplay actions,

804
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,961
you just keep doing this at a very high frequency.

805
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:38,664
Just to show you how important this concept is,

806
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,885
I want to look at Bioshock 2.

807
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:42,827
So this is my disclaimer that I really like Bioshock 2,

808
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:43,548
but.

809
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:50,137
this is the one game, or, this was an awesome game, but it had a really bad feeling of player identity.

810
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:55,119
Because, well, Bioshock 2 puts me into the role of a rogue big daddy, right?

811
00:41:55,159 --> 00:42:02,843
So, I played Bioshock 1, and I have a very, very clearly and narrowly defined idea of what big daddy stands for.

812
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:05,264
That he's badass protectors of those little girls.

813
00:42:05,684 --> 00:42:08,825
And then Bioshock 2 comes along, and it's very schizophrenic on its archetype.

814
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:12,732
On the one hand, many of the core gameplay actions treat me like I'm a human player.

815
00:42:12,752 --> 00:42:16,475
I'm eating fucking cream cakes and drinking coffee and I don't even know how.

816
00:42:16,515 --> 00:42:17,676
Does it go through the helmet?

817
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:19,057
To replenish my health.

818
00:42:19,658 --> 00:42:23,661
On the other hand, the game is expecting me to feel and sometimes act like a big daddy.

819
00:42:23,681 --> 00:42:27,544
That's the overriding motivation, actually, to get to the end of the story.

820
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,187
But then it presents with the choice of being able to harvest the little sisters, which

821
00:42:31,267 --> 00:42:33,169
once again is completely out of character.

822
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:37,993
So as I'm playing Mirror Shock 2, I have this really inconclusive treatment.

823
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:42,722
of the character's identity, and I think it starts like pricking needles into the identity

824
00:42:42,742 --> 00:42:44,184
bubble at a very high frequency.

825
00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:51,091
Because the moment-to-moment gameplay is communicating one thing, but then the overall story is

826
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,454
communicating a completely different direction of what the character is about.

827
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:59,199
So every time I eat a cream cake or harvest a little sister, character and player start

828
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:00,660
just drifting apart a little bit more.

829
00:43:02,473 --> 00:43:07,356
Microshock 2 was awesome, but I think like at the third level or so, it had lost all sense of identity for me,

830
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:09,658
because I didn't know what it meant to be a big daddy.

831
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,902
The main lesson I want you to take away from this is just this understanding of double consciousness,

832
00:43:15,182 --> 00:43:17,243
like with the character, player, and person model,

833
00:43:17,864 --> 00:43:22,807
and Harvey Smith's identity frames, which then form each identity fragments, which form each of this frame.

834
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:30,052
So I think most of bad game writing, 99% whatever, can be traced back to just treating games like we're writing for other media.

835
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,481
So hopefully you're able to explain to people why you shouldn't be doing that.

836
00:43:35,202 --> 00:43:39,083
And then I just hope to have imparted some concepts, some language we can use to come

837
00:43:39,123 --> 00:43:42,484
back and actually talk about games and about identity approaches.

838
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:49,106
If you know about this identity range, well, you can actually see where the games we talked

839
00:43:49,146 --> 00:43:50,847
about fall on this identity range, right?

840
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:55,708
And there's a bunch more examples, which all just kind of show you where they belong.

841
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,895
We can even use it to show how the approach changed between different games.

842
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,996
Like the last game I worked on is Dead Space 2.

843
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,758
Well, Dead Space 1 is very much on the left side.

844
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:10,681
Dead Space 2 comes along, adds a voice, it adds a lot of cutscenes and that kind of stuff to Isaac Clarke,

845
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:12,762
and it falls much more into the vehicle category.

846
00:44:13,002 --> 00:44:17,764
Resistance was very similar, where the approach changed between game 1 and 2, and we added a voice.

847
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:21,004
And all of this has been very much about action games, right?

848
00:44:21,024 --> 00:44:22,084
Because that's what I work on.

849
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:24,025
You can actually use it for other genres as well,

850
00:44:24,065 --> 00:44:24,666
like rock band.

851
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:26,186
Like the main rock band experience

852
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:27,907
is all about building your own rock hood.

853
00:44:28,427 --> 00:44:30,628
But rock band's Beatles is all about reliving

854
00:44:30,688 --> 00:44:31,709
somebody else's journey.

855
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:32,990
It's the vehicle rock band.

856
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,391
And I know Guitar Hero is dead now,

857
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:39,573
but there's even a distinction right there between rock band

858
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:40,373
and Guitar Hero.

859
00:44:40,433 --> 00:44:43,675
Because, well, Guitar Hero was always about.

860
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:48,066
we're living like collecting all of these rock stars and playing as them, right?

861
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:49,387
So that's where the difference was there.

862
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:55,350
So we can create a similar chart for the mythic quality of various games, right?

863
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,711
Myth-building, myth-creation, and myth-recalling.

864
00:44:57,851 --> 00:45:02,734
Once again, we got those games that we talked about in this talk, and there's a whole bunch

865
00:45:02,774 --> 00:45:04,875
of other games that fall into the spectrum as well.

866
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:10,438
So if you've been tasked with coming up with a story, a character for a game,

867
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:14,229
Here's some quick closing thoughts on that. Figure out what kind of game you're making.

868
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,431
Are you making a puppet game? Are you making a vehicle game? Are you making something in between?

869
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:24,854
All approaches are valid. I subscribe to a certain philosophy, but, you know, in the industry, all of these approaches are valid.

870
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:28,255
But they're going to guide what you should and shouldn't do, and you need to understand this.

871
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:32,837
If you're going to make a puppet game, it might be non-linear. It's going to have an emphasis on the player story.

872
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:36,699
It's going to be about the player allowing, like, building his own myth.

873
00:45:37,345 --> 00:45:42,769
There might not be cutscenes because I think that would take away control from the player and it's very much against that concept.

874
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:49,834
If you're making a vehicle game, well it's probably going to be highly structured and it's going to be linear and it's going to have an emphasis on with recall.

875
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:57,799
You might be able to use cutscenes, you probably can, you can use pre-offered character traits and you can use those traits to propel the story forward.

876
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:03,443
So I think puppet games are easier generally when it comes to just the identity approach.

877
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:05,304
They're going to be much harder on various other levels.

878
00:46:06,337 --> 00:46:08,938
So if you are making a vehicle game, be very careful.

879
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:11,679
Be 100% sure you understand what you're getting yourself into.

880
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:15,200
Because I've kind of danced around the issue, but if you are making a vehicle game,

881
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,341
you're making a fucking talking car, right?

882
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,703
And those talking cars might have been awesome in the 80s, especially where I come from, but...

883
00:46:21,723 --> 00:46:26,925
you know, they can be annoying. They can even be completely unnecessary, right?

884
00:46:27,605 --> 00:46:29,026
I mean, just imagine you're driving down Highway 1,

885
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:32,887
and you're witnessing this beautiful sunset over the Pacific Ocean.

886
00:46:32,907 --> 00:46:34,308
You're just sitting there, you're appreciating,

887
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:36,048
and then all of a sudden, you hear this voice saying...

888
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,388
Ah, look at that beautiful sunset.

889
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,729
And you realize, fuck, I'm sitting in my car.

890
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:41,989
My car is talking to me.

891
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,910
And I'm not sure if this remark really enhanced the moment.

892
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,252
I mean, it should probably be appreciated and experienced

893
00:46:49,272 --> 00:46:50,292
in quite appreciation.

894
00:46:50,332 --> 00:46:52,233
So you can do this, of course.

895
00:46:52,293 --> 00:46:54,134
I mean, this is a very personal decision.

896
00:46:54,174 --> 00:46:57,095
I'm just trying to point out that every time the character

897
00:46:57,195 --> 00:46:59,736
expresses a sentiment and that's not shared by the player,

898
00:46:59,936 --> 00:47:01,396
well, you're widening the identity gap.

899
00:47:01,977 --> 00:47:03,217
You're making them drift apart.

900
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:09,667
So finally, understand the underlying myth of the game.

901
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:11,468
And this is especially important when you're

902
00:47:11,488 --> 00:47:13,849
creating a story-driven game, like with a vehicle character.

903
00:47:13,889 --> 00:47:14,830
It's actually imperative.

904
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,531
So you must identify and execute on a myth

905
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:20,212
that the game will be based on, or it's going to feel aimless.

906
00:47:20,573 --> 00:47:22,254
The player won't really know where it's going,

907
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:23,234
and it's going to feel hollow.

908
00:47:23,694 --> 00:47:25,715
And of course, this lecture can dive into the subject.

909
00:47:25,755 --> 00:47:26,716
We're pretty much done now.

910
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:28,737
But if you are looking for some further reading,

911
00:47:28,877 --> 00:47:31,238
I suggest the late Blake Snyder's book,

912
00:47:31,278 --> 00:47:34,480
Save the Cat Goes to the Movie, which I think the Unshutter 2

913
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,640
team used as well.

914
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:42,200
So, both types, myth-building games like Fallout, right, or myth-recalling experiences like

915
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,761
Uncharted have merit, and I think players seek them out equally, but for completely

916
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:46,341
different reasons.

917
00:47:46,902 --> 00:47:50,463
So as a designer, you need to understand the distinction between those types, and then

918
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,864
take the differences into account when you're designing a game.

919
00:47:54,184 --> 00:47:56,765
But when it comes to myth reinforcement, I really believe in that, right?

920
00:47:56,805 --> 00:48:01,027
And I believe in that because I'm a game designer, and game design is kind of a black art.

921
00:48:01,467 --> 00:48:04,588
There aren't very many fundamental facts that I can hang my head on.

922
00:48:05,022 --> 00:48:09,804
It's up to all of us here to come up with our own belief systems about what makes games work and what doesn't work.

923
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:15,588
Then we might even go out and we're looking, we're perusing the media landscape, we're finding various psychological tests,

924
00:48:16,128 --> 00:48:18,429
texts because, you know, we want to reinforce that belief.

925
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:23,352
We might come to specific GDC talks because, you know what, if they tell us what we believe in,

926
00:48:23,952 --> 00:48:26,794
it's very comforting to know that you can trust in your own beliefs.

927
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:31,217
So this right here is my belief system on player identity and I hope you found it useful.

928
00:48:31,777 --> 00:48:33,158
Maybe you can even make it your own.

929
00:48:33,858 --> 00:48:35,779
But no matter what, thanks very much for coming.

930
00:48:46,948 --> 00:48:49,109
So we have about 10 minutes for questions.

931
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,331
If you do have a question, please use the microphones.

932
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:54,293
And I want to remind you again to please return

933
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:55,074
those feedback forms.

934
00:48:55,874 --> 00:48:57,956
I never bring a pen, so what I've been doing recently,

935
00:48:57,996 --> 00:49:01,558
I just use my fingernail to even just circle whatever you like.

936
00:49:02,964 --> 00:49:03,706
It's going to be helpful.

937
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:05,529
So yes, if anybody has questions, please.

938
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:24,237
that in such an approach the characters of the games, which are characters of the players of the games,

939
00:49:24,257 --> 00:49:28,741
to know these certain kinds of motivations that we have as players of games,

940
00:49:29,682 --> 00:49:32,845
about aggression, challenge, overcoming obstacles,

941
00:49:32,945 --> 00:49:38,190
what you said about duration of the minutes, for example,

942
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,571
can't be decided by that.

943
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:49,272
And it seems to imply that if we want to explore other kinds of heritage motivations,

944
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:54,514
that are more moral, we have to go to the vehicle model.

945
00:49:54,674 --> 00:49:58,014
We have to abandon this heritage, this English heritage.

946
00:49:58,434 --> 00:50:03,556
So do you think then that it's possible to achieve what Cliff Hockney wished for

947
00:50:03,796 --> 00:50:06,956
when he said, wouldn't it be great if all of Jesus was about Jesus?

948
00:50:07,096 --> 00:50:09,717
Wouldn't it be great if everybody was about one?

949
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:20,281
Do you think that the invoke of Sardinian procedural wrenches can't be used to prove those facts?

950
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:27,966
It seems to have motivations by design and the game system in such a way that it is a fact.

951
00:50:40,285 --> 00:50:42,547
So I'm not going to disagree with Clint Hawking because he's my boss.

952
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,289
And I don't actually want to express that at all.

953
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:50,171
What I'm saying is that if you do have a primal motivation,

954
00:50:50,231 --> 00:50:52,072
something that a caveman understands,

955
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:56,394
it's very easy for the player to understand how to act on that motivation.

956
00:50:56,454 --> 00:50:58,135
I don't have to explain it at all.

957
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,976
If you do want to express hope in a game,

958
00:51:01,036 --> 00:51:03,878
and you want to anchor that systemically, or duty, or whatever,

959
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:11,421
it's going to take much longer, it's going to take much more explanation, it's actually going to explain to you how those gameplay systems are tied together

960
00:51:12,142 --> 00:51:20,570
um, or, well, I think this is, I could talk about this for like two hours, but, um, I'm not saying it's impossible, in fact I think that's where we should go

961
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:27,456
I'm saying in the current landscape, in the way, I mean, um, just looking at the games we have right now

962
00:51:28,608 --> 00:51:30,649
it's going to be, well, it's difficult, right?

963
00:51:30,669 --> 00:51:34,512
I mean, it's going to take you hours and hours to actually establish the framework

964
00:51:35,073 --> 00:51:39,256
of actually getting the player into the world of the game to understand how he might act on duty.

965
00:51:39,656 --> 00:51:42,938
It's going to take you several hours just to establish the duty in the first place

966
00:51:42,998 --> 00:51:47,542
because all this inherent understanding that defines us in the world, right?

967
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:50,224
I'm going to feel duty to my country because I've lived there for 35 years.

968
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:55,623
I need to cram that into at least two, three hours or whatever in the game to actually

969
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:58,985
get to the point where that matches what would be going on in the real world.

970
00:51:59,905 --> 00:52:01,186
That's more what I was trying to say.

971
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:03,387
Yes?

972
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:20,775
So the question is, am I...

973
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:26,312
well, it's the reason why I'm taking an academic approach, or seemingly academic approach to this,

974
00:52:26,392 --> 00:52:29,153
because we're lacking that kind of language as an industry.

975
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,415
Honestly, I'm just doing, I'm just talking about it.

976
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:37,536
I think what's really humbling when you're doing these kind of talks is that everything you want to talk about

977
00:52:37,676 --> 00:52:39,577
actually is expressed somewhere in rules of play.

978
00:52:40,328 --> 00:52:44,310
We do have all this academia, and it's out there. All the information is out there.

979
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,170
The way I talk about this is just kind of colored by that.

980
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:53,272
If I'm finding these kind of things in Rules of Play, if I'm finding it in Shared Fantasy,

981
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:57,493
which was written by academics to a varying degree, at least it gives us language.

982
00:52:57,593 --> 00:52:59,793
At least it gives us a certain way to talk about stuff.

983
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:04,585
So yes, LULU narrative parity is not something I want to say more than five times.

984
00:53:04,665 --> 00:53:07,787
Having to say myth reinforcement, which has a fucking TH at the end,

985
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,488
has been a real chore just talking about in this talk.

986
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,029
But I mean, if that's language we can use,

987
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:16,090
you know, to come back next GDC and start talking about the concepts,

988
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:16,950
then I'm all for that.

989
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:18,571
So that's where that comes from.

990
00:53:42,327 --> 00:53:46,670
I think it goes into something that Ken Hudson talked about on Wednesday night, actually.

991
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:47,631
Everybody can look it up.

992
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:49,012
He was talking about exactly that.

993
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:50,213
How do we get gamer...

994
00:53:50,797 --> 00:53:52,198
or player-derived narrative.

995
00:53:52,618 --> 00:53:54,300
And what are some, he had like, he talked about it

996
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,041
for 10 minutes, how we take something

997
00:53:56,061 --> 00:54:00,025
that's in a high AAA production, like high value cut scene,

998
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:02,507
and how we might be able to get around that.

999
00:54:02,587 --> 00:54:05,049
So I think there's various ways we can go about that.

1000
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:06,911
Like, the one thing I'm gonna mention,

1001
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:11,875
Ken was talking about, use voice synthesis, right?

1002
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,837
I mean, you might not have a human character,

1003
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,299
you might have a computer or something.

1004
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:18,761
So if you need to generate large amounts of,

1005
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:22,384
text or voice or whatever, build your story around that.

1006
00:54:23,004 --> 00:54:25,166
So we just have to be clever about it.

1007
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:29,951
I think that, I mean I love Unshuttered 2, Dead Space 2 very much goes in the same direction.

1008
00:54:30,011 --> 00:54:34,075
I think it's going to be a road that we're going to wear ourselves out at some point

1009
00:54:34,115 --> 00:54:36,877
because we have to keep piling and piling and piling on top.

1010
00:54:37,138 --> 00:54:41,662
And what we're doing by this, we're not even creating something that's inherently new to

1011
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:42,202
our medium.

1012
00:54:42,243 --> 00:54:43,564
It doesn't really play to our strengths.

1013
00:54:43,604 --> 00:54:44,405
The only thing we can do...

1014
00:54:45,111 --> 00:54:48,712
And an experience like that is be a movie, but interactively.

1015
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,932
So I think that adds a little bit of meaning on top of it,

1016
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:53,953
because we've actually done something.

1017
00:54:53,993 --> 00:54:55,834
We've actually taken the ring to Mordor

1018
00:54:55,874 --> 00:54:57,594
and said, let's just watch somebody doing it.

1019
00:54:58,394 --> 00:55:01,175
But it's like a delta of 20% or something on top of it.

1020
00:55:01,455 --> 00:55:02,995
So I think as the future goes, we

1021
00:55:03,055 --> 00:55:05,636
need to go to more of a fallout experience.

1022
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:07,036
We need to go into something that's

1023
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:10,197
more complementary, a little narrative parity,

1024
00:55:10,297 --> 00:55:10,837
stuff like that.

1025
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:25,246
one of the only ways to create a stronger bond between this bubble identity bubble between

1026
00:55:25,266 --> 00:55:27,007
the player and the character, versus the app or the browser?

1027
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:27,808
No, that's what I'm not trying to say.

1028
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:30,450
Sorry if that's how it came along, I just did a terrible, terrible job.

1029
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:35,293
Now, the way we get to this identity bubble is expressing what the story is about in gameplay

1030
00:55:35,353 --> 00:55:35,653
actions.

1031
00:55:36,053 --> 00:55:37,514
That's, I mean, that's the simple answer.

1032
00:55:38,075 --> 00:55:40,736
We need to make sure we know what it means to be that character.

1033
00:55:41,153 --> 00:55:44,975
And what it means to be that character, what his motivation is about, needs to be expressed

1034
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:48,957
in gameplay, because otherwise, you're completely floating on two different tracks.

1035
00:55:49,897 --> 00:55:50,057
Yeah.

1036
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,101
Yeah.

1037
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:57,321
Mm-hmm.

1038
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:07,547
Mm-hmm.

1039
00:56:09,997 --> 00:56:21,819
about being heroic and being able to stop, how do you minimize the effects of bringing

1040
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:22,800
a new actor or changing the character that way?

1041
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,060
I love Brutal Legend for the reason that when it comes to identity, like what I'm doing

1042
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,881
in the game is totally expressed in his identity, right?

1043
00:56:28,981 --> 00:56:30,822
This complementary match the entire time.

1044
00:56:30,882 --> 00:56:33,282
I'm a roadie, I know what it means to organize an army.

1045
00:56:33,802 --> 00:56:37,023
So the entire game is about organizing an army in a slightly different context.

1046
00:56:37,743 --> 00:56:38,763
So that part is cool.

1047
00:56:39,624 --> 00:56:41,865
my honest answer would be don't hire Jack Black.

1048
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,727
I mean, it's the same problem you're going to have.

1049
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:45,848
I like Jack Black, but it's the same problem

1050
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:48,310
you're going to have when he does Kung Fu Panda or something

1051
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:48,730
like that.

1052
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,312
Can I see a panda, or do I see Jack Black doing that?

1053
00:56:52,893 --> 00:56:54,294
I mean, unless you really engross

1054
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:57,617
the player in the experience and make him forget that it's Jack

1055
00:56:57,657 --> 00:57:00,279
Black, if that's really a sticking point,

1056
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:01,019
that's really important.

1057
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:04,041
Then I would say, well, go to an anonymous voice actor.

1058
00:57:05,582 --> 00:57:07,364
I don't know if that's an awesome answer, but I mean,

1059
00:57:07,384 --> 00:57:07,784
the end.

1060
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,085
I think it's so personal, right?

1061
00:57:10,105 --> 00:57:13,847
Some people can't see past Jack Black, other people are going to think it's awesome because

1062
00:57:13,907 --> 00:57:15,328
Jack Black actually stands for something.

1063
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:19,390
He actually involves the person in a way, because I understand what he stands for, right?

1064
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,192
He's all about rock appreciation, stuff like that.

1065
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:24,193
So for other people, it might have worked perfectly.

1066
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:24,914
Yeah.

1067
00:57:24,934 --> 00:57:28,376
Okay, I think one more question.

1068
00:57:48,823 --> 00:57:50,184
I ran out of time.

1069
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:54,045
I mean, I think, when we're looking at this, this is an awesome model for modeling addiction,

1070
00:57:54,486 --> 00:57:54,646
right?

1071
00:57:54,706 --> 00:57:58,947
Like, if you do create a strongly characterized avatar, like a vehicle game more or less,

1072
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:01,989
and let's say he's, well, he's an alcoholic, right?

1073
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:05,750
And the only, well, the way you play the game, you need to make sure it has two tracks, right?

1074
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:07,531
The very end, not like the virgin tracks.

1075
00:58:07,908 --> 00:58:12,431
But at the very end, you're going to go through the story regardless, but you're either going to put him in the loony bin,

1076
00:58:12,471 --> 00:58:16,614
you're going to turn him into somebody who's completely, you know, a raging alcoholic,

1077
00:58:16,714 --> 00:58:19,315
or you actually allow him to slowly get off that.

1078
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:23,398
The way you do that then, and I think that's where Bioshock 2 specifically failed,

1079
00:58:23,438 --> 00:58:26,380
is you make that a value choice which is asymmetrical.

1080
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,783
Make sure that you give the player a lot of systemic value for drinking more and more alcohol.

1081
00:58:33,704 --> 00:58:41,347
So if he goes through the game drinking more of my alcohol, it's going to turn the player character, the avatar, into this alcoholic, which is bad, but it's going to give him a lot of benefits.

1082
00:58:41,687 --> 00:58:52,673
On the other hand, if I want to play the game in a way that it's actually going to heal this guy from alcoholism, and I'm still going to get to the end, but it's going to be much harder to do, well, that's the value choice right there.

1083
00:58:53,273 --> 00:58:57,855
So I think we're going to find, like, I don't know what the exact distribution was for the little sisters.

1084
00:58:58,015 --> 00:59:00,376
I mean, the problem with Bioshock was that...

1085
00:59:01,195 --> 00:59:05,578
Ultimately, harvesting or not harvesting the little sisters was systemically exactly the same.

1086
00:59:06,158 --> 00:59:09,059
But I think that's where you start, you know, that's where you start.

1087
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,521
You then go into a room and ask how many people turned him into an alcoholic?

1088
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:15,623
How many people tried to maintain this equilibrium?

1089
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:19,524
And how many people just said, you know what, I'm gonna be good, I had to put in much more work,

1090
00:59:19,605 --> 00:59:23,667
but hey guys, I'm a fucking angel because, you know, I went through all this hardship

1091
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:29,169
because my digital character, you know, came out and he got back his family and did all that stuff.

1092
00:59:31,727 --> 00:59:33,226
Thank you very much, enjoy the rest.
