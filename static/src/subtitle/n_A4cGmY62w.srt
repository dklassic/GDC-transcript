00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:08,655
Hi everyone, my name is Santo Averio Ojeda.

2
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:15,260
I'm a director at BrujerÃ­a at Work, which is a local arts collective based in Canada

3
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:20,544
of different artists and collaborators working together to make unusual game experiences.

4
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:25,808
And this talk called Making Witches Talk in Don't Make the Night is about our first project,

5
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:27,730
which was released in 2019.

6
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:34,324
And the talk will cover some points about the narrative design as well as gameplay loops

7
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:44,008
that we used to make the game and how we approach the more non-linear method to develop the story.

8
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:54,594
So specifically what the talk will cover is identifying the bias in storytelling. So that

9
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:58,255
means how we made sure that

10
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:08,399
The story didn't favor one specific storyline or character or preconceived notion of what the story means.

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,787
Crafting mechanics that carry stories, so making sure that the storytelling is really solid with the game design loop.

12
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:22,493
Then relying on visual cues, how we use art direction as well as...

13
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:24,589
So we're going to be talking about the overall story,

14
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,891
and how we used general game design to tell a story without outright telling it in the text.

15
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:34,133
As well as building an arc and developing non-linear storytelling.

16
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:38,095
So how we really went into making sure that from beginning to end,

17
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:45,358
the overarching theme of the story made sense as the player begins and ends the game.

18
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:51,061
So to cover those points, I'll also go into a little bit of the background.

19
00:01:51,907 --> 00:02:01,151
of how Don't Wake the Night came to be and how we wanted to create this game with a very

20
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:02,252
experimental approach.

21
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:11,135
So a little bit of background is Don't Wake the Night was a game that was developed between

22
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:11,415
2017 and 2019.

23
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:20,031
It's a 2D point and click game with visual novel elements that tells the story of a community at a crossroads.

24
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:35,174
And the players basically tasked with finding out why this community is facing this conflict and seeing if there's anything they can do to help these community members, you know, come to some solution.

25
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:41,535
So the practicals are developed in part, and thanks to provincial municipal funding in Ontario.

26
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:45,518
and Toronto from the Ontario Arts Council and Toronto Arts Council,

27
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:52,124
which allowed myself and several collaborators to bring this game to life. So a little bit of

28
00:02:52,164 --> 00:03:00,992
background on myself. I've been making games for quite a while now and I specialize in Indigenous

29
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:07,198
Guarani-inspired stories, knowing that I was kind of the first project that I took on.

30
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:12,459
that was very much influenced by that and that I worked on with other collaborators.

31
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:20,366
And with Don't Wake the Night, it was very much also inspired by 2D animation and 2D animation design.

32
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:26,731
As a background, I come from 2D animation, but then I kind of veered into game design,

33
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:32,476
and so I kind of combined the two together to create the design for this game.

34
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:47,933
As well as working with other folks local to Toronto to release this game to itch in 2019 and most recently was released to steam in October of 2020.

35
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:57,616
So, generally, Don't Wake the Night has a core gameplay loop of two different aspects.

36
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:01,630
That happens between two main camera views.

37
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,536
So the first one that you see here is kind of a scene overview of a bird's eye view,

38
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:10,060
where you're able to see all the characters in one scene.

39
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,487
You're able to see, you know, if they any like clickable elements in the scene,

40
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,831
you can click around and interact with.

41
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:34,578
The environment itself, you can see if there's any conversations available to view with speech bubbles here, which when you click them, they take you to the second scene overview, which is the one that is more directly visual novel inspired.

42
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:50,462
So basically, the player will interact and then switch between these two views, depending on whether they're interacting with the environment or whether they need to view character dialogue to gather more context about what's happening in the game.

43
00:04:52,005 --> 00:05:00,187
So one of the key aspects to this loop that we really wanted to get across is that the player

44
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:05,729
themselves are omnipresent, which means that you know they can you can view everything at once

45
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:11,090
but they're also absent at the same time. So you have a degree of influence in the scene but

46
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,231
you can't talk to the characters directly, you can't

47
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:18,859
You can't control individual characters as a player,

48
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,401
so you can kind of influence their actions,

49
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:24,864
but not directly make some kind of final decision

50
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:25,605
on their behalf.

51
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,468
So you're able to affect the environments

52
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:33,252
by touching several objects in the scene, which

53
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:35,113
elicit reactions from the characters themselves.

54
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,836
But again, you can't actually talk to the characters

55
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:40,558
and make choices on their behalf,

56
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,159
but you can view their conversations.

57
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,940
Depending on these different objects that you're touching the scene.

58
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:55,123
So you're primarily a bystander who's seen, but who's not seen, but felt, not heard, but sensed.

59
00:05:55,303 --> 00:06:07,886
So it's a kind of spiritual presence where, you know, you can sense it, but you know, you can't see anything concrete, you can't necessarily, you know, reach out and touch something physical.

60
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:12,127
So with this gameplay loop, it was also very...

61
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:16,937
heavily inspired by Guarani storytelling and spirituality.

62
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,464
So that's something that I generally work pretty closely with in narrative design as well as

63
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:29,971
gameplay design in general. So basically the player is meant to emulate a spirit where

64
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,704
They are not permitted to talk to these living characters,

65
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:37,346
but they can kind of influence the scene around them.

66
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:42,971
So that's kind of something I'll also touch on shortly in more

67
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:46,273
depth, but basically that's kind of what influenced

68
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,654
that gameplay decision.

69
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:52,979
So one of the.

70
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:59,280
most challenging aspects of Don't Wake the Night is having to identify the bias in the narrative.

71
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,983
So since the point of the game is to be a bystander, this means that

72
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:10,545
there's no actual influence on character dialogue. You can't really,

73
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:16,048
you know, make decisions or change anything. You can only really kind of watch what happens.

74
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:25,274
So the only choice that you really have is to view the conversations in, you know, whatever order that you would like to.

75
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:35,401
And the main challenge behind this approach is building a narrative that is not heavily biased towards one interpretation of the story or one particular character.

76
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:42,205
So we had to make really sure in reviewing both the gameplay loop and the actual dialogue that

77
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:48,201
You know, one character was since being focused more over others.

78
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:52,925
So there came a point where, you know, we had the dialogue in spreadsheets.

79
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:57,348
We had the dialogue on several different documents and we had to like,

80
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,512
run search and see like, okay, does this character get mentioned a lot more

81
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:03,073
than this other character?

82
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:06,977
Is this character getting enough dialogue lines so that the player can

83
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:10,840
actually get an idea of like what type of personality they have or.

84
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:15,567
Um, what type of, you know, interest they might have.

85
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:21,932
Um, so obviously this can vary because some characters might be more reserved than others so they talk less.

86
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:25,595
Uh, but the key aspect is to at least give the character to,

87
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,357
you know, enough space so that they can like,

88
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:34,042
express the personality that they we've assigned them and to also make sure that,

89
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:37,644
uh, you know, this game does not really have like a main character.

90
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:40,767
The main character in theory is the player because they are the ones that

91
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,929
And that's the main focus of this gameplay.

92
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:51,332
But, you know, we were really careful that that bias was identified pretty early.

93
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:58,735
Because the mystery of the story is that there's a conflict that you're tasked with solving, but there's no context.

94
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:02,917
There's no actual direction on what that is.

95
00:09:04,118 --> 00:09:10,441
So the point of the game is to really, you know, listen in on these conversations and kind of gather clues and hints to...

96
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:15,577
make you understand a little bit more of what the characters might be going through,

97
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:21,399
while still not getting the full picture. Because at the end of the day, you're a stranger in this

98
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,941
community and you've never met any of these people personally. You're just kind of dropped in and

99
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:32,402
you're expected to kind of know what's going on. So part of the mystery of the game is to

100
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:40,005
kind of feel out what conflict is and whether or not, you know, some conversations

101
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:43,787
reveal more of the nature of that conflict or whether they're just more,

102
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:48,730
you know, playful, everyday kind of small talk conversations

103
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,511
between people who know each other.

104
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:57,134
So that meant because of this narrative direction that the bias

105
00:09:57,174 --> 00:10:00,736
had to be rooted out pretty early in development.

106
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:04,298
So from the very beginning in creating a narrative system

107
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:08,060
that's grounded more nonlinear storytelling and storytelling techniques.

108
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:18,994
We had to really make sure that the conversations had a main idea, that they were abstract, but that they still made sense.

109
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:28,860
So we favored abstract conversations over anything that was linear or contextualized, just to really favor the type of direction we were going for.

110
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:49,260
And a particular way we approach this in Dueling the Night is basically by posting questions that players might already have about the game coming in or asking questions about what might come up later in the game, but only skirting around the answers.

111
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:56,535
You know, not giving the full answer, just kind of like half of it, or even just a small piece of it.

112
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:04,078
And this is usually shown in the game by characters alluding to something that happened or

113
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:11,321
mentioning something or an event that the player never actually saw. So that could be like a

114
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:16,203
character saying like, you know, something happened last week and I didn't like it.

115
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:22,597
Which, it just says something, right? So there's no actual context as to what happened.

116
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:29,541
So it doesn't really let us know anything, and it doesn't really, you know, give us any clear

117
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:37,005
context. But what it does tell us is like two key things, which is one, the passage of time,

118
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:41,807
and two, the character's personal reaction to that. So we know that

119
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,414
It happened last week.

120
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:46,017
We know that the character didn't like it.

121
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:52,163
So it's more similar to bumping into two people talking

122
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:55,546
to each other and kind of coming in halfway

123
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:56,887
into their conversation.

124
00:11:57,588 --> 00:12:01,051
And generally when that happens, you

125
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:05,696
have to gather context from them to understand and catch up

126
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:06,697
to what they were talking to.

127
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:06,937
But.

128
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:11,217
Of course, in this game, you don't have any kind of direct interaction with characters,

129
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:14,038
which means that you can't ask them those questions.

130
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:19,320
You can't ask them like, oh, what was this about or what did this mean?

131
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,601
You're just kind of overlooking them as they talk.

132
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:28,083
So it's almost like peering into this somewhat intimate,

133
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:32,044
maybe personal conversation that you have no context of,

134
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:35,985
and then kind of trying to get the impression that characters have of it.

135
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:42,497
So it's nothing concrete or informative, but it can tell you a lot about intent and personality.

136
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:48,781
So it can tell you a lot about, you know, whether this character, what their general disposition is

137
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:55,926
in any type of conversation. It might tell you that this person is, you know, good enough friends

138
00:12:55,946 --> 00:13:02,650
with this other character to actually divulge that to them. Or it could be that, you know,

139
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,932
this character is just very open and they tell everything to everyone.

140
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:13,796
So that's also another approach we took really closely when we identified, you know, what kind of characters we want to work with.

141
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:30,786
So there's about seven characters, eight characters that you know you see regularly throughout the game. And these characters, each have like a specific personality that really influences their narrative style so even just in this screenshot of the opening

142
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:34,909
cutscene of the game, you can see that the character on the left.

143
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:40,278
tends to be a little bit more, um, maybe like short tempered,

144
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:44,560
uh, and the character on the right tends to, uh,

145
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,642
get into trouble but also tries to avoid trouble at the same time.

146
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,762
Uh,

147
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:54,924
so we kind of came up with like very basic dynamics between each character so

148
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:58,846
that we could work out what kind of conversations they could be having,

149
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:03,728
what might they like to talk about? Maybe the character on the left, um,

150
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,201
The character on the left likes a certain type of activity. The character on the right likes gardening.

151
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:13,362
So maybe that could somehow influence what they like to talk about.

152
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:24,406
And the mechanics of the game were very much influenced like from a narrative first perspective.

153
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:29,327
So Don't Wake the Night was very much a game that started out you know with the story being

154
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:33,628
written first and then the game mechanics came second and so was the game design.

155
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:41,374
So in the game, you know, we have these characters, they're each named after a specific role that they play in their community.

156
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:49,359
Things like gardener, listener, actions that they take in their community to basically make sure it runs smoothly.

157
00:14:49,859 --> 00:15:01,986
So all those kind of things like names and locations and some backstory were developed and fleshed out before we really decided on what kind of mechanical approach we wanted to take with the game.

158
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:02,907
We definitely knew that.

159
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:07,801
It would be a more narrative focused game with text dialogue and characters talking to one another.

160
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:12,806
We just weren't sure whether or not, you know, how these characters being

161
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:17,369
interacting with one another, how the player come in to make sure that these characters

162
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:22,473
talk to one another or, you know, what would happen, you know, to the ending and

163
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:23,694
things like that mechanically.

164
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:29,079
So this meant that the mechanics also had to accommodate.

165
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:36,254
A certain style of nonlinear storytelling so that players could access key components in the game at the right time

166
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:41,056
And parse information in a way that was more fluid and out of order

167
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:44,318
It's also a shorter game. So it's about 20 minutes

168
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:51,041
And that also meant that the approach that made the most sense was a point and click route to kind of give that

169
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:55,443
Omnipresent feeling where you're kind of looking over all the characters at the same time

170
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:59,607
And we also had to narrow down the amount of character conversations

171
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:05,789
by the number of interactable objects we actually wanted in the scene.

172
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,891
So with that in mind, it also became important to give players a chance to

173
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:15,552
always go back to conversations if they wish to review any previous dialogue.

174
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:20,774
So when you view dialogue once in Doming the Night, it's not locked away forever.

175
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:25,695
You can always, you know, re-trigger the same environmental cue.

176
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:33,170
And then go back to that conversation and review it and see, you know, if something makes more sense reading it the second time.

177
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:44,800
And part of that is also that because the conversations are non-linear, it might mean that you read, you know, conversation A first, then you go to another conversation, conversation B.

178
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,424
And then after reading that, you know, maybe you pick up on something that is like, oh, I think.

179
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,953
This previous conversation might have had another reference to the thing that this character is talking about, so you decide to go back.

180
00:16:56,553 --> 00:17:00,796
And now that conversation makes a little bit more sense than it previously did.

181
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:15,243
So that's the kind of narrative loop that we wanted to encourage to make sure that, you know, you can still view older conversations at any moment in case that helps in contextualizing what a character is saying.

182
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:22,903
And this also helps tie in the sense of non-linear movement in the game, since there's no prerequisites

183
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:27,544
to access certain conversations and they don't have to be completed in a specific order.

184
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:33,745
So the only prerequisite is that you have to interact with that environment asset.

185
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:40,147
So usually that involves like in the game either you know wrestle a branch or you touch a trunk or

186
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:45,508
you drop a fruit from a tree and that like elicits a reaction from the characters and it makes them go

187
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:48,056
You know, break out into different conversations.

188
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:51,402
That's the only requirement really to access conversations.

189
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:54,126
But other than that, you can just do them in any order.

190
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:57,813
You don't have to, you know, click the branch first or click the trunk second.

191
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:04,323
The only thing in the game that is really a more binary choice is towards the end.

192
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:08,746
Once you have viewed all the conversations, the game will offer you to end it

193
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:13,230
by basically adding one more object to the scene.

194
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:18,554
And if you click that object, it will bring up a choice of three different endings.

195
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:21,496
And you can kind of choose what ending you would like to view,

196
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:27,721
and then it takes you to the credits and to the cutscene that wraps up the game for the player.

197
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:43,141
And generally with the narrative cues, we also made sure that one thing that really helped also contextualize the player into the scene was having cutscenes at the beginning and the end of the game.

198
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:56,011
So the game will open up with about a minute long cutscene that is animated by hand and that kind of brings the player into the world that the characters inhabit.

199
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:56,852
So it will kind of...

200
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,973
You know, show you what the characters are doing before you actually start the game.

201
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:07,656
And it will give you a little bit of like an initial context as to why you're there

202
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:11,338
and maybe what the characters are looking for.

203
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:16,721
So in this case, the characters summon a spirit because they want help from this

204
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:21,143
spiritual being to like solve their community conflicts.

205
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:25,766
So that's kind of shown at the beginning to help contextualize that event a little

206
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:26,166
bit more.

207
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:30,350
And then at the end, there are cut scenes that are shorter,

208
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,792
whether about maybe like 20 to 30 seconds long,

209
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:35,834
that just help kind of wrap up

210
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:39,037
any kind of loose threads of the game,

211
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,558
but still keeps it very open.

212
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:46,777
So that the player is encouraged to kind of go back and replay the game to see the other endings as well.

213
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:53,004
And on top of that we also used a little bit of voice acting in the opening cutscenes and

214
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:59,071
the ending cutscenes because we found that it also really helped give a sense to the

215
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:02,715
character's personality. So we worked with several different

216
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:11,532
People for voice talents to make sure that each character kind of had a character or a voice actor that

217
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:14,353
made sense to their character and

218
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:18,154
that way when you're watching the opening cutscene you are already kind of getting a

219
00:20:18,234 --> 00:20:21,516
little bit of an impression of what each character is like

220
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:26,358
so in that sense if you have any kind of animated cutscenes or

221
00:20:27,198 --> 00:20:29,919
scripted cutscenes in your game that can also help

222
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:37,275
Um, contextualize more information about the characters without giving too much away in the text.

223
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:43,017
So that way the player kind of has an idea of what to expect from each character.

224
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,820
So the last piece and related to the animated cutscenes that helps

225
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:53,422
kind of tie everything together is the visual design of the game.

226
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:58,519
In the game, this is one of the screenshots from one of the endings.

227
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,401
In the game, each character is designed around a specific animal.

228
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:09,145
So they have masks on their back that represent a different type of animal that is common

229
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:09,846
in South America.

230
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:15,949
So like alligator, capybara, jaguar, you know.

231
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:20,432
types of deer and eater, things like that.

232
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:26,556
So the reason why each of them is characterized with an animal is also to kind of, again,

233
00:21:26,596 --> 00:21:30,158
feed into that visual cue of what personality they might have.

234
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:34,481
So like the character that wears the capybara mask is very friendly, very kind of

235
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:41,045
open to conversation, and also a bit naive at the same time.

236
00:21:42,213 --> 00:22:00,327
Then the character who is represented by a drag war tends to have like a more, a stronger presence and can be maybe a little bit intimidating, but they're not like, like outwardly hostile or anything when they're in conversations and things like that.

237
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:03,129
So we try to, we try to link these.

238
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:08,647
um, animal symbols to the characters, you know, cause it relates to their

239
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:12,988
environment, relates to the culture that is inspired by Guarani culture.

240
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:18,670
And it also helps kind of attach some kind of narrative device to them to help

241
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,832
contextualize what their motivations might be.

242
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:27,414
So it's something subtle, more subtle than let's say, like the anime cutscenes or

243
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,835
anything else about their character design.

244
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:33,619
And when you're viewing the conversations, you'll see these masks on their back.

245
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,321
So it's almost like they're still looking at you, but just from another perspective.

246
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:44,823
So as I mentioned, a lot of the characters in the world are directly inspired by Guarani

247
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,903
storytelling that I personally grew up with.

248
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:53,045
So Guarani is a nation, an indigenous nation that is spread out between Brazil,

249
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:55,626
Paraguay, Uruguay, parts of Bolivia and Argentina.

250
00:22:57,621 --> 00:23:04,343
So the values that I grew up with generally were around accountability and personal responsibility to your community,

251
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:11,286
which in this sense, you know, it's a lot, the game is a lot about, you know, how do you handle community conflicts?

252
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:17,008
And how does restorative justice work for these particular characters?

253
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:24,992
You know, what are they looking for? And those are the kind of questions that the player might want to think about without having an actual answer.

254
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:35,513
So one of the important things is that we don't, you know, in the game narrative and the game mechanics, we don't punish the player by picking a specific ending.

255
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:48,600
Because at the end of the day, they also don't know the answer. So that's kind of one of the main ideas of the game is that it's okay to not know the definitive narrative answer to what some of the characters might be asking or wanting.

256
00:23:49,434 --> 00:24:00,825
The whole point of the game is just kind of to like experience their conversations and experience a kind of imperfect nature of trying to solve a conflict without really knowing anything about it.

257
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:09,653
So this was kind of the basis that I used to help me answer some of the questions and solve some design challenges.

258
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,883
In creating a mysterious story that didn't lead players astray.

259
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:19,427
So the main, uh, the really like most important point there was that

260
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:23,610
the player still walked away with like a sense of story, a sense of place.

261
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,393
Uh, so they might not have the answer, but they knew what happened, uh, just

262
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:32,756
in that particular moment that they were in, uh, you know, they, it's almost

263
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:37,259
similar to, you know, being at a certain place, but not having all the answers.

264
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:50,018
And similarly, many of the character aspects that I mentioned, like the masks, are derived from Guarani art as well, and they reflect each character's personality, you know, the animals they're assigned to.

265
00:24:50,038 --> 00:25:02,681
And I had referenced before as well that the game also relied quite heavily on to the animation, so everything that was animated in the game was animated through Toon Boom.

266
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:07,082
Parts of it were also animated through Photoshop with like...

267
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:17,133
Usually by coloring it in, but the actual like smears and like in-betweens and all those were done in Toon Boom.

268
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:26,737
It was all done by hand as well, and since it was a very kind of small self-contained environment that these characters were inhabiting,

269
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:32,680
2D animation really also helped to bring out their personality.

270
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,082
So it became really crucial to like really over-exaggerate.

271
00:25:37,654 --> 00:25:42,317
animations and to really overextend styles to make a lasting impression.

272
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:50,423
So generally that means that it was really about exaggerating those smears and exaggerating

273
00:25:50,803 --> 00:25:56,267
those actions so that even when the player is viewing, you know, more bird's eye view of the

274
00:25:56,307 --> 00:26:02,652
game, you can still see the animations and feel them very clearly and they kind of tell you like

275
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:06,654
a little bit more about the mannerisms or personality of a certain character.

276
00:26:07,918 --> 00:26:12,041
In the main view, sometimes there are characters that are like fidgeting with their hands because they're very anxious.

277
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:21,249
There's other characters who like might do other things like, you know, rest their face on their hand, like they're thinking about something.

278
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:29,415
So those little cues also help a lot with establishing what kind of mindset each character is at.

279
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:33,338
So that's also something very useful to think about.

280
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,241
We're trying to use animation to also tell a story without having to rely too much on the in-text dialogue.

281
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:49,022
So coming to a close here, just to summarize some of the things that I've gone over.

282
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:58,904
So basically, a lot of what we solved in this game was that we wanted to limit information to the player and let them fill in the gaps.

283
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:00,165
So we wanted to kind of...

284
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:07,711
meet them halfway and let them try and fill in the gaps to contextualize what's happening in the game.

285
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:15,578
That way you know you're kind of leaving it a mystery and they can speculate on what you know

286
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:22,463
what might have happened, what might have taken place while not giving a definitive answer. So

287
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:27,267
we wanted to really make players think about it, come up with different possible

288
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:34,492
Um scenarios that come up in the game so that way you know technically every player is right

289
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:38,373
in a way you know no matter the different scenarios they can think of to kind of fill

290
00:27:38,393 --> 00:27:43,055
in that gap it's technically correct so that's what we also wanted to work towards.

291
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:49,217
We also wanted to allude to a larger narrative so we wanted to foreshadow a lot of things that

292
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:54,600
don't actually happen in the game itself so we wanted to foreshadow oh this character had a

293
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,172
relationship with this other character, but now they don't really talk anymore.

294
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:06,477
Or maybe, you know, this event happened where it soured some relations

295
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:11,461
within the community, or maybe this one character who doesn't appear in-game

296
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:16,344
is referenced in some way, and that also kind of helped escalate that kind

297
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:19,766
of mysterious nature of the game.

298
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:23,565
We also wanted to assume player curiosity.

299
00:28:23,665 --> 00:28:27,386
So we wanted to assume that the player would be curious about what's happening.

300
00:28:27,426 --> 00:28:31,128
We wanted to assume that the player would interrogate the design.

301
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:34,610
So one of the key takeaways is also that, you know,

302
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,651
we planned around the player's interrogation of design.

303
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:42,593
We wanted to give them, you know, some autonomy in that,

304
00:28:42,693 --> 00:28:45,775
even if, you know, there are some things that they might not influence directly.

305
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:52,684
And that's the end of this talk.

306
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:57,986
Thank you so much for taking the time to listen me go on about

307
00:28:58,606 --> 00:28:59,626
this little game.

308
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:04,528

312
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:20,175
I'm currently working on a newer project about indigenous cyberpunk that will be announced

313
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:24,723
in the future, so I hope I can talk about that in the future as well.

314
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:26,205
Thank you.
