00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:09,960
Hello people. I think we're going to get started. I kind of wanted to mention, if you were sitting

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,383
in here before things kind of got going and they didn't scan you on the way in, if you

3
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:18,407
would really, really please scan, ask them to scan you on the way out, because otherwise

4
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:22,630
I don't get the review and I don't get a lot of the information that I need to make the

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:29,856
talks better for years to come. That being said, I'd like to start. My talk this year

6
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:32,935
Designers are from Venus and programmers are from Uranus.

7
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:36,716
I kind of get to say things like that because I am a programmer.

8
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:40,877
And so, it's sort of like Dave Chappelle gets to tell certain jokes

9
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,217
and Ellen DeGeneres gets to tell certain jokes.

10
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:47,699
So, who am I? I'm standing here in front of you guys.

11
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,960
I've been in game dev for a really long time.

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,920
I was recently at Blizzard and I worked on Hearthstone.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,801
It was actually my 19th ship title.

14
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,402
I've been in companies from...

15
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:06,070
garage companies to Sony Computer Entertainment of America, probably the largest one. And

16
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:13,894
I've worked on a game in almost every genre, which is kind of weird in a way. I had never

17
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:18,476
done a card game before, that was interesting. And mostly I've done gameplay and AI, but

18
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,518
I've also done design. I've even been lead designer on a few of the projects that I've

19
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:26,520
worked on. And I put them in this order for a good reason. I've always found that AI is

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,960
sort of...

21
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:33,502
on the border between design and gameplay, on the border between design and programming.

22
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:37,265
And in order to do AI right, you end up having to be in both sides.

23
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,968
And this is kind of why I'm doing this talk, because I find myself in many of the companies

24
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:44,530
that I work at as sort of a translator between these two groups.

25
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:50,755
I would find myself all the time coming around the corner at Sony and finding two people

26
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:54,197
arguing, and I would kind of sit off to the side and listen to them for a while.

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,641
very quickly determined that they were just having a communication problem.

28
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,961
They needed Google Translate to come in and kind of help them.

29
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:04,242
And so I would say, hey, I think what he's saying is this, and I think what he's trying

30
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:04,762
to say is this.

31
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:07,763
And they would both kind of shake their head and go, yeah, and then walk away.

32
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:11,284
And that happened so many times that I realized that this is really a problem.

33
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:18,846
And that, combined with doing a lot of psychology sort of work with AI, I've really started

34
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:22,627
to get a feel for how people work together and that sort of thing.

35
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:24,908
And it's been part of my job for quite some time.

36
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,042
So, in summary, I'm a seasoned veteran. I've pretty much seen everything.

37
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:36,943
And I've been exposed to a wide, vast array of work environments.

38
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:41,245
So, why this talk?

39
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:44,086
Well, the way that we make games is changing quite a bit.

40
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:46,967
I mean, the old way, right, was that a designer would write a spec,

41
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:49,728
the programmer would go off and implement the spec,

42
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:51,688
he'd come back eventually and they would playtest it,

43
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:53,609
and it might get repeated.

44
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,590
Maybe. That was kind of how things worked.

45
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,272
But nowadays, that's not even really how we even make games anymore.

46
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,213
A lot of times a system designer will write the doc.

47
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,133
The programmers will then implement a tool

48
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:05,774
that the content designers will use to make the game.

49
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:07,975
And then the programmers will support

50
00:03:08,676 --> 00:03:10,997
both of those designers with tool and feature changes.

51
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:13,918
And then we keep doing that over and over again until we ship.

52
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,079
And then many times we even keep doing it afterwards

53
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:19,180
because games are online nowadays and we can update them all the time.

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,821
Now obviously this is more of a AAA process.

55
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,326
and there's differences if you're doing an indie team or what have you.

56
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:27,387
But this is kind of how games are done nowadays.

57
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:32,490
And as you can see, there's a much tighter coupling between the designers and the programmers

58
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,551
in the new system than there ever was in the old system.

59
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:39,494
The other reason I'm doing this talk is because features themselves in our games are changing.

60
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:46,238
You know, while the disciplines are still in the big three, you know, designers, programmers,

61
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:48,899
artists are how we divvy out our staff.

62
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:52,598
Game features are not really divided that way anymore.

63
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:53,679
I mean, even this feature.

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,364
That probably could have been drawn by the same guy who

65
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,125
programmed it, who was also the designer.

66
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,448
But even that feature, I don't believe, was done by one guy.

67
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,350
And what about that feature?

68
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:08,673
Is there anybody in this room that can tease apart which was

69
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:12,717
the programming and which was the design on this feature?

70
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:18,258
As our games become increasingly complex, the features themselves become increasingly

71
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:24,761
complex and they require these cross-disciplinary teams to work super tightly if they're going

72
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:25,181
to work out.

73
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:33,025
And these two groups can be especially tough to harmonize because they really don't think

74
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:34,085
anything like each other.

75
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:42,049
So the things I want to cover in this talk are basic differences between the two.

76
00:04:43,736 --> 00:04:47,859
actually working together as far as establishing a connection and ongoing sort of things.

77
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,463
And then some bridge methods that are starting to be used by the industry.

78
00:04:55,646 --> 00:05:00,730
One of the things I did when I do a lot of these talks is I go into Google and I type

79
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,332
the thing that I want to think about into Google Images.

80
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:05,534
And it's cool, right?

81
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:09,497
Because Google Images, or Google in general, the way that they score things and they bubble

82
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,137
to the top is like.

83
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:12,796
That's the link that the most people clicked on.

84
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:17,078
So in effect, you kind of get a ask the audience sort of thing

85
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,639
when you consult Google on things.

86
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,720
And so I typed game designer into Google.

87
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,462
And that was actually the first picture that came up.

88
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:25,602
Now, for me.

89
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,543
I don't know if it's different for anybody else.

90
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:29,124
And that's kind of a cool picture.

91
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:31,986
And so then I typed game programmer in.

92
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:32,966
And I got that picture.

93
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,608
And I think it's kind of interesting that.

94
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:41,586
Even ask the audience, there's a massive difference, right?

95
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:44,667
When you ask the audience, what's a game designer, you get a concept,

96
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:47,808
you get a powerful drawing of the creative process.

97
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:50,528
And when you ask what's a game programmer, you get John Carmack.

98
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,429
You get a specific guy.

99
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,489
You get somebody sitting at a desk programming.

100
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,430
And so even the general populace sort of knows

101
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,451
there's a very distinct difference between the two.

102
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:09,076
And so, the process by which these two groups actually do work is vastly different as well.

103
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:12,241
The design, as you guys all know, is very free form.

104
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:14,064
It's super collaborative.

105
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,787
It's largely discovered.

106
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:17,409
It's, you're kind of...

107
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:23,069
out there in design space looking for the fun combination of rules

108
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,791
that give you something special.

109
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:28,532
And it's very situational, depending on the game,

110
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:30,573
the part of the development process.

111
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:35,776
There's no real sort of formula for the design process at any given moment.

112
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,277
Whereas programmers are not that way.

113
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:41,239
Typically their job is much more structured.

114
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:46,497
they can divvy out tasks and separate systems much more easily

115
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,619
and they can divvy out the work much more easily.

116
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,281
They deal in abstract systems

117
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:55,805
and that's sort of their mindset in the total.

118
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:58,147
And also they're typically a lot more isolated.

119
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,890
They tend to be able to figure out a task,

120
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,753
go off and kind of do it and come back for feedback.

121
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:06,455
That's not the case with...

122
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:12,352
with design. Typically, you don't have that sort of back and forth. You have group, group

123
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:15,935
sort of dynamics. So if you have a mixed team environment, you can see where this might

124
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:22,080
rub everybody kind of the wrong way. The programmers are going to feel interrupted quite frequently

125
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,024
because there's a loud, potentially boisterous talk going on right next to them. And while,

126
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:32,568
yes, occasionally, they're going to be able to give some feedback that might steer that

127
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:33,528
group in the right direction.

128
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:38,118
For every one of those times, there's probably 10 times where they're going to give some

129
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:43,680
feedback or naysay something that the designers aren't even trying to say we should do.

130
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,362
They're blue-skying over here and they're bouncing stuff around and it's sort of proto-ideas.

131
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:50,663
And you don't want to naysay a proto-idea, right?

132
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,403
Because that leads to stifling.

133
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:59,286
And on the same other side of the coin, you know, the designers might feel stifled when

134
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,207
in reality they maybe just...

135
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:05,810
are miscommunicating what they're talking about at any given time.

136
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,631
And so, yeah, I think for certain parts of the development,

137
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,671
a mixed team sort of environment works.

138
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:15,431
I especially like it when you're doing a new feature.

139
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:17,652
You all kind of sit together for a while

140
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:20,512
and kind of get an idea as to the beginnings of it

141
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:22,013
and the starts of it and that kind of thing.

142
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:24,833
But then, personally, I think that it's better

143
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:29,374
if the programmers can be isolated a little bit.

144
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,863
so that they can get a little bit more of that deep focus that they need to do their job.

145
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:40,647
The two groups have very different goals when they're making games as well.

146
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:45,250
Design is searching for fun, and they're searching for that consistent player contract.

147
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,433
They're trying to find that set of rules that they can limit the player to

148
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:57,078
and see how effectively they can sort of maintain just that contract with the player.

149
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,240
Versus the programmers.

150
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:04,194
are looking more for performance, scalability, and maintenance of the overall product.

151
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:07,355
They're not really talking, they're not really thinking about this particular game.

152
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:11,756
They're thinking about code in general.

153
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:16,197
I think both sides have simplicity on their watchword,

154
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:18,938
but I don't know that they mean it in the same way.

155
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,179
And I'll talk about that in a little while.

156
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:26,980
Part of the thing that I wanted to show you guys was on Hearthstone.

157
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:35,762
the designers, and by designers I mean the two designers, were sitting in a particular

158
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:38,985
spot and right between them was a series of posters that they had up called the design

159
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:46,171
pillars that clearly stated the goals of the Hearthstone design effort. And I wanted to

160
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:55,218
show you guys these. There's game for everyone, keep it deep, make it physical, great flavor,

161
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:59,021
play fast, and win or lose the game should still be fun.

162
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:04,038
So now if I kind of go back over these again, you'll notice that these are very colorful.

163
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:06,819
They're very flavorful.

164
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,583
They give you a decent idea as to what Hearthstone's tone is supposed to be like, its overall attitude.

165
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:24,046
And to a certain high-level extent, you can kind of see the game that Hearthstone is supposed to be just in these pictures.

166
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:25,627
Now I want to show you...

167
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:29,363
the series of posters that were sitting on Bob Fitch's desk,

168
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:30,744
the lead programmer.

169
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:32,984
And these are the programming pillars,

170
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:36,626
in the, seven feet away from the design pillars.

171
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:39,066
Solve the problems you have.

172
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,467
Fast doesn't mean sloppy.

173
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:43,488
Keep it simple.

174
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,069
Know how it broke.

175
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:48,090
It better work.

176
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,890
Leave no tracks.

177
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:51,891
Play the game you're making.

178
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:53,251
And use the right tool.

179
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,672
Now, one thing you should notice on these.

180
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,727
is that these have nothing to do with Hearthstone.

181
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:03,092
In fact, these are the exact, oh excuse me,

182
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,354
these are the exact programming pillars

183
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:07,577
that Bob Fitch has used for 20 years.

184
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:13,183
These are about building tools and about building systems

185
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:15,865
and about working with the other programmers.

186
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:17,467
Leave no tracks.

187
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:27,129
And so the difference here is that one group is very much thinking about the game and what it means to make this game,

188
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:33,211
whereas the other group is very much interested in the process and what it means to do the process.

189
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:40,192
Now, how do these different goals and motivations lead to success?

190
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:47,713
What is it about performing these goals and motivations that actually give satisfaction down the road?

191
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:51,805
to these groups. I mean, obviously you can tell they're fairly different, right?

192
00:11:51,945 --> 00:12:00,529
For the designers, fun is fun, right? But if you can maintain a contract and maintain

193
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,250
simplicity, you're talking about that game that's easy to pick up and difficult to master.

194
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:09,052
You've made an accessible game that a lot of people can learn that rule set and really

195
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:14,414
dive into. Whereas the programmers, they've won if they've kept the bug count low.

196
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,890
if they've made intuitive code so that an additional staff that comes in can jump in

197
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:28,175
and help out, and if there's no crunch. That's how they win. And so you can see where sometimes

198
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:34,378
something that the designers want that will actually give them the win is exactly the

199
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:38,641
thing that might cause the programmers to lose what they consider to be the win. And

200
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,962
that's a big source of rub, right?

201
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:49,699
the common thread for the two to win is the word elegance.

202
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,901
But even then I think they're thinking about it in two different ways.

203
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:56,964
I think when you have an elegant game, that's where you have the minimum set of rules

204
00:12:58,506 --> 00:12:59,927
so that you have depth in your game,

205
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:02,949
but it's not so many rules that it's complex.

206
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,070
It's accessible still.

207
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,812
Whereas in programming, elegance means

208
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,035
it means the code is clever,

209
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:13,016
but not in an unintuitive way, again.

210
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:19,485
because that's a strength. But it's clever in such that you get a surprising jump in

211
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:24,290
performance or a surprising jump in optimization of space or something. And so when the programmers

212
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:29,635
say elegance, they mean the code itself is elegant, not the game, which is what the designers

213
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,918
are talking about. Again, there's sort of a different tack.

214
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:38,063
So how do we get these two groups to work together? They're very different people.

215
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:40,815
And they have to be very closely associated.

216
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:41,756
And how do we do this?

217
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,337
I think for me, it's all about beginnings.

218
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:48,400
It's all about when your game first starts, especially with

219
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,524
new staff, you have, I like to use a two-part process to sort

220
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:57,406
of jumpstart the process of this connection.

221
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:00,228
First, I like to call it the pre-prototype.

222
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:03,730
When the design has been gone on long enough, you've got a

223
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,971
nice paper prototype.

224
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,113
You've got a good idea of the rule sets.

225
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,760
That's when you bring the designer in, or excuse me, the programmer in.

226
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,642
And that way you can get everybody on board and on the same page as to what the design is going to be.

227
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:19,562
You can start the buy-in process.

228
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:26,603
And more importantly, you can actually, at this point, essentially teach the programmer how your brain works.

229
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:35,585
How you perceive this design problem, how you perceive what are the important bits and what are sort of not the important bits.

230
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:36,125
All of that.

231
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:43,693
this is your time to sort of shine and give him insight into your brain.

232
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,877
I like to do this with as many different types of media as I can.

233
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,598
The paper prototypes work great.

234
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:54,000
Obviously talking, doing a lot of whiteboarding.

235
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:56,342
Act it out.

236
00:14:57,302 --> 00:15:00,464
Stand next to each other and act it out if that would make it more clear.

237
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:04,307
Human beings have a lot of different ways of retaining information and sometimes...

238
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:08,269
you can give an email to somebody and they will remember it for 10 years and other times

239
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:13,150
you can give somebody a piece of paper and they will read it 20 times and they will still

240
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,450
have to pick it up for that 21st time.

241
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,910
They will never, it will never stick.

242
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,531
And so mixed media is super important.

243
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:23,232
I mean, any grade school teacher will tell you this, right?

244
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:25,972
People learn in different ways.

245
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:31,993
And the purpose of this...

246
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,713
interview, if you will, is to explore the boundaries of your game space with the programmer

247
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:45,436
right from the start. It gives him the opportunity to push back on your design, try and find

248
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:51,400
exceptions and edge cases. And it gives you the opportunity to explain how the design

249
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,743
encompasses those edge cases and those exceptions. Because at this point, he's trying to determine

250
00:15:57,783 --> 00:16:02,666
an abstraction that's going to work well to encode your game design. And at the same

251
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:02,946
time...

252
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,993
those exceptions, those edge cases might be things you haven't thought of. And so it's

253
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:12,455
going to give you clarity in forcing you to verbalize those things to the programmer.

254
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:21,018
So then he's going to go off, or they, they're going to go off and do the code. And they're

255
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:23,678
going to come back to you at some point with some semblance of a prototype.

256
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:29,733
the, the, it's, it's, it's time for the opposite to happen.

257
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:33,995
Now, it's your turn, as a designer, to get into his head,

258
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:37,377
and to see if he got the message, as well as,

259
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:38,998
as well as how he thinks about things.

260
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:41,340
So now it's time for you to push back on,

261
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,641
on his abstraction, and let him explain how his system

262
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:47,863
is going to encompass, I keep saying his, I apologize,

263
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:51,685
how the programmer is going to encompass your, your,

264
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:53,586
your design.

265
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,170
how his abstraction is going to handle everything that it needs to handle.

266
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:03,291
And again, the same thing happens when you work on exceptions and what have you.

267
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:12,072
The programmer clarifying these things in his own mind while they talk about it

268
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,773
is a very important step.

269
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:17,173
Part of the reason I'm tripping so hard is because

270
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:20,414
the female programmer from Hearthstone is right here and I'm trying not to be a jerk.

271
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:29,248
He also has a, they also have a lot more idea about the performance of the system.

272
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:34,110
How the system is going to play out given all of the things that now, now are known

273
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,292
about the program and how it's going to handle data.

274
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:44,895
And so, this is where the programmer might give you a, a, hey, if you don't have to do

275
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:46,616
this all the time, it would be a good thing.

276
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:50,037
In fact, let's make some limitations and some budgeting based on performance numbers that

277
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:50,358
we already know.

278
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:51,478
And if, if it doesn't work, it's not going to work.

279
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:52,178
It's not going to work.

280
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:58,219
this is a really good time to sort of start the negotiation process for the interaction

281
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:06,942
between the two camps. Again, it's good for you as a designer to watch out for over-engineering.

282
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:13,505
The programmer might be making a system that's way too broad to try and grab every possible

283
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:18,067
option. And if you notice this and you say, hey, hey, that's really never going to happen,

284
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,448
you can give the programmer

285
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,051
boundaries that you're willing to live with such that he might be able to

286
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:28,611
simplify things down at

287
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:34,893
at the system level and actually get some real good gains and

288
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:40,714
again, they'll watch out for trust fails at this point because if you say something's never gonna happen and then down the road you say

289
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:44,595
Yeah, we're gonna do that now like that

290
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:48,156
That's a big problem and be prepared for some sort of strong

291
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:51,957
Negotiations because this is very early in the process and if you say never at that point

292
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:53,597
You better kind of mean it.

293
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:58,240
So what I'm talking about here is establishing a connection

294
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,320
between two human beings.

295
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,222
And this is the standard metaphor, right?

296
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:04,924
Because, yeah, two human beings can link up.

297
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:07,506
There is an easy way to even communicate.

298
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,526
But there is signal loss.

299
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,409
The problem I have with this particular hookup

300
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:14,310
is that it's typically more like this.

301
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,411
These are not.

302
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,745
people that really speak the same language or think the same way.

303
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:23,987
And so you really have to come about it in this way instead.

304
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:30,373
A lot of programming is more top-down and content is more bottom-up.

305
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:37,659
I think a lot of systems designers also think top-down and so there is some common ground,

306
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:43,143
but it's a really hard road to do and you really have to be careful and you really should

307
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:45,765
start thinking about things in these terms so that you don't...

308
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,328
Designers love to use flowery language.

309
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:54,089
We hate seeing the same word used over and over again.

310
00:19:54,509 --> 00:20:00,451
But programmers basically love clarity of language.

311
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:03,252
It's actually probably one of the reasons why we deal with

312
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:05,813
computers better than people.

313
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,934
Because computers, by definition, are the ultimate

314
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:09,955
example of clear.

315
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:14,767
clear language. You know, every time you put a semicolon in the wrong spot, the computer

316
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:18,690
will say, wrong. And that starts to sort of sound like a lot of programmers, doesn't it?

317
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,615
You know, like you, you, you, you deal with that entity enough in your life and you, you

318
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:28,618
will become that, you know, like they, they will tell you when you put the semicolon in

319
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:34,103
the wrong point. And so, what we really need to do to establish this connection is, is

320
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:36,205
remember that communication clarity is key.

321
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:43,150
Vocabulary is actually one of the very few things that human beings do when they form groups to bond.

322
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,511
High school cliques are about forming your own vocabulary.

323
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:57,973
Human beings do this so that they can feel a kinship with each other and know that they're on the same page.

324
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:03,694
It's one of the reasons why when geeks get together and we start quoting movies, we feel more connected to each other.

325
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:05,695
It's because that's our shared vocabulary.

326
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:09,196
And if you have that one friend in your group that keeps

327
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,998
quoting Monty Python wrong or slightly wrong,

328
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:16,079
he doesn't get it.

329
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,360
He's never going to be in the group.

330
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,761
Nobody likes that guy.

331
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:24,043
And so when you're dealing with programmers,

332
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:25,384
you really have to remember that

333
00:21:25,704 --> 00:21:29,125
they are the kings of consistent and clear language

334
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:31,626
because that's what the computer demands of them.

335
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,588
And the more senior a guy is, I think that...

336
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:38,108
he can get a little wiggle room and he can figure things out.

337
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:42,491
But the junior a person is, they're still very fresh.

338
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:45,193
Every time the computer's slapped them, it's still like

339
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:46,374
stinging on their cheek.

340
00:21:46,814 --> 00:21:49,056
And so they're still in that mode.

341
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:51,317
And when they come in and they talk to the designers,

342
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:53,339
sometimes they want to sting you back.

343
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:57,922
I've seen entire meetings be derailed by a single antonym.

344
00:21:58,642 --> 00:22:01,304
Some designer in the room will say the word actor when he

345
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:02,085
meant entity.

346
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:05,173
Some programmer will go, wait, wait, wait.

347
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:07,675
Are you talking about the entity?

348
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:09,236
Or are you talking about the battle manager?

349
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:11,718
And his brain is off in that direction now,

350
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,359
trying to find the inconsistency.

351
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,121
It's no longer in the meeting.

352
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:18,584
And you have to practically apologize to the guy.

353
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,046
No, no, no. I'm sorry. I said the wrong thing.

354
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,168
And that's annoying. I agree.

355
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:26,911
But it's something you should be aware is happening.

356
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:29,653
Consistency of vocabulary is something

357
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:32,355
that really needs to be set up in that pre-production phase.

358
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,769
where you set a vocabulary for the game.

359
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,451
And hopefully he'll code the thing using the same vocabulary

360
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:41,313
so that when you talk, the consistency stays.

361
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:44,794
Now, during the prototype phase, he's going to come back at you

362
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,515
with some naming systems that he's made up.

363
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:48,596
Maybe there's a scripting language,

364
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:50,757
and he's written out a bunch of opcodes.

365
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:54,879
Or maybe there's a naming system for the assets

366
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:56,200
that are going to be loaded into the game.

367
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:00,775
I personally as a programmer try to have some flexibility in this.

368
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:06,396
In the Hearthstone game, I first brought the list of opcodes for the scripting system to

369
00:23:07,196 --> 00:23:11,038
the designer and they were all written in a third person.

370
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:14,559
Like the player who owns this card was an opcode.

371
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,400
So that in the script you could reference the player who owns this particular card in

372
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,880
that script.

373
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,561
And the designer at the time said, oh, I don't think about it like that.

374
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:26,923
that's weird, I don't understand that.

375
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:29,704
And so I said, okay, take this file.

376
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,945
And there was a file with all of the opcodes

377
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:34,747
that was read in by both the tool and the engine,

378
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:39,389
and that was sort of the text of the opcodes

379
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:40,309
that was used in the tools,

380
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:41,890
because I didn't really care what they were.

381
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,651
And he went through and rewrote them,

382
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:45,792
and I looked at them afterwards,

383
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:47,993
and what he had done was change them all

384
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:49,473
from third person to first person.

385
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,434
Because when he was writing the cards,

386
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:54,616
he saw the script as being the card itself.

387
00:23:56,005 --> 00:24:02,669
saying what it was. So he changed the player who owns this card to my player. And I saw

388
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:06,911
that pretty quickly and I got a good insight into his mind as to why he was reordering

389
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:12,134
these. Okay, when he writes a script, he becomes the card and he writes my script, basically.

390
00:24:12,554 --> 00:24:17,436
And so it was very easy for me then, when I would talk to him, to use better metaphors

391
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,638
to sort of get into his mode when we talked.

392
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:26,409
However, be explicit. Again, this is a clarity issue, right?

393
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:30,450
And there's certain things that you really have to be explicit about.

394
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,091
One is priorities. Must-haves versus would-be-nice,

395
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:38,712
that's at the bare minimum. I better know which ones you have to have

396
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,713
and which ones would be nice. I mean, obviously, there's a priority of the

397
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:42,813
would-be-nices as well.

398
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:46,674
But post-ship is not a good priority to say.

399
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:49,983
I want to know if it's a must-have post-ship

400
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:52,265
or if it's a would-be-nice post-ship.

401
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:53,406
Because if it's a must-have,

402
00:24:53,706 --> 00:24:55,588
then it might not be a post-ship feature.

403
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:57,689
I have to take that into account as a programmer

404
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,071
before the game ships.

405
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:01,653
Otherwise, there's a nasty surprise.

406
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,695
Especially if you want to do some content fairly soon after we ship.

407
00:25:05,316 --> 00:25:07,718
Estimates are another big thing that you have to be explicit about.

408
00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:09,059
Don't give snap estimates.

409
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,462
Because programmers are notorious for remembering them forever.

410
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,241
Ranges are a lot better as well because they show certainty.

411
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:20,483
If I say a task is going to take me between 15 and 20 minutes,

412
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:22,564
I think you're fairly certain about that.

413
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:24,465
Whereas if you say it's going to take between one and four

414
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:26,886
days, I'm going to realize immediately

415
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:29,548
that maybe the thing I'm asking you isn't very clear.

416
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:35,051
Because if you can't tell me within 400% time scale,

417
00:25:35,111 --> 00:25:37,332
then maybe I haven't been clear and I

418
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:38,913
need to talk to you more about what's going on.

419
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:42,174
There's a lot of other types of communication

420
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:43,235
that come up in game dev.

421
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:44,015
Meetings.

422
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,169
Meetings are a big one.

423
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:46,189
They run...

424
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,831
They run nasty for most programmers.

425
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:53,293
I think designers have a little bit better time with them.

426
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,154
I think producers have the best time with them.

427
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:58,995
I think producers actually, you know, have a bed made out of meetings at home.

428
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:07,440
And the big reason is that the chunk size of work between the two groups is wildly different.

429
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,140
I think it might be the same,

430
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:11,602
except that programmers tend to have...

431
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,305
a lead in phase and a lead out phase because your brain requires a different degree of

432
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:22,832
focus as well as like width of information that you need to sort of have in your head

433
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:29,140
at once in order to do a software engineering task than a collaborative creative task.

434
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:37,880
the sort of well-documented programmer works chunk size is about four hours.

435
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,583
And so if you have a meeting in the morning,

436
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,305
that might actually kind of shoot the programmer's morning.

437
00:26:44,926 --> 00:26:47,288
And if you then put another meeting in the middle of the afternoon,

438
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:48,609
ouch.

439
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:51,611
He might not actually get that much done,

440
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:54,154
especially high-focus work that day.

441
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:57,376
This is one of the reasons why

442
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:03,433
You really need to think about meetings and if they're necessary, try and front load them.

443
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:04,854
All those sorts of issues.

444
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:07,016
Also social setting.

445
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:10,639
Programmers again, you know, they vary greatly.

446
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:17,345
But in general, they're not as social as designers.

447
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:22,609
Even here at GDC, I have people come up to me and I'm also another programmer and I can

448
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:26,493
tell you within three words if they're a programmer or a designer.

449
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:30,487
That's typically just eye gaze is all it takes.

450
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:32,629
The programmer will walk up to you and go,

451
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:33,329
hey Brian.

452
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,791
And that's pretty high percentage of the time.

453
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:40,372
They typically don't like being made

454
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,193
the center of attention.

455
00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:43,894
And meetings can do that.

456
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,275
I mean, I've seen the single most powerful,

457
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:48,676
confident programmer I've ever met, practically,

458
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:50,517
turn into one of these in a meeting.

459
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:51,218
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

460
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:54,499
Defensive, wants people to stop talking.

461
00:27:57,324 --> 00:28:00,065
Ongoing communications are very different as well.

462
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:03,945
You really should, I like to do it at the start of a team.

463
00:28:04,326 --> 00:28:06,426
I like to say, hey, do you like emails?

464
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:07,286
Do you like IMs?

465
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,587
Do you want me to come talk to you in person?

466
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:11,127
Do you like phone calls?

467
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:13,327
Because different people like different things.

468
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:18,168
And with programmers especially, because of that work chunk I was talking about, there's

469
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,769
times of day where this might be varied.

470
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:24,730
They might say, after 4 o'clock, please don't come anywhere near my desk.

471
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,430
Send me an email.

472
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:25,950
I'm busy.

473
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,310
I'm busy.

474
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:26,750
I'm busy.

475
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,727
and that might change over the course of the project.

476
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:32,929
But this is something that you really should think about

477
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:36,912
because this is the sort of thing that you can really kill productivity

478
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,133
completely innocuously.

479
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:43,055
And the last thing is feedback and suggestions.

480
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:49,959
I find that if, as a designer, you open an idea zone,

481
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,821
that it makes it reciprocal,

482
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:55,542
it makes it easier to reciprocate as a programmer.

483
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:56,303
They will also...

484
00:28:56,911 --> 00:28:59,752
be a little bit more open for ideas when the designer comes to them.

485
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:04,973
I love this question. This is something that Eric Dodds taught me.

486
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:09,974
I had sort of a notion of this, but this is the most wonderful question there is, right?

487
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:13,775
When somebody comes to you with some feedback or a suggestion,

488
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:16,316
and they start to say, hey, you know, it'd be really cool.

489
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:21,177
Don't say, we don't have time for that. Oh, I don't agree with that.

490
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:23,197
There's a million different ways to answer this question.

491
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:26,079
But this one, what are you trying to fix?

492
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:27,419
It does two things.

493
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,701
It shows respect for the person that's coming up to you with feedback.

494
00:29:31,181 --> 00:29:32,602
Because it doesn't say,

495
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:34,203
your idea is dumb.

496
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:34,723
It says,

497
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:36,924
whatever your idea is,

498
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:38,985
your intent coming up to me

499
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:41,206
is to try and make this game better, and I see that.

500
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:46,348
But it also potentially digs deeper than just their little description

501
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:48,089
and gives you an idea as to what...

502
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:51,697
the higher level thing is that they're maybe trying to fix

503
00:29:51,737 --> 00:29:52,837
and maybe there is something there.

504
00:29:52,977 --> 00:29:54,298
Maybe their idea is stupid,

505
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,599
but maybe the thing that they're trying to fix is not non-existent.

506
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,960
Other communication.

507
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:04,121
Documentation is a sore spot.

508
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:05,882
I mean, I don't know that

509
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:10,164
programmers do documentation all that much better,

510
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:14,205
but we definitely try because we make it part of our process.

511
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:21,079
And I think designers try as well, but they tend to, especially later in the project,

512
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,281
kind of fall off the wagon a little bit more than programmers do.

513
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:29,284
So try and keep your design docs up to date, especially if they're short.

514
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:30,765
Keep your design docs short.

515
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:39,371
Our Hearthstone designer was proud of himself because he could get our documentation down

516
00:30:39,411 --> 00:30:40,372
to about two pages.

517
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,674
And that was a point of pride with him.

518
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:47,190
And I applauded him for it when he did it because that takes work.

519
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:52,514
You know, I've made GDC talks take less and less slides

520
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:55,176
and that's a really hard thing to do to boil something down.

521
00:30:57,358 --> 00:31:00,661
When we talk about design-driven production,

522
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:04,644
the information about how to make this game

523
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:06,585
and about where the intelligence lies

524
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:08,767
is sometimes spread out in 15 different places.

525
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:10,753
How do I make a new actor?

526
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:13,734
How do I make a new script for this particular actor?

527
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:18,077
How do I, what do the priorities on the animations even mean?

528
00:31:18,457 --> 00:31:20,438
All of these sort of process level things

529
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:22,619
need to be documented as well.

530
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:24,500
And a lot of times this stuff falls through the cracks.

531
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,841
And so you hire a new designer,

532
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:28,682
or you hire a new programmer, and he doesn't know squat.

533
00:31:28,742 --> 00:31:32,024
And it's really hard to get these things to keep going.

534
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:34,345
And finally, content and scripts.

535
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:36,946
In much the same way that programmers,

536
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:41,880
When I work with programmers, I try to get them to comment their code.

537
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,080
If I look at it and I say,

538
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,741
hey, this doesn't make sense to me,

539
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,942
throw a comment in here so that a month from now we know what this means.

540
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,923
When there's a bug.

541
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,523
I do the same thing with contents and scripts.

542
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:57,745
I put comment opcodes into my scripting languages,

543
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:00,826
and when the designer goes to check something in,

544
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:03,047
I say, what does this even mean?

545
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,207
Throw a comment here and tell me what this means.

546
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:08,268
The same exact statement as the programmer.

547
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,940
it will help down the road.

548
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,181
And it will also make that communication more clear

549
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:18,603
so both sides can see that things are sort of even.

550
00:32:20,203 --> 00:32:21,443
Bug reports is kind of a big one,

551
00:32:21,804 --> 00:32:29,206
because obviously your designers aren't going to be doing real bug reports.

552
00:32:29,526 --> 00:32:33,607
However, they get the pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha of the game.

553
00:32:34,107 --> 00:32:37,948
And they essentially are the testers of the pre-pre-pre-crap-alpha of the game.

554
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:41,409
And not only that, they're the pre-pre-pre-alpha of the tools.

555
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,990
And so, they end up being bug reporters in a certain way.

556
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,911
And so, try to know that this statement is sucky.

557
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,352
We had a designer on Hearthstone that would love to say this.

558
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:58,413
And to a certain extent, he was very systemic with this.

559
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:00,173
He would do this to everything.

560
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:02,653
If it was his favorite hamburger, he would say,

561
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:05,254
This hamburger is the greatest hamburger ever!

562
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:09,995
And we used to tease him, we used to say he was a Sith, because only Sith speak in absolutes.

563
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:19,320
And the problem is that what this statement gives you is a notion that he doesn't feel that...

564
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:25,804
He kind of feels like this bug sucks and it just needs to go away.

565
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:29,146
When in reality, yeah, of course it does.

566
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:32,908
But I need more information if I'm going to do it quickly.

567
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:42,039
by not having legitimate bug reports and by not sort of being a part of the bug fixing

568
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:48,282
process, it tends to build that us or them sort of thing. When in reality, it's a cooperation.

569
00:33:48,682 --> 00:33:52,543
It's two people working together to try and make the same thing. It's not an us or them.

570
00:33:55,264 --> 00:34:01,546
There's some trouble spots, obviously. Workflow, again, when you're dealing with a lot of tools,

571
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:05,688
a lot of people get...

572
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:09,807
very early on tools, and they start working with them, and they try to make what they can.

573
00:34:10,368 --> 00:34:11,869
And there's problems. There always will be.

574
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,711
But they try to make do.

575
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:17,934
They try to work around the bug, and they try to use the tool anyway.

576
00:34:18,214 --> 00:34:20,556
And a lot of times they do that because there's not time to fix them,

577
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:22,898
but a lot of times they just do it because human beings

578
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:26,681
will throw a little duct tape on the hammer and use it anyway.

579
00:34:27,842 --> 00:34:29,523
We're sort of trained to kind of make do.

580
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:32,766
But my point is, don't do this.

581
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:37,940
try to tell personal preferences and pet peeves on the current tool sets to your programmers

582
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:43,185
as quickly as you can, as nicely as you can, but as quickly as you can, because if they

583
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:48,869
can improve some of these very basic usability problems with tools and with your workflow,

584
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,774
it's going to not only increase your productivity, but it's going to eliminate this nasty little

585
00:34:55,475 --> 00:34:59,518
erosion of goodwill between the programmer and the designer.

586
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,800
This is sort of like...

587
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:05,878
if you're in a relationship with another human being

588
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:09,761
and let's say that person

589
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:13,264
doesn't lift the lid or doesn't put it down when they're done

590
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:16,967
it's not a big thing but eventually you hate them

591
00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:20,810
so if you just tell them

592
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,092
hey this is a pet peeve of mine could you please

593
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:27,255
and if they're reasonable human being they will go

594
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:29,937
well I could care less I'm just gonna do it

595
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:32,996
and it doesn't take any of my time, bang.

596
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:35,398
That's the sort of thing that I'm talking about.

597
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:37,880
Another thing is discovery,

598
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,161
and please don't laugh at my picture,

599
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,682
try to find a good picture for discovery.

600
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,825
Surprise, asparagus, he discovered that.

601
00:35:46,106 --> 00:35:51,350
Discovery is a necessary evil when it comes to design,

602
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,892
and it's not even that evil, right?

603
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:55,734
We're trying to mine the goodness,

604
00:35:55,874 --> 00:35:56,735
wherever we can find it.

605
00:35:58,916 --> 00:35:59,096
But...

606
00:36:00,763 --> 00:36:04,066
this can lead to some pretty hairy changes in the code,

607
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:05,386
especially big changes.

608
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:11,370
If you can try and work hard to find the big changes early on,

609
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,912
obviously that's ideal, but that's not always the case.

610
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,414
So when you come to the programmers with big changes,

611
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:22,177
obviously this is a time for potential strife.

612
00:36:22,978 --> 00:36:26,180
And if you come to them with a foisting sort of situation,

613
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,121
that's obviously where there's problems.

614
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:30,162
But if you come to it as a negotiation...

615
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:33,271
Hey, remember what we said before?

616
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,872
We have to take that back.

617
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:38,015
But we're willing to negotiate on this and this.

618
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:44,481
It makes it less about accept this and don't talk back.

619
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:47,384
As opposed to, we understand there's a partnership.

620
00:36:47,444 --> 00:36:52,488
We understand that we've had to come back on part of what we said before to be a true statement.

621
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:55,271
And we're willing to work with each other on it.

622
00:36:56,198 --> 00:37:01,881
Reprioritization is a little bit of, oh, that shouldn't have come up. Oh, never mind. Reprioritization

623
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:07,265
is a lesser evil. I mean, reprioritization might just be there's a demo coming up or

624
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:10,927
somebody needs to see something or maybe an artist needs something quicker because of

625
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:16,170
whatever. And so, these are a lot easier to sort of get into the system. But still, again,

626
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:21,173
try to do it as quick as possible because you don't want to waste work, obviously. Crunch,

627
00:37:21,513 --> 00:37:22,434
everybody's on tiptoes.

628
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:31,722
When you have people that aren't socially gifted, crunch period suddenly becomes a really hard place.

629
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:42,086
So, I don't really want to go into this too much, but just remind yourself that again, you're dealing with the can and the banana.

630
00:37:43,147 --> 00:37:46,508
This is the time when the wire might even be a little bit frayed, right?

631
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:53,511
You have to come at these sort of communications knowing that there's a big gulf to be done here.

632
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:55,979
And these trouble spots are really about trust.

633
00:37:56,379 --> 00:37:58,900
This is the trust part of the relationship.

634
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:03,302
The workflow, like I said, sort of slowly erodes trust over

635
00:38:03,362 --> 00:38:06,744
time, because the tool doesn't really do what I want.

636
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,945
And if I ask him, he's not going to really do what I want.

637
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,886
And I'm going to have just more hassles.

638
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:15,428
And discovery, again, you're dealing with the contract

639
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:18,749
between design and programming at this point.

640
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:20,410
And the contract.

641
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:25,428
Part of the problem that I see with this particular grouping is that the contract is a little

642
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:26,749
bit inconsistent.

643
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:33,613
Programmers agree on a contract and they actually have to write that contract into code.

644
00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:36,335
It's somewhat calcified for them.

645
00:38:37,256 --> 00:38:41,778
Design doesn't exactly have that same level of calcification.

646
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:48,343
They can feel a little bit looser with their contract and they have a little bit of an

647
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:49,643
easier time to kind of...

648
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:56,013
change their contract. Whereas, changes to the programmer's side of the contract are

649
00:38:56,073 --> 00:39:04,540
actually somewhat harsh. And this inconsistency, I think, is part of the rub. So, finally,

650
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,744
I want to talk about some bridge methods that are starting to appear in the industry. I

651
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:16,689
specifically use a rope bridge on this because it's serviceable, but there are some hazards,

652
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:17,710
and you have to watch out.

653
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:21,317
and one person with a big knife can kind of cut it all apart.

654
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,880
So first is a technical designer.

655
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:29,444
This is a person that's gone either direction, right?

656
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:35,169
You either have a designer who has a lot of programming skill

657
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:43,956
or a programmer that's decided that he wants to go more into the design direction.

658
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:44,737
And in either case...

659
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:50,996
What you really have here is somebody who speaks sort of both languages and they're down on the worker side.

660
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:57,359
And these guys can be amazingly effective at what they do, at not only bridging the gap between staff,

661
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:07,564
but also by potentially not being seen by the other members of their team as being,

662
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:11,866
the programmer is telling me to do this or the designer is demanding this.

663
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:16,315
they can soften the blow by knowing the language a little bit better of both sides.

664
00:40:16,975 --> 00:40:20,536
However, there's definitely some issues.

665
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:23,398
They need twice the mentoring and twice the management.

666
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:26,899
They technically are both a programmer and a designer

667
00:40:26,979 --> 00:40:31,941
and if they're not getting both mentoring and both management,

668
00:40:32,242 --> 00:40:35,523
you can run into some of the problems that you can with green programmers.

669
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:37,484
And the thing that we all know,

670
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:42,006
green programmers can cause some severe havoc in a code base.

671
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:47,492
They can check things in that maybe aren't approved and come in on a weekend with a great

672
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:50,633
idea and just hack it together.

673
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:54,436
Stick it in the game, thinking that everything is going to be great.

674
00:40:55,917 --> 00:41:00,720
We don't like this even when the programmers do it, and we certainly don't want anybody

675
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,741
else doing it, especially somebody that's supposed to be there to help us.

676
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:09,925
All of these sorts of things, and it's not just sort of rogue behavior.

677
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,206
It's also just...

678
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:17,939
inexperienced programmer things like poorly optimized code or potentially hackable code

679
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,042
on an online game. Things you have to think about. Also again, you have to take care when

680
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:29,944
you do have designers and programmers and technical designers involved because the tasking

681
00:41:29,984 --> 00:41:34,466
they might feel like somebody's stealing something from somebody. But they might not know who's

682
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:39,288
supposed to take a particular thing. And so there's a little bit of tap dancing when you're

683
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:39,728
dealing with

684
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:43,187
with cross-disciplinary groups simply because of that.

685
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:46,768
I also don't think that technical designers should be the main designer.

686
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:53,190
I think that the main designer should have only the player's needs in mind.

687
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,150
He should be the advocate for the player.

688
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:02,932
And technical designers, whether they want to or not, are also worried about the performance

689
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:05,692
and the maintainability of some of their stuff.

690
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:07,313
And that's good.

691
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,253
That's what we want.

692
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,176
causes them to be a little bit more pointed in that direction.

693
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:18,439
I also think that cross-disciplinary stuff is absolutely the future of some of these

694
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:24,802
features. We just can't have people that don't have both of these things. The art world has

695
00:42:24,923 --> 00:42:29,885
already embraced this directly with technical artists who can code shaders to make special

696
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:33,027
effects that are in every game out there, just about.

697
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:39,097
We're a little bit behind them, but that's the way of it.

698
00:42:40,017 --> 00:42:40,737
But only sort of.

699
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:43,818
Obviously, you have to deal with some of these issues.

700
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:49,419
And it's also going to be a culture thing as far as the corporations themselves.

701
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,941
Right now, there is the big three of career tracks.

702
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:58,282
And people that straddle the fence can sometimes have a hard time getting promoted

703
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:03,703
because if they don't have two managers that know everything they're doing in an effective way,

704
00:43:03,723 --> 00:43:05,103
it's going to be hard for them to get promoted.

705
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:11,078
a design manager, let's say, with a technical designer to really know just how much value

706
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:20,425
the coding work that a TD has put on into a project. It can be difficult for HR in general

707
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:29,371
to even hire one. On the other side is sort of the management version, which is the dual

708
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:30,251
class creative director.

709
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:40,295
This is obviously a guy who is sort of like a technical designer, except more at the management level.

710
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:42,897
And he knows enough so that he can push back on both sides.

711
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:49,240
He can actually be the person that maybe does the mediation and the management for your cross-disciplinary stuff.

712
00:43:50,801 --> 00:43:56,104
And sort of have that ownership clarity that the underling didn't have.

713
00:43:56,692 --> 00:43:58,954
But because he needs to manage both sides,

714
00:43:59,274 --> 00:44:01,236
he ends up not really being able to do much work.

715
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:03,637
And so you have a very powerful person ending up

716
00:44:03,798 --> 00:44:04,978
being just a manager.

717
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:06,840
And this is a classic problem, right?

718
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,741
But it's something to think about if you're

719
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:09,742
going to go in this direction.

720
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:16,887
So finally, just remember that programmers and designers

721
00:44:16,927 --> 00:44:17,768
are very different people.

722
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:20,190
They're not just different people.

723
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,529
their brains are wired in a very different direction.

724
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:25,410
And this isn't a bad thing, though.

725
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,731
This is actually a good thing,

726
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:29,152
because the best systems and the best games

727
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:31,634
come from a melding of design and engineering.

728
00:44:31,954 --> 00:44:35,396
Design and engineering's way of thinking is very orthogonal.

729
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:37,137
They're coming at the issues

730
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:38,558
from very, very different directions.

731
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:42,821
And this pushback is what causes the systems

732
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:44,021
to be as good as they are.

733
00:44:45,622 --> 00:44:46,823
But because they're so different,

734
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:48,504
you have to build that strong relationship.

735
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:51,894
And like in any relationship, communication is the heart.

736
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:54,276
And trust is the soul.

737
00:44:54,997 --> 00:44:57,058
You really have to come at it in this direction, and you

738
00:44:57,098 --> 00:45:01,942
have to realize that when you come to a programmer with a

739
00:45:01,982 --> 00:45:05,024
discovered task, you may be killing his abilities to

740
00:45:05,064 --> 00:45:06,085
succeed at this game.

741
00:45:06,686 --> 00:45:10,508
And that causes trust to be damaged, and it might futz

742
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:11,389
with the entire team.

743
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,192
Cross-disciplinary staff can be super valuable if you can

744
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:15,993
get over the problems.

745
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:18,314
And just remember, every day.

746
00:45:19,168 --> 00:45:21,910
that we're all on the same team and we all want to make something great.

747
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,273
We want to be something, we want to make something that we can be proud of.

748
00:45:26,253 --> 00:45:28,155
So that's, that's my talk. Thank you.

749
00:45:38,623 --> 00:45:39,364
Is there any questions?

750
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:00,523
What does it look like right now for those designers who are straddling the fence to

751
00:46:00,823 --> 00:46:05,184
get into the industry as a first-time hire?

752
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:07,866
Well, that's tough, right?

753
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:13,988
Because you're essentially at that point interviewing for two jobs that nobody knows if you can

754
00:46:14,008 --> 00:46:14,128
do.

755
00:46:14,928 --> 00:46:15,589
You know, designer.

756
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:17,690
I think it's very difficult for...

757
00:46:18,824 --> 00:46:21,346
just being a designer to get into the industry,

758
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:24,067
much less telling somebody that you're a technical designer.

759
00:46:24,268 --> 00:46:29,591
I think if you have put out your own indie game or something

760
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:31,672
or something like that as a programmer,

761
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,494
that you could maybe say that, yay,

762
00:46:33,614 --> 00:46:36,676
I was the designer and the programmer on this project.

763
00:46:37,376 --> 00:46:38,357
It did pretty well.

764
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:38,957
Check it out.

765
00:46:39,738 --> 00:46:41,179
That might be an in road.

766
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:45,241
But shy of that, I think that's a very tough road.

767
00:46:48,303 --> 00:46:48,643
Anybody else?

768
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:50,138
Yeah.

769
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:51,560
Howdy.

770
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,863
I love the idea that Hearthstone had a two-page design doc.

771
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:57,466
Could you go into some more detail about what that looked like?

772
00:46:57,506 --> 00:46:59,969
Like, for example, was there just one line for each mode?

773
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:04,273
No, it was more like, I mean, probably.

774
00:47:04,914 --> 00:47:07,116
But it was very boiled down to where...

775
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:12,373
none of the... I mean, the thing is, is Hearthstone itself is a very simple game, right? So, so

776
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:16,898
the design doc for Hearthstone was the very boiled-down version. I mean, you don't have

777
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:20,962
to have the design of all of the cards when you can have a design that just shows what

778
00:47:20,982 --> 00:47:26,548
the keywords mean, what the sort of game flow looks like, and, and, and just a few other

779
00:47:26,588 --> 00:47:27,549
things. You can kind of...

780
00:47:29,044 --> 00:47:33,467
fully describe Hearthstone very quickly. I mean, obviously, I don't have the two pages

781
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:36,909
where I'd share them with you because they're pretty kick-ass.

782
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:39,331
Yeah, I'd love to see it if you ever put it out someday. Thanks.

783
00:47:39,351 --> 00:47:39,731
Yeah.

784
00:47:42,353 --> 00:47:43,253
Hi, Brian.

785
00:47:43,554 --> 00:47:44,374
Yeah. Hey.

786
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:53,800
Well, I am a programmer turned designer, so I'm kind of the other way. What I was wondering

787
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,483
if this... I mean, how far do you go before starting to...

788
00:47:59,597 --> 00:48:04,902
look for help with other parts, like for example, the main issue I have is with the art department.

789
00:48:05,402 --> 00:48:11,368
They are like aliens to me, so it's kind of difficult to start talking with them without

790
00:48:11,408 --> 00:48:14,070
them just going into really artsy kind of terms.

791
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:15,852
So go to them and say that.

792
00:48:16,312 --> 00:48:16,953
Say, hey, you know what?

793
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:21,036
I really need understanding with you guys, and you guys are aliens to me.

794
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:24,379
Can we sit down and have a conversation and get a good vocabulary going?

795
00:48:26,122 --> 00:48:29,804
Exactly what you just said to me, go say to somebody on the design side and say,

796
00:48:29,844 --> 00:48:31,606
Hey, I want to make better games.

797
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:33,947
And I know that to do that, I need your help.

798
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:39,932
But right now you guys are speaking Simlish and I don't even know what you're saying.

799
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:41,433
Okay.

800
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:42,934
And just, that's how you do it.

801
00:48:45,135 --> 00:48:45,396
Thank you.

802
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:59,193
Um, so, uh, first, to answer the other person's question, we do have a lot of technical designers at Maxis, and they always start as engineers, because they have to prove themselves as engineers first.

803
00:48:59,553 --> 00:49:06,377
And that's, that's the only way that I've ever seen it done, so I, I would hire, I would go into try and be hired as an engineer, and then switch to design.

804
00:49:07,498 --> 00:49:10,740
My question is, if you're in a state where,

805
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:16,004
because a lot of what your talk is saying is about building this sort of trust from the beginning,

806
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:18,666
if you're in a state where the trust is already damaged,

807
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:22,789
do you have any tips for going back and attempting to repair that?

808
00:49:23,149 --> 00:49:29,534
Yeah, I mean, not to extend the marriage counseling metaphor too much,

809
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:31,336
but literally, you need a mediator.

810
00:49:33,034 --> 00:49:39,757
Until trust is repaired, communicate through the mediator, so that things can be couched.

811
00:49:40,217 --> 00:49:45,499
And obviously, the reason that the trust is broken is because there are some issues there, right?

812
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,421
There's some head-butting, there might even be egos involved, that kind of thing.

813
00:49:48,501 --> 00:50:00,386
And you need to add another person to the equation until things are smoothed out and parameters are set and boundaries are set and that relationship is more serious, right?

814
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:01,806
And then you can go back to...

815
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:07,933
to working together. But that's really the only way I've ever found.

816
00:50:08,314 --> 00:50:13,075
But who do you find that is that person, right? Like, who is that person that both sides can

817
00:50:13,116 --> 00:50:15,677
put their trust into? And that's probably the hard part, right?

818
00:50:15,797 --> 00:50:20,599
That's the hard part. That's where you need that cross-discipline staff. I mean, I've

819
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:23,160
had the luxury of being kind of that person on...

820
00:50:23,673 --> 00:50:28,437
in a lot of companies I've worked at, I've seen it, I've seen other people doing it.

821
00:50:29,498 --> 00:50:32,761
A lot of times if just the lead designer

822
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:35,504
is, is, is, um,

823
00:50:36,965 --> 00:50:40,168
what's the word I'm looking for? Veteran enough,

824
00:50:40,628 --> 00:50:44,632
is, is senior enough, he will have worked with enough.

825
00:50:45,827 --> 00:50:49,749
problems that he can mediate a little bit.

826
00:50:50,189 --> 00:50:50,950
But you need that.

827
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:51,991
You need that mediation.

828
00:50:52,231 --> 00:50:54,172
I don't think that those two people typically

829
00:50:54,492 --> 00:50:57,054
can do their workload and repair that relationship

830
00:50:57,314 --> 00:50:57,834
by themselves.

831
00:50:58,855 --> 00:50:59,495
Thanks.

832
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:03,658
If it's interesting for designers

833
00:51:03,738 --> 00:51:06,540
to learn scripting to get into programmers' head,

834
00:51:08,081 --> 00:51:09,522
since it's all about negotiation,

835
00:51:10,322 --> 00:51:13,184
what should designer ask programmers to do themselves

836
00:51:13,444 --> 00:51:14,265
to get into our heads?

837
00:51:15,298 --> 00:51:19,881
Well, I mean, that's kind of what I was saying, you know, the start of the process of the game.

838
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:24,564
In just the description of how the prototype is going to encompass the design,

839
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:28,246
you can hopefully get into that programmer's head by asking him questions like,

840
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:30,548
oh, you did it this way because...

841
00:51:30,568 --> 00:51:35,991
And he might say, well, it's because if I don't do it that way, the performance is one-tenth.

842
00:51:36,812 --> 00:51:39,914
And then you go, okay, now I know why he did that particular decision.

843
00:51:41,115 --> 00:51:42,736
You know, anything from...

844
00:51:45,906 --> 00:51:52,247
you know, just why, but also just how his particular brain wraps around a particular problem.

845
00:51:52,847 --> 00:51:59,989
You know, that's why I mention that process, is because getting into another human being's mind is a very difficult thing to do,

846
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:06,470
and using the game that you're working on as the tool that you do that with is probably the best way I've found to do that.

847
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,231
Okay, thanks.

848
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:20,034
Hi. So I agree with your experience that the programmers are very much focused on the performance of the code, and the designers hold that space of owning the player experience.

849
00:52:20,714 --> 00:52:35,301
Have you had any, or experienced any success where, early on, by hopefully getting the programmers more into the player experience, because they are creating the player experience, that kind of helps with that communication gap?

850
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:37,382
And if you have any suggestions for doing that, because...

851
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:46,243
Oh, absolutely. I mean, personally, I have always loved the notion of feature-based teams.

852
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:51,786
So when you have a team coming together, the reason they're coming together is not because they're working on a game,

853
00:52:51,926 --> 00:52:55,288
as opposed to working on Elizabeth, let's say, for Bioshock Infinite.

854
00:52:55,788 --> 00:52:59,790
The people that were on the Liz team, they called themselves that, the Liz team.

855
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:06,594
And it was the animators, the programmers, and the designers that were specifically working on that feature.

856
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:12,050
And I find that by coupling in that feature space

857
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,571
and owning a particular feature,

858
00:53:16,091 --> 00:53:19,112
you narrow down the amount of information

859
00:53:19,132 --> 00:53:20,492
that you need to be sharing,

860
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:21,992
and so there's deeper understanding

861
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:22,993
of that particular thing.

862
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,953
And so you get that closer,

863
00:53:25,753 --> 00:53:27,354
that deeper level of communication.

864
00:53:27,594 --> 00:53:29,434
And there's higher buy-in then too, right?

865
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:34,235
And so there's probably also a larger avenue for...

866
00:53:35,238 --> 00:53:36,039
hey, can you do this?

867
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:36,961
Hey, could we do this?

868
00:53:37,061 --> 00:53:38,383
Kind of back and forth as well.

869
00:53:42,248 --> 00:53:45,333
I'm an engineer and I've often had either artists

870
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:46,675
or designers come to me.

871
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:50,034
with a very specific thing that they want.

872
00:53:50,054 --> 00:53:52,076
And everything they say, I want this.

873
00:53:52,276 --> 00:53:54,658
And you're thinking, my response to your,

874
00:53:55,158 --> 00:53:57,240
what do you want to fix it question, everything is,

875
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,942
I always come back with, what is it you're trying to solve?

876
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:03,706
Because they often have a very specific idea

877
00:54:03,726 --> 00:54:06,128
of what they think they need to solve their problem,

878
00:54:06,388 --> 00:54:08,650
but it often isn't the actual solution

879
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,111
or the best solution in the engine.

880
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:15,423
So you always need to make sure that you ask because otherwise you have this miscommunication

881
00:54:15,443 --> 00:54:15,823
and everything.

882
00:54:15,843 --> 00:54:20,044
And if you give them what they explicitly ask for, it often doesn't work the way they

883
00:54:20,064 --> 00:54:20,545
expected.

884
00:54:20,845 --> 00:54:21,105
Agreed.

885
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:21,885
Yeah.

886
00:54:22,105 --> 00:54:24,726
I mean, and that's why I tell people to ask that question.

887
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:24,946
Yeah.

888
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:27,667
Always ask, you know, what is it you really want?

889
00:54:27,687 --> 00:54:31,349
I mean, don't tell me specifically what you want me to have done.

890
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:35,090
Tell me what it is you're trying to fix and I may have a better solution for you.

891
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:35,410
Yep.

892
00:54:36,198 --> 00:54:41,764
Yeah, and in the same vein, if that is the case, then maybe you need to do a little bit

893
00:54:41,804 --> 00:54:46,449
more education of your designers because they didn't even know they could do that already.

894
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:50,112
They didn't understand the engine enough and everything to know what their options were

895
00:54:50,132 --> 00:54:51,914
or what they should have done.

896
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:52,555
Very cool.

897
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:59,382
So earlier you mentioned the communication between you and the designer, between the

898
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:04,472
third and first person for the scripting. Are there any other really good examples you

899
00:55:04,512 --> 00:55:08,654
can think of for Hearthstone specifically of good communication between programmers

900
00:55:08,694 --> 00:55:09,215
and designers?

901
00:55:09,615 --> 00:55:17,499
Well, I mean, remember, I was doing all of the gameplay and AI programming for Hearthstone

902
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:25,084
pretty much, and one guy was doing the vast majority of the design of the cards and that

903
00:55:25,124 --> 00:55:27,865
kind of thing for the design.

904
00:55:30,012 --> 00:55:31,893
to a certain extent, he was a technical designer,

905
00:55:32,113 --> 00:55:34,673
because he was actually coding the script on those cards.

906
00:55:35,273 --> 00:55:39,554
And so there was a ridiculously tight relationship there.

907
00:55:39,814 --> 00:55:44,375
I talked about this in the Hearthstone thing,

908
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:46,795
is that there was a specific mandate

909
00:55:46,835 --> 00:55:50,636
to have an intermediate player be the base goal for the AI.

910
00:55:50,676 --> 00:55:52,637
They just didn't want a high-level player,

911
00:55:52,677 --> 00:55:53,817
they wanted an intermediate player.

912
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:56,737
And so I spent a month and a half

913
00:55:56,797 --> 00:55:58,958
just sitting with the designer.

914
00:55:59,972 --> 00:56:03,453
trying to figure out what an intermediate player was.

915
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:08,035
And not only with him, but with other people that were playing,

916
00:56:08,316 --> 00:56:09,796
so that we could get that idea.

917
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:11,437
And then going forward,

918
00:56:13,258 --> 00:56:16,579
a lot of times, when I would get a bug,

919
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,641
I would come over to him directly,

920
00:56:19,741 --> 00:56:21,402
and we would sort of discuss it together.

921
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:24,783
I found that by including him a lot

922
00:56:25,524 --> 00:56:27,445
in the solution to bugs, in...

923
00:56:28,362 --> 00:56:29,883
new features that we were thinking of adding.

924
00:56:30,383 --> 00:56:32,925
Like right from the start, doing that inclusion

925
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:38,108
not only allowed him to know the process more under the hood

926
00:56:38,509 --> 00:56:41,631
so that new cards coming in wouldn't have the same bugs

927
00:56:42,411 --> 00:56:47,315
or as well as I knew things that he hated.

928
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:50,557
He's like, well, we haven't even fixed the last time we did this.

929
00:56:50,737 --> 00:56:53,359
You know what I mean? Like I would get that feedback very, very quickly.

930
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:54,840
I think that it's more just a...

931
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,752
The more tightly coupled you are, the more tightly coupled you should work.

932
00:57:00,513 --> 00:57:00,773
You know?

933
00:57:01,153 --> 00:57:04,937
You should get up out of your chair and go ask that person as much as you can.

934
00:57:05,457 --> 00:57:08,079
Right, yeah, I prefer the personal communication too.

935
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:08,800
Thank you.

936
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,320
Thanks.

937
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:11,042
Anybody else?

938
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:12,203
Hi.

939
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:19,549
So you tell Hearthstone design doc if only two pages long.

940
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:19,789
Yeah.

941
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:20,550
So...

942
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:25,312
probably programmers in Blizzard, specifically on first

943
00:57:25,332 --> 00:57:27,453
zone, have some flexibility.

944
00:57:28,054 --> 00:57:31,516
Like, you don't specify designers,

945
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:35,319
don't specify it's really detailed.

946
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:40,442
And only if some issue appears, they

947
00:57:40,922 --> 00:57:42,123
tell programmers to change it.

948
00:57:42,784 --> 00:57:45,766
Like, if the programmer is flexible,

949
00:57:46,386 --> 00:57:48,347
or they have clear specifications,

950
00:57:48,447 --> 00:57:49,968
but not written on the page.

951
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:52,935
like in your work on AI probably.

952
00:57:54,056 --> 00:57:58,320
How many design decisions you made, for example?

953
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,163
Actually, the AI in Hearthstone was largely driven by the

954
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:03,685
design choices that we made.

955
00:58:04,185 --> 00:58:07,148
I mean, everything from the actual techniques that I used

956
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:12,853
to specific game plays that the AI would make were sort of

957
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:13,954
discussed with design.

958
00:58:13,994 --> 00:58:15,976
And it was very experience driven.

959
00:58:16,878 --> 00:58:22,619
So I mean, yeah, it wasn't all written down, but a lot of that was explored, discovered

960
00:58:22,659 --> 00:58:25,700
work that was coming in, like, after alpha anyway.

961
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,501
And so that wasn't something I would have ever really wanted written down.

962
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:30,761
And there was not really time to do that.

963
00:58:30,781 --> 00:58:32,601
It's not like programmer decisions.

964
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:35,822
It's a result of communication, yeah?

965
00:58:36,202 --> 00:58:38,622
Yeah.

966
00:58:38,662 --> 00:58:40,243
I'm not exactly sure what your question was.

967
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:52,998
The problem is, as a designer, you cannot describe the feature in all details.

968
00:58:53,138 --> 00:58:53,459
Of course.

969
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:59,303
In all possible things that might happen.

970
00:58:59,663 --> 00:59:04,187
So, a programmer makes its own decisions, its own...

971
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:09,585
design decisions when it write it. How you saw it?

972
00:59:09,865 --> 00:59:15,011
I think I see what you're saying. So, what you're saying is that a two-page design basically

973
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:20,636
leaves the door open for a lot of programmer decisions. And in this case, maybe you're

974
00:59:20,696 --> 00:59:24,620
right that the fact that he could have a two-page design was because I was very collaborative

975
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,583
with him and didn't do that. However, my

976
00:59:30,014 --> 00:59:34,058
read on the two-page design document is just that it suddenly becomes something that's

977
00:59:34,118 --> 00:59:38,543
legitimate and maintainable, and that you can, like, update.

978
00:59:38,903 --> 00:59:41,546
Whereas if it's 100 pages long, nobody's even going to open it.

979
00:59:42,547 --> 00:59:43,708
That's my point with that.

980
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,271
Yeah?

981
00:59:46,331 --> 00:59:48,613
So I relate a lot to the bit about...

982
00:59:49,337 --> 00:59:51,198
tech designers needing sort of twice the mentoring.

983
00:59:52,178 --> 00:59:54,739
But I'm wondering about the effectiveness

984
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,121
of a pure engineer as a mentor for the tech side

985
00:59:58,321 --> 01:00:00,162
or a technical designer as a mentor.

986
01:00:00,802 --> 01:00:02,563
Yeah, I mean, there's a trade off there.

987
01:00:02,663 --> 01:00:04,544
Hopefully, if you've got a mentor position,

988
01:00:04,564 --> 01:00:05,945
they've been in the industry for a while.

989
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:08,366
I mean, if they're doing gameplay or AI,

990
01:00:08,406 --> 01:00:09,987
they've done a lot of design anyway

991
01:00:10,047 --> 01:00:12,068
because there's no way to really do AI

992
01:00:13,169 --> 01:00:14,510
without being partial.

993
01:00:15,814 --> 01:00:22,078
in the design space, you know, you're crafting an experience using AI techniques, you know,

994
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,959
and that's primarily a design process anyway.

995
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:31,664
So if you have senior staff, they've either been in games for a while and so they can

996
01:00:31,684 --> 01:00:36,927
have a little bit of that, you know, I mean, everybody is not a zero or a one, right?

997
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,628
Everybody kind of is somewhere in the middle.

998
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:40,229
And so I agree with you.

999
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:44,552
If you have a very dry programmer, you maybe shouldn't have him be.

1000
01:00:46,006 --> 01:00:47,066
reviewing that guy's stuff.

1001
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:49,808
But there's very few of those.

1002
01:00:50,008 --> 01:00:50,548
You know what I mean?

1003
01:00:50,568 --> 01:00:53,210
They tend to not be managers in the first place, right?

1004
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,431
Because managers have to deal with varying

1005
01:00:55,471 --> 01:00:56,652
levels of their staff.

1006
01:00:56,692 --> 01:00:56,872
So.

1007
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:57,653
True.

1008
01:00:57,993 --> 01:00:58,053
OK.

1009
01:00:58,093 --> 01:00:58,333
All right.

1010
01:00:58,373 --> 01:00:58,653
Thank you.

1011
01:00:59,374 --> 01:00:59,754
Thanks, guys.
