1
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:11,663
Hey everyone, good afternoon, thanks for making it down to GDC Narrative Summit day one.

2
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:16,969
I'm guessing that you're all That Game Company fans, maybe?

3
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:22,697
Thanks for making it down, everyone.

4
00:00:22,717 --> 00:00:26,459
I feel like I'm presenting this slightly prematurely.

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,660
We did actually have a big beta release recently,

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,802
but I wanted to do a quick sense check before I dove into the presentation

7
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:39,265
to see how many of you guys have actually read or seen or even played New Games Guy.

8
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:40,666
Oh, a handful.

9
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,527
OK, great.

10
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:42,827
OK.

11
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:44,449
For the rest of you guys in the room,

12
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:45,970
there's actually a lot of surprises

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,273
that I won't be covering in this talk today.

14
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:51,295
So don't be afraid.

15
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:52,916
Don't shut your ears down when there's

16
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,138
spoilers in the presentation.

17
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:57,701
I think that hopefully everyone in this room

18
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,803
will walk away with something as well.

19
00:01:00,303 --> 00:01:01,384
So let me make a start.

20
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:04,613
So my name is Jenny Kong.

21
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:08,095
I am the story writer at That Game Company studio

22
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:09,476
based out in Santa Monica.

23
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:12,338
And I'm really thrilled to be sharing with you

24
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:15,460
the presentation, Evolving Emotional Storytelling

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,721
in our New Game Sky.

26
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:20,103
For those who don't know me, I'm also a narrative writer

27
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:22,605
for a couple of indie studios who are showcasing

28
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,526
the games out here at GDC this week.

29
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,988
And most recently, I actually directed and shot

30
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:29,169
a docu-series.

31
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:32,630
around storytelling in video games.

32
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,832
It follows 15 iconic and indie game creators

33
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:39,313
and it's currently streaming on Comcast and YouTube

34
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:41,334
if you haven't had the chance to check it out yet.

35
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:44,935
And just taking a step even further back,

36
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:47,316
I've been working in the video games industry

37
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:49,117
for around 15 years or so now.

38
00:01:49,517 --> 00:01:51,598
I began my career on the publishing side

39
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:53,379
back at Sony PlayStation UK,

40
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,840
working on a number of titles there.

41
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,890
So I've been working at that game company since 2013.

42
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,752
Sky, the new game, is probably the studio's most ambitious

43
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:06,652
project to date.

44
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:10,274
I would say that because not only are we developing the

45
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:12,495
game, but we're also publishing the game for the

46
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:13,415
most part as well.

47
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:15,636
We announced the title back in

48
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,200
late 2017 at the Apple Keynote stage,

49
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:22,746
and over the past year we've been aggressively beta testing

50
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:24,688
two key components of the game,

51
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:28,013
the multiplayer aspect and also the emotional aspect.

52
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:29,696
We want to get both of these right.

53
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:35,021
I think we're in the home stretch now, we're nearly finished with the game and ready to

54
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,682
kind of launch the global release.

55
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:42,707
But I'm so passionate about this area that I feel that over the past decade, emotional

56
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:49,452
storytelling has really seen some highlights over the past few years, primarily in the

57
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:51,214
linear game experience.

58
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:56,938
And what I hope today will do is to offer additional conversation to explore emotional

59
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,241
storytelling in the multiplayer domain as well.

60
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,961
So I would say that Sky is a spiritual successor

61
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:07,563
to some of the previous games that the studio have made.

62
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:10,305
I studied screenwriting at school,

63
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:13,748
but boy, this studio does things very, very differently.

64
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,390
But they did break from tradition

65
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,871
compared to their previous games.

66
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:21,494
So Sky is the first fully-fledged multiplayer experience

67
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:22,234
that they've launched.

68
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,977
It's gonna be multi-format, coming on iOS first.

69
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:27,619
The world itself is wholly online.

70
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:34,363
And then the game itself will touch upon both aspects of non-linear story as well as more

71
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:36,544
MMO type storytelling.

72
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:43,128
The big vision really is that we want to launch the game and have Sky appeal to as many people

73
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:46,651
as possible and we've tried to do that really with this next release.

74
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,873
Sky's been in development for the last six years.

75
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:55,398
It's a very long time, I don't wish six years of development and production to any of you guys in the room.

76
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,059
There's been a lot of starts and stops, U-turns, etc.

77
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:06,240
And my hope today is to really share with you some of the creative processes internally at the studio,

78
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:13,202
providing a top-level case study and analysis of how the story had changed over the six-year period.

79
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:19,166
I would say we're a team of 25, everybody in the studio interfaces with story at some

80
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,567
point, we're highly collaborative.

81
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:26,449
But I do want to give a shout out to my boss personally, Junova Chen, he's been a true

82
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:31,952
inspiration for my work in this game, as well as my colleagues Chris Bell and the design

83
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,992
team and Yui Tanabe and the art team.

84
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:37,914
Both of these guys have really put a lot into the emotion of Sky 2.

85
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,080
So that game company, how do we best define

86
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,121
emotional storytelling and the approach?

87
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:48,142
I would say that our goal is to connect players globally

88
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:50,203
through a positive emotional experience

89
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,024
in interactive entertainment.

90
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:55,485
We are an emotion-first studio.

91
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:56,605
What does that mean?

92
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:04,189
So for other studios, a green light project could look like, oh hey, there's a new piece

93
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:07,551
of technology, let's explore that and green light that project.

94
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:11,774
Someone has a great idea from a design perspective, let's kind of flesh that out.

95
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:17,537
Or someone might want to translate an IP, a film IP for example, into a game, let's

96
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:17,917
go for it.

97
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:19,518
We don't do any of that.

98
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:25,720
We are very much about focusing on what that positive emotion will feel like for the audience

99
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,521
and advocate that forward.

100
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:33,603
So what that means is that we will iterate and iterate across the other disciplines.

101
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:37,945
So whether it's design, story, art, music, we will keep recalibrating.

102
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:42,490
time and time again to make sure that the emotional experience is spot on.

103
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,532
We also focus very heavily on non-competitive play.

104
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:50,153
This has been kind of our domain over the past few titles.

105
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,870
And as we push forward with our next release,

106
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:57,033
we want to advocate that more genres and narrative

107
00:05:57,073 --> 00:06:00,276
are explored, because if we touch upon different genres

108
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:02,878
rather than the ones we've seen in the past two decades,

109
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:05,861
let's say, we can possibly procure different kind

110
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:07,702
of emotions in the games.

111
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:11,866
And what kind of games and narratives can we explore

112
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:15,129
that will nourish and enrich our emotional selves as a player?

113
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:21,751
We want to see games accepted as an art form alongside the other forms of entertainment.

114
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:26,265
So let me talk about some emotional storytelling tools

115
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:28,885
that we work towards at TGC.

116
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:31,326
Let me highlight three core tenets.

117
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:34,767
The first is emotion through universal language.

118
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:40,628
So a lot of other developers may lean on voiceover

119
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:44,169
or a flashback or a character dialogue piece,

120
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,809
even a text kind of popping up on screen

121
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,390
to hint and maybe explore what the exposition

122
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,570
of the story world is.

123
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,371
We don't do any of that.

124
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,352
I kind of wish we did sometimes, it would make my job easier.

125
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:04,715
Instead, we focus on prospectively looking towards the universal language of visual,

126
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:06,176
of themes, of music.

127
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:07,196
Why is that?

128
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:12,198
Because if you think about these elements of language across the world,

129
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:16,760
sometimes all it takes is a little piece of music to evoke a certain kind of emotion.

130
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,981
We don't need words, we just need that piece of music.

131
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:24,006
And so we've kind of been developing this area a lot more

132
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,368
and focusing on this too.

133
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,631
I would say that our previous game, Journey,

134
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,734
did lean on the Joseph Campbell model

135
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:31,695
of the hero's journey.

136
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:35,419
And with our next game, Sky, we touched upon that

137
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:37,822
as we made a start on the development process.

138
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:43,106
The second tenet I would like to explore is emotion through the environment.

139
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:47,069
You know, we're all familiar with environmental storytelling here.

140
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,753
One of the kind of aesthetics that we've kind of approached in the past,

141
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:54,275
again with other titles like Flower and Journey,

142
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:59,098
is that our artists like to work within a minimalist design space.

143
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:00,584
What does that mean?

144
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:04,147
So rather than try to reveal story through an object

145
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:07,890
or an item or a person, we try to remove these obstacles

146
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,633
out of the way because we feel possibly it might get

147
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:12,714
in the way of the emotional interaction

148
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:15,417
that we have as a player and the subject at hand.

149
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,060
Sometimes maybe something off screen is more powerful

150
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,683
as an emotional trigger than something that's on screen.

151
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:29,490
Genova talks quite candidly about inviting players into the game as though they were

152
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:30,331
archaeologists.

153
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:39,182
The idea that maybe backstory, hint of character, portrayal could be buried and or hidden within

154
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:39,983
the environment.

155
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,066
It's a playground and we invite you to join.

156
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:47,312
and kind of showcase what the story could be there.

157
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:51,638
It's more rewarding to unearth a piece of story item

158
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:54,221
than it is just to sit and watch another cut scene.

159
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,762
And the final tenet is emotion through action.

160
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:00,704
And what I mean by that is, you know,

161
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,605
let's think about, if you can imagine,

162
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:05,528
redefining what player actions and the moveset

163
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:06,789
could be within a game.

164
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:10,291
So if you are player A, and you have a sword,

165
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,153
and you're walking around, this is an adventure game,

166
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:14,655
you're wielding your sword, or you're player B,

167
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:18,064
and you're carrying a candle instead.

168
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:23,786
Now I'm praying that none of you are going to be carrying the candle and pyro-ing the

169
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:27,807
sky world once you get in because I don't think we have enough budget to rebuild the

170
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:28,347
world again.

171
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:35,580
Granted, the actions of each are very different, and therefore the emotions of each are going

172
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,581
to be very, very different.

173
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:39,283
So again, player A has a sword.

174
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:42,046
He's going to be destroying stuff maybe.

175
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:44,949
Player B has a candle with light.

176
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,973
Maybe he or she is illuminating things in the world.

177
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,061
So let me talk a little bit more about Sky.

178
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:53,201
What is Sky?

179
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,662
Sky is a social adventure set above the clouds.

180
00:09:57,002 --> 00:10:00,323
You play as one Sky descendant of many

181
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:03,884
that flies across this mysterious kingdom

182
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:05,964
looking to spread light back into the world.

183
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:09,765
The end goal is that once light is restored,

184
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:12,085
the constellation will come back alive.

185
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,206
It's a very fantastical world.

186
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,066
And very early on, we wanted to ground it.

187
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,109
and kind of thematically how could we do that?

188
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:23,312
Rather than portraying Sky as a fantasy game,

189
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:26,675
we wanted to portray it as a coming-of-age game instead.

190
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:30,458
We liked the idea that the character could be growing up

191
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:32,099
throughout the game's time.

192
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,783
We felt it was a very positive message to send out.

193
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:39,526
We liked the inclusivity of this genre too.

194
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:48,452
And I think the feeling that we wanted to explore also was the idea of childhood wonder as you explored this magical sky kingdom.

195
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:58,797
A lot of us, we've all had childhoods, we understand what that means, we remember some nostalgic feelings of this world and of this time.

196
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:03,239
And so we wanted to leverage maybe some language and motifs around childhood.

197
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:08,481
And I think that's why the characters were designed as children, you play a child.

198
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:12,503
and you primarily remain a child through the course of the game.

199
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:17,566
But this was a perfect entryway into the world that is pretty fantastical.

200
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,687
So I actually have a lot to cover,

201
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:23,869
but I will focus on how story changed in these three areas.

202
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,834
Over the course of the six years, I want to share with you how we adapted to a different

203
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:32,694
story structure.

204
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:40,058
I want to explore with you how we developed an emotional engine to explore the user story

205
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:40,479
in the game.

206
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:45,361
And finally, how we ended up testing emotion in the live community space.

207
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:51,909
So the first two years of Sky, we had a very small team

208
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,790
that explored prototyping the world, as you can see.

209
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,412
We wanted to feel the way that flight could be for a player.

210
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:02,813
We wanted to see how the traversal would work.

211
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,894
We had an awesome engineering team

212
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,695
that developed cool new technology

213
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,657
to make the cloud robust and fun to fly within.

214
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:11,938
And we also looked at the scope of gameplay

215
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:13,559
as well in this early stage.

216
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,841
For the next year or two, we started

217
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,403
with a very small story development team.

218
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:23,406
That included Jenova, myself, and a couple of other artists.

219
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,427
And there's no difference to maybe if you've

220
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:27,888
studied writing in the past.

221
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:31,130
We generated a lot of traditional story materials.

222
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:35,993
And what that meant is that we would use a whiteboard,

223
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,474
we would hash out what the emotional flow could be

224
00:12:38,814 --> 00:12:40,835
at each point in the game.

225
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:43,896
We developed mini story bibles in Google Doc

226
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,518
and drafted out what the player's background were,

227
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:49,279
what the characters' motives were.

228
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,245
and again looking at the different kind of pinpoints of the story that you yourself would be developing.

229
00:12:57,466 --> 00:13:03,891
And finally we also looked at, prospectively, how we could visualise the Sky Wall system.

230
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:09,476
But this was kind of early stages, so we wanted to kind of park that until a later stage.

231
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:14,521
At this time I also revisited some coming of age classics,

232
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:19,025
re-watching Wizard of Oz, Stand By Me,

233
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:23,350
even some of the more recent coming of age stories

234
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,333
Spirited Away, and re-reading The Little Prince.

235
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:29,115
That was one of the things that inspired us.

236
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:34,658
So as we started moving into the development phase,

237
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:39,322
this is a pretty large map that the art team drew out

238
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:43,786
around the kind of the grandeur of the Skyworld.

239
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,629
We would start out in number one,

240
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:51,232
around the Avery area and the Isle area,

241
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:53,634
moved to number two, which was the Prairie realm,

242
00:13:53,914 --> 00:13:56,456
and then the forest number three, so on and so forth.

243
00:13:57,057 --> 00:14:00,319
And we devised a multiplayer linear story path

244
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,480
across each realm within the Sky Kingdom.

245
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,303
And then in between development, we

246
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:10,006
would kind of map out almost like a mini three-act structure.

247
00:14:10,026 --> 00:14:13,048
So for the Prairie Realm, what would happen in the first act,

248
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:16,270
second act, third act in terms of the story beats,

249
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,271
how the player moved, what was the obstacles.

250
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,813
Myself and the concept art with Jenova

251
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:23,015
would kind of feel these elements out.

252
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:27,277
But a big mandate from Genova was like,

253
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:30,918
hey, we want players to repeat and play the game again.

254
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:34,299
And I'm like, so we've already gone to number seven,

255
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,700
so you want them to kind of start again at number one

256
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,741
and play through again with the same emotional beats

257
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:42,482
and the same things that are happening?

258
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:49,047
It was really tough to justify the current kind of setting that we have.

259
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:55,052
So we kind of banked it, we put it to a side and asked ourselves, okay, so what emotions

260
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:59,875
would spur a multiplayer group of people to revisit the Skyworld?

261
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:07,150
And kind of just progressing further on each realm, we start to look at the linear progression

262
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:08,592
of each area.

263
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,574
So we started with the Isle and the Prairie.

264
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:16,722
And the idea is, if you can think about it, the idea is that with each of these realms,

265
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:17,663
we would...

266
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,966
kind of showcase or unlock a new emotion.

267
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:24,267
So let's say for instance you and your sky friends,

268
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:26,188
you go into the prairie area,

269
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:28,809
and the idea is that this is kind of like

270
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,970
the first burst of childhood memories.

271
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:33,051
You feel freedom, you feel joy,

272
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,112
and then you would meet a character at the end

273
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:37,173
that would kind of compound that emotion.

274
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:40,155
And then through each realm,

275
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:42,836
as we kind of navigate through all the way to the end,

276
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:45,037
we wanted to ultimately

277
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,294
showcased the emotion of sacrifice.

278
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:50,435
Now how can we do that?

279
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:53,336
So we did a quick test in the forest area,

280
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:55,136
and the idea is that you and your friends

281
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:57,957
would kind of fly into this enchanted forest,

282
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,558
and then the further down into the woods you would get,

283
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:03,259
things aren't kind of looking so great,

284
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,139
and you actually lose your friends.

285
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:06,960
This is where we separate you from the friends

286
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,820
for the first time.

287
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,241
You would be confused,

288
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,501
you're not really sure what's going on.

289
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,941
You'd feel uncertain, right?

290
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:15,373
This felt very contrived.

291
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,293
It was like, I don't know how we're gonna do this.

292
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:21,435
We're retro-engineering and refitting emotions into levels.

293
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:25,817
And so, another try, another crack at emotion,

294
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:28,118
we set this plan aside too.

295
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:31,819
And we decided to keep some of these emotions in place

296
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,720
for the art team to develop the look and feel of each realm.

297
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:38,122
But they were kind of more like mood boards at this point.

298
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:46,268
The art team also started thinking about the design of the character and the design team

299
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:52,753
and Genova agreed that the player should really be showcased as a very plain character at

300
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:57,696
the beginning, kind of going back to that minimalist design if you will, so that any

301
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:59,298
people jumping onto the game.

302
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:02,336
they could almost connect to the avatar a lot quicker

303
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,237
because it's not customized yet.

304
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:06,658
They can kind of see themselves within that character.

305
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,681
Just as your character is getting kind of, you know,

306
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,782
all the garb and the masks as you see in the final picture,

307
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:17,344
the idea is that, you know, if you visited certain lands

308
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:20,326
and met certain characters, you would unlock masks,

309
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:22,347
power capes, items along the way,

310
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:24,648
and other people would kind of understand that,

311
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:26,449
oh, hey, you've actually been to that area.

312
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:27,630
I see that you have that item.

313
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:32,888
Concurrently, we spent some time developing the backstory.

314
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:35,591
I created a lot of mini documents

315
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:38,474
around each of the characters, the personalities,

316
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:41,717
the motives, and the concepts around these eight

317
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:44,640
elder characters in the Skyworld that you would meet.

318
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:48,164
And at this point, we leaned against the archetypes

319
00:17:48,204 --> 00:17:51,328
that you would see in a lot of the storytelling books.

320
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:57,452
But it felt very cliché, even when I was writing them, the idea that, hey, here's a

321
00:17:57,492 --> 00:18:01,995
child of light, look at them, they're holier than thou, they're here to help the world,

322
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:06,518
and here's these elder dudes that have just ruined everything and somehow they're evil.

323
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,300
I felt it was a very tragic story.

324
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,583
I wanted to share that feeling of emotion of tragedy and the history of what they'd

325
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:18,205
done, how they cared about the world and what happened.

326
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:24,101
And so we started looking at maybe elders as antiheroes rather than villains, I suppose.

327
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:30,177
And during this time, we kind of went one step further

328
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:32,058
and looked at the hero's journey again.

329
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:36,422
I just felt like the model was doing the game

330
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:39,164
a slight disservice in terms of not explaining

331
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:40,225
the narrative fully.

332
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,128
How could we account for the range of players coming in

333
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:46,410
to join the multiplayer group?

334
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,732
How can we showcase the variance of characteristics

335
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:50,933
in each of the NPCs?

336
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:55,618
and how do we include a replayable story loop in here?

337
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,223
Conflicts was something that we looked at time and time again.

338
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:03,946
We looked at stakes in the story. We went back and forth.

339
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:07,070
And, you know, we asked ourselves,

340
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,832
OK, is Sky a world that's driven by conflict,

341
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,715
or is it a world that's driven by purpose?

342
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:16,200
Do we see good and evil in this world?

343
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:20,306
Or do we see and celebrate the beauty of light and dark

344
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:23,631
and the duality that we are all in ourselves, light and dark?

345
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,622
I did some additional research and I want to share with you if you guys haven't read

346
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:30,442
up on this yet.

347
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:36,364
This is a new initiative called The Collective Journey by Jeff Gomez, the brilliant Jeff

348
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,525
Gomez and his team at Starlight Runner.

349
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:43,147
He's not trying to replace the hero's journey, he's trying to kind of add an extra layer

350
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:49,390
to basically say that hey, modern day story structure in the digital age is very different.

351
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,352
You see it online, you see it in politics every day.

352
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,114
People want to get involved, it's not about one person saving the world.

353
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:04,639
We like this model, we like that empowered and activated communities coming together in the Skyworld.

354
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,941
Communities that wanted to not bring down one big bad villain,

355
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:13,284
but to seek systematic change that would change the world inside out.

356
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:17,586
And to showcase the multiple sides and the voices of people involved.

357
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:20,927
So Genova and I, we all got excited about this TV structure,

358
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,409
of this ensemble storytelling, you know, looking at Game of Thrones, etc.

359
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,830
And this side migrating into some of our brainstorms,

360
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,992
that we were actually now thinking more of the story as TV,

361
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:34,773
episodic maybe, rather than kind of one big story.

362
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:39,008
So the collective journey really redefines

363
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:41,030
some of the emotional qualities of Sky

364
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,470
and the nuances of our game,

365
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:44,591
and it starts to shift emphasis

366
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:47,753
towards more of a multiplayer non-linear experience.

367
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:51,635
What I like is points 10 and 11,

368
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:53,596
the idea that in this model,

369
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:55,897
we're celebrating vulnerability in the character

370
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,418
and also sacrifice, and again,

371
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:01,880
we have all a part to play in this world.

372
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,302
Again, not just one person's gonna save the day.

373
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:10,453
So we now start moving into the pre-production build,

374
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,757
and you're gonna see this map time and time again.

375
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:14,379
It's getting a bit crazy there, I think.

376
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:22,893
But kind of building off the first playthrough where we started with the aviary, the prairie,

377
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:23,573
the forest.

378
00:21:24,694 --> 00:21:29,455
Once as a player you've locked those areas, you can actually fly to those areas at any

379
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:29,795
time.

380
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:33,216
You don't have to play through the entire map to kind of get back to it.

381
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:38,598
And we like this idea of zigzagging back through the different realms because Encourage

382
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:44,623
group exploration, you can go back and delve into an area of a realm that maybe you've

383
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:50,668
forgotten to take a different path, or maybe there's hidden areas of story and items that

384
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:51,409
you didn't see.

385
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:56,173
And I was getting really worried at this point, I was like, I don't want to, I want to protect

386
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:58,955
the Ace story, I don't want to start impacting and messing with that.

387
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:00,956
But it actually didn't.

388
00:22:01,717 --> 00:22:03,959
The players that tried the game actually...

389
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:07,441
enjoyed the A-story mythology, they wanted to learn more,

390
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:09,382
they can't wait to kind of finish the game

391
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:10,642
and play the global release.

392
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:14,144
But the B-story components of seasonal content

393
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:16,805
and the world events allowed a bit more

394
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:18,726
of a breathing space within the world.

395
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:23,128
And it really pushed the design team and the story team

396
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:24,749
to think a little bit more about

397
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:26,490
what the core gameplay loop would be.

398
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:32,853
So, just to track this through, what it meant was that as you travel through each realm,

399
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:36,035
it was a looser kind of structure.

400
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:42,138
The group would be moving from one realm to another, solving puzzles, flying through new

401
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:46,181
areas, meeting these elder characters, and spreading light.

402
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:46,501
Right?

403
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,301
It sounds great.

404
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,462
It's collaborative.

405
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:50,503
No, no, it wasn't.

406
00:22:52,463 --> 00:22:57,884
So the pre-production build, it didn't, when we played it as a team and we did many trials,

407
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:01,205
I don't think it moved us emotionally as we thought it would be.

408
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:03,706
Like, we're spreading light, we're doing great things in this world.

409
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:06,686
We had a lot of internal playtesters too.

410
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:10,667
It was really funny actually, in one survey with a playtester,

411
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:13,668
a woman was playing with another woman, she was sat opposite her.

412
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:18,652
And she actually thought it was all NPCs in the world at some point, and I'm just like,

413
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:23,257
wow, we really have not done our job if she felt it was all NPCs in this world.

414
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:28,962
So we could see the players, you know, physically traveling together through each of the realms,

415
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:31,285
but they weren't emotionally connected.

416
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:35,108
So if they're not going to be emotionally connected, they're not going to do the other

417
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:38,471
stuff that we want to, you know, see if they'll be gravitating towards.

418
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:43,206
The one thing that did happen during some of these playtests

419
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:47,527
was Jenova explored the element of including a tool,

420
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,647
the idea of the candle, which was a breakthrough

421
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:52,928
in some of the story work that we did.

422
00:23:53,928 --> 00:23:55,549
And I like the candle because it actually

423
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,209
forges the player to have both a physical

424
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:02,110
and emotional relationship and connection with the world.

425
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,791
So the idea that you would be going around lighting things,

426
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:09,372
helping the NPCs and the world out.

427
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:14,336
But not only that, that it was connecting player on player as well.

428
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:19,501
So the idea is if I have a candle and I want to hold it out to you, you have a candle that's not lit

429
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:24,405
and I'm lighting your candle and giving energy back to you, wouldn't that be a great thing?

430
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,541
And so as we were moving very sluggishly through this pre-production build,

431
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:34,742
we kind of, I think, had a eureka moment.

432
00:24:35,062 --> 00:24:38,363
Okay, well, we've zeroed in, we've exhausted all the emotions we can.

433
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:42,425
Maybe let's start looking at what an emotional engine could look like.

434
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:47,847
And we focus on altruism as an element, and also connection as an element.

435
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,468
What do I mean by an emotional engine?

436
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:55,009
So before we were looking at emotional moments

437
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:57,890
in each of the realms, and that would help drive us through

438
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,610
and build us through to the end of the game,

439
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,990
we scrapped that.

440
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,471
We decided to focus on an engine that

441
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:06,672
would power the gameplay and the story

442
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:08,412
through from beginning to the end.

443
00:25:09,752 --> 00:25:12,453
The big question was, was this enough, really,

444
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:15,174
to sustain positive experience with the entire world

445
00:25:16,254 --> 00:25:17,894
and to invite people back into the game

446
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:18,935
and for them to enjoy it?

447
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:23,551
So as we were ramping up to the beta build,

448
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:26,013
we started looking at the friendship connection.

449
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:29,035
This is something that you might have seen before in Journey.

450
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:31,117
We started to kind of build off of that.

451
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:34,840
And we liked the idea of the candle moment.

452
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,342
So the team and design team started

453
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:41,346
looking at how can we leverage the gifting of candles

454
00:25:41,426 --> 00:25:42,026
to each other.

455
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:45,229
the idea that you can unlock friendship functions.

456
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:50,112
So if I give you three candles, we can unlock the capacity

457
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:52,894
to hold hands, and then I can lead you around the world

458
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,255
and share with you some of my favorite parts of Sky.

459
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:58,978
Or maybe you want to gift me three candles,

460
00:25:59,698 --> 00:26:01,840
and then we will unlock the hugging function.

461
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,941
People like to hug in the game.

462
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:05,582
You'll see why when you play.

463
00:26:06,743 --> 00:26:08,044
And then so on and so forth.

464
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:10,606
A chat functionality and other things is pretty cool.

465
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:17,561
We also experimented and pushed the needle a little bit to see, hey, can we leverage

466
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:18,642
candle currency?

467
00:26:18,722 --> 00:26:25,889
Maybe people can buy candles and if they haven't found a cape yet or a mask, they can leverage

468
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:26,450
some of this.

469
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,834
It's not necessarily like I will buy the candles and then I'll buy things for myself.

470
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:35,077
The idea is that I will gift you candles and you can gift me candles.

471
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:39,080
So that we have that exchange and depending on what you want to do with your candles,

472
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,983
you can buy some things or unlock some things and vice versa as well.

473
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:45,518
So this was the big one.

474
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,259
We went into beta testing over a year ago

475
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,761
and really, you know, testing emotion at scale.

476
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:55,242
We had over 20,000 plus players global.

477
00:26:55,603 --> 00:26:56,763
Some of you guys in here,

478
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:57,944
you've had a chance to check it out.

479
00:26:58,864 --> 00:27:00,345
And these are the kind of key areas

480
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:01,826
that we began to test in.

481
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:04,687
So what was the emotional feedback of the game,

482
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:08,069
multiplayer dynamic, friendship, replay value.

483
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:08,849
That's the big one.

484
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:16,811
And in the beta test, I would say that we kind of leveraged around 6 to 8 builds, again

485
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:22,614
focusing on each time, alright, what was the emotional experience of the game, and looking

486
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:25,756
at the engine of altruism and connection.

487
00:27:27,037 --> 00:27:31,479
With each of the builds, we would get feedback, and then we'd slowly tweak controls.

488
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:35,322
game mechanics, a story, cooperative play,

489
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:36,843
some of the quests in the game,

490
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:38,965
and even move things around in the world

491
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:41,908
if it helped people to be more generous with each other.

492
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,590
We used a tool called Firebase,

493
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:48,914
which sees when players drop out of the game.

494
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:52,257
It's a terrible thing, don't use Firebase.

495
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,599
You're just like, hey, they're having fun.

496
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:55,880
Oh, no, they're not, they hate the game.

497
00:27:58,222 --> 00:28:03,284
And we also followed up each build with in-game surveys.

498
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:04,984
Let's find out what you think about the game.

499
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:09,246
We read feedback on Discord, Twitter, Facebook.

500
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:12,747
We opened up our inboxes to the world and said,

501
00:28:12,887 --> 00:28:16,188
send us your long emails, tell us what you think, pretty please.

502
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:20,069
And this was great, we really wanted that feedback.

503
00:28:20,969 --> 00:28:23,890
And so we built upon this narrative gameplay of altruism

504
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,190
spreading light to the world,

505
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,611
and this was pretty much what was in the beta build.

506
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:33,771
Again, this was a time to refocus and recalibrate around friendship again.

507
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:39,335
The team spent a lot of time on this area because we felt this would be the key to the

508
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:43,198
replay value and this was a big focus during the time.

509
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:53,867
Okay, so six months to nine months of iteration, lots of qualitative and quantitative data.

510
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:56,809
We're all piling, you know, reading through every team member.

511
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,775
And my god, people were harsh on this game.

512
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:06,580
These are the things that we don't want to share, but here I am sharing them.

513
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:12,247
The players, as you can see, struggled to understand what was going on in the game.

514
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:13,868
They didn't understand the user goal.

515
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,774
Story wasn't clear to them, sure, there was some placeholder cinematics.

516
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,955
Some players didn't even want to help other people.

517
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:22,776
They were not compelled.

518
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:24,476
They were just doing their own thing and that was it.

519
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:27,958
And then certain, the vocal members,

520
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:32,640
they were just outright rejecting multiplayer altogether.

521
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,700
Like this guy.

522
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,280
He was like,

523
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:37,702
I don't like that I'm forced to do this for some stuff.

524
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:39,743
Let me be free to choose.

525
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:41,703
Alright, okay.

526
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:45,065
And we had this consistently

527
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:47,546
for the first portion of the beta trials.

528
00:29:49,273 --> 00:29:52,614
it was very clear that we hadn't built enough

529
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:55,816
into the story world to earn the player's compassionate

530
00:29:56,036 --> 00:29:58,037
or friendship behavior.

531
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:01,238
But the biggest complaint really was that players felt

532
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:04,240
the friendship component of the game was imbalanced.

533
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,341
And this is harsh because we're trying to make a game

534
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:09,782
that connects people, right?

535
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:14,044
So one guy was like, I'm leveraging my friendship points

536
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:17,046
to unlock content and collectibles in this world.

537
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:20,087
You're giving me candles, I'm giving you candles.

538
00:30:20,507 --> 00:30:24,168
I want your candles just to unlock the cool stuff, you know?

539
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:27,229
And it felt very inauthentic and at times very, very greedy.

540
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,550
And we're TGC, we don't do greedy.

541
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,191
I don't know how to do greedy.

542
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,032
And this was really tough on us.

543
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:37,973
So we took a bit of a break, we took a step back

544
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:42,095
and began to shift focus and reiterate on this emotional engine

545
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:46,517
and try and look at different ways to represent altruism instead.

546
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:53,215
Instead of building friendships around the act of altruism,

547
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:56,458
could we actually leverage altruism first

548
00:30:56,978 --> 00:30:58,660
and then see if people come to it,

549
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:01,302
and then form lasting friendships?

550
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:04,485
So what that meant was we didn't focus so much

551
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:06,147
on the friendship-building component.

552
00:31:06,187 --> 00:31:08,109
We just had to trust that it was going to happen.

553
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,971
People are going to be friends in this world.

554
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:15,054
We instead focused on building out moments of altruistic play

555
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:18,976
across the NPCs and also between players.

556
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:23,919
We redesigned some of the creature and civilian saving quests,

557
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,762
but you had to do it in a multiplayer setting.

558
00:31:29,202 --> 00:31:31,784
The idea that four players would come together

559
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:36,527
and kind of shepherd light back into the soul of a creature.

560
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:40,348
We began thinking about how we can make multiplayer more fun

561
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:44,949
and start designing and releasing musical instruments in Sky.

562
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:49,690
People loved it, even the people that didn't like to play instruments,

563
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,770
didn't know how to play it, they were jiving, it was awesome for them.

564
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,311
And then we started also looking at new areas in the game

565
00:31:57,331 --> 00:32:01,612
that had nothing to do with story, so we built out things like an ice rink,

566
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:03,692
we had a crab cave,

567
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:08,718
pit. I don't know why we would have a crab pit, but there they are holding two crabs on the left.

568
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,901
They love that area, by the way.

569
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:16,167
And this was just promoting, you know, friendship play. It's nothing to do with the story.

570
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:22,235
And the main focus is not progression through friendship, but progression through altruism.

571
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:25,596
We talked about hugging and holding hands.

572
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:29,818
Those abilities became unlockable very, very quickly in the game,

573
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:31,358
very soon after.

574
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:35,400
You could just spend one candle and you had that ability.

575
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,222
And finally, we started to look at multiplayer challenges,

576
00:32:40,302 --> 00:32:42,422
where the players would have to protect each other

577
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:45,063
during certain sequences in the game.

578
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:52,890
So over the next six months we found that there was a slow but somewhat drastic change

579
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,892
in some of the player feedback we were getting.

580
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:59,758
People were beginning to understand some of the story elements that we were trying to

581
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:05,325
get through and we were starting to see compassionate community driven behaviours within.

582
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:08,367
some of the beta players, a lot of the beta players

583
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,848
stuck around and played the game every day.

584
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:13,729
And what was interesting was that they were,

585
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,130
once they had like, you know,

586
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,492
played all the A story content and the B story content.

587
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:22,538
They were making adventures and stories on their own,

588
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:23,459
unprompted.

589
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,721
That's what they were coming back for in Sky.

590
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:29,103
It wasn't necessarily the stories that we relayed to them.

591
00:33:30,464 --> 00:33:33,666
And somehow the unexpected replay value

592
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,968
that we'd been seeking all this time

593
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:37,829
actually came from the players themselves.

594
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,912
Instead of preparing content to put out into the world,

595
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:44,034
the world actually had became theirs already.

596
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:49,735
So it's still a work in progress, but this is kind of the chaotic map of the different

597
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:52,358
story structures we've been kind of playing around with.

598
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:58,285
We still have the kind of main A mythology story, the seasonal event content, and then

599
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:03,551
what I call the user-generated multiplayer stories peppered throughout the world as well.

600
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:09,933
I want to share with you a letter that encapsulates what's possible with positive interactions

601
00:34:09,993 --> 00:34:16,094
in games, and to really emphasise that the community themselves has redefined the trajectory

602
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:17,315
of storytelling in Sky.

603
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:21,996
We owe a lot to them, and that's why we're working so hard to finish the game.

604
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:25,236
Here's the team.

605
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:26,577
They're hustling.

606
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,437
I'm at GDC.

607
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:28,217
Thank you very much.

608
00:34:29,787 --> 00:34:33,468
The global release will be hopefully with you guys very soon.

609
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:39,969
So in conclusion, just some tips as to how to approach emotional storytelling,

610
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,390
more so in a multiplayer setting rather than a linear setting.

611
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:48,651
I would advocate that storytellers and developers look outside the conventional

612
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:54,913
tropes and structures to find and explore new ideas of what emotional storytelling can be.

613
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,495
You can't dictate emotion at any point, it's very hard.

614
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:03,376
Instead, experiment extensively how to uncover and reveal

615
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,197
what this emotional engine could look like.

616
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:06,738
Keep testing, keep working at it,

617
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,219
and see what drives the player from beginning to end.

618
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,640
That emotion might not be what you think it is.

619
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,322
Treat your community very well.

620
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:17,703
Their feedback is completely invaluable

621
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:19,684
and probably the most authentic it can be.

622
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,811
and stay open to what could be available emotionally.

623
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:28,475
Some of the emotions we saw in the game are happy accidents

624
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:31,860
and actually reveal the true nature of what Sky can be.

625
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:41,343
So I started the talk advocating more genres of narrative in video games can evoke more

626
00:35:41,403 --> 00:35:47,406
emotions in video games and I hope that there's some ideas that I've shared with you today

627
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:51,668
that you can go back to your teams or your studios to experiment with.

628
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:55,470
This topic is very, very important to me.

629
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:01,594
I wholly advocate building out emotional storytelling in games and thank you so much for your time

630
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:01,894
today.

631
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:02,294
Thank you.
