00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:12,547
Hi, welcome to Designing for Multiple Minds.

2
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:14,248
I'm Kim.

3
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:16,389
I'm a longtime game developer and researcher

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,451
with a degree in cognitive science, as well as a PhD in AI.

5
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,992
Today, I run my own game studio, Stray Bombay,

6
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:24,994
where we're currently working on a cooperative first-person

7
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:25,294
shooter.

8
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:27,255
Prior to that, I spent four years

9
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:29,736
at Riot Games as the head of player behavior, which later

10
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:30,937
became the head of player dynamics,

11
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,238
where I worked alongside some pretty incredible folks,

12
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:35,079
including Wes, who you're going to meet momentarily.

13
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:38,287
In 2017, I co-founded the Fair Play Alliance,

14
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:41,170
which is an industry-wide coalition for fostering

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,652
healthier player interactions as a core part of how

16
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:44,332
we make games.

17
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:46,454
I'm also the current executive director.

18
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,796
Much of my work and passion centers

19
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:50,618
on why people do the things that they do

20
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:53,140
and how this can help make us better game designers.

21
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:56,094
Hi, my name is West.

22
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:58,814
I'm a designer, musician, and the current head

23
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:00,235
of player dynamics at Riot Games.

24
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:02,055
And this is where Kim and I met.

25
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:04,876
Gosh, I'm not sure how many years ago at this point.

26
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:07,436
I'm also an executive steering committee member

27
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:09,997
for the Fair Play Alliance and have

28
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,098
been designing behavior and social systems

29
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:14,858
for a decade or more.

30
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,919
At this point, I'm focused exclusively

31
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,939
on helping to evolve the field of player dynamics.

32
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,660
And when I think about what I'm most passionate

33
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,387
about in regards to games and music,

34
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:32,509
it's creating dynamic, meaningful, emergent experiences.

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,270
And that's what brings us here today.

36
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:38,316
The focus of today's talk is on two major elements.

37
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,977
First, we want to introduce you to Player Dynamics

38
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:42,157
and what we think it is today,

39
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,418
and talk a bit about why we think it is a unique

40
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,699
and useful field, and why we feel there's value

41
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,499
in identifying an explicit discipline.

42
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:51,400
Second, we want to walk through our own design process

43
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,661
in Player Dynamics, including some design frameworks

44
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,661
and strategies that we hope you will find useful

45
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:56,541
outside of this talk.

46
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:00,805
Of course, this talk is short, which means that we're probably going to do everything a disservice.

47
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:04,327
So we invite you now to reach out later on if you'd like to learn more,

48
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,369
and we'll ask you to reach out again toward the end.

49
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:09,711
One thing that we want to stress if you're not already thinking this way,

50
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:13,734
designing for healthy interactions is a craft that requires effort and intention.

51
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:17,357
We know games don't design themselves, and neither do player dynamics.

52
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:20,740
It has to be woven through the fabric of the game, starting from ideation.

53
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:25,699
And it's worthwhile prefacing this with, in some ways,

54
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,201
player dynamics isn't exactly new.

55
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:29,665
It's just gaining momentum in game development.

56
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:31,707
It sits atop a great deal of research

57
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:34,351
from cognitive science, psychology, anthropology,

58
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,534
criminology, and economics, and much more,

59
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:39,277
as well as the output of many multiplayer games

60
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:41,460
out there that have helped us learn and grow in this space.

61
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:46,881
and the work of many folks who spent years working to understand the nuances of player behavior.

62
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:51,867
And of course you, for the role that you have played in all of the above, and just for being here to listen.

63
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:55,832
So we really want to start this talk by saying thank you, and that we hope if nothing else,

64
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:59,697
we can inspire more people to continue to push the craft of player dynamics even further.

65
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:00,899
So let's jump in.

66
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:05,474
All right, now let's talk about what player dynamics is

67
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,715
and the gap that it fills in design.

68
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,577
And I believe the easiest way to illustrate this

69
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:14,160
is to compare player dynamics to a few design disciplines

70
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,442
that most everybody will be familiar with,

71
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:19,324
namely game design and UX.

72
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:24,748
At the risk of grossly oversimplifying both disciplines,

73
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:26,329
let's say for the sake of discussion

74
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:28,210
that game design is about play

75
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:30,732
and that UX is about interaction.

76
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,852
Game design is focused on developing the core play

77
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:38,015
experience of a single player or a small group of players.

78
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:41,978
UX is concerned with the end-to-end experience

79
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,039
of a single user.

80
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,982
Now, when we look at multiplayer games,

81
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,564
in particular multiplayer experiences online,

82
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,365
things get more complicated.

83
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:54,187
Many of the experiences that players are having

84
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,588
aren't the ones that we intended.

85
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,090
They're emergent.

86
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:59,816
through the interplay of people and systems,

87
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:02,317
through collective and contextual behavior.

88
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:06,259
Now, because these experiences are unintended and emergent,

89
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,500
the outcomes can be unpredictable.

90
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,201
And at best, they're delightful.

91
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:14,802
At worst, they're infuriating or even dangerous.

92
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:18,483
And player emotions can become directed at each other,

93
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:20,324
as well as at game developers.

94
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:23,845
So it's not simple enough to say that the concern is

95
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:25,326
undesirable local behavior.

96
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:29,367
Local behavior shapes global behavior and vice versa.

97
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:33,288
And we must understand how a mix of humans and context

98
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:36,369
shape the interactions within our online spaces

99
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:39,910
and how this interplay can lead to desirable outcomes

100
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,011
when things align right for everyone involved.

101
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,992
So there's a gap.

102
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,073
We need to understand how to ensure

103
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:50,234
the quality of this interplay.

104
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:52,754
And it's this gap for which we've

105
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:55,535
been crafting the craft of player dynamics.

106
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:00,043
And this is our definition today.

107
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:03,644
Player dynamics is the craft of creating products

108
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,264
that help people play well together,

109
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:07,565
typically in games and in social systems.

110
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,705
We also have begun to think of this as interplay design

111
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:13,966
and also designing for multiple minds.

112
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:20,148
So game design, play, UX, interaction,

113
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:24,689
player dynamics, or PD for short, interplay.

114
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:29,933
And while it requires many of the same skills as game design in UX,

115
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:36,778
Player Dynamics expands our toolkit to deliver higher quality interplay experiences.

116
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,020
Okay, so we've talked about the gap,

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,042
but now let's dig into what Player Dynamics is really all about.

118
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:45,764
Who hasn't experienced this at some point?

119
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:51,608
Jump into a game, you say a friendly hello, see who's there, and this is what happens.

120
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:53,491
You know, it can take many forms.

121
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:55,417
It can be a tiff over a rule choice.

122
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:56,782
It could be a misunderstanding.

123
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:58,266
Maybe somebody's hangry.

124
00:05:58,286 --> 00:05:59,630
Or it could just be a troll.

125
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:02,859
Games at the end of the day often make it hard to get along.

126
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,500
They lack a lot of the things that we have face-to-face,

127
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,902
such as body language, facial expressions, shared experiences,

128
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:11,203
and even repeat exposure with the same people.

129
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:14,665
They're often competitive by design, and the stakes can seem quite high.

130
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:18,947
And players can arrive in the very same game with very different expectations.

131
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,648
These things, when taken together, erode trust.

132
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:24,970
And a lack of trust means that as humans, we tend to assume the worst.

133
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,651
It quickly becomes us versus them, even within the same team.

134
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:34,184
So your first instinct might be to focus on any behavior that disrupts the game

135
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:35,585
and just remove those players.

136
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:41,707
This is a totally natural instinct, especially as we want to protect the good players.

137
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,188
But like many things, it's a trap.

138
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:47,249
Humans will always be messy, complicated creatures.

139
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:48,429
We won't all get along.

140
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:49,610
We won't all agree.

141
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,611
And sometimes we'll take it out on each other, even when we shouldn't.

142
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,639
Disruptive behavior isn't a problem we fix and just move on from.

143
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,520
We can't just remove all the bad actors and call it a day.

144
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,341
Just as we think about human variation with other aspects of design,

145
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:06,542
we have to bring the same care and attention to the interplay portion.

146
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:10,483
And, just as it makes no sense to ask when we'll have solved game design,

147
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,624
it also makes no sense to ask when we'll have solved player behavior.

148
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:17,965
If we have multiple players in a game, then we will always need to design for that.

149
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:22,667
So player dynamics is really about designing to bring out the best in players as often as possible,

150
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:27,350
while creating robust ways to handle the inevitable to keep players safe and happy.

151
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:32,012
So let's just help everyone be friends then, right?

152
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:37,435
It's not a bad instinct, but it's also not that either.

153
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:40,439
Friendship can naturally emerge through the game,

154
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,181
but we all know from day-to-day lives

155
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,823
that friendship is complicated.

156
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,126
We don't always need or want the same things.

157
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:48,068
Not all friends are great to play with,

158
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:49,990
and not all great people to play with

159
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,251
are actually friend candidates.

160
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,454
In fact, pushing social features can freak people out.

161
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:57,176
Socializing can be work.

162
00:07:57,736 --> 00:07:59,517
We may be adding undue pressure to players

163
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:00,958
who feel like they have to be social

164
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,820
when they see the game as a place to escape.

165
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,521
Well-intentioned social features can leave players

166
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,263
feeling pushed out of their comfort zones.

167
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:08,804
That can feel like punishment.

168
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:12,066
We can play well together without making it about friends.

169
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,908
And let's face it, we can't make everyone be friends.

170
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,249
That's just not how humans work.

171
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,170
So there has to be something else.

172
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,600
We think that great player dynamics is actually about cohesion.

173
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,281
It's about finding compatible players where everyone is on the same page,

174
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,562
or a team that at its best feels like a well-oiled machine.

175
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:31,683
It's just easy.

176
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,924
Everyone has a meaningful role that complements one another.

177
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,485
Everyone trusts that everyone else is doing their best.

178
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:40,806
You have a shared goal and a shared expectation of the stakes.

179
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:43,147
Maybe you're laughing at your foibles,

180
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:45,028
or you're pushing each other forward to victory.

181
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:48,610
But importantly, everyone feels personally and socially fulfilled.

182
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:53,907
Cohesion is helpful because it helps us point to the goal without overburdening the concept of friendship,

183
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:57,591
and it naturally points to removal or minimizing disruptive behavior.

184
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:02,015
The big question is then, how the heck do you do that with strangers?

185
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:10,102
Like Kim said, it is a really big question. How do we do that with strangers? How do we design

186
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,805
for cohesion? And these may sound like intimidating questions,

187
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:15,878
We totally get it.

188
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:18,179
We've been there, but we've also learned a lot.

189
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,501
And today, we'd like to introduce a design process

190
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:22,141
to help.

191
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,803
This process is organized into three phases.

192
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:27,764
And we're going to step through each one of them,

193
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:31,606
introducing tools, and strategies, and examples

194
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:32,126
as we go.

195
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,408
And where we need to begin is simply understanding.

196
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:37,569
We need to do some research.

197
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:39,810
And what we're trying to understand

198
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,651
is cohesion, what that means in context.

199
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:46,130
who players are as humans and populations,

200
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,552
and what are the conditions that are influencing them?

201
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:52,355
Overall, what are our interplay considerations?

202
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:55,938
And we're gonna need some tools to do this.

203
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,939
And the first tool that we'd like to introduce

204
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,862
is meant to help us get an understanding of cohesion

205
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,243
and how it emerges when the foundations are right.

206
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:06,241
It's called the Cohesion Ladder, and it's a tool

207
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:09,922
that we basically use as a set of lenses

208
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,603
through which to assess and understand our games

209
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:14,064
and efforts to improve behavior.

210
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:16,684
We really just move up the ladder

211
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:20,085
from individual to interplay to emergent.

212
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:23,666
Now, while this gives us a general understanding

213
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,306
of what cohesion means conceptually,

214
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:27,027
we are gonna need a context.

215
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,128
So now we want to take our ladder

216
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:35,209
and begin to use it as a set of lenses for the overall experience,

217
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,830
which we can visualize by using experience maps,

218
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,571
which is really one of my favorite tools.

219
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,432
When you create an experience map,

220
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:48,693
we recommend that you look at as much of the experience as you find useful.

221
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:51,534
Don't focus exclusively on the core game experience,

222
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:57,955
because much of the game experience happens outside of what begins with push and play.

223
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,252
Now, with experience maps, we can work as a group

224
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:03,593
to figure out where we want to invest proactively.

225
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,574
Or in the case of an existing game,

226
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,615
where we believe the opportunities

227
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:08,715
are to make some changes.

228
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,116
And you've gone through that exercise.

229
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:16,578
You're starting to understand cohesion in context.

230
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:19,398
And you're beginning to see where you may want to focus.

231
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:24,140
So now you're ready to get more of a grip on player

232
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,700
perspectives.

233
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,924
And we have more tools to share with you.

234
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:32,786
So the next tool are called cognitive bias lenses.

235
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:36,427
And they help us understand what's influencing players

236
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:38,708
as individuals, because we need to understand

237
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:41,109
who players are as individual human beings.

238
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:45,431
So what biases are we bringing and introducing to the game

239
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:48,292
on top of the ones that players themselves

240
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:49,693
may be bringing to the table?

241
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:51,253
And which ones should we consider?

242
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,105
We also can use these lenses to identify

243
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,188
which biases could negatively impact experiences,

244
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,110
as well as those that we believe can help

245
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,231
make the experiences better.

246
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,893
So it's not just about what's bad,

247
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:06,835
it's also what can help things level up.

248
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:10,037
So, all right, let's put this to use.

249
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,079
And once again, we're gonna use our experience map.

250
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,922
Let's say we wanna introduce a bit more positivity

251
00:12:16,162 --> 00:12:18,644
into our game lobbies to make it easier for strangers

252
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:19,905
to start off on the right foot.

253
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:23,802
You may want to use mechanisms like honor emblems

254
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:25,164
that we've seen in League of Legends

255
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:26,686
or thank yous in Overwatch,

256
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:28,809
because these tug on that lever.

257
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,633
They help people feel more positive about strangers

258
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:34,296
because they recognize that others have valued them

259
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:35,618
on a community level.

260
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:40,645
We also may want to check ourselves as game developers

261
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:43,766
to make sure that we're not introducing, well,

262
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:46,468
mechanisms that can cause friction for players, which

263
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,889
would therefore cause friction for other players.

264
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,671
So we may want to take a close look

265
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,893
at the curse of knowledge, which essentially says that, well,

266
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:56,834
we already know.

267
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:02,502
too much in a way. Basically, things are obvious to us because of knowledge that we already have.

268
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:08,764
And if we were, say, designing a HUD, this bias could lead to frustration because players may be

269
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:12,766
overwhelmed by the information that they're seeing, but we wouldn't recognize that because

270
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:21,148
our bias says that everything I need to know is right there. Now, assuming at this point we started

271
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:25,770
to get a good understanding of players as individual humans, now we need to be thinking about

272
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,970
players as populations.

273
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:30,405
And culture maps can help us do that.

274
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:34,045
Culture maps are a way to visualize the differences

275
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:36,686
between cultures, and therefore, help

276
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,826
us understand what could be influencing players

277
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,207
and their interactions regionally.

278
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:45,267
In this particular example, we see how different cultures

279
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:45,767
communicate.

280
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:48,488
This knowledge could be used to determine

281
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:51,048
which features we may build that can help players chat

282
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:53,949
with others who don't speak their native language.

283
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,850
Well, what about those patterns that transcend cultures?

284
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,772
Well, that's what this tool is for, behavior subgroups.

285
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:06,594
These are distillations of common behavior patterns

286
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:08,095
that we may want to consider.

287
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:12,877
So the purpose of a tool like this really is to understand

288
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,138
what trends in behavior are interesting and relevant

289
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:16,439
for the area that we're focusing on.

290
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:19,593
And we could potentially use behavior subgroups

291
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,835
to create more targeted penalties,

292
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:24,977
and say to nudge players towards improvement

293
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:25,917
where they can be nudged,

294
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:29,799
or maybe to isolate those a bit who we can't.

295
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,681
Now, with all our understanding,

296
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:34,402
we still need to put it to work.

297
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:37,944
We need to bring that understanding into our designs.

298
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,766
And one tool that we would like to talk about now

299
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:42,887
is one of my personal favorites.

300
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:44,708
It's the multi-perspective prototype.

301
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,662
And I found them to be incredibly useful.

302
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,865
And this is an example of a prototype

303
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:53,667
that I personally developed when we were developing

304
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,929
the team builder queue in League of Legends.

305
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,232
Now, what this tool helps us do is to essentially

306
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:02,676
see through the eyes on multiple people at the same time.

307
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,386
and to quickly iterate through possible solutions.

308
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,647
We can identify which actions we're concerned about,

309
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,227
which behaviors we're targeting,

310
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:13,668
and then we can look at how that may manifest

311
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,468
to other players and what we may need

312
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:18,669
to provide those other players in particular situations.

313
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,250
And with all that, with all that research and understanding,

314
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:28,071
we may still need to bring it back to our company

315
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:30,352
to make sure that others can benefit from the research.

316
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:32,792
And one tool that we would recommend

317
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:39,128
is the one sheet. And it seems pretty simple, and it should be pretty simple, because our goal

318
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:45,192
is to provide a whole bunch of useful information at a glance. And the example that you see here

319
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:52,097
is a summary for CCGs, just for the genre, and for what we might need to be concerned about

320
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:58,721
from a behavioral perspective. Like, what players expect of the genre? What are players going to

321
00:15:58,781 --> 00:15:59,561
expect of each other?

322
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,476
What are the behaviors that we can expect to see?

323
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:04,400
And which ones are considered appropriate?

324
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,487
So we can provide all this information and much more

325
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,395
in an easy to digest way once we get to the end of this part

326
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:11,916
of the process.

327
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,761
All right, thank you, Wes.

328
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:16,983
So now that we're equipped with a sense of the world

329
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:18,044
and our intended audience,

330
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:19,585
let's spend some time talking through

331
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,567
some more specific design considerations.

332
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:24,049
Really the central tenet of player dynamics

333
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,710
is designing with the intention

334
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,231
to foster healthy interactions.

335
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,233
A big part of this means figuring out

336
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:30,454
what good looks like in your game.

337
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:35,357
So for example, while in a competitive first-person shooter, killing each other may be the objective,

338
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:41,223
and celebrating those kills may be perfectly OK, getting in the way of others' ability to enjoy the game is intended,

339
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:45,928
or harassing other players because of how they identify, for example, is clearly not OK.

340
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:49,371
We also need to be thinking proactively and creatively.

341
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:55,017
So over the years, we've landed on three pillars that we find particularly helpful to this end that I'm going to take you through.

342
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:00,220
So the first is to identify moments of truth.

343
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,482
These are the points that are in a game that make or break the success of player interactions.

344
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:10,745
These can be high-impact moments that might cause an argument, such as a character selection screen or discussing strategy,

345
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:13,627
or they might just be more subtle, adding up over time.

346
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,211
Secondly, we want to strategically reduce player-to-player friction.

347
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,672
Even a small point of friction can undermine player interactions,

348
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:25,253
leading to frustration and blame among players.

349
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:28,194
Of course, there needs to be some friction in every game,

350
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:29,614
else it's not really much of a game.

351
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:35,175
But those points of friction should ideally only exist in service of the core experience.

352
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:38,856
So as with any aspect of game design, you want to understand the trade-offs

353
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,457
and be ruthless in addressing unnecessary friction to the best of your ability.

354
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:44,618
And thirdly,

355
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:49,650
Make it easy to be good. Make the good thing easier and more fun to do than the bad thing.

356
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,453
Provide tools and opportunities for players to be good to each other that feel like part of the game,

357
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:58,896
not tacked on later on. And look for ways to help players develop healthy habits.

358
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:04,179
Remove unnecessary avenues for harassment. Strangers have little to no trust among each

359
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:07,121
other, so think about the ways you might be pushing them past their limits.

360
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:10,223
For example, do you really need full chat or would pings work?

361
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:19,114
Next, we're going to take you through a survey of strategies that arise from these pillars from the perspective of key game elements and use some existing games to illustrate these points.

362
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:31,162
A key moment of truth centers around who you end up with playing with in the first place. And so, of course, we have the problem of making matches. Clearly, this is a space where we can address some player to player friction.

363
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:34,943
Historically, this has been some form of warm body.

364
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:36,285
Human, you're in.

365
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,527
Or skill, MMR, ELO, with the bias

366
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:42,590
being toward skill alignment as a predictor of match quality.

367
00:18:43,431 --> 00:18:44,752
And while to some extent this is true,

368
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,813
you don't want new players being crushed by veterans,

369
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:49,055
for example, it turns out it's definitely not

370
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,838
the only predictor, and it's definitely not the best.

371
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,060
Predicting a good match between people

372
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,902
is much, much more complicated, as you

373
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:59,664
can see from this huge and incomplete list on the screen.

374
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:02,982
Think of the time you agreed to play with your friend who was new to the game.

375
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,463
In that situation, you were opting into a mentorship relationship,

376
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:08,264
or, you know, at least to be more patient.

377
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:10,164
Think about a quick lunch match.

378
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:12,305
You were organizing maybe around some time constraints.

379
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:15,286
It was probably lower stakes, maybe a more casual setting.

380
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:19,268
What about that time you were short a healer and offered to play it to help the team?

381
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:22,509
Even though your mercy game required maybe some mercy.

382
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:26,610
And maybe you're just that person that can't resist commentating a clutch play.

383
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:29,471
You know, what this all boils down to is that a good match

384
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,693
really needs compatible players.

385
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:33,994
And what if we could factor in these needs

386
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:35,055
and differences somehow?

387
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,137
It's time to ask different questions

388
00:19:37,157 --> 00:19:38,958
about what good looks like and how we get there.

389
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,061
And it's worth calling out that matchmaking

390
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:44,202
is a really tough space.

391
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:46,664
I mean, these are difficult problems we're trying to solve.

392
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:49,146
Mathematically, you can run out of viable matches

393
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:51,048
really quickly, even with a huge player base.

394
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:52,629
And if you're not careful, you can end up

395
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,010
with incredibly long wait times.

396
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,851
You know, we're trading on time, match quality,

397
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:56,692
role choice.

398
00:19:57,339 --> 00:20:00,040
So we have to be very careful when we're adding complexity to matchmaking.

399
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,681
But there's so many opportunities here if we start by revisiting core assumptions.

400
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:09,483
We need to think about the bigger problem and look for ways to augment not just our matchmaking algorithms,

401
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:12,124
but how we tap into player needs more effectively.

402
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:17,706
Matchmaking algorithms aren't the only strategies for tapping into compatibility.

403
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:21,727
There are also opportunities in self-organization and self-selection.

404
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:23,828
Modes, for instance.

405
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:26,622
Modes can help reduce player-to-player friction

406
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:28,883
by offering players a choice that

407
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:30,343
helps them find the right game.

408
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,505
Players essentially opt into a shared understanding

409
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:34,665
before the game even starts.

410
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:36,766
Now let's look at a couple of examples.

411
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:40,808
In League of Legends, they have ARAM versus regular play.

412
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:45,190
In Minecraft, players can create or have, I should say,

413
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,951
a choice of worlds for worlds that they can create naturally,

414
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,551
creative or survival.

415
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:52,793
In CSGO, well, it has a whole bunch of choices.

416
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,650
One particularly interesting option is arms race,

417
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:58,231
which is a gun progression mode.

418
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:01,332
So there's no pressure to choose the right weapon

419
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:02,272
or composition.

420
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:04,773
So in that way, you can't make a wrong choice,

421
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:07,413
but you still need to be pretty accurate.

422
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,154
Like it's not going to handle that for you.

423
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:14,195
We can also help players by helping them

424
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,215
find the right people to play with.

425
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,036
We can do this by supporting self-organization

426
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:20,316
in and out of the game.

427
00:21:21,137 --> 00:21:23,259
Looking for group tools, for instance, like in Discord,

428
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,021
allow players with similar goals or mindsets

429
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,041
to easily find each other.

430
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,684
And this helps players bias positively towards each other

431
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:33,266
as they anticipate shared goals and likes.

432
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:35,888
In short, makes it easier to get along.

433
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:38,349
Public teams in Fallout 76.

434
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:42,347
These offer bonuses that support team goals.

435
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,608
They're essentially player-driven modes

436
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:46,829
that reflect compatibility and alignment.

437
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,510
Like, you have a benefit from playing

438
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,832
with this team that aligns to your own personal goals.

439
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:53,852
It's pretty cool.

440
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:59,715
We can also help players find the right job or role

441
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:00,896
in the current game team.

442
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:04,117
The Team Builder queue, which we touched on a little bit earlier,

443
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:05,668
in League of Legends.

444
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,528
Though it's a sunsetted feature,

445
00:22:07,548 --> 00:22:11,529
I really bring it up because it was one that I worked on.

446
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:14,490
And the feature was intended to address

447
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,131
player-to-player friction that was caused

448
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,832
by the system not recognizing the intent of the players.

449
00:22:20,532 --> 00:22:21,832
They wanted to play a certain way.

450
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:24,673
The system wasn't designed to support that way.

451
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:26,894
And we were seeing friction between players

452
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:28,234
before games would even start.

453
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:31,655
And so the intention was reduce that friction.

454
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:34,223
Now, Overwatch takes a similar approach,

455
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,646
while also serving as a neutral third party that

456
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:40,448
provides gentle suggestions about role choice,

457
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:43,070
makes it easier to get that alignment,

458
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,353
helps proactively reduce some of the potential friction.

459
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:50,737
And when we equip players with tools that meaningfully expose

460
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:52,979
their intentions and let them better

461
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:55,541
organize to fit their expectations,

462
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:56,842
we reduce friction.

463
00:22:57,507 --> 00:23:01,048
and make it easier to be good, because players feel more confident

464
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:02,809
in the type of experience they're going to have.

465
00:23:07,831 --> 00:23:08,871
Now let's talk about narrative.

466
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:13,213
Your game's narrative can do a lot to frame how players think

467
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:16,054
and talk about the game, as well as their attitudes in-game.

468
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:19,555
And because of this, you're going to want to think pretty carefully

469
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:23,677
about the values and stereotypes you might be reinforcing within your game.

470
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:25,137
For instance,

471
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,731
When we are exposed to voice lines again and again,

472
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:33,193
we naturally absorb them and their message unconsciously.

473
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:37,776
And this can have a dramatic impact on inclusivity over time.

474
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:40,178
For example, if you have characters

475
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:42,179
that are making exclusionary comments.

476
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,361
But that doesn't mean things are all bad.

477
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:49,143
It doesn't mean that we can't manage the risks

478
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:51,224
and avoid some of the potential trouble spots.

479
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:54,406
Narrative, in fact, can do a lot to help with teamwork.

480
00:23:55,412 --> 00:23:59,234
In Borderlands 3, for instance, we hear Vault Hunters again

481
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:02,677
and again in every one of the titles.

482
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:07,921
It's a label that reinforces shared identity and shared

483
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:08,281
goals.

484
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,843
In Left 4 Dead 2, characters you heal

485
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,085
say thank you, which is a great way

486
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:17,668
to reinforce that sense of us, that sense of teamwork,

487
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:18,848
that we're in it together.

488
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:21,350
And it really can help reinforce group alignment

489
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:25,033
by making those kinds of narrative choices.

490
00:24:28,244 --> 00:24:30,986
Now let's talk about how we can celebrate the values

491
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:32,047
that we want to see in the game.

492
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,890
And we're going to spend a moment talking about Overwatch.

493
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:38,073
Overwatch keeps individual achievements,

494
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:41,355
which are important, but it keeps them separate, right?

495
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:44,378
It keeps them personal and not broadcasted, right?

496
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:48,602
As part of the communication of what means team.

497
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:51,684
Essentially, we have me and we have team.

498
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,946
And it doesn't mean that those goals can't be the same,

499
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:55,027
but they're separated.

500
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,965
Now, you don't want to necessarily downplay personal accomplishment.

501
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,467
You just don't want to play it up at the expense of others.

502
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:08,610
And we want to make sure that we're conscious of the celebrations that are going

503
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,852
to help you towards your goals to help you improve over time.

504
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:16,896
And we want to do this in part because when you are celebrating

505
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:20,658
and you're feeling pretty good about yourself, you're less likely to get angry at others

506
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,859
and you have more personal resilience.

507
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,400
Now, the team view.

508
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:32,468
celebrates the shared goals and the teamwork without overemphasis on how a player may have

509
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:37,698
done poorly. So for instance, if two people are tied for gold, the third person gets silver,

510
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:39,461
right, bias towards celebration.

511
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:44,549
And Overwatch also shows us that you don't need to make a kill ladder.

512
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:49,270
Like this just reinforces them as the thing that matters, right?

513
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,311
That the kills are the thing that's more important than us working together

514
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,051
towards eliminations, right?

515
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:58,372
Which can be a combination of kills and assist.

516
00:25:58,672 --> 00:26:01,892
Once again, separating the me from the we.

517
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:05,733
One last thing on Overwatch.

518
00:26:06,673 --> 00:26:09,974
The logo literally has a high five in it.

519
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:15,173
I mean, that's a great example of reinforcing the sense of us

520
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:16,574
through narrative.

521
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:20,855
So I think of multiplayer games as entering into a play

522
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:21,355
agreement.

523
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:23,515
I'm going to do this, you're going to do that.

524
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:25,836
And as designers, we often have high hopes

525
00:26:25,896 --> 00:26:28,317
for how the unenforced aspects of that agreement

526
00:26:28,377 --> 00:26:29,597
are worked out among players.

527
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:32,358
We hope that folks are going to cooperate and communicate where

528
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:32,818
it matters.

529
00:26:33,362 --> 00:26:36,683
where no one's going to be unnecessarily antagonistic or cheat, etc, etc.

530
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:40,284
But the theme of this whole talk is how difficult all of this can be.

531
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:43,586
So much of what we're talking about today centers around the question,

532
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,787
what if we could lessen that burden on players?

533
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:50,528
One major way we can do that is through mechanics, level design, and just general gameplay.

534
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:55,130
Just as we use design choices in this space to affect individual play experiences,

535
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,232
we can bring the same intentionality to the player dynamics.

536
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:02,688
By looking at gameplay elements that allow players to interact and express themselves,

537
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:07,931
and where these take place, we can proactively improve how players coexist and influence each other.

538
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:11,193
This helps to contribute to a more healthy game atmosphere overall.

539
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:14,515
Let's talk through some strategies for how you might think about this in your game.

540
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:19,568
Of course, many games are built around conflict as the core goal.

541
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:22,150
You're trying to defeat the other person or team or shared enemy.

542
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,591
However, even in games where there's an expected level of conflict,

543
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:28,833
when we really look closely, what we find is that there are often

544
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:31,674
other sources of conflict creating stress among the players

545
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:34,495
that are not contributing to the core promise of the game.

546
00:27:34,515 --> 00:27:37,856
And this is particularly problematic when it happens among the same team.

547
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,438
When we identify those causes, we then need some discipline

548
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,619
in asking the question, is this really necessary?

549
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:48,381
Often these problems can be hidden among design choices we take for granted or that we just

550
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:52,564
assume to be necessary. Or even biases we don't even realize that we're introducing.

551
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:57,487
Think for a moment about how adding a competitive ladder changes player motivations, for example.

552
00:27:58,248 --> 00:28:02,971
Expressions like table stakes features make us lazy because we stop asking the hard questions.

553
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:08,174
You want to be explicit in calling out trade-offs. You want to know what good looks like in your game

554
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:12,497
and don't discount the role that good player interactions will play in achieving that.

555
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:16,755
A quick and easy example of this is loot sharing,

556
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,696
which is now a common practice in many games.

557
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:22,099
While limited resources can seem like a really great tool

558
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,880
for getting players to discuss and share,

559
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,322
we know that's not actually how it tends to play out,

560
00:28:26,442 --> 00:28:27,242
even among friends.

561
00:28:28,143 --> 00:28:29,784
Is discussing or debating loot

562
00:28:29,904 --> 00:28:31,806
really a key part of a game's value?

563
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:34,708
Or if it is, is it really getting the results that you want?

564
00:28:35,608 --> 00:28:37,990
As we all know, rarely is design choice

565
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,731
universally good or bad, right?

566
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:41,493
How these choices all come together

567
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,194
to create the experience that matters.

568
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:48,285
If those choices cause conflict, that conflict might interfere with your intended design goals.

569
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:50,186
You want to make it easy to be good.

570
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:57,528
Another example, body blocking and friendly fire might play a really important role in the game,

571
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:01,789
but they also induce some friction and can be misinterpreted in the moment as intentional,

572
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:02,890
leading to arguments.

573
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,791
It's easy for any of us to forget how difficult spatial awareness can be,

574
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:07,891
especially for new players.

575
00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:11,308
If these choices are important for your game, and they might be,

576
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:16,438
think about how you might educate newer players or exercise forgiveness in some situations.

577
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,086
Role choice, as Wes mentioned earlier, is another hotspot.

578
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,828
Players have expectations for how they want to play the game.

579
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:27,572
If a player is forced to play a role they're not experienced with or they don't enjoy,

580
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:31,575
they're likely to be distracted or self-conscious, and they might just play poorly.

581
00:29:31,976 --> 00:29:33,797
They may worry that they're going to let their team down.

582
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:36,079
They might even feel like their time is being wasted.

583
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,043
And that can be compounded if there's explicit leveling associated with that role.

584
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:42,924
Ask yourself, can you pre-filter on roles?

585
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:45,245
That will help players start in a better mindset.

586
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:47,686
And if not, can you help reduce the pain

587
00:29:47,706 --> 00:29:48,567
of playing off role?

588
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:51,648
All three of these demonstrate moments of truth,

589
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:53,989
ways to reduce player to player friction,

590
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:56,090
and chances to make it easy to be good,

591
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,351
in some cases just by removing the bad option.

592
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:03,133
In addition to being intentional with conflict points,

593
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:05,294
be intentional with positive interactions.

594
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,361
Look for ways to create mechanics that are centered around players being helpful or just having fun together.

595
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:12,082
Make it a positive atmosphere.

596
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:16,263
One strategy to this is to make everyone feel like a valuable contributor.

597
00:30:16,703 --> 00:30:21,304
This means tackling the challenge of different skills, asymmetrical mechanics, multiple objectives,

598
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:24,324
different ways to achieve the same goals can all help when they're done mindfully.

599
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:28,745
And secondly, think about reducing down to only positive actions.

600
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:30,605
If you look at the classic journey,

601
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:32,746
charging your companion's scarves

602
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:34,546
or uncovering the body language were really

603
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:35,787
the only ways to communicate.

604
00:30:37,307 --> 00:30:40,268
That removes many of the avenues for poor behavior

605
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:42,188
while creating a way to bond through discovery.

606
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:45,209
So bias toward the positive around shared experience.

607
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:46,830
Make it easy or fun to be good.

608
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:52,499
People are at their best when they feel like a meaningful contributor.

609
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:54,661
So our goal is really to help make that happen.

610
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:58,543
Asymmetry can help everyone feel like they have an important role to play.

611
00:30:58,563 --> 00:31:01,024
And it can keep people focused on their own tasks and strengths.

612
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:05,587
In the case of keep talking and nobody explodes, one person is operating the,

613
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:08,689
you know, diffusing a bomb and operating with limited information.

614
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:12,211
And another person with the instructions is providing that guidance

615
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:15,553
to that person diffusing, you know, they both have very valuable roles

616
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:17,634
and they don't share the same set of information.

617
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:24,197
You want to be careful, of course, because this can highlight an ineffective player in a way that can make them a target for harassment, or you know, just feel crummy.

618
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:30,160
So you want to find ways to eliminate or reduce broadcasting poor performance and help players play to their strengths as much as possible.

619
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:34,317
But sometimes the role just isn't appealing to a player,

620
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:37,399
or might feel counter to the main promise of the game.

621
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,220
I think a great example of this is the support role.

622
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,181
A lot of players want to shoot people.

623
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,562
That's the core promise in a first-person shooter.

624
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,523
And this is exaggerated by KDA

625
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:47,944
as the primary measure of achievement.

626
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:49,965
But there are ways to balance this out,

627
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:51,766
where you can truly celebrate

628
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,807
more diverse outcomes and contributions,

629
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,028
get creative outside of KDA,

630
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:58,190
and ensure that those alternative measures

631
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,390
actually carry weight in the game.

632
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:04,309
Add more texture to roles so they feel meaningful and people feel capable of doing well on their

633
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:09,033
own terms. Reduce the sense of getting stuck with a role. I think Overwatch's Moira is a

634
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:13,417
really interesting example. She's a healer who retains the ability to be effective on the front

635
00:32:13,457 --> 00:32:17,941
line. This gives some additional appeal for those who might dread support roles like myself.

636
00:32:19,082 --> 00:32:23,025
But again, caution, there's a balance here. Don't dilute the roles so much that they

637
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:25,708
lose meaning. A class-based shooter still needs its classes.

638
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,800
We can also look at the spaces themselves to help.

639
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,241
Death Stranding's system for pinging thank you

640
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:33,961
feels amazing.

641
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:36,202
If you put the time in to lay a huge road

642
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:38,222
and then log in and receive a thousand likes,

643
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:40,103
it feels like an incredible reward.

644
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:43,044
The system is super easy to participate.

645
00:32:43,084 --> 00:32:44,104
There's no negative option.

646
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:46,665
Plus it provides an outlet or mechanic

647
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:48,245
for when you do feel that gratitude.

648
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:50,166
So bringing these all together,

649
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:52,766
it reinforces the good and encourages

650
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,007
a more positive atmosphere,

651
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:56,087
which in turn leads to a more positive mindset.

652
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:01,708
You can also expose ways to play together even in single-player experiences.

653
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:05,629
Games can create powerful moments of support and shared experience

654
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:07,809
through summoning other players to your game, for example,

655
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,090
or joining in other games, such as Dark Souls.

656
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,370
Dark Souls is another interesting example

657
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,651
because it also has the option to invade another's game.

658
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:18,652
This tension between a moment of help or a moment of terror during summoning

659
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:21,172
helps set the intensity that is the hallmark of the series.

660
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,413
But imagine for a moment adding that to Animal Crossing.

661
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,333
You know, the growing dread as the float plane approaches.

662
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:31,656
Meanwhile, you probably don't want someone to show up

663
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:33,258
with just some exotic fruit and dark souls.

664
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,041
You know, in short, know what your game is and isn't,

665
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:37,803
and equally what healthy interactions

666
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:38,744
look like in your game.

667
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:41,327
If it matters, for example, that players stick together,

668
00:33:41,427 --> 00:33:43,269
then think about how your level design choices

669
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:45,171
add or reduce tension toward that goal.

670
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:49,517
And finally, sometimes we just need to have fun,

671
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,998
even if it has very little to do with the core loop.

672
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:55,660
Don't be afraid to create systems specifically for bonding.

673
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:57,521
Help players just have fun together.

674
00:33:58,022 --> 00:34:00,343
Start a band together, draw pictures, throw balls.

675
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:02,024
When we share to laugh together,

676
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:03,765
we're far less likely to start a fight.

677
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:06,547
Dances, interactive emojis, et cetera,

678
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:08,628
all of these things create a powerful language

679
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:12,230
among players for self-identity, connection, and reciprocity.

680
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,051
Research tells us that these are critical ingredients

681
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:16,872
for allowing trust to form between strangers.

682
00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:22,102
Without it, we're essentially asking players to get along when we've placed them at an extreme disadvantage.

683
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:29,008
We need to treat healthy interactions as important as any other design element to help games reach their full potential.

684
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:36,836
I recommend that every game with multiple players find at least one intentional feature or feature set that is just geared toward the positive interactions.

685
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:40,878
Let me give you just a really quick story.

686
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,882
So back when the original Destiny 1 launched,

687
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:45,544
I played the heck out of Crucible.

688
00:34:45,624 --> 00:34:48,428
I love Crucible, particularly 6v6 control.

689
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:52,033
And there's this one time that I was playing and that my entire team discos,

690
00:34:52,053 --> 00:34:54,235
and of course, I'm left by myself, super frustrated.

691
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:55,535
There's no way I'm going to win.

692
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:58,657
So I do the only thing that you would do in this situation, of course,

693
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:00,118
which is I head over to one of the points

694
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:03,100
and I just sit down and wait for my inevitable demise.

695
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,262
And almost on cue, the entire enemy team arrives.

696
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,163
But instead of taking that moment to destroy me and end the game,

697
00:35:09,183 --> 00:35:12,686
they actually just sat down with me and we all just sat there.

698
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,107
To this day, it's still one of my all-time favorite game stories.

699
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,048
I couldn't see or hear them, but I knew they were laughing.

700
00:35:19,108 --> 00:35:20,549
I was certainly laughing. I mean, it was great.

701
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:24,130
And all of this was made possible because Bungie, somewhere along the way,

702
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,471
made a decision to let you sit down in the game.

703
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,753
Things like this can become the language of connection.

704
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:31,273
They create meaningful moments.

705
00:35:31,473 --> 00:35:34,114
They organically foster trust and reduce sniping.

706
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:36,175
They just make it easy to be good.

707
00:35:38,196 --> 00:35:40,717
No matter how well we proactively design our games,

708
00:35:41,157 --> 00:35:42,478
there will always be transgressions.

709
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:46,109
And in those moments, we should be ready to intervene.

710
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,791
This doesn't mean, however, that we can only

711
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:50,293
react to transgressions.

712
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:52,675
We can also intervene proactively

713
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:56,058
by setting expectations, requiring commitment,

714
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:57,539
and empowering players.

715
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:00,802
And that's what the third and final phase of our design

716
00:36:00,822 --> 00:36:01,823
process is about.

717
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,862
Now, there are many ways to proactively intervene,

718
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,164
but unfortunately, we don't have that much time.

719
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:12,805
We can't go into them all.

720
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,686
So the ones that I listed are what

721
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:15,927
we're going to take a quick look at.

722
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:19,749
And these are methods that we recommend.

723
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:24,332
The first is set rules and establish values.

724
00:36:25,593 --> 00:36:28,735
In absence of rules, communities will simply make up their own.

725
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:31,196
Players will start to set their own expectations.

726
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:34,518
So it is important to make it clear in advance what the rules

727
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:36,419
are and which behaviors are considered

728
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:38,680
appropriate and meaningful by the game

729
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,121
and also by the community.

730
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:43,682
This is what Fortnite has done with their code of conduct

731
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:46,944
and Valorant has done with its community code.

732
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:49,005
If you think about it.

733
00:36:49,597 --> 00:36:53,659
You really have to admit that it's pretty unfair to punish players for

734
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:57,060
transgressions that they had no way of knowing that they were committing.

735
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,243
So set expectations by setting rules and establishing values in advance.

736
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:08,446
Now requiring player commitment is another powerful way to proactively intervene.

737
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:10,727
Now let's look at a particular example.

738
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:12,968
Guided games in Destiny 2.

739
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:17,710
Every time a player joins a guided game, they're required to commit to the guardian oath.

740
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:25,301
This commitment serves as a social contract, as a team contract, and it sets expectations

741
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:28,622
for members of the team. This helps reinforce values.

742
00:37:31,822 --> 00:37:38,044
And lastly, empower players. So we can also create tools and empower players to proactively

743
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:43,465
intervene on their own behalf. Discord, for example, lets players add to a banned words

744
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:44,145
filter list.

745
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,132
which ensures that these players only see words

746
00:37:47,212 --> 00:37:49,013
that they personally consider okay.

747
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:53,016
Facebook's community tools empower streamers

748
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:54,717
to define what's appropriate for the community,

749
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:56,939
which in turn empowers the developers

750
00:37:56,979 --> 00:38:00,381
to provide better support for the community wants,

751
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:05,545
which means we help players help us help them.

752
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:09,328
Now, I'm willing to bet that when you first thought

753
00:38:09,348 --> 00:38:10,889
about what we discuss in this talk,

754
00:38:11,629 --> 00:38:13,591
you were thinking about this next section.

755
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:16,851
you were thinking about reactive interventions.

756
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,354
Hopefully, you're surprised that that

757
00:38:20,394 --> 00:38:21,255
is in the bulk of the talk.

758
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:25,299
Now, reactive interventions are like fouls and red cards

759
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:25,819
in sports.

760
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,802
They're guardrails of interplay to reinforce what's

761
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:30,443
considered appropriate behavior.

762
00:38:31,624 --> 00:38:33,306
Though reactive interventions are

763
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:35,207
insufficient for long-term behavior change

764
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:38,590
and only deal with damage done, they're still necessary.

765
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:40,612
We're probably going to always need them.

766
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:43,766
And when we're talking about reactive interventions,

767
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:47,208
we're talking about things that might be familiar, right?

768
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:50,851
Penalties and reports of players.

769
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:52,773
And we have a couple of examples.

770
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:57,736
We see penalty system or at least a penalty in Xbox Live,

771
00:38:58,317 --> 00:39:01,139
and we see reporting categories from Heroes of the Storm.

772
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,241
And even in these moments,

773
00:39:04,071 --> 00:39:06,112
Even though we are dealing with a transgression,

774
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:09,293
there are still opportunities to help reinforce values

775
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,334
and nudge players towards improvement.

776
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:14,055
We can do this through encouraging language

777
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:15,956
and meaningful information,

778
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:18,016
helping to provide the right feedback.

779
00:39:18,537 --> 00:39:21,278
And if you can help players see how they're improving,

780
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,138
well, this is a major plus.

781
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:26,320
Okay, let's sum up,

782
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,900
because we covered a lot of stuff today.

783
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,582
So our games are always gonna have one thing in common,

784
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:32,422
humans.

785
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:44,088
We need to ensure that our design practices are taking into account what happens when we introduce multiple minds, multiple perspectives, goals, desires, moods, interpretations, expectations, personalities, etc. etc.

786
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:48,692
All the rest of the complex tapestry that makes other humans so wonderful to play with.

787
00:39:49,392 --> 00:39:52,655
If all we focus on is punishment, we're never going to see long term change.

788
00:39:53,155 --> 00:39:57,778
Players need help to get along in a game, and it's up to us as game designers to figure out how best to do that.

789
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,404
At a high level, this is our recommended design framework

790
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:02,905
and the key goals within each.

791
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:04,927
One, research and understand.

792
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:06,788
Two, design proactively.

793
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,249
Three, be ready to intervene.

794
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,351
We've also introduced a number of tools

795
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:14,493
that we actively use in our own day-to-day design work.

796
00:40:14,893 --> 00:40:16,514
And of course, we haven't gone into a fraction

797
00:40:16,534 --> 00:40:17,935
of the detail these each deserve,

798
00:40:18,195 --> 00:40:19,956
but we'd be happy to take anyone through them.

799
00:40:20,296 --> 00:40:21,297
And we'd love to hear from you.

800
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:22,138
What did we miss?

801
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:23,238
What would you like to share?

802
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,500
What tools do you find helpful in Player Dynamics?

803
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,061
Just how could we help?

804
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:34,875
And also a super quick plug, consider joining the Fair Play Alliance, which is a great place to share and learn from others who work in this space every day.

805
00:40:36,756 --> 00:40:42,978
Finally, we introduced a number of design strategies that we've come to over the years with some examples, which I don't have time to go back through right now.

806
00:40:44,658 --> 00:40:52,180
The big question is, where do we go from here? We chose to focus today's talk on the design process and to lift up what we think player dynamics is today.

807
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:58,399
This framework and these strategies are far from perfect. We're all in a key phase of field building with a lot of work ahead.

808
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:04,260
When we really think back to, say, the 70s and 80s, we didn't have the same mature understanding of game design,

809
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,801
of the many elements of game design that we do today, and player dynamics is in a similarly nascent space.

810
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:15,783
We need to continue in investing in maturing our design language, framework, and identifying best practices.

811
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:19,890
We need to understand how can we effectively measure and assess cohesion

812
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,851
or the impact of our interventions more broadly today as an industry.

813
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:27,633
Which brings us to you. Our ask is threefold.

814
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:30,834
Prioritize investment and excellent player dynamics.

815
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:35,135
Experiment as much as you can and share everything you can.

816
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:39,697
We want to see you up on stage next year, whatever kind of stage it ends up being.

817
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:43,598
You know, at the end of the day, we all win when our communities are healthy and happy.

818
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:46,987
These are all of the games that we've referenced

819
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:47,607
during the talk.

820
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:49,428
We certainly don't speak for these games,

821
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:51,548
but we wanted to call out what we found valuable

822
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:53,049
from the perspective of player dynamics

823
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:53,949
as we were enjoying them.

824
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,370
And of course, there's so many more

825
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,330
that we didn't talk about.

826
00:41:56,951 --> 00:41:58,051
Hopefully you'll seek out these folks

827
00:41:58,071 --> 00:41:59,632
to learn more about their design process

828
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:00,692
and thinking in this space.

829
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,313
And finally, we'd be remiss if we failed to call out

830
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,314
the tremendous work that has come before this talk

831
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:06,334
and is going on right now.

832
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:09,455
The Fair Play Alliance today has over 160 companies

833
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:11,936
within it and over 200 individual members

834
00:42:11,976 --> 00:42:13,757
who are working in this space every day.

835
00:42:16,027 --> 00:42:19,488
To close, no game is perfect, and some may have further to go than others.

836
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:22,170
But at the end of the day, this is a challenging space.

837
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,112
If we're going to evolve as an industry, it's going to take an intentional effort.

838
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:29,853
And that means lifting up our learnings and opening the door for others to continue

839
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:33,115
to invest and mature both our tool sets and our mindsets.

840
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:37,357
Let's continue to grow together on behalf of players and help our games reach their

841
00:42:37,377 --> 00:42:38,057
full potential.

842
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:42,299
We hope you'll join us on this journey because players are worth it.

843
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,060
Thank you.

844
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:46,923
Thank you from me as well.
