1
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:07,777
It's really an honor to be able to talk about Flash Games

2
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:10,718
today, to be here at GDC.

3
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:15,681
I was just thinking about coming in today how 15 years

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:18,262
ago I was trying to pay for college.

5
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:20,543
I was struggling, trying to make rent.

6
00:00:21,043 --> 00:00:23,064
And we had a community.

7
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,705
We had developers.

8
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:26,506
We had sponsors.

9
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:30,708
We had a group of individuals who not only let me eat, but

10
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:32,829
also eventually pay for college.

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,301
pay down my debt and just pretty much survive.

12
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:41,482
And this is the Flash Games Postmortem.

13
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:45,443
This is a talk about the indie spirit,

14
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:51,806
about an industry that rose from the most chaotic place

15
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:57,007
to make games and then the fall of sponsorships

16
00:00:57,327 --> 00:01:01,289
and the fall of technology and what happened next.

17
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:04,229
So my name is John Kinney.

18
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:05,331
I work at Kongregate.

19
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:08,417
And I'm just gonna get right into it.

20
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:12,109
So we've always looked at Flash games

21
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,750
as these kind of lunchtime time wasters,

22
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,011
these distractions, these things that we

23
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,072
kind of take for granted, but in reality,

24
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:24,473
Flash games and developers, we really formed

25
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,913
the foundation of the modern indie game scene.

26
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:29,794
We built really incredible things,

27
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,655
and we saw that many games and developers

28
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:40,025
were born out of flash. We had games like super meat boy, evil

29
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:43,130
land coming out of game jams. All these games had

30
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:52,641
their foundations in Flash and building content quickly and easily to the web. As Flash developers

31
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:57,766
we blazed new trails, we defined what it meant to be Indie and we pursued really innovative

32
00:01:57,806 --> 00:02:03,251
content and this kind of content that directly enabled the greater industry to move forward

33
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:04,973
in pretty colossal ways.

34
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,736
When we're talking about the Flash games post-mortem,

35
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:10,759
this is the story of the prototype indie.

36
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,921
This is the story of this ubiquity,

37
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:16,265
this insane technology, this impact on our industry

38
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:19,668
that was really unlike anything else out there.

39
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:22,378
My name's John Cooney.

40
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:25,100
I've been a Flash game developer for 15 years.

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,321
I've developed over 100 Flash games

42
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,922
and I've produced 20 to 30 more.

43
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:31,463
I've worked on games like Achievement Unlocked.

44
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:33,684
This is the only level, Hedgehog Launch.

45
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:36,506
I was the creator of my own studio in college,

46
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:39,687
which helped me eat and pay for bills.

47
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,529
During that time I also worked on Flash Rites,

48
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:44,930
which was a resource for helping developers find

49
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,851
ways to figure out how to protect their work

50
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,052
and to learn about fair use.

51
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:50,913
talk about copyright.

52
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:52,493
I moved over to Armor Games

53
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:53,774
and was head of game development there.

54
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:56,775
Worked on about 70 titles while I was there

55
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,176
and then I'm now a congregate

56
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,956
working on our premium games initiative

57
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:01,077
and our launchpad program,

58
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,977
which is our incubator for experimental games.

59
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:09,415
really quick housekeeping. We're covering about 19 to 20 years in an hour, so I'm going to go

60
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:13,838
really, really fast. There's about 150 slides, so I'm going to go nonstop. I'm going to put the

61
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:17,441
slides online because I think it's really important for you guys to go back and take a look

62
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:21,384
at the games and just kind of everything that's been written. We're also going to post it to

63
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:24,927
the Congregated Developers Blog, so you can get it there after this presentation.

64
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:30,412
I also really wanted to clarify that this talk isn't to talk about why Flash is dead

65
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:31,613
and to make arguments.

66
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:33,154
We could spend hours doing that.

67
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:38,179
This is really to have a conversation and to talk about the amazing things that came

68
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,763
out of the Flash games community and to really reflect on the last 19 to 20 years.

69
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:45,105
So okay, let's go.

70
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:48,769
In 1998, we saw the birth of Flash and it was because

71
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,992
The internet was really slow and it was really young.

72
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,317
And back in 1998, we were using America Online and Dial Up.

73
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:59,580
And this was really the normal thing to do,

74
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:01,543
was to have a Dial Up modem and hope

75
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:04,045
your mom didn't pick up the phone so you lost your connection.

76
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:09,250
We were downloading illegal MP3s, but they took 10 minutes

77
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,871
to do because they were so big.

78
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:13,693
And we didn't really have broadband at the time.

79
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,335
Broadband was not really what we were having in our homes.

80
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,037
Just for cultural context, this is the year that Titanic won

81
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:23,039
the best picture as well, just to kind of show you how far

82
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,740
back this was.

83
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,281
And this is when Flash came onto the scene.

84
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:30,824
It was 1998, and Flash came into browsers and said, we're

85
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,906
going to have this lightweight and powerful plug-in.

86
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:36,048
so that people can create animations and interactive work.

87
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:37,990
And we're gonna make it really lightweight

88
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,951
because the internet is so slow.

89
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:43,454
And it could do that because it leveraged vector technology.

90
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:47,036
It really found ways to really push a lot of data

91
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:51,240
and information through, instead of sending bitmaps

92
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,560
or large image files, instead it's...

93
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:56,725
wrote the instructions for how the compiler should actually

94
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,529
recompile the information back into the plug-in.

95
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,233
So instead of sending 60 frames of animation, which was

96
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:05,437
really heavy at the time, it would just send the first frame

97
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:08,320
and the last frame and use math to interpolate where that

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,641
should be.

99
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:14,428
To give more information on that, we can take a look at these two photos and say, oh, these

100
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:19,491
are kind of the same photos, but in reality, the flash vector that was being sent was just

101
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:24,233
a quarter of a kilobyte. It was tiny for the time, and this technology was really cool.

102
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:29,356
Flash came in two parts. There was flash, the program which you used to make your content,

103
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:35,160
and there was flash player, the free plugin that you used to display that content. Flash

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,040
content required

105
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,480
the download of the browser plugin.

106
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,321
But luckily, this was the late 90s.

107
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,662
And in the late 90s, you could get anyone to download anything.

108
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:46,223
We had browser plugins.

109
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:47,544
We had Bonsai Buddy.

110
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:50,826
It was a great time for the internet.

111
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,968
And what that resulted in, along with that compelling content,

112
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,550
that animation that was really clean, crisp, 30 frames

113
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,430
per second, is we got.

114
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:08,380
ubiquity. We got a plug-in that could be played pretty much anywhere. By 2009, 99% of computers

115
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,526
connected to the internet had flash installed. But flash was still young. It was an animation

116
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:16,349
tool. We didn't really view it as a games tool.

117
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,252
But game developers are smart, and we

118
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,434
saw that they were creating quizzes, point and click

119
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:24,396
adventures, these sort of really bare bones,

120
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,938
almost early hypercard sort of games,

121
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,559
and putting them up on the web.

122
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,480
And in 2000, we saw ActionScript arrive,

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,542
and this is when we really got our hands dirty

124
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:33,242
with programming.

125
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:35,123
It was very easy to use.

126
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:37,165
If you're already a programmer, it was very accessible.

127
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:39,386
If you've never wrote code in your life like I did,

128
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:44,370
I could figure out how to make really bad games with really

129
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,531
very little amount of code.

130
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:45,831
And.

131
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:49,294
What we started to realize is that we were stumbling upon

132
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:51,156
the holy grail of game development.

133
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:53,257
This was a tool that was easy to script.

134
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:54,298
It was easy to draw.

135
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,639
You could deploy immediately.

136
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,961
There was a huge audience that was really excited about this

137
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,143
content, and it was accessible.

138
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:02,405
Everyone could pull up a browser, whether they were at

139
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:05,108
the local library, their school, their home computer,

140
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:06,669
there was a way to get to this content.

141
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,131
And this was really a cross-platform dream.

142
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,333
And this was in the 90s, in the 2000s, the early 2000s.

143
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:11,834
And this was cool.

144
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:16,356
We exported once and it worked everywhere.

145
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:19,837
And we didn't even test it half the time.

146
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:21,238
It just magically worked everywhere.

147
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:21,898
It was awesome.

148
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:26,219
And that brings us to the first really important

149
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,740
cultural part of Flash Games, which is Newgrounds.

150
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,521
And in 2000, Tom Fulp released

151
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,121
the automated Flash Games portal,

152
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:36,102
which allowed you to immediately upload

153
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:39,763
and view and engage with content immediately.

154
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:40,103
This was...

155
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:46,807
immediate. The moment you hit upload, you saw a spinning bar, and it instantly was on

156
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:51,550
the site running. This was before YouTube. In fact, this was five years before YouTube.

157
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,434
This was in a time where screens were pretty static. This was really early on the edge

158
00:07:57,474 --> 00:08:00,076
of what we call Web 2.0 or the interactive web.

159
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,812
And it really opened up the idea of instant communities,

160
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,754
being able to communicate with our users,

161
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:07,575
but also communicate with other developers,

162
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:10,178
to get feedback on our games, for people

163
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,619
to get engaged with our content.

164
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,442
There were scores, and reviews, and rankings, and forums.

165
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:17,745
And there was artists in this massive community, which

166
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:20,688
was really incredibly important to Flash starting.

167
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,611
Newgrounds began to see a swell in the Splash game content

168
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,694
as developers, programmers, animators, musicians

169
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:33,076
were coming together to work on really small projects

170
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:34,517
and to be creative together.

171
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:38,420
And one of the things we saw was the emergence

172
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,582
of the collab, which is short for collaboration,

173
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:45,204
which was really just setting up this one-time project

174
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:47,626
together and working on it and seeing how it goes.

175
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:51,968
And it was really cool because we could continue to work with other developers

176
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:56,470
that we had never worked with and to get to know a bunch of people inside our community

177
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,311
and work together.

178
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:02,493
And this may sound familiar because this is really what the prototype indie is.

179
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:06,075
This was really developers creating what they wanted, self-publishing,

180
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:08,436
gathering this massive audience, making fans,

181
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:12,678
finding their own unique voice in games and then delivering it on their own.

182
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,122
So as developers, we built a lot of games.

183
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:17,403
And we worked with a lot of people.

184
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:19,006
And we especially worked on small ones.

185
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:24,313
And in fact, 75% of developers were

186
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,136
working on games that were less than two to three months

187
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:26,756
in duration.

188
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:30,341
And a quarter of that were in less than a one-month cycle.

189
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:34,512
The question I always get is why are Flash games so small?

190
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:36,333
There's several reasons.

191
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:38,734
The first one is that the file size had to stay small.

192
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:43,457
We're still in a restricted bandwidth time for the internet.

193
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:47,359
Flash took forever to compile really large files.

194
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,481
One of my favorite stories is I had to run to school

195
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,662
to compile a file because my computer was under.

196
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:56,655
performing and compiling. So every time I had to go compile

197
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:59,379
the game, I had to ride my bike to school and hit compile and

198
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,182
then run home to be able to upload it.

199
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:07,073
We also saw that long Flash game development was getting outpaced.

200
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:12,375
There was a lot of games coming out, the art was evolving, the technology was evolving.

201
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:15,035
Everything was evolving really quick and if you're working on really long games,

202
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:20,217
we weren't... they were getting outpaced by the progress of Flash games at the time.

203
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,558
And we weren't making any money, we were just doing this for fun.

204
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:26,699
This was just our sending things out and seeing how it goes

205
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,639
and really enjoying the process of it and just making games.

206
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,802
So we started asking ourselves, how are we

207
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:33,902
going to get paid to do this?

208
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:34,963
How can we make this our living?

209
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:36,805
Because this is really a rad process.

210
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,407
And the first place we started was web page ads.

211
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:41,749
We found out really quickly that you

212
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:44,952
could go on to Google AdSense and go download the code

213
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,133
and put it on your page.

214
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:48,615
And magically, you're now earning money on your games.

215
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:50,717
And ads at the time were really good.

216
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,641
We were getting $2 to $10 for every 1,000 page impressions.

217
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:58,484
So if you had a viral title, it was really doing well for you.

218
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:02,253
So we just put a couple of banner ads around the game, put it up,

219
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:05,674
but we saw this other correlation. We realized that

220
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:08,595
when we're making good games, we're getting a good amount of traffic,

221
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,136
and when we're getting good traffic, we're getting those ad views,

222
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:12,616
and those ad views are giving us more income.

223
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,077
So there's this direct correlation that

224
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:17,118
the better the games were, the more innovative, the more interesting,

225
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:20,439
the more standout the content, we were basically making more income,

226
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,440
and we were getting paid for it.

227
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,362
That was really cool.

228
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:26,866
Other people who weren't making games also figured this out.

229
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:30,531
Website owners around the internet were discovering

230
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:32,894
that these flash games are getting a lot of traffic,

231
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:33,895
they're getting a lot of revenue,

232
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:35,778
so they started collecting this content

233
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:37,240
into places called game portals.

234
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:43,344
And very similar to Newgrounds, there were either long lists or large places with tons of icons.

235
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,965
And they got this content in a lot of different ways.

236
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:49,467
The first thing they did was ask a team to build it.

237
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:52,689
If they had a specific idea for a game, they would pay that team to build it.

238
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:56,211
They would license it, they would find a game already existing,

239
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:59,233
and then pay to have a version of that game directly for their site.

240
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:00,994
They asked for it.

241
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:04,096
They said, hey, your game's really good.

242
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:06,418
Would you mind bringing it over to our site?

243
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,420
I might give you a promotion for that.

244
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:09,901
Or not.

245
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:13,984
Or steal it, which was a really fun way of getting a game as

246
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,245
well, because it didn't cost anything.

247
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:16,486
You didn't have to ask permission.

248
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:19,909
So funny enough, that was the most popular way to get

249
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:20,589
content.

250
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,062
What we found was this kind of pirate culture around games. Stealing games was the cheapest

251
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:31,384
and easiest way to get your games. So stealing was really rampant. Just an example of

252
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:36,446
stealing, we have a number called time to steal, which is how fast did your game get

253
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:41,789
stolen. The fastest game my content was stolen was in ten minutes. So the moment I put it

254
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,390
up on a web page, someone took that game,

255
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,331
They removed the URL lock, which meant you could only play it on that page.

256
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,412
They decompiled the file, they removed all my logos,

257
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:54,293
they recompiled the file, they blocked all my outgoing links,

258
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:57,615
and then they put it on their website, and then they tried to get that Google SEO

259
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:58,795
to drive all that traffic to it.

260
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,156
And that was in ten minutes from releasing the game on the page.

261
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:05,757
And the reason that we do this is because the first person to mark it

262
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:07,778
was the one who ended up getting the traffic,

263
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:10,299
getting the Google juice to get them onto that page.

264
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,301
Because we had that community on Newgrounds and other places,

265
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,142
players were really worried about us.

266
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:19,824
When games got stolen, we got a ton of emails.

267
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:22,145
We had players that said, hey, I really love your games,

268
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,746
but I'm really worried that this other website is

269
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:25,827
stealing your content.

270
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:27,668
Do you want me to go talk to them for you?

271
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:31,730
No, I can go talk to them, but that's super great,

272
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,691
and I really appreciate that you care about me.

273
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,812
We just had these sort of interactions with our players,

274
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,273
and this was a really cool thing.

275
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,766
Traffic and revenue was driven to these larger websites and

276
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:43,949
portals and was being taken away from us.

277
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,734
So developers had to start thinking, how are we going to

278
00:13:46,774 --> 00:13:49,218
make money on this stolen content?

279
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:52,994
And that's when we saw the birth of the sponsorship market

280
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:54,274
in 2005.

281
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,615
We realized that there was a stolen game economy here,

282
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,096
that games are going to get stolen.

283
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:00,636
There was a way to make money off of that.

284
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,217
And almost as a really cooperative initiative,

285
00:14:03,337 --> 00:14:04,998
portals started paying developers

286
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:06,459
for putting their branding in their games.

287
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:08,419
When that game got stolen with the branding

288
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:11,360
on a different site, it drove traffic back to the main site.

289
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:13,341
And it actually worked really well.

290
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:17,303
For example, this is Kingdom Rush with the Armor Games

291
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:17,743
branding.

292
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:22,590
The traditional sponsorship was really around

293
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,553
just an exchange of funds for a logo,

294
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,275
a little bit of an animation, usually some sound effects.

295
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:30,077
Developers would co-brand

296
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:32,619
or they would find some special arrangement.

297
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,901
Really depended on who you were talking to

298
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:36,603
as a publisher or as a sponsor.

299
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:39,465
But at the time, the sponsorships were really meager.

300
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:46,211
I retrofitted a game with a logo and some other things they asked for, and I earned

301
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:52,495
an incredible amount of money. I earned $25 for that, and that was for an exclusive title.

302
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:58,120
Now, for me in college, this was an amazing amount of money, because I already made the

303
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,683
game and I was just looking for a little bit of income. And I started replicating this

304
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:06,967
model. I realized that if I kept giving this game to other people, that I would get more

305
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,148
money. So anyone want to guess the second?

306
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:11,562
It was actually less, it was $20.

307
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:15,705
Well, actually it wasn't because they never paid me.

308
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:18,708
They ran away with the game and I never saw them ever again.

309
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:21,910
And the hard part was this was normal.

310
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:24,472
Developers were constantly getting screwed over

311
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:26,714
by these really shady portals,

312
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:28,996
these people asking them if they can have the content

313
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:31,278
and then never responding after they give them the content.

314
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,119
And it was getting really bad.

315
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,641
In 2005 it was bad, but going into 2006

316
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:37,262
it felt like it was getting worse.

317
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:40,806
games were getting stolen, payments were not getting made,

318
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,710
like I said before, the decompiled, recompiled code.

319
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,072
We started finding eBay listings for our games,

320
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:51,236
like self-starting websites, have your own flash game portal

321
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,477
and they were selling our content.

322
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:55,100
Websites were blocking our outgoing links,

323
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,582
there was hostage tactics, that was a really fun time

324
00:15:57,622 --> 00:16:00,865
when I would have my game stolen and someone would say,

325
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,367
I'll remove it for you if you give me some money.

326
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:04,894
And that was a real thing that portals did.

327
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:08,337
And there was a really strong feeling of, you owe us.

328
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:09,498
We're giving you the traffic.

329
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:10,939
We're featuring your game.

330
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:13,861
This is the kind of relationship we should have.

331
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:15,223
And this was kind of gross.

332
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:18,205
And I really want to say that this is really

333
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:20,047
a handful of bad portals.

334
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:21,488
This isn't everyone.

335
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:22,349
This isn't Newgrounds.

336
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,030
This was just a really set of bad portals.

337
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,912
And they were all rising up together

338
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,894
just because there was this gold rush

339
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:29,095
on the flash game economy.

340
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:33,692
But luckily in 2006 there started to be a turnaround.

341
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:36,477
Developers were getting treated terribly,

342
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:37,559
there needed to be a champion.

343
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:40,785
So there were really three companies that really stood up

344
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:42,809
and said, it's time for change.

345
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,891
The first is Mochi Media, which opened in 2006

346
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:49,413
by Jamison and Bob, and it was a self-service approach.

347
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:52,575
You could go online and get yourself some in-game ads,

348
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,116
some analytics, some distribution.

349
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:56,237
You could check on where your game's being stolen

350
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:58,779
and located, and the other interesting part is

351
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,640
now that games are getting stolen with ads in them,

352
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,861
you can now make money when your game got stolen

353
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:03,902
with those in-game ads.

354
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,123
There's different opportunities that were starting to

355
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:08,585
rise up because Mochi Media came in

356
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:09,645
and disrupted the model.

357
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,938
This is kind of a homework pick, but Kongregate is also

358
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,439
a really important part of Flash Games rising up.

359
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,660
When founders Jim and Emily Guer opened Kongregate,

360
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,620
they really wanted to create a place where devs could get

361
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,581
a rev share on the games that they post to the site.

362
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:25,642
So every developer would get a rev share of the banner ads

363
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:28,483
and later in-game purchases when those became available.

364
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:32,044
And Kongregate also really saw the importance

365
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:34,525
of developer communities, player communities

366
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:36,385
interacting with each other and engaging.

367
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:38,526
It's a really important part of making games.

368
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,971
And the final champion is Flash Game License, which was opened

369
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:43,511
by Atom in 2007.

370
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:47,732
And it was a place where you could go onto the website,

371
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:50,893
post your game, and sponsors could openly bid on your game

372
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:55,514
or would openly offer up how much they're willing to pay.

373
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,455
And what this did is it really made the Flash Game model

374
00:17:58,515 --> 00:17:59,375
really transparent.

375
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:01,616
We started to see how much developers were making.

376
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:02,776
It made sponsors really.

377
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:06,518
start to battle each other to try to get the best titles.

378
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,500
And we started to see a shift back towards the developer.

379
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,662
We started seeing that sponsorships were getting competitive.

380
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:14,583
Around 2005, sponsorships were reaching $1,000.

381
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:18,085
But by the end of 2006, they were topping five

382
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,046
and maybe $10,000 for content.

383
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:22,688
And the high quality content was always in demand

384
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:25,009
and they were always getting pit against each other

385
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:26,390
on FGL and other places.

386
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,411
This was the first time we started seeing developers

387
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:30,552
reaching full-time status.

388
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,733
They started being able to pay to do this full-time,

389
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:35,994
and their hobby is now suddenly the thing

390
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,314
they're working on every single day.

391
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:40,195
And this also really, in a really strange way,

392
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:41,636
strengthened the relationship

393
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:42,976
between sponsors and developers.

394
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:47,018
Sponsors started to, the best sponsors started to stand out,

395
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:48,919
and developers started to get to know those sponsors,

396
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,600
and there was this happy sort of relationship

397
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,301
that formed when you found the perfect publisher or sponsor.

398
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,153
The new options that started to open up from this was revenue

399
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,095
shares, mostly media ads and content, contests and

400
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:06,097
competitions, and then site licenses.

401
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:09,079
All these sort of evolutions of the original traditional

402
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:09,939
sponsorship model.

403
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,522
And with this swing back to the developers in the forefront,

404
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:16,244
with this innovative content continuing to come out, and

405
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:19,366
people becoming full-time developers, it really started

406
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:20,607
the Flash Game Renaissance in 2006.

407
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,210
And it was a really pivotal point for Flash Games,

408
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,353
where this really insane collection of developers

409
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:32,855
and websites and fans and people in this industry

410
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:34,096
became an industry.

411
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:37,758
The Flash Games weirdly became a game industry,

412
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:39,319
and it was really awesome.

413
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:42,901
And it attracted so many new talented developers

414
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:46,504
and games were getting jump started through Flash.

415
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:50,287
Games like Dad and Me by Tom Fulp on New Rounds

416
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:52,389
with artists Dan Paladin and Dustball

417
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:55,231
was a collab that was one of those games

418
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:56,312
that really set the bar for,

419
00:19:56,332 --> 00:20:00,555
wow, this game feels like it's a PC console title.

420
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:02,677
This is a really high quality Flash game

421
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:05,679
and really kind of defined the quality bar for 2005, 2006.

422
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,661
We saw games like Kitten Cannon, which was this really early

423
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:12,402
viral title by Dan Fleming.

424
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,803
And it kickstarted an entire genre of launch games

425
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:19,624
and really got people creating this sort of content that

426
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:23,185
went viral and was quick play, but had a lot of depth to it.

427
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:27,666
We saw games like Triachnid by Edmund and Florian,

428
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:31,687
who it was one of the earliest physics-based games in Flash

429
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:33,308
and was this really artistic vision

430
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:34,668
and really kind of changed the way

431
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,689
that we look at games on Flash.

432
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:39,719
This innovation continued to grow,

433
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,341
especially under the sponsorship model.

434
00:20:41,381 --> 00:20:43,122
Developers could be really creative

435
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:45,324
and build whatever they wanted

436
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:47,385
because they knew that the most innovative work,

437
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:49,026
the most creative work, the most polished work

438
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:50,367
was gonna be the one that got funded.

439
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,709
So they continued to have free reign

440
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,190
to work on pretty much whatever they wanted

441
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,411
without a ton of guidance.

442
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,413
And portals kept pushing the developers

443
00:20:58,494 --> 00:21:01,136
to be more innovative, to do better games

444
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:02,937
that are more polished and to stand out

445
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:04,858
because when the developer was winning,

446
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:05,719
the portals were winning.

447
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:09,143
And this innovation and this push for innovation

448
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:11,645
iterated so many genres in Flash.

449
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:15,848
We had games like desktop tower defense

450
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:19,631
that really innovated the tower defense genre.

451
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:21,673
We had launch games like hit and cannon,

452
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:24,935
defense games which were more one-sided tower defense game,

453
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:28,058
puzzle physics games, I said that backwards,

454
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:29,799
escape the room games.

455
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:32,261
Yeah, we just had all these genres

456
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:33,662
that were erupting from Flash

457
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:35,724
and were continuing to be innovated in Flash.

458
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,170
And we started to see that developers were using Flash

459
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,393
as a benchmark to see if their innovative ideas worked.

460
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:46,195
One of the earliest ones we saw was N from MetaNet,

461
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:48,597
who created the game in 2005 in Flash

462
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:50,419
and was a cult classic immediately.

463
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,700
It was one of the first browser games

464
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,623
to win an IGF Audience Award or an IGF Award in general.

465
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:58,646
and it hit consoles and handhelds in 2008.

466
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:00,368
It was one of the first Xbox Live titles.

467
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:03,271
But seeing the success in Flash was what let that game

468
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:05,733
end up on Xbox Live and continue to let it

469
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,997
continue to live on PlayStation 4 and other platforms.

470
00:22:09,898 --> 00:22:12,300
Similarly, Super Meat Boy was originally

471
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,282
a three-week development project in Flash

472
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:15,564
that was launched on Newgrounds.

473
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:21,936
weeks we actually were seeing that it was getting close to half a million to a

474
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:25,377
million downloads just playing this game and that was a really clear indicator

475
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:29,859
that there is something special here and that's why Edmund went and made it into

476
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:30,659
a full title.

477
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:32,179
This is like the

478
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,740
early story of Indie Game the Movie that you

479
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,641
may not have seen. This is what was behind the scenes going on before

480
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:41,182
Edmund was on camera doing that.

481
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:48,043
This really opened up the idea of virality, that great games

482
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:50,744
would rise up, get shared everywhere, would get posted

483
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:52,745
on social media or different websites.

484
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:55,526
And viral was becoming an accepted real way to make

485
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:58,408
games, and it was wrecking our websites.

486
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:02,089
We were getting on Dig and Fark and StumbleUpon, and it

487
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,510
was a real mess.

488
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,552
The amount of traffic we were getting was taking down our websites.

489
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:11,675
In fact, one of the scariest things in college was I had no money, but I had my game on a website,

490
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:16,078
and I got a call from my bandwidth provider saying that

491
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,400
you're not only out of bandwidth, but you're double up on what you're doing.

492
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,902
and you didn't deploy your banner ads yet,

493
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,483
so you weren't making money on this game yet.

494
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,464
So I immediately had to turn off my website,

495
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:28,165
and I couldn't turn it on for over a month

496
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:31,047
until the ashes were scattered,

497
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:33,208
and I was really sad.

498
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:36,093
Yeah, it's a sad story.

499
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:39,997
Some games went extremely viral.

500
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:43,340
We have all played QWOP by Bennett Foddy.

501
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:47,324
It's this really wonderful, bendy, joint-controlling

502
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:47,884
running game.

503
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:49,786
And it broke the internet.

504
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:54,090
It was just this incredibly easy game to share and to play

505
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,392
with other people, even though it's a one-player game.

506
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,254
It's one of the most viral flash.

507
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:04,841
games of all time and we all rallied and cheered when it was featured on a television show.

508
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:08,225
It was on the office on NBC that you could see the office workers playing co-op in the

509
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:14,331
background. It was also the inspiration of maybe the best Flash cosplay ever done.

510
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,392
We saw games like Line Rider, which

511
00:24:18,552 --> 00:24:21,095
was one of the first games to have that sharing culture,

512
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:24,358
building tracks freehand, sharing them, playing them.

513
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:28,141
Currently, Line Rider has 1.7 million videos on YouTube.

514
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:30,544
And with some of the earliest pieces of YouTube content

515
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:31,985
being shared, you can look at videos

516
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:33,526
that are over 10 years old on YouTube

517
00:24:33,546 --> 00:24:34,728
that were from Line Rider.

518
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:38,396
We continue to see our community grow.

519
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:40,978
As we were more innovative, as we attracted more people,

520
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:42,238
we worked with different people,

521
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,780
and these communities started to appear

522
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,041
all across the world.

523
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:49,222
There was micro communities in various different countries,

524
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:52,044
there was online communities through Newgrounds,

525
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:54,826
Karupa, TIG Source, and developers hosted

526
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:55,886
their own player communities.

527
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:58,850
this really amazing time where we could talk about

528
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,712
games over AOL Instant Messenger,

529
00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:03,716
which was our chat program of choice.

530
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:05,799
We were talking on email forums,

531
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:07,261
we were learning how to program together,

532
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:09,644
we were growing together as a community.

533
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:12,367
And it was really important for Flash

534
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:14,250
to have these communities growing together.

535
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:17,172
And Ludum Dare was another community that was growing.

536
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:20,375
And we found that a lot of games coming out of Ludum Dare

537
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:23,076
were Flash games, because it was just a natural progression

538
00:25:23,117 --> 00:25:24,838
for these tiny little experimental games

539
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:25,658
that you could work on.

540
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:28,380
We saw a lot of Flash developers between Ludum Dare 19 and 28

541
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,201
building great Flash content.

542
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:37,990
And the younger developers started to rise. We saw developers like Tyle Glale, who worked on

543
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:43,835
Closure and Aether, start to come out of the scene because he was given the opportunity. He

544
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,658
was 15 or 16 at the time and he created a procedurally generated physics-based terrain

545
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:57,005
game called Crazy Car at age 15. And it was at 2 million plays by the end of 2005. Another

546
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:01,628
developer that I know personally, Chris Chaps, he sent me a quote and he said,

547
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:02,573
I never.

548
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:06,943
I never even knew I'd fall into games industry at the age of 16.

549
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,385
Having full creative freedom to make games that anyone could

550
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:11,186
play in their browser was insanely cool.

551
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,627
And without Flash, I wouldn't be doing what I loved.

552
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:16,309
He was given that opportunity to stand out

553
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:20,111
and to do things in games, which was a really powerful part

554
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:20,611
of Flash.

555
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:23,273
Here's a longer quote from Anya, who

556
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:26,755
was the developer relations manager at Nickelodeon

557
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:27,575
or Addicting Games.

558
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:30,317
This is one of my favorite stories in Flash,

559
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:31,397
so I wanted to share all of it.

560
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,098
We had a developer who made.

561
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,181
irreverent, slightly minimalist games. We found based on his

562
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:40,344
humor and skill, he was maybe 25. But his dad always signed

563
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:43,186
the contracts, which we thought was really odd. And then one

564
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,608
day he sent us an e-mail saying that he bought his first car.

565
00:26:45,628 --> 00:26:47,930
And we were like, oh, that's kind of late for buying your

566
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,813
first car. But it turns out he was only 16 and not only was he

567
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:54,195
buying his first car with the money he had received from

568
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:56,777
licensing his flash games, but he had just got his driver's

569
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:57,118
license.

570
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:01,440
The Flash game community really let young developers rise up

571
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:03,750
and get their first titles out there and succeed.

572
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:09,132
A lot of this was due to the fact that tool sets started to emerge around the Flash game scene.

573
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:13,834
There was a lot of really great titles coming out of these tools as well.

574
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:18,755
Tools like Flashpunk, who was Chevy Ray Johnson's library for making Flash games,

575
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:25,377
it really helped elevate developers and get them past the initial problems that Flash developers had to figure out.

576
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:28,258
Like, how are you going to deal with delta time or animation or collision?

577
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:31,420
It resulted in titles like Give Up Robot by Matt Thorson,

578
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,001
the creator who went on to make Tower Fall,

579
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:36,423
or Radical Fission by the Vlambeer team

580
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:37,844
and Super Puzzle Platformer.

581
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,565
And then we had tools like Flixel,

582
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:42,546
which was this gorgeous tile-based editor

583
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:45,248
which pretty much covered everything you had to do in games

584
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:47,329
and if you were gonna make a tile-based game.

585
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,711
And that was created by Adam Saltzman

586
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:52,533
and ended up with titles like Cannonball and Looming

587
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:53,393
and Tower of Heaven.

588
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:57,697
And then Starling came out later in the game by Gamua,

589
00:27:57,757 --> 00:28:00,079
and it was a really nice tool because it leveraged

590
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:03,102
the access to the GPU for the first time,

591
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:04,383
which was amazing,

592
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,385
because everything was on the CPU before that.

593
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:08,987
And we had games like Incredipede and Samorost

594
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,268
and Haunt the House come out.

595
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:12,331
And we saw Flash evolve as well.

596
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,414
We were in ActionScript 1, we were moving into 2,

597
00:28:14,454 --> 00:28:17,399
but now we're in 3, which was object-oriented programming,

598
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,944
more mature tools, and animation performance

599
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:21,445
was getting better.

600
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:23,328
So everything was on an upward trajectory.

601
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:28,257
And Flash gave us all these robust tools, but they also gave us a bunch of really weird

602
00:28:28,297 --> 00:28:32,698
tools. In some ways we weren't sure if they knew what we wanted or what we were going

603
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:35,879
to do with these things. I feel like they kind of gave them to us just to see what would

604
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,300
happen. So as curious developers we just kind of ran with it. One of the first examples

605
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,422
is Flash had local save objects. These wouldn't reset with your browser cookies. So a developer

606
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:49,663
named Raytendo created a game called You Only Live Once.

607
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:52,004
And the first time you play through the game,

608
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:55,547
you get as far as you can, and once you die, you're dead.

609
00:28:56,788 --> 00:28:59,630
And players could not figure out how to reset the game.

610
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:02,193
Every time they reset the browser,

611
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:04,174
it would show a different scene of

612
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:05,875
what was going on in the game.

613
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:07,136
The first time there was a funeral,

614
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:09,198
the second time you see the body getting buried

615
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:12,541
in the ground, each time the player frustratingly

616
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:13,942
trying to figure out how to reset the cookie

617
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,243
so they can try to get further in the game,

618
00:29:15,263 --> 00:29:16,124
they would see another scene.

619
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:17,565
I think there was like six or seven scenes,

620
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:18,365
it was really hilarious.

621
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,240
We knew where you're loading your Flash files from.

622
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,921
And players didn't know this.

623
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,662
And some portals didn't even know this.

624
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:28,584
If there was a portal we didn't like, we did things like

625
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,286
mess with the difficulty, or flip the screen upside down.

626
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:34,408
Or we just played these practical jokes as developers.

627
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:36,310
But we also used that to our advantage.

628
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,031
We sometimes created specialized content.

629
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:39,832
For example, if we knew the game was being played on New

630
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:42,654
Grounds, which is somewhere we really liked, we would put in

631
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,395
special features or kind of pander to New

632
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,155
Grounds a little bit.

633
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,937
We were very much a pandering audience in Flash.

634
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,993
flashed to this insane thing where you could load a flash

635
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:54,375
inside any other flash file.

636
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:56,577
And you could have that flash file load another flash file

637
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:57,418
inside that flash file.

638
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,780
And you could do that at runtime.

639
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,001
You could do that whenever you wanted.

640
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:02,364
And there was this really weird thing that you could

641
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,146
build these nested experiences through.

642
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:06,509
You could also talk to other flash windows.

643
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:09,031
I had a game called Achievement Unlocked 2, where

644
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:10,013
I had one window.

645
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,672
open where you're playing the main game, but if you just

646
00:30:12,832 --> 00:30:15,235
weirdly opened up another window, it would take you to

647
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:19,659
the iced coffee mod, which was a counter to the hot coffee

648
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,160
mod from Grand Theft Auto.

649
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:23,122
And there was iced coffee there.

650
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:25,745
And there was secret achievements in that window.

651
00:30:26,786 --> 00:30:29,388
Another fun thing that we got access to is Nintendo Wii's

652
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:31,190
Opera browser decided one day it was just

653
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:31,930
going to support Flash.

654
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:35,853
And we decided that we were going to take advantage of that.

655
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:38,054
So a lot of developers started creating their own portals

656
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,375
around Wii-based Flash games.

657
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:44,657
And it wasn't an amazing experience.

658
00:30:44,697 --> 00:30:47,499
In fact, it ran kind of slow, and it was kind of awful.

659
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:50,060
But it was the first time that we

660
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,321
got to say that we made a console game,

661
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:55,082
and then just smile at our parents.

662
00:30:57,597 --> 00:31:02,338
And Flash was kind of crazy and players were really engaged with

663
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:04,619
us. But one of the funniest things that also happened a lot

664
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:08,880
is players mistook our bugs as features. A developer named

665
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,742
Oliver Joyce made a game called Swords and Sandals. And he was

666
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:17,463
using an array but didn't really realize that if you put commas

667
00:31:17,663 --> 00:31:21,385
in the player's name box that you could kind of screw with the

668
00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:24,946
array that had all the save data in it. So players started

669
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,247
creating this phenomenon called the comma hack.

670
00:31:27,787 --> 00:31:30,810
And they would create these videos that were getting quarter of a million, half a million

671
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,213
plays in them to explain the comma hack.

672
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,256
And this culture around hacking this game opened up.

673
00:31:36,836 --> 00:31:41,601
And when Oliver went to go make the next Swords and Sandals, the biggest question he always

674
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:45,305
got from players was, is the comma hack feature going to be in the next game?

675
00:31:45,345 --> 00:31:46,786
Because that was our favorite part of that game.

676
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,511
So Flash had really weird features, but it also kind of

677
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:52,571
let us be weird ourselves.

678
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:56,033
We created all these really odd, interesting, kind of out

679
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:56,553
there games.

680
00:31:57,994 --> 00:32:00,495
One of the best examples is Don't Shit Your Pants, which

681
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:01,656
was a text-based adventure.

682
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:07,781
it's a 20 second simulator of walking to the bathroom

683
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:09,362
as a text-based adventure.

684
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:12,645
And it was one of those games that was just really obscure

685
00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:14,687
and really different, and we point out and say,

686
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,108
oh, yeah, that was Flash.

687
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:19,871
That team went on three years later to make Rogue Legacy.

688
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:23,534
And if you're walking around inside the castle

689
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,356
in Rogue Legacy, you'll actually see pictures

690
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:26,436
from this game.

691
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:30,685
We had games like Robot Unicorn Attack, which for me,

692
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:32,566
I think it really defined the kind of games

693
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:34,887
that Adult Swim worked on and the style.

694
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:39,050
And the song Always by Erasure was a song

695
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,291
that I can still hear in my head in the middle of the night.

696
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:44,173
And this game just kind of blew up into the stratosphere

697
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:47,094
and had this really nice cult following

698
00:32:47,194 --> 00:32:49,496
and had ports to iOS and Android.

699
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,838
And this is going to be the one slide where I talk about myself.

700
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:55,179
I worked on a game called Achievement Unlocked,

701
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:59,281
which was a game where all you do is collect achievements,

702
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:01,402
and that's really the goal of the game.

703
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:04,884
So just doing really dumb things inside this environment,

704
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,666
and whether it's typing in the Konami code,

705
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:09,307
whether it's refreshing the page, whether it's...

706
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,654
not touching any buttons for five minutes,

707
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:15,815
like those sorts of things that aren't really a game,

708
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,316
but players seem to really enjoy collecting

709
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:21,518
and filling out lists, so I made 500 things to do

710
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:23,198
and just let players spend their afternoon

711
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:24,219
trying to figure out what those were.

712
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,680
It was, my favorite part of the game

713
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,360
was there was a guinea pig stuck in a hamster tube.

714
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,261
That's just me, though.

715
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:38,928
The flash game industry continued to grow and by 2009, 2010 the trajectory was insane.

716
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:44,690
We were seeing popular releases for games getting over a million plays in the first 24 hours.

717
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,071
Mochi Media at the time was serving 40,000 portals.

718
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:54,073
There's a ton of tiny flash game sites and we were seeing our content spread across thousands of websites.

719
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:56,956
And we had our first Flash Gaming Summit.

720
00:33:57,156 --> 00:34:03,843
We met up in San Francisco here back in 2010.

721
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,025
And we, for the first time,

722
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:07,466
were face to face with each other.

723
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:09,548
Because we had never seen each other.

724
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:11,850
We worked on the internet.

725
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,672
And every once in a while we sent chat messages.

726
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,714
I didn't meet the artist I worked with

727
00:34:15,794 --> 00:34:18,537
for three to four years until Flash Gaming Summit.

728
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,050
In 2009, these portals were getting crazy traffic.

729
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,011
Miniclip was hovering around 250 worldwide.

730
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:29,232
Newgrounds, Armor Games, Kongregate all top 1,000.

731
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:31,774
Addicting games pulling up on Miniclip.

732
00:34:32,294 --> 00:34:34,695
And the new models for making money were still rolling in.

733
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:36,176
There were sponsorships with bonuses.

734
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:38,398
There was pre-roll ads, interstitial ads,

735
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:40,219
and microtransactions were starting

736
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,579
to come into the game, too.

737
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,881
And by 2010, we were seeing sponsorship prizes

738
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:45,421
rising to over $100,000.

739
00:34:45,461 --> 00:34:46,142
This is just a reminder.

740
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:47,763
These are games where.

741
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,591
We just are going to do whatever we want.

742
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:55,172
We're just going to put in all these features.

743
00:34:55,212 --> 00:34:58,153
We're going to do the art in the way we want to,

744
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,013
the team we want to build.

745
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,254
And we're going to get paid up to $100,000 for this game.

746
00:35:03,374 --> 00:35:05,274
That's a pretty remarkable thing.

747
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:09,495
And the sponsorship deals were getting even more complex.

748
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,676
And developers were starting to get their rights secured

749
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:15,437
for sequels, because the best developers were starting

750
00:35:15,457 --> 00:35:16,757
to get locked down by a platform.

751
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:21,796
By 2009, we were seeing that 30% of Flash game developers

752
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:23,517
were using this as their full-time job.

753
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:27,139
And 60% of developers were just working on their own.

754
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:29,719
They were just working solo on a lot of their projects.

755
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,641
And the other fact we started to learn is that 16% of all

756
00:35:33,661 --> 00:35:34,801
developers were making more than $1,000 a

757
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,542
month on their games.

758
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:40,985
We started to see lots of different regions start to benefit from Flash games.

759
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:44,627
A lot of smaller, it wasn't just US, it wasn't just Europe,

760
00:35:44,747 --> 00:35:49,631
we started to see these smaller game communities start to rise in other countries as well.

761
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,841
With Flash Rising, by 2011, we saw over 18,700 titles

762
00:35:54,981 --> 00:35:58,462
on congregate.com in just 2011 alone.

763
00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:02,183
That's averaging 50 a day, and that's around every 30 minutes

764
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,163
someone is uploading a new game to Congregate.

765
00:36:04,984 --> 00:36:06,664
It's also worth noting that Newgrounds at the time

766
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:10,865
was peaking somewhere around 200 for games coming in

767
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:13,626
every single day, or sorry, animations and games coming

768
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:14,426
in every single day.

769
00:36:14,646 --> 00:36:16,307
There was a lot of content being made.

770
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:23,675
We also saw the rise of social games, which were all flash-based and were starting on a new

771
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:28,981
platform called Facebook. And Facebook games had this big bang that started with a gold rush and

772
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:35,068
many larger companies were exploding on the scene trying to cash in on this new social media thing

773
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:35,769
that was going on.

774
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,560
the age of microtransactions begins,

775
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,321
and we start to see that these microtransactions

776
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:44,762
were starting to be used in casual social games,

777
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:46,383
but also MMOs and RPGs.

778
00:36:46,983 --> 00:36:49,704
And we started to see that flash games

779
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:50,765
were making a lot of money.

780
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:54,626
Farmville in 2009 made a billion dollars in revenue by 2013.

781
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:59,249
It's pretty safe to say this is the highest grossing flash game

782
00:36:59,269 --> 00:36:59,990
we've ever seen.

783
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:02,072
And then additionally, Candy Crush,

784
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:04,074
while it was also a mobile title,

785
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:05,735
was seeing somewhere around $1 to $1.33 billion

786
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:06,296
in revenue a year.

787
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:12,230
We started to see MMOs and RPGs rise up.

788
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,411
The East was starting to localize in the West.

789
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:17,193
We had games like War Toons, Rise of Mythos coming in.

790
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:21,335
We saw that AAA games were getting involved in Flash.

791
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:25,277
Autodesk's Scaleform allowed you to build your UI

792
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:28,999
and pieces for your game inside Flash

793
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,721
and then export to whatever you were working in, C++.

794
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:36,804
And games like Elder Scrolls Skyrim and Borderlands

795
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:39,625
and StarCraft were building all of their UI in Flash.

796
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,326
One of the funniest things is,

797
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:44,886
I'm skipping ahead a little bit,

798
00:37:45,007 --> 00:37:47,327
but players used to get really worked up and saying,

799
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,867
I don't want Flash games on Steam,

800
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:50,868
I don't want to be playing those Flash games,

801
00:37:50,928 --> 00:37:51,908
and then you look at their library

802
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:53,128
and it's full of these titles,

803
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:56,649
so they just never knew that Flash was part of the games

804
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:57,990
that they already loved and played.

805
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,590
We started to see reactive content start to emerge.

806
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:03,951
PETA created a game called Cooking Mama,

807
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:06,932
Mama Kills Animals, which was right around Thanksgiving.

808
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:07,732
It's a game about...

809
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,422
cutting open a turkey just in time for Thanksgiving.

810
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:14,524
It was real gross, but it got a lot of press and news.

811
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:17,466
And we started to see other controversial titles

812
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:18,886
and reactive content start to come out.

813
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,928
We had games like VTech Rampage come out,

814
00:38:21,288 --> 00:38:23,329
and the news went absolutely insane for that.

815
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:24,690
And games like Smuggle Truck,

816
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,491
which is also known as Snuggle Truck,

817
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:29,032
for platforms who wouldn't accept Smuggle Truck.

818
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:30,053
Sorry.

819
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,363
The Flash game art scene was evolving as well.

820
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,908
The art in Flash games went from these really beautiful

821
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:42,954
rainbow gradients and static-y 12 frames per second tweens

822
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:46,038
to these really gorgeous frame-by-frame animated.

823
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:52,862
titles. We had games like Alien Hominid, Dad and Me from Dan Paladin. Nitrome was finding

824
00:38:52,902 --> 00:38:56,864
their visual style and it was gorgeous and continues to be gorgeous in the games they

825
00:38:56,904 --> 00:39:02,027
release for iOS. I really like Nitrome because they really embody the Flash game spirit and

826
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:04,208
a lot of the titles they make for iOS and Android.

827
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,362
Amanita Design was building these really lush, beautiful

828
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:13,964
environments in a place that was normally just reserved for

829
00:39:14,044 --> 00:39:17,445
vector and for hand-drawn vector animation.

830
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:21,527
So this was a really cool piece that was starting to come in.

831
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:25,469
Jim, who is a developer I worked with for a very long

832
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:29,531
time, created these really gorgeous, artistic, cartoony,

833
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:35,273
poppy animation styles and art, and games like Sushi Cat.

834
00:39:35,594 --> 00:39:36,214
came from him.

835
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:40,676
We also saw this throwback to this 8-bit style.

836
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:45,057
Terry was working on games like Hexagon and VVVVVV

837
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:48,139
and Don't Look Back, that was six, okay.

838
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,120
And we also saw Oracinal,

839
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,760
which is one of our favorite Flash portals.

840
00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:57,062
And these really gorgeous, beautiful, cute animations.

841
00:39:57,343 --> 00:40:00,024
This is a game where you have to raise and lower your head

842
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:02,405
as a giraffe to kiss the various giraffes

843
00:40:02,445 --> 00:40:04,025
that are going by, it's really great.

844
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,871
So that brings us to 2010 and the arrival of mobile,

845
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:11,272
which is a very fun time for Flash.

846
00:40:12,352 --> 00:40:14,333
Flash was struggling with mobile.

847
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,935
Apple and Google was opening their smartphones

848
00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:20,536
to third-party creation, but they was hesitating

849
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:24,237
towards allowing Flash content onto the devices.

850
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:26,338
And Apple especially was really worried

851
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:29,960
about how content was gonna be used on their devices.

852
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,681
This was a brand new device, and it made a lot of sense

853
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,581
that they were concerned.

854
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:39,365
They were so concerned that Steve Jobs wrote 1,700 words about Flash.

855
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:43,848
This was really odd for the time because at the time as developers we were thinking, well,

856
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:46,469
Flash is just this little plug-in that we use to make games.

857
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,973
To have someone like Steve Jobs who just released this incredible smartphone to be talking about

858
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,434
Flash in this way was kind of hurtful.

859
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:55,975
We didn't really understand it.

860
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:59,338
But he said Flash is a cross-platform development tool.

861
00:40:59,478 --> 00:41:02,580
It's not Adobe's goal to help developers write the best iPhone, iPad.

862
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,021
and iPod apps.

863
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:07,323
And we start to see this emergence of this war,

864
00:41:07,543 --> 00:41:10,045
this war of Apple versus Adobe.

865
00:41:10,906 --> 00:41:12,027
This photo's a little gruesome,

866
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:13,208
maybe I shouldn't have used that one.

867
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:15,950
It was during a time when the iPhone

868
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,111
was drawing a lot of attention,

869
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:19,833
Steve Jobs said flash isn't the right way forward,

870
00:41:19,873 --> 00:41:23,235
HTML5 is, and he brought up a lot of shortcomings,

871
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:24,877
which were true, we had shortcomings

872
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:25,938
in the flash game space.

873
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:29,060
Heavy CPU usage, everyone's had that like,

874
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:33,031
laptop fan turn on and start worrying and then the battery

875
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:36,653
dropped really low because we were using CPU. A lot of games

876
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:39,154
were based in CPU because that's how it was originally written.

877
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,076
There was constantly these security flaws and patches

878
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:46,739
having to be deployed. Players don't like updating Flash every

879
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:49,800
three days. It's really not fun. But it makes sense because when

880
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,681
you have 99% of machines, you can't do it.

881
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:54,505
having this technology, it's obviously going to be the thing

882
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,785
that hackers are going to target and try to get into.

883
00:41:57,545 --> 00:42:00,646
But Flash still tried to go to mobile, and Flash landed on

884
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:04,026
several Android phones and the Palm Pre and other devices.

885
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,126
But it didn't last long.

886
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:10,087
Conrad attempted to create a small portal of games on

887
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,248
Google's app using a lot of phones were using Flash at the

888
00:42:13,268 --> 00:42:16,648
time, and Google shut it down, saying that it violated their

889
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:19,009
app's terms of service for creating an app store

890
00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:19,409
environment.

891
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:23,011
So there was really this pushback against Flash content

892
00:42:23,091 --> 00:42:24,753
going anywhere near mobile phones.

893
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:29,336
And Apple outright blocked the export of third party tools to

894
00:42:29,376 --> 00:42:29,956
create apps.

895
00:42:30,016 --> 00:42:32,578
They wanted you to be building games in their ecosystem in

896
00:42:32,598 --> 00:42:33,559
the way that they wanted to.

897
00:42:35,602 --> 00:42:38,583
And so Adobe responded by running these ads that were a

898
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:39,543
little backhanded.

899
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:44,145
They said, we love Apple, but we just don't like how they do

900
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:45,886
business.

901
00:42:45,986 --> 00:42:46,987
It was a really odd thing.

902
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:49,188
The media outlets started to say Flash was dead.

903
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,429
And this was the first time we started hearing, Flash is

904
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,970
dead, long live HTML5.

905
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,071
And this was the first death of Flash.

906
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:59,052
And I put death of Flash in quotes because there will be a

907
00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:02,613
death of Flash every three months from 2010 all the way

908
00:43:02,633 --> 00:43:02,753
to now.

909
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,452
Nearly every week a news article was running saying Flash is dead.

910
00:43:09,472 --> 00:43:12,394
Another stake in the heart of Adobe.

911
00:43:12,954 --> 00:43:16,537
And there was websites popping up called Occupied Flash, which was trying to get

912
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:18,979
people to uninstall Flash off of

913
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,320
like

914
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,822
computers from people who don't know how to uninstall Flash. They want you to go

915
00:43:23,842 --> 00:43:27,045
around and help get things uninstalled. It was this really weird

916
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:29,987
movement to get Flash off of people's computers.

917
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:34,125
people were calling me worried saying why are you making games

918
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,227
that are going to break my computer? Why are you making

919
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:39,009
flash games? My relatives were worried about me. They said are

920
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:41,211
you going to have a living because flash games are dead,

921
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:45,394
right? It was this weird heavily covered rally by the news

922
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:47,836
organization about a browser plug-in.

923
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,396
which is really bizarre.

924
00:43:50,596 --> 00:43:53,057
And the industry was scrambling to hide Flash.

925
00:43:53,117 --> 00:43:55,318
We started to see a lot of these brands starting

926
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:57,998
to obfuscate the Flash part.

927
00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:00,859
Flash Game License became FGL, and Flash Gaming Summit

928
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:02,079
became FGS.

929
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:06,260
And devs were starting to remove Flash from their studio names

930
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,121
because they didn't want that associated with them.

931
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:11,281
And even Adobe Flash at one point

932
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:13,342
decided, yeah, we're going to become Adobe Animate.

933
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:16,722
So there was this kind of backpedaling on Flash.

934
00:44:16,903 --> 00:44:17,003
And

935
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:20,846
Adobe responded by saying, we gotta compete,

936
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:22,308
and started ramping up their tech.

937
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:26,232
And at one point, you could export Unity into a Flash file,

938
00:44:26,452 --> 00:44:27,654
and it was really cool.

939
00:44:28,775 --> 00:44:30,657
And they started announcing that they were working

940
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:32,700
on ActionScript Next or ActionScript 4,

941
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,081
depending on how you like to look at it.

942
00:44:34,702 --> 00:44:37,443
And we started to see a new generation of flash programming

943
00:44:37,483 --> 00:44:38,204
start to emerge.

944
00:44:38,264 --> 00:44:39,644
And there was GamePad support coming,

945
00:44:39,684 --> 00:44:41,365
so we could make GamePad games.

946
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,986
And that was the coolest thing in the world.

947
00:44:43,086 --> 00:44:45,287
But they also, around the same time,

948
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:47,948
started saying that they're going to charge a 9% rev share

949
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:49,909
on anything you make that makes over $50,000,

950
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,291
but only if you use these certain technologies

951
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:56,513
in this order, which was really confusing for developers.

952
00:44:56,913 --> 00:44:58,794
And developers were already paying a monthly fee

953
00:44:58,814 --> 00:45:01,335
for these games, or to make games with Adobe,

954
00:45:01,395 --> 00:45:03,836
or were paying $700 a year for the upgrade every year.

955
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:03,996
So.

956
00:45:04,557 --> 00:45:07,738
were really confused on why they had to pay a rev share on top of

957
00:45:07,758 --> 00:45:11,120
paying for the tools. Later Adobe would drop action script

958
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,761
floor plans. Unity would pull out their Adobe flash support.

959
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:17,382
So it wasn't looking really good for flash. And developers were

960
00:45:17,442 --> 00:45:20,684
really worried. And they didn't know what to do. They were

961
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:24,285
confused. They didn't know how to go forward. Flash felt like

962
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:26,506
it was dying, but only because everyone was telling them it was

963
00:45:26,546 --> 00:45:29,427
dying. In reality, the flash portals were still doing really

964
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:29,627
well.

965
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:32,989
Do they stick with Flash, the tools they know and love?

966
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:35,690
Do they move to native code to try to be on mobile?

967
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,291
Do they move to Unity, which was starting to appear

968
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:40,571
and was starting to export to web?

969
00:45:41,652 --> 00:45:48,374
No, HTML5, our savior, was being rallied super hard

970
00:45:48,394 --> 00:45:48,974
by everyone.

971
00:45:49,034 --> 00:45:51,615
Everyone wanted HTML5 to come into existence

972
00:45:51,655 --> 00:45:54,856
and to replace Flash into, even Steve Jobs called it out

973
00:45:54,916 --> 00:46:00,118
like seven or eight times in his very long essay on Flash.

974
00:46:00,878 --> 00:46:03,780
And HTML5 was really a good idea.

975
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,122
It was going to usher in non-proprietary game

976
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:06,702
development.

977
00:46:06,803 --> 00:46:08,624
We were going to be able to get in there

978
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:09,865
and create new tools around it.

979
00:46:09,885 --> 00:46:11,346
It did video streaming.

980
00:46:11,366 --> 00:46:12,467
It had multimedia support.

981
00:46:13,267 --> 00:46:15,609
It sounded like a good idea, but it wasn't there

982
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:17,010
at the time in 2010.

983
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,232
In 2010, HTML5 was still a draft.

984
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:21,634
It wasn't widely adopted by browsers.

985
00:46:21,994 --> 00:46:23,475
It wasn't uniformly adopted.

986
00:46:23,495 --> 00:46:25,416
There wasn't that tool parody.

987
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:27,418
There weren't the things that we enjoyed in Flash.

988
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:33,820
available to us in HTML5 and CSS and JavaScript. So it was a

989
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,242
little early. And there was starting to become this gap in

990
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:40,363
technology because developers were worried about flash. HTML5

991
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:45,405
wasn't there yet. So what are we going to do? And in 2013, we

992
00:46:45,445 --> 00:46:47,185
start to see the collapse of sponsorships.

993
00:46:49,377 --> 00:46:52,141
As sponsorships started to decline,

994
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:53,382
it was a lot of things.

995
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,685
But one of the biggest ones is that web ads

996
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:57,187
started to decline in revenue.

997
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:00,030
This was from a few different factors.

998
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,392
Mobile was up and coming.

999
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,635
Adblock was coming in and wrecking havoc on people's ads.

1000
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:09,770
Developers needed to start using in-app purchases and

1001
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:13,450
other things to supplement their monetization, because it

1002
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,231
was no longer feasible to just build whatever you wanted,

1003
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:19,272
send it out there, and hope that banner ads were going to

1004
00:47:19,312 --> 00:47:20,432
drive the revenue for it.

1005
00:47:21,192 --> 00:47:23,253
Less games were coming out, because there was less money

1006
00:47:23,293 --> 00:47:26,193
there, and lack of sponsorships meant less traffic.

1007
00:47:26,273 --> 00:47:33,295
So there became this decline from 2013 to 2016 to now of

1008
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,796
all the portals starting to slowly decline in traffic.

1009
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:41,328
To kind of simplify this graph, I just averaged all of it.

1010
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:43,756
There was this slow decline downward.

1011
00:47:46,048 --> 00:47:48,029
The sponsorship market pretty much slows to a halt.

1012
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:52,091
The large portals slow down or even just stop on sponsorship.

1013
00:47:52,111 --> 00:47:54,832
There was no longer enough value to be working on these

1014
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:55,993
really expensive games.

1015
00:47:57,153 --> 00:48:00,055
The smaller portals have to start folding because the

1016
00:48:00,075 --> 00:48:01,736
large portals aren't creating new content.

1017
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,537
And there's no way for them to get new content if the large

1018
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:05,618
portals aren't sponsoring.

1019
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,020
And by 2014, we saw Mochi Media shut down.

1020
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,361
And the company was one of those early companies

1021
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:15,883
that really came in and helped us make games and be creative

1022
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:18,384
and be able to self-serve with these tools and services.

1023
00:48:18,444 --> 00:48:21,686
So that was a really painful moment for our community.

1024
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:23,627
And it happened right before GDC.

1025
00:48:25,428 --> 00:48:27,869
In addition to that, FGL in 2016 announced

1026
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:29,910
that they were going to slow down and stop

1027
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,891
the sponsorship marketplaces while there.

1028
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:35,013
FGL is still working on other tools and services

1029
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:37,995
for developers, but the main sponsorship portal is down.

1030
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,282
And we start to see developers leaving Flash.

1031
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,143
And they spread out in all directions.

1032
00:48:43,823 --> 00:48:46,864
We had developers who were staying in web games,

1033
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:49,065
working on HTML5, working on Unity export.

1034
00:48:49,405 --> 00:48:51,286
We had others working on mobile PC games.

1035
00:48:51,686 --> 00:48:54,107
But many developers actually just got up and left the scene.

1036
00:48:54,287 --> 00:48:57,408
They went on to work on careers.

1037
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:00,630
One of my favorite developers became a travel agent

1038
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,970
and loves being a travel agent.

1039
00:49:03,871 --> 00:49:05,993
But some still remained and made games.

1040
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:06,774
They made it work.

1041
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:10,337
They adjusted to this crazy collapse of sponsorships

1042
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:12,940
by finding ways to continue to make profitable games.

1043
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,781
And it was really this amazing thing

1044
00:49:15,242 --> 00:49:17,824
that even today, Flash game developers

1045
00:49:17,864 --> 00:49:19,366
are making money on their games.

1046
00:49:22,177 --> 00:49:28,601
After Flash, we continue to see the exports of Unity and Unreal

1047
00:49:28,722 --> 00:49:30,503
and all these other really great technologies.

1048
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:33,225
3D is starting to become more commonplace in browser games.

1049
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:37,087
And we really start to see this shift in technology usage

1050
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:42,150
on Congregate, especially around the turn of 2010,

1051
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:45,533
when the panic over Flash really began.

1052
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:50,316
And even now in 2017, a minority of our content

1053
00:49:50,356 --> 00:49:51,316
coming into Congregate.

1054
00:49:51,837 --> 00:49:57,483
is Flash. But it's still coming in and it's still being enjoyed by our players. The biggest

1055
00:49:57,563 --> 00:50:03,129
uptick we've seen is HTML5 taking off. And that's a really great sign for the web platform.

1056
00:50:04,983 --> 00:50:06,665
New tools emerged for those developers who

1057
00:50:06,705 --> 00:50:07,465
were working in Flash.

1058
00:50:07,485 --> 00:50:10,048
We have Haxe, Flixel, and OpenFL.

1059
00:50:10,068 --> 00:50:12,951
And we got a lot of great titles out of that, games like

1060
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:15,353
Papers, Please, and Defenders Quest, and Cardinal Quest.

1061
00:50:16,194 --> 00:50:17,876
We start to see new portals arrive.

1062
00:50:17,896 --> 00:50:20,598
We get to see Itch.io and Game Jolt come in and provide

1063
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:22,921
these really great user experiences around

1064
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:23,882
downloadable games.

1065
00:50:24,562 --> 00:50:26,725
And we start to see portals also move into publishing.

1066
00:50:26,845 --> 00:50:28,466
A lot of these portals were working.

1067
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,811
with developers who are making really great games on a daily basis.

1068
00:50:32,892 --> 00:50:35,133
So becoming a publisher made a lot of sense for them.

1069
00:50:35,153 --> 00:50:38,254
Kongregate, Miniclip, and Armor Games are some of the bigger ones

1070
00:50:38,294 --> 00:50:39,815
that turned into publishers as well.

1071
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:43,880
And Flash continues to slowly get phased out.

1072
00:50:44,081 --> 00:50:48,644
We continue to see first banner ads were starting to slow down

1073
00:50:48,664 --> 00:50:51,166
and then we start seeing ads getting paused.

1074
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:53,667
Soon games will be clicked to start.

1075
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,129
There's been this slow progression

1076
00:50:56,169 --> 00:51:00,212
of Flash functionalities becoming less functional.

1077
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:06,878
So now that we're in 2017, what have we learned from all this?

1078
00:51:07,058 --> 00:51:10,402
What has everything we've done since 1998 really taught us?

1079
00:51:10,622 --> 00:51:12,465
And what has Flash Games really done for us?

1080
00:51:13,586 --> 00:51:15,168
We learned that ubiquity is incredible.

1081
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:18,352
We learned that being able to put your games anywhere

1082
00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:21,596
for anyone to be played across the world

1083
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:23,077
is an incredible experience.

1084
00:51:24,605 --> 00:51:26,688
Spending time porting, getting your game ready,

1085
00:51:27,108 --> 00:51:28,991
doing all that is a lot of work,

1086
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:31,814
but being able to export once and get your game everywhere

1087
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:35,078
is an amazing thing, and we haven't had a technology

1088
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:36,620
reach that level of ubiquity yet.

1089
00:51:39,493 --> 00:51:41,074
Through Flash, we learned that sharing culture

1090
00:51:41,114 --> 00:51:41,894
is really important.

1091
00:51:42,034 --> 00:51:43,295
Being engaged with your users,

1092
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:44,835
being engaged with other developers,

1093
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,716
trying things you're not willing to try

1094
00:51:47,116 --> 00:51:48,516
with people you haven't met before,

1095
00:51:48,956 --> 00:51:50,177
but that you really want to work with,

1096
00:51:50,657 --> 00:51:52,458
and then sharing your work with others.

1097
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:54,958
It's a really important part of being a game developer,

1098
00:51:55,138 --> 00:51:57,199
and it's a really important part about being creative

1099
00:51:57,699 --> 00:51:58,960
and thinking outside the box

1100
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,440
and being comfortable with what you do.

1101
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:03,921
We learned what it meant to be an indie.

1102
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:04,961
We learned that...

1103
00:52:06,044 --> 00:52:07,767
We learned that the modern indie game scene

1104
00:52:07,787 --> 00:52:09,129
was really influenced by Flash,

1105
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:11,473
and we saw that we could make money to eat,

1106
00:52:11,553 --> 00:52:13,315
we could become business owners,

1107
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:14,878
we learned how to do taxes,

1108
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,301
we made quirky little games,

1109
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:19,745
and we ran our own businesses,

1110
00:52:19,785 --> 00:52:21,328
and we were innovative, and we embraced it.

1111
00:52:24,202 --> 00:52:26,322
We set a precedence on how game developers

1112
00:52:26,362 --> 00:52:27,363
and their games should be treated.

1113
00:52:27,763 --> 00:52:29,003
We thought about our relationships

1114
00:52:29,023 --> 00:52:31,304
with publishers and sponsors and how it used to be awful.

1115
00:52:31,424 --> 00:52:32,424
We found a middle ground.

1116
00:52:32,464 --> 00:52:33,725
We found a way to work together.

1117
00:52:34,245 --> 00:52:37,966
We found a commonplace way for really great content

1118
00:52:38,006 --> 00:52:40,507
to be featured so that it was a symbiotic relationship.

1119
00:52:41,307 --> 00:52:42,308
We were collaborative.

1120
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:43,888
We weren't aggressive towards each other.

1121
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:47,750
And we continue not to talk about

1122
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,150
Flash's impact on games enough.

1123
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,936
I feel like that under the stigma of Flash,

1124
00:52:51,996 --> 00:52:54,938
we really don't give it the chance to breathe

1125
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:56,039
and to talk about games.

1126
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:59,601
Or being here right now is a privilege for me,

1127
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:01,222
because I get to talk about Flash games.

1128
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:03,563
And we just do not talk about it enough.

1129
00:53:03,703 --> 00:53:06,925
And I have a constant fear that Flash games one day

1130
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:09,767
won't be with us, that we'll lose millions of games

1131
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:11,288
because browser support will end,

1132
00:53:11,808 --> 00:53:13,689
or that we won't remember all the important things

1133
00:53:13,709 --> 00:53:14,830
that Flash games have given us.

1134
00:53:16,598 --> 00:53:20,861
And the reality is that ubiquity is going to die with flash if we don't find ways to

1135
00:53:21,442 --> 00:53:25,465
encourage our platforms that we work with now to try to reach ubiquity faster.

1136
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:29,495
Flash games have pushed indie games forward

1137
00:53:29,515 --> 00:53:30,235
in a really big way.

1138
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:31,756
It's a big part of our history.

1139
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:36,938
And it's always lived in the shadow of the indie game movie

1140
00:53:37,038 --> 00:53:39,979
and the uprising of the modern indie,

1141
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:41,399
which is a really great story

1142
00:53:41,439 --> 00:53:43,220
and is a really great part of our industry.

1143
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,321
But it's important to look back just one further

1144
00:53:46,361 --> 00:53:47,281
and look at Flash games.

1145
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:50,343
But ultimately the thing we need to really focus on

1146
00:53:50,483 --> 00:53:51,984
are the things that we're gonna lose with Flash

1147
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:54,326
and making sure that in the future we have these things

1148
00:53:54,646 --> 00:53:56,928
for ourselves but also for the future generation

1149
00:53:56,948 --> 00:53:58,448
of developers that come after us.

1150
00:53:58,929 --> 00:53:59,969
Those things like community,

1151
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,931
working together with other developers,

1152
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:03,252
showing your game, being.

1153
00:54:04,352 --> 00:54:06,734
feeling like you can do that in a way that's productive

1154
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:09,016
and working with players to make sure your games are fun.

1155
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:11,177
Accessibility, making sure that everyone

1156
00:54:11,218 --> 00:54:13,699
can get to your games, making sure that your games

1157
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,761
are not only accessible to the players

1158
00:54:15,801 --> 00:54:17,102
that are playing at the library,

1159
00:54:17,142 --> 00:54:19,944
but are also maybe playing on their phone or somewhere else.

1160
00:54:20,945 --> 00:54:23,866
Rapid innovation, the ability to just game jam,

1161
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:25,166
to just make stuff.

1162
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:26,707
That's the most important thing you can do

1163
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,068
as game developers is to make.

1164
00:54:28,728 --> 00:54:30,889
And rapid innovation, rapid iteration,

1165
00:54:31,169 --> 00:54:32,649
getting your games up is so important.

1166
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:35,270
And of course, ubiquity, the ability to be anywhere

1167
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,971
and everywhere that you could ever, ever want to be

1168
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:39,392
with your game is so important.

1169
00:54:39,512 --> 00:54:42,573
And these are the things we need to chase as an industry

1170
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,634
and these are the things that are really, really important

1171
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:46,615
for us to support.

1172
00:54:46,635 --> 00:54:49,476
And that's it.

1173
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:06,462
Thank you guys.

1174
00:55:06,863 --> 00:55:09,366
I have a few things to remind everyone about.

1175
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,628
Please fill out your surveys.

1176
00:55:12,148 --> 00:55:13,230
It's really good feedback for me.

1177
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,092
This is my first time talking at GDC,

1178
00:55:15,152 --> 00:55:16,873
so I'd love your feedback.

1179
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:22,883
I also wanted to point out that if you want to talk to me after

1180
00:55:22,923 --> 00:55:26,184
this talk, there's a meeting area right outside the hall that

1181
00:55:26,204 --> 00:55:31,486
I would be happy to meet you guys at. And I think that's it.

1182
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:36,147
So I think I have like two minutes, so maybe two questions.

1183
00:55:39,528 --> 00:55:39,788
Go ahead.

1184
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:45,060
Thanks, Joan. That was a fantastic and very bittersweet lecture.

1185
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:50,105
So my name is Mark. I have been making flash games for about 8 to 10 years.

1186
00:55:50,525 --> 00:55:54,168
And my question is more specifically on Kongregate on the user side.

1187
00:55:54,828 --> 00:55:57,491
So that graph was very informative. It seemed like...

1188
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:04,813
sure HTML5 was spiking and the swift was declining slightly. But what is the demographic of

1189
00:56:04,913 --> 00:56:11,294
congregate on the web? How do they feel about flash games? Like do they play a flash game

1190
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:14,975
still and they're happy about it or they're like the media press that think flash games are

1191
00:56:15,115 --> 00:56:20,897
evil and they avoid them. So I'm curious to hear your thoughts of what the congregate user

1192
00:56:20,917 --> 00:56:21,817
base thinks of flash now.

1193
00:56:21,997 --> 00:56:23,258
Yeah, the reality is that...

1194
00:56:24,302 --> 00:56:28,224
The reality is that Flash games that were made 15 years ago

1195
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:29,004
still work today.

1196
00:56:29,524 --> 00:56:32,305
And a lot of the games on our site still function just the

1197
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:34,806
way they did 15 years ago, which is pretty amazing,

1198
00:56:34,866 --> 00:56:36,627
especially as a developer being able to look at.

1199
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,528
I uploaded my first game to Kongregate and Newgrounds.

1200
00:56:39,808 --> 00:56:42,389
And man, it's an awful game, but it still works.

1201
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:43,689
And players.

1202
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:51,585
What we've realized on Kongregate is that players who want to play the games that they're coming there to play will actually go and

1203
00:56:52,385 --> 00:56:54,406
whatever way they have to, go and play those games.

1204
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:55,806
When we saw...

1205
00:56:56,638 --> 00:57:00,259
the Unity web player start to get pulled out of Chrome, we

1206
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:03,300
saw a shift of about 10% to 20% of our users switching over to

1207
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,801
Firefox so that they could still engage with the Unity web

1208
00:57:05,821 --> 00:57:06,362
player games.

1209
00:57:07,262 --> 00:57:08,843
Players want to play this content.

1210
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:11,424
Players have voiced that they're nostalgic about this

1211
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:11,844
content.

1212
00:57:11,884 --> 00:57:15,225
Now that games are much older, maybe they started playing

1213
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:17,186
these games and it inspired them to be a developer.

1214
00:57:17,606 --> 00:57:21,147
So developers are really still excited about this content.

1215
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:22,568
They're still excited about Flash games.

1216
00:57:22,608 --> 00:57:23,388
They're excited about where.

1217
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:27,029
the future of more 3D titles for web will be going.

1218
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:32,911
For the most part, they are not voicing their anger

1219
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:35,672
towards it as much as they're worried that the developers

1220
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,412
won't be making games in Flash anymore.

1221
00:57:38,173 --> 00:57:38,433
Thank you.

1222
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:39,873
Yep.

1223
00:57:40,013 --> 00:57:41,054
Hi, my name's Matter.

1224
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:43,934
I ran a company making Flash games and animations

1225
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:45,795
every two weeks for seven years.

1226
00:57:45,815 --> 00:57:47,295
So that was where I started.

1227
00:57:47,475 --> 00:57:49,576
This year I'm a speaker talking about your play stuff.

1228
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:50,936
Which is great fun.

1229
00:57:52,105 --> 00:57:58,309
One of the things that really struck me about flash games a decade ago, especially in the George W. Bush era,

1230
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:04,934
was how many developers were using flash games and gameplay mechanics as a form of political commentary.

1231
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:13,740
And I would love to see a talk later on, maybe next year or something like that, about political commentary through flash games.

1232
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,441
Yeah, sure.

1233
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:18,075
People like that idea apparently.

1234
00:58:19,515 --> 00:58:22,616
So what do you think the future is of games?

1235
00:58:22,676 --> 00:58:24,597
Because there was such an easy on ramp

1236
00:58:24,637 --> 00:58:25,877
to making games with Flash.

1237
00:58:26,638 --> 00:58:30,079
Do you think there's a future of political games that would

1238
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:31,420
never be picked up by a publisher?

1239
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,081
Is there a platform where people can do this as a future,

1240
00:58:34,101 --> 00:58:34,541
do you think?

1241
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:37,322
As long as the web is an open marketplace where we're all

1242
00:58:38,122 --> 00:58:39,883
able to access it in the same way

1243
00:58:39,903 --> 00:58:42,764
that we do now, that there's not any sense of.

1244
00:58:43,584 --> 00:58:46,207
Some people get priority over the internet over others.

1245
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:48,569
I think as long as we have that, we'll continue to have

1246
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:52,492
a place where we can create games without the struggle of a

1247
00:58:52,913 --> 00:58:54,474
platform saying, no, you can't do that.

1248
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:56,936
The ability to upload our own games to our own websites.

1249
00:58:57,036 --> 00:58:59,519
I think it's incredibly important that the web stays

1250
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:02,041
open and that it continues to be a place where we can voice

1251
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,382
our opinions through our titles.

1252
00:59:07,606 --> 00:59:08,447
I might have time for one more.

1253
00:59:09,643 --> 00:59:11,164
Hi, my name is Judd, I'm a journalist.

1254
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:16,447
You voiced a fear earlier that Flash games would disappear and not be preserved,

1255
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:19,429
even though they're an integral part of the history of indie games.

1256
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:26,232
Are you aware of any efforts to preserve and maintain an archive of Flash games in a playable form?

1257
00:59:26,732 --> 00:59:30,014
Is that logistically feasible, and is there anything that Kongregate can do to help that?

1258
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,241
Yeah, it's something that we've talked about internally,

1259
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,563
about what will be the future of Flash games.

1260
00:59:35,663 --> 00:59:38,124
But we haven't landed on anything.

1261
00:59:38,144 --> 00:59:41,506
And I know that a bunch of various portals and developers

1262
00:59:41,546 --> 00:59:42,987
are also thinking about it as well,

1263
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:44,707
whether it's porting content or moving it

1264
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,448
towards something else.

1265
00:59:46,248 --> 00:59:49,070
I don't think we have a really good plan in place yet.

1266
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:51,771
Emily's looking at the microphone,

1267
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:52,912
who's the CEO of Kongregate.

1268
00:59:56,695 --> 01:00:06,278
on how to preserve Flash.

1269
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:07,478
There's not a good plan yet, but there's a...

1270
01:00:07,498 --> 01:00:08,999
Emily said that she had several meetings this week

1271
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:10,879
on how to preserve Flash, and it's gonna be

1272
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,860
an ongoing conversation on what to do with it.

1273
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,400
Cool.

1274
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,501
All right, I'll be right outside.

1275
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:17,261
Thank you so much, you guys.
