1
00:00:06,117 --> 00:00:07,778
Thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:11,640
There's a lot of people in here and I'm really nervous.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,141
So thank you.

4
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:18,444
All right, so I've been at Riot Games for several years now.

5
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:21,666
And we are the makers of League of Legends,

6
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:26,289
a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena that's

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,390
not working.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,650
No.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,751
Sorry.

10
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:30,271
Here we go.

11
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:30,511
One second.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,061
There we go.

13
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:40,243
All right.

14
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:44,325
We are a no, free to play multiplayer battle,

15
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:45,026
online battle arena.

16
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:49,348
And I can remember about five years ago

17
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:52,790
when Brian Thompson first joined the team as an intern.

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,511
We put him on.

19
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:55,730
Gatekeeper Galio.

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,971
And when we saw his work on Gatekeeper Galio,

21
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:00,193
this shit fucking blew our minds.

22
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,874
This was really good.

23
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:04,235
And it was better than anything that any of us

24
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:07,057
had produced up until then.

25
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:10,260
He was using colors in a way that was much more interesting

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,001
than we had ever done before.

27
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,262
His shapes were more stylized and graphic.

28
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,345
There's actually some semblance of visual hierarchy

29
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,607
where none existed before.

30
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:21,428
And it was communicating gameplay really well

31
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,670
without detracting from the aesthetics.

32
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,414
It was amazing work and we all reacted really poorly to it.

33
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:33,108
We were all mid to senior level artists at the time.

34
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:35,470
And up until then, we were all thinking,

35
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,532
you know, we're doing pretty awesomely.

36
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:39,353
And here comes Brian, this intern,

37
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:41,915
who like blows our shit out of the water,

38
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:44,717
raises the bar completely,

39
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:46,458
and also has no ego about it,

40
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,379
doesn't even realize how amazing he is.

41
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:53,623
So, you know, we all started to feel kind of jealous of him,

42
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:56,125
and it made us question our own capabilities as artists.

43
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,686
We're like, fuck, what are we even doing here?

44
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:05,548
And so rather than recognize that we had this gold mine to learn off of who could teach us and you know

45
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:07,608
Help us get better in our skills

46
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:10,289
instead we distanced ourselves and

47
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:17,711
We put up these walls. We were trying to you know a mask how fragile our little egos were and

48
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:20,272
We kept ourselves. We kept trying to find ways to one-up each other

49
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:26,518
This was the landscape of the team, not because Brian came in.

50
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:28,841
Because Brian came in and was awesome,

51
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:31,764
it just exacerbated what was already there.

52
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:35,709
So we were trying to find ways to differentiate ourselves from each other,

53
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:39,393
prove to one another that we're better than everybody else,

54
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,915
and I was definitely guilty of this.

55
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:44,958
We had a small little side project spinning up,

56
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:48,141
and it was staffed with a superstar animator

57
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:49,262
and a superstar producer,

58
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:51,944
both of which were really well known in the studio.

59
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,946
And they needed some VFX help,

60
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:55,127
and they reached out to me only

61
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:57,428
because they happened to know somebody on the team.

62
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,371
And so I snatched that opportunity for myself immediately

63
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:01,432
without doing the right thing,

64
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:05,715
which would have been to understand the needs of the project.

65
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:09,478
and take it back to the team and figure out

66
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:12,119
who would be the right resource for that project

67
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,061
because it probably would have been Brian.

68
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,223
You saw how amazing his work was in the last slide.

69
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:19,804
And it also would have been a really good opportunity

70
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:22,706
for him as a junior artist by then

71
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,888
to completely own his own project.

72
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,689
A great opportunity for him to learn,

73
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,090
but I took it away from him

74
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,431
because I wasn't thinking about any of that.

75
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,692
I was just thinking about how...

76
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:36,034
this project was going to make me feel more special and above everybody else.

77
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:37,135
And that is how I felt.

78
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:41,157
And it, you know, continued to exacerbate that competitiveness

79
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:43,919
and underlying animosity on the team.

80
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,991
Another thing that we were really good at

81
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:50,672
was we would blame failures on individuals

82
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:54,514
rather than look at failures like they're team failures.

83
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,755
So when we were working on Lucian,

84
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,816
which by the way, it shipped like three years ago,

85
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:01,737
so this toxicity on the team persisted for two years,

86
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:02,637
maybe more than that.

87
00:04:03,837 --> 00:04:05,458
When we were working on Lucian,

88
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,979
we would have our regular feedback sessions,

89
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,460
but we had a very weak feedback culture.

90
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,282
So people weren't asking for specific feedback,

91
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:15,503
and we didn't take the time

92
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:19,124
to give actionable, quality feedback to others.

93
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:22,926
And on top of which, the artist who was working on Lucian

94
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:26,968
just had sort of like a standoffish vibe to him,

95
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:29,249
so we didn't try to break through it.

96
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:31,310
And he didn't ask for feedback, we didn't give it to him.

97
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:35,534
Eventually he ships Lucian, more eyes get on it,

98
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:38,838
and we realize that it's not hitting the quality bar.

99
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:41,981
And instead of saying, like, this was a team failure,

100
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,483
you know, we all had eyes on it,

101
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,224
but we didn't do anything to help him,

102
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:47,407
give him the feedback, help him grow.

103
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,229
Instead, we pointed the finger and said,

104
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:50,930
you know, that's the artist that worked on Lucian,

105
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,991
it's his fault, not ours.

106
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:58,023
So this is only three stories, but we do have two years worth

107
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:01,485
of stories that are all of the same vein.

108
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:06,248
And we had become one of the most unhealthy and least liked

109
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:07,468
teams in the entire studio.

110
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:13,014
And working from the inside, you know, that toxicity and unhealthiness,

111
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:15,475
it was really difficult to work in every day.

112
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:18,176
It was starting to get really hard to be a part of it.

113
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:20,517
So something needed to change.

114
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:24,519
And, you know, frankly, I think each one of us had gotten to a point where we were

115
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,340
ready for a change.

116
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,971
But even though we were ready for a change,

117
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:30,992
that change was still going to take a lot of time

118
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:32,393
and hard work.

119
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:35,955
So at this time, the tension on the team was really high.

120
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:39,737
Toxicity and that inability to work well with each other

121
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,638
was at its peak.

122
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:43,580
And that's when Chris joins our team.

123
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,821
And coming from an outside perspective,

124
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:49,863
Chris can immediately see just how toxic the team is.

125
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:56,329
But rather than first take time to build relationships with us so we could get to know him, understand where he's coming from,

126
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:59,732
he immediately, you know, starts pulling us each aside and says,

127
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:04,576
this is the thing you're fucking up on, this is the thing that you suck at, this is what you need to change.

128
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,649
And we didn't know who he was,

129
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:10,451
we didn't understand what his intentions were,

130
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:12,192
so it really rubbed us all the wrong way.

131
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:14,954
We were thinking, who the fuck is this guy?

132
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:18,595
So he immediately lost trust and rapport with each one of us.

133
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:22,998
So feeling at a loss, he turned to a mentor,

134
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:25,499
and this mentor recommended something called Campfire.

135
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:30,715
Campfire is something where everybody kind of sits around,

136
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,898
there's no real agenda for the meeting,

137
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:35,360
and the purpose is to just talk.

138
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,583
The goal being that by talking,

139
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,405
you start to get to know each other,

140
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:41,127
eventually build relationships,

141
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:43,229
maybe you start to actually trust each other enough

142
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:45,311
to air out your differences,

143
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,053
actually talk through your grievances

144
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,935
and get out the other side better for it.

145
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:55,035
But the caveat being don't you dare try to attempt to do campfire

146
00:06:55,035 --> 00:07:01,666
Unless you are ready to take in all the shit that someone might have to say about you and possibly die in that fire if necessary

147
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:06,032
So Chris recommended that we do Campfire,

148
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:08,512
and we all begrudgingly did it.

149
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,233
And the reason why we were so reluctant

150
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:14,214
was because even though deep down we were ready for a change,

151
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:17,074
you know, when we looked at everybody else in the room,

152
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,955
our perceptions of everybody was,

153
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,055
you know, they're kind of egotistical,

154
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:23,096
they're difficult to work with, I don't really like them.

155
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:25,196
So the last thing, you know, I wanted to do

156
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:28,237
was sit in a room for an hour with these people.

157
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:31,337
But, you know, it's kind of the only option on the table,

158
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:32,458
so we did it.

159
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:37,660
And that first meeting came along, an hour passed,

160
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,481
nothing happened, sat in silence, super awkward.

161
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:45,923
So the next week happened and we tried it again.

162
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,164
So another hour passes, sat in silence,

163
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:50,285
nothing happened, super awkward.

164
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:52,806
And then the next week comes

165
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,046
and finally somebody breaks ground.

166
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:57,268
And this person said,

167
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,108
I don't think that anybody in this room respects me.

168
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,521
which is a really hard thing to say

169
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,461
to a room full of people who you don't think respect you.

170
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:09,122
So that moment of vulnerability really snapped us out of it

171
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:12,983
and we immediately started jumping in to explain to him

172
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:16,003
how wrong he was and that we really did respect him.

173
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:18,084
But somebody else said,

174
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,624
you know, the reason why I don't talk to you

175
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,264
is because your work is so intimidating,

176
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:24,145
you make me feel like a shitty artist

177
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:25,765
and so I just avoid you altogether.

178
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:32,389
And one by one, we each just started to word vomit on each other and reveal how we really felt.

179
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:38,892
And it turns out that what we thought was a problem, you know, we originally thought that everybody was egotistical,

180
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,673
they're kind of full of themselves, they're not very nice people.

181
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:43,054
It turns out that that wasn't the problem at all.

182
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:48,820
The real problem was that we were each dealing with so much insecurities,

183
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,803
and we didn't have the tools to understand how to navigate through those insecurities.

184
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:56,666
So the way in which we each reacted was by throwing up walls,

185
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:00,489
putting up this false sense of ego so that we can pretend like we have confidence

186
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:03,732
when we're really just masking how frail we are inside.

187
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:10,334
and to also try to feel like a peer amongst all these other artists who we massively respected.

188
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:14,316
And so it turns out that we were all dealing with a bunch of insecurities.

189
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:16,196
We were coming from the same place.

190
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:19,498
And so when we were finally able to find some common ground,

191
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,818
we could finally take a step forward.

192
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:24,307
which was a huge deal for us because we had never,

193
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:27,150
ever been able to find common ground before.

194
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,512
And who knew that we all suffered from the same problems.

195
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:32,574
And so, you know, at this point,

196
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,757
we're starting to build relationships with each other.

197
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:37,939
Those relationships turn into trust.

198
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:40,301
And eventually, we're actually feeling open

199
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,723
to be vulnerable and share our weaknesses

200
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:43,824
in craft with each other.

201
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,166
Something that could have never happened

202
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,408
in the past old culture.

203
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,408
And at this point in our history,

204
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:53,109
we're also trying to shift the style.

205
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:56,692
So where we were using photorealistic textures,

206
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,994
we're moving into hand-painted textures,

207
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:02,896
where we were, you know, our effects had a lot of high detail,

208
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:05,458
we're moving into large graphic shapes.

209
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:09,181
And also emphasizing the importance of a visual hierarchy

210
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:11,603
where before our effects, you know,

211
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:14,165
the elements in our effects would be fighting against itself.

212
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:20,498
So for one of our artists, Troy, who was an original artist on the team,

213
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:26,921
and he originated the old style, we were essentially asking him to take everything

214
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:30,663
that he's ever known, everything that he's ever done, and just throw it out the window,

215
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:35,025
and try to do something that's completely out of his depth, that's just so foreign to him,

216
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:37,806
which is a very scary proposition for any of us.

217
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:44,852
And we actually did ask him to do this back in the old culture back when it was still toxic and you know a scary

218
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,775
environment where we could you know be vulnerable and

219
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:54,019
When we asked him then he completely rejected the idea and he was really defensive about his work

220
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:58,273
But now that we had started to build relationships and trust

221
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:02,535
and it was OK to be vulnerable, this time when we asked him,

222
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,415
he came to the table.

223
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:07,716
And he was really honest with how he felt and said,

224
00:11:07,716 --> 00:11:08,997
I don't know if I'm ever going to be

225
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:11,298
able to hit this new style because this is something

226
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:13,338
that I've never done before.

227
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:14,519
And it freaks me out.

228
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,499
I don't know if I can get there, but I'll do everything

229
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:17,199
that I can to try.

230
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,781
Which was such an awesome change of attitude.

231
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,382
It was really humbling and it inspired us.

232
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,703
So the rest of us rallied around him

233
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:28,344
and we supported him as best as we could.

234
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:32,126
And that support was really motivating to him.

235
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:35,707
And Troy took the initiative and reached out to Brian

236
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:38,128
and Jin, who I'll talk about later,

237
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:40,670
both who were junior artists at the time.

238
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,272
him being a senior, he didn't care,

239
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:45,715
he was just really excited to learn off of them.

240
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:47,437
And they were really honored to be able

241
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:49,380
to teach him their skills.

242
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,501
And soon enough.

243
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:54,029
Much to especially Troy's surprise.

244
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,051
You know, Troy didn't know if he was ever going

245
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:57,693
to move away from this style.

246
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:01,116
To him, this was what he had been doing forever.

247
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:04,259
He felt like he was an old dog with old tricks.

248
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:06,621
He didn't know if he could do anything more than this.

249
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:10,065
But incrementally, he was able to slowly move

250
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:11,866
closer to the new style.

251
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,808
And the thing that freaked Troy out the most

252
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:15,890
was whether he would be able to hand paint his textures.

253
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:20,752
And he wasn't sure if he'd be able to do it,

254
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:22,873
and he didn't want to feel stupid,

255
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:24,793
you know, making a texture and if it failed.

256
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:26,494
But now in this new culture

257
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:28,775
where we were becoming more supportive

258
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,975
and we were okay with failures,

259
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,236
you know, Troy felt comfortable

260
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,677
to try hand painting textures,

261
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:35,997
and then, you know, fail at it,

262
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:38,418
and then learn from those failures and try again.

263
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:40,358
Again, something that could have never happened

264
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,059
in the old style, or in the old culture.

265
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:47,883
So at this point, learning becomes a really big part of our culture.

266
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:50,146
We care a lot about learning.

267
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:51,308
Learning from anybody.

268
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:54,231
It doesn't matter if you're learning from an intern or a junior.

269
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:58,557
Everybody has something that they can teach someone else.

270
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:01,641
That's really the thing that we started to focus on.

271
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:03,022
And so at this point.

272
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:06,110
Jin joins the team as a junior artist.

273
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,491
And pretty immediately, we throw him out into the deep

274
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,632
end and have him working on new champions.

275
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:14,453
And for those of you unfamiliar, we frequently

276
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,174
patch new content to the game.

277
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:20,736
And sometimes that new content is a new champion, which is

278
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:21,556
unique to the game.

279
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:25,198
And so the artist who works on that new champion is

280
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:27,999
responsible for creating a whole new suite of effects

281
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:30,140
that's completely unique to that champion to the game.

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,241
And some would argue, and some did argue,

283
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:37,364
that that kind of work requires a level of autonomy

284
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:41,287
and creativity that should only be reserved

285
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,909
for a senior artist, and that a junior like Jin

286
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,891
should work in that senior's shadow

287
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:49,492
so that they can learn incrementally and slowly.

288
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:52,254
But that's something that I call bullshit on

289
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:55,256
because I truly believe in trial by fire.

290
00:13:55,962 --> 00:14:01,267
that everybody deserves the chance to own something really huge and demonstrate to the

291
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:04,350
rest of us that they actually do have the capabilities to get there.

292
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,733
And of course we would support him along the way, we wouldn't just throw him in the deep

293
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:13,558
end without a life preserver or some swimming lessons, but the point is giving him the opportunity

294
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:16,380
to really own it and demonstrate that he can get there.

295
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:19,984
So we stocked up our guns and we kept them there.

296
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,167
And Jin worked on Atrox.

297
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:23,448
This was his first champion ever.

298
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:27,572
This was probably the worst new champion any junior artist

299
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:31,457
could work on because Atrox is a darkened character.

300
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:33,899
And up until this moment, there was no such thing in our

301
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,142
universe that is darkened.

302
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,424
In fact, I don't think there is darkened that exists

303
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:39,085
outside of Atrox.

304
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:44,008
And you know, had we started Jhin on an Ionian champion,

305
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,151
Jhin could have at least looked at the other Ionian champions,

306
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:50,813
pulled references and used those as resources.

307
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:53,575
But for Aatrox, all he knew was

308
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:55,797
it can't look like anything else in the game.

309
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:57,398
Which is a pretty broad spectrum.

310
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:57,458
And...

311
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,560
In my opinion, I think that he really knocked it out of the park.

312
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,304
I know Jin's sitting right there, he's cringing at this slide and he probably

313
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:10,806
is really mad that I keep staying on this.

314
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:15,869
But to me, a junior artist, you know, working on such an ambiguous problem,

315
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:19,852
I think he did a really great job. He was really bold with his color, his use of color.

316
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:24,456
You know, he was creative with his meshes. The gameplay reads really well.

317
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,923
And so we were impressed with Jin's work,

318
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:29,425
and we kept him on New Champions,

319
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:33,128
and we kept challenging him with big challenges.

320
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:36,192
So, you know, as time progresses,

321
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,454
champions become more challenging,

322
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:41,817
the gameplay becomes more complicated and sophisticated.

323
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,914
And Jin continues to step up to the plate.

324
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:51,278
Because Jin is who he is, he continues to try and challenge

325
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,380
himself to do better than his previous champions.

326
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,323
So his use of color becomes more deep, more interesting.

327
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:01,766
His meshes also become more creative, more interesting.

328
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,607
He's constantly leveling himself up one

329
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:05,189
champion at a time.

330
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:09,012
And in just one year, Jin went from a junior to a senior.

331
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:13,225
And now as our principal artist on League,

332
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:16,307
Jin uses the same method of mentorship

333
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,569
in which he challenges others

334
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,290
with seemingly larger than life challenges.

335
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,912
He trusts in their capabilities

336
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:25,534
more so than they trust in themselves.

337
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,935
He supports their development along the way,

338
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:30,897
but he really allows them to own the big challenge

339
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,459
so that they can own the big win.

340
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:37,981
And in fact, Jin believes in this way of mentorship so much so that he takes it to the next level.

341
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:43,403
Because Jin truly believes that every single person, no matter what level you're at, intern,

342
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:48,205
junior, doesn't matter, that everybody possesses some strength that's unique to them that they

343
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:49,865
can teach to others.

344
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:53,246
And so Jin doesn't even call it mentorship, he calls it a knowledge swap.

345
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:59,708
And whoever he does mentor is challenged with having to teach him back something else.

346
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,389
Not to be facetious, but because he truly believes that they can make him better.

347
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,791
And so now, at this point, our culture has totally shifted.

348
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:11,251
We're all about learning and learning through feedback.

349
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:14,792
You know, we continue to cultivate our relationships.

350
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:18,253
We continue to value vulnerability.

351
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:22,115
And so now these parts of our culture are starting to creep into everything else that

352
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:22,415
we do.

353
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:26,292
So when Jason applies for Riot,

354
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:31,754
Jason applied for a motion graphics position

355
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:34,916
because he was a 2D flash animator at the time.

356
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,637
And even though he wasn't right for that role,

357
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:39,858
the motion graphics lead came and showed me

358
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,139
Jason's application because we were just nerding out

359
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:44,659
on his flash work, it was really awesome.

360
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,441
So I decided to give Jason a call.

361
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,704
He hadn't applied for the real-time VFX position,

362
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,945
but honestly, I just wanted to meet another artist

363
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:56,027
and tell him that I really admired his work.

364
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:57,167
So I gave him a call,

365
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,829
and that conversation was really awesome.

366
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,690
He asked me lots of great questions.

367
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,832
We ended up talking about real-time VFX,

368
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,374
and he was intrigued by it,

369
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:09,235
and it was something that he wanted to try

370
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:12,037
and challenge himself and learn more.

371
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:17,085
But he was really honest about his capabilities as an artist

372
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:20,791
and also honest about his reservations of, you know,

373
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,396
sinking time into something that seems pretty

374
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:24,898
out of his league, at least at the time.

375
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,989
And his honesty, his vulnerability,

376
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:30,992
also his commitment to challenging himself

377
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:32,513
really resonated with me.

378
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,696
So I also wanted to give him a shot.

379
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,719
So we left that conversation with an understanding

380
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:41,463
that Jason was going to teach himself real-time VFX,

381
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:44,666
and I gave him our test so that he would have something

382
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,487
to shoot towards.

383
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:48,894
And throughout this time, we were corresponding.

384
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,877
He would ask me some questions.

385
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:54,200
I would send him any tutorials that I could find.

386
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,424
And eventually, he sends in his first test, the first

387
00:18:58,424 --> 00:19:03,129
iteration of the test, in 3D, along with the 2D flash

388
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,531
animated version, so that I could see what

389
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:06,172
he was trying to do.

390
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:10,355
Now clearly the 3D version still needs a lot of work.

391
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:12,596
You know, the timing's kind of linear.

392
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:13,637
The colors are all the same.

393
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:15,257
The shapes are very obvious.

394
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:17,838
But I was really impressed that he even got this far.

395
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:20,920
He taught himself to do this in a short amount of time.

396
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,821
And I was also impressed with his vulnerability

397
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,642
with even being able to show me this.

398
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:29,203
Because the 2D version is so fucking awesome.

399
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:33,066
And then he was, so I know he has taste as an artist.

400
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:35,847
And he was willing to show me this other version,

401
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,928
which clearly isn't quite the same.

402
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,670
So all of those things, again, his vulnerability,

403
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,252
his commitment to his own growth and development,

404
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:46,053
his openness to feedback, all of these things

405
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,234
really resonated with the whole team.

406
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,455
And so we gave him feedback, told him what was

407
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,396
and wasn't working, how he might be able

408
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:55,878
to technically achieve in 3D what he was doing in 2D,

409
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:57,219
and he went back at it.

410
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,301
And the next iteration was much better, and each iteration just kept on getting better.

411
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:08,285
So we learned enough about Jason to really understand who he is, his motivations, and

412
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:12,847
most importantly, his potential, and that he would be worth bringing in to teach from

413
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:13,808
the ground up.

414
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,359
But that decision was met with opposition

415
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,463
because the question was, why would we bring someone in

416
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:23,045
and sink time and resources into

417
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:25,086
when we could use that amount of time

418
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:28,189
to go and find some other artist like a senior artist

419
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,451
and that person can come in and hit the ground running?

420
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:35,986
But based on our history, we knew that craft wasn't the most

421
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:36,727
important thing to us.

422
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:41,188
We knew how difficult it was for us to cultivate this

423
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:45,249
culture of being open to feedback, vulnerability,

424
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,529
commitment to your own growth and development.

425
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,249
And we saw all of those things in Jason immediately,

426
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,770
something that was really hard for us

427
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,690
to cultivate on the team.

428
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,751
And so because of the testing process and we learned all of

429
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:59,992
these things about Jason, it was very easy to dig our heels

430
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:00,752
in and fight for him.

431
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,757
And some of you may know that we ended up hiring Jason.

432
00:21:04,757 --> 00:21:07,541
And in just three years, he went from an artist

433
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,924
who knew nearly nothing about real-time VFX

434
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:14,410
into one who actively mentors nearly every VFX artist

435
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,574
in the studio, and also mentors students

436
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:19,536
and artists in the industry.

437
00:21:20,257 --> 00:21:23,141
And had we been in our old culture,

438
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:25,124
we would have never hired Jason.

439
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:26,827
We would have looked at, you know,

440
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,289
that first version of the test,

441
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:31,054
and we would have thought, not good enough, fuck him.

442
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:34,166
And in fact, when I think about that,

443
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,569
I think about all the other amazing artists

444
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:41,332
with massive potential that we passed up on

445
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:44,374
because back then we weren't in a place

446
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:46,856
where we realized that attributes,

447
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,837
other things that artists bring to the table

448
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:50,198
are just important as craft.

449
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:54,809
And so I can really attribute the growth and evolution

450
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:58,992
of the style and our work to the growth

451
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:01,054
and evolution of our culture.

452
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,676
In fact, at this point when we were working on A-RAM,

453
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:05,497
that was the first real inflection point

454
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:06,518
in the change of our style.

455
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:09,900
And that's actually when we had started doing campfires.

456
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,542
And from there, we were building trust, relationships,

457
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:15,364
building a supportive learning environment.

458
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:18,807
And from then on, we've been able to grow and level up

459
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,108
our work and our style ever since.

460
00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:25,105
And so now this is the new status quo

461
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:27,426
of the culture of the team.

462
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:28,966
This is who we are.

463
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:32,807
We very much value relationships, trust,

464
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:36,128
vulnerability, and learning.

465
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:39,329
In fact, learning is such a big part of our culture

466
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,729
now that it's a responsibility.

467
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:44,010
It's like an expectation of your job.

468
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,350
So artists like Chris, Jin, Jason, Brian,

469
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,731
they are all expected to give back and teach what they know.

470
00:22:52,372 --> 00:23:00,056
all while continuing to cultivate this environment of support,

471
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:03,378
that it's safe to be vulnerable about your weaknesses.

472
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:08,120
And I know that I'm painting a really rosy picture of how everything is so awesome,

473
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,902
but it wasn't an easy one, two, three step for us.

474
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:14,844
It was a long, arduous, and emotional journey,

475
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:17,005
and one that we continue to work at every day.

476
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,907
In fact, three years later, we still do campfires.

477
00:23:19,907 --> 00:23:23,148
It's something that we've been doing every week since.

478
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:26,690
Because we know what a pivotal moment this was for us

479
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,572
and how important it is for us to continue to cultivate

480
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:33,274
relationships and trust and vulnerability with each other.

481
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:37,015
And now that actually our team is scaled,

482
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,556
and it's a pretty large team, so we're

483
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:41,256
sprinkled across the entire studio.

484
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:43,737
We don't sit next to each other anymore.

485
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:47,638
We sit next to, we are separated by buildings.

486
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:50,259
And then because of the projects we work on,

487
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,244
There are barriers between some of us, between projects as well.

488
00:23:54,244 --> 00:23:59,612
In this new landscape, it is even more critically important to continue to bring the artists

489
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:04,980
back in and continue to cultivate our culture through relationships and trust building.

490
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:09,462
And we are now using campfires to share knowledge,

491
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:11,262
teach each other.

492
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:14,023
At times we share our challenges with each other,

493
00:24:14,023 --> 00:24:16,523
and even if nobody else in the room

494
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,344
is experiencing the same challenge,

495
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:20,784
we get together as a group,

496
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:23,285
we help that artist brainstorm,

497
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:26,546
and we help them find a solution to their challenge.

498
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:29,286
And by doing so, we are able to demonstrate

499
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:31,267
just how important relationships, trust,

500
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:34,047
vulnerability learning is to the health

501
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:35,168
and culture of the team.

502
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:40,393
And so, even though this is something that we work at every day,

503
00:24:40,393 --> 00:24:43,816
that in a nutshell is how we were able to turn our toxic team environment

504
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:44,937
into what it is today.

505
00:24:44,937 --> 00:24:45,217
Thank you.

506
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,078
Thanks, guys.

507
00:24:58,636 --> 00:25:02,881
I know that I had a lot of time and I sort of blew through it.

508
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,964
Or there's still a lot of time left.

509
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:07,567
So if anybody has questions, that'd be awesome.

510
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,850
If nobody has questions, that's also awesome.

511
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,832
Super happy to get off the stage as well.

512
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,399
Yes, hi.

513
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:16,460
Sorry, I'm gonna keep you there.

514
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,642
So you mentioned that the team has now grown

515
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:21,623
and it's spread out,

516
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:23,163
and I'm assuming there are new people coming on.

517
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:25,384
You know, you kind of ramp up.

518
00:25:25,384 --> 00:25:29,967
How do you deal with new people coming into this culture

519
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,367
of say, dealing with campfires

520
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:34,569
or getting comfortable with that?

521
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:38,211
And have you had people that are resistant to it?

522
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:39,311
And how would you deal with that?

523
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:47,541
Yeah, so because we have such a long history of sort of building this really fortified

524
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:53,003
membrane of our culture, we very much know what we're looking for in artists.

525
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:56,443
And we have a pretty rigorous hiring process.

526
00:25:56,443 --> 00:26:01,325
And so those attributes are actually attributes that we look for when we're hiring.

527
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:05,606
In fact, we have panels specifically targeting those attributes.

528
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,550
And so, first off, coming into the door,

529
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,678
we already know that they should feel more open

530
00:26:13,678 --> 00:26:14,980
to wanting to build relationships.

531
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,524
And then secondly, because when people are new,

532
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:19,627
the first thing that they wanna do is make relationships

533
00:26:19,627 --> 00:26:21,049
and friends in their new office.

534
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,832
And so we're very on top of, you know,

535
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,693
making sure whenever new artists come in,

536
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:28,175
we grab them and put them into campfire.

537
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:31,237
And our campfires are once, are every Monday.

538
00:26:31,237 --> 00:26:34,619
And so that's kind of where we start to, you know,

539
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:38,322
they get to at least meet other people in the studio.

540
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:41,144
And so far we really haven't had a problem

541
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,765
getting people into the culture

542
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:45,467
because we have a really rigorous hiring process.

543
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,508
And then we, you know, make sure to grab them

544
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:49,910
and start to get them into the culture immediately.

545
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:51,638
So.

546
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:52,558
Thank you.

547
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:52,718
Yeah, sure.

548
00:26:52,718 --> 00:26:52,778
Hi.

549
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:52,938
Hi there.

550
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:58,260
Thanks for the great presentation, love it.

551
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,140
My question would be, how were you able

552
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,501
or have the other art departments sort of liaison with you

553
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,702
to try to spread this sort of, you know,

554
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:08,442
great group cohesion and exercises

555
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:10,003
to their other art departments?

556
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:11,545
Yeah, we have actually.

557
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:15,650
So the tech art group within Riot

558
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,893
also was suffering sort of through the same things

559
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:19,554
as we were.

560
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,477
They were sort of a disjointed group

561
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:24,839
because tech artists,

562
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:27,222
they all have really different kinds of skills.

563
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:29,264
And so it was difficult for them

564
00:27:29,264 --> 00:27:30,986
to sort of find that common ground.

565
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:32,767
And we did the same thing.

566
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,688
We recommended that they do campfire

567
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:37,350
and we also offered to facilitate for them.

568
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,652
But actually, campfire, those kinds of meetings

569
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:42,174
are most powerful when it's only the people

570
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,335
in the room who matter.

571
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:46,717
Like, having a facilitator just sort of makes it feel

572
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:49,179
like you've got a therapist in the room.

573
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:51,140
And so, yeah, they started doing campfires as well.

574
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,102
And they've actually also been able

575
00:27:54,102 --> 00:27:56,304
to turn over their culture.

576
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:58,806
So it's a pretty powerful tool, guys.

577
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:00,707
Would really recommend that you try it.

578
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:04,148
So yes, we have shared, and we've really shared this

579
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:06,369
with anybody who wants to know about it.

580
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:07,509
Okay, awesome, thanks.

581
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:07,889
Yeah.

582
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:10,250
Hi, that was a really cool talk, Ansela.

583
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:10,990
Thank you.

584
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,071
My question is, having hired people

585
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:17,312
that haven't come from a background

586
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:22,354
doing real-time VFX, just the process of optimization,

587
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:24,175
to be able to get that stuff running properly,

588
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:26,655
how hard is it to teach that kind of thing

589
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:28,576
to someone that comes from a completely different background?

590
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,421
You mean like teaching them the technical skills,

591
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:33,502
like knowing when to optimize and how to optimize?

592
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:34,262
Yeah, exactly.

593
00:28:34,262 --> 00:28:36,383
That kind of stuff?

594
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,965
I think if you guys were here earlier for Keith's talk,

595
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:41,906
Keith and Drew, there's always going to be

596
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:43,367
some kind of ramp up.

597
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:46,069
You know, like every studio uses different tools.

598
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:48,190
Every studio has different parameters

599
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,471
for optimization as well.

600
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:52,632
So there is kind of this like two month ramp up time

601
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:53,273
for everybody.

602
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:59,197
But as long as a person is open to learning

603
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:02,760
and they understand that it's going to be different

604
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,341
at every studio, they do understand

605
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:06,582
that it's important to optimize,

606
00:29:06,582 --> 00:29:07,863
we found that it's not difficult

607
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:09,305
to actually teach those things.

608
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:12,167
They're just like technical tools.

609
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,969
But as long as you have the frame of mind

610
00:29:15,969 --> 00:29:17,911
of you know that you need to optimize your work,

611
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:21,213
then how you do it isn't so hard to teach,

612
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:21,894
if that makes sense.

613
00:29:22,314 --> 00:29:23,255
Cool, thank you.

614
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:23,696
Thank you.

615
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:29,842
Hi, so you were talking about there are certain attributes that you look for during your hiring

616
00:29:29,842 --> 00:29:35,549
process and there are certain attributes that you saw in Jason that made him appealing to

617
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:38,772
be hired for that kind of thing.

618
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:41,756
I guess with that understanding, are there...

619
00:29:43,604 --> 00:29:48,426
Are there tangible or certain things that you do

620
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:53,388
to try to look for those attributes, if that makes sense?

621
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:55,429
Or is it just kind of like a gut feeling,

622
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:58,030
like, oh, this feels right as far as,

623
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,091
basically, how do you get those attributes

624
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:04,132
to be something tangible that you can kind of communicate

625
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:06,813
to other people and be like, this person's a good fit

626
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:08,233
because of this, this, and this?

627
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,825
Yeah, I would say that it's really,

628
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:15,250
it takes time to learn how to dig into attributes,

629
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,733
especially when you're interviewing somebody

630
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,533
for like an hour.

631
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:21,617
You know, somebody can put their best foot forward

632
00:30:21,617 --> 00:30:25,321
for an hour or even for like a whole day of interviews.

633
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:27,243
It's pretty easy to mask who you really are.

634
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:34,228
And so for the testing process, I really recommend finding a way to define your attributes that

635
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:36,830
you're looking for and find a way to test for that.

636
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,334
So for us, the way that we're able to dig into that is by doing rounds of feedback.

637
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:45,217
Because through those rounds, you understand, can this person take feedback?

638
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:46,978
Do they have an ego about their work?

639
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,479
Do they know how to apply feedback?

640
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,000
Can they ask questions back to me?

641
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,581
Can they even challenge me on my feedback?

642
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:54,644
Which is like that part if a person isn't challenges

643
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,604
It's not like a test

644
00:30:55,604 --> 00:31:01,529
But my point being by being able to find a way to just spend a little bit more time with that person to understand

645
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:08,834
Who they really are I think that is the most powerful way for us to try and dig into attributes rather than just

646
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,256
Trying to interview somebody for an hour

647
00:31:11,256 --> 00:31:12,456
Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome

648
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:25,646
I'm just wondering the hierarchy in your office like the way that the structure is at riot. Did they allow

649
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:29,369
For this kind of thing to happen or did you guys kind of have to fight to make this happen?

650
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:34,012
Like there's I worked in the game industry and there's just there's with the way we had it set up

651
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:37,794
It was like this would be very hard to do although totally needed

652
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:42,417
but be very hard to do because the the eye of Sauron's always

653
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:44,831
Yeah, I can definitely relate to that,

654
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:47,215
because I've worked at other studios as well.

655
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:50,341
We are very lucky at Riot in that

656
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:55,432
we're pretty empowered to do as we want to with our time.

657
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:58,614
Because we have a rigorous hiring process,

658
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:00,275
we trust everybody that comes into the door.

659
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:03,256
It's like, we know that you are the kind of person

660
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,798
that we can empower with however it is

661
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:06,878
that you want to spend your time,

662
00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:09,480
because we know that you'll get to the end point,

663
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,920
however it is that you get there.

664
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,002
So we're really lucky that we can work in this way.

665
00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:18,024
And so, that's how we've been able to do

666
00:32:18,024 --> 00:32:20,005
a lot of experimentation, I guess.

667
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:23,669
have meetings where they're not about craft,

668
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:25,611
spend the time to actually mentor each other.

669
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,455
We have wheelie desks, so we kind of like wheel

670
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:30,417
to each other's workstations.

671
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,799
You know, if somebody needs to level up,

672
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,301
we'll have a mentor sit next to a mentee.

673
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:35,423
So we're really lucky in that way.

674
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:41,908
But I think, you know, for those studios where, you know, there is an eye of Sauron, I think

675
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:45,250
that, you know, if there's a need on your team and if there's enough, you know, like

676
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,132
where we were, we were kind of ready for a change.

677
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:52,295
So if you can't do it within work, you know, there's opportunities where you can go out

678
00:32:52,295 --> 00:32:56,418
for lunch and try to talk, maybe go out for beers and try to talk, but limit the amount

679
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:58,039
of alcohol because it might get a little too hairy.

680
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,724
But there are creative ways that you can try to work around it,

681
00:33:02,724 --> 00:33:07,369
if it is something that you really need to work on.

682
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:11,353
But I do understand. So we are pretty lucky at Riot.

683
00:33:11,353 --> 00:33:13,515
Thanks. Anybody? No?

684
00:33:13,515 --> 00:33:16,238
Cool. Well, thank you very much for coming.
