1
00:00:04,773 --> 00:00:15,939
Alright, let's start. I guess, yes? Okay, let's go. Yeah! Alright, so, um, I'm Dave, uh,

2
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:20,021
creative director on Dead by Daylight. Thank you so much for being here today. Um,

3
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:22,868
This is what we're gonna talk about today.

4
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:26,372
So a little bit of introduction on our studio.

5
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:29,355
Origin story of the game, how it was made,

6
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:32,337
preparing for the release, the live operation.

7
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:34,920
There's a lot to talk about,

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,522
so I had to take some very specific subject,

9
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:41,045
but I think they're key to the success of Dead by Daylight.

10
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:42,227
So, I mean, let's start.

11
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:47,642
So I wanted to present the studio I work for,

12
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:48,682
Behavior Digital.

13
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:50,983
It's part of the story.

14
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:51,483
It's important.

15
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:55,144
You have to know that Behavior Interactive has been

16
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:56,545
operating for 25 years.

17
00:00:57,305 --> 00:01:00,906
And our usual business model is to do work for hire.

18
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:04,627
So we develop the game of others, others' ideas.

19
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:06,147
And this is great.

20
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:10,028
We can work with big publishers, big studios, and

21
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:10,749
learn a lot from them.

22
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:14,030
But we also add our own stories that we wanted to tell.

23
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:18,647
So four years ago, we started a studio within the studio

24
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:19,887
called Behavior Digital.

25
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:24,590
And the goal would be to develop and publish our own titles,

26
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,631
our own stories.

27
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:26,611
And we had this vision.

28
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:29,373
Remarkable games we would play our way.

29
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:33,795
Remarkable as in having a unique appeal

30
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:37,778
that we would play because they would be for us.

31
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:38,718
We would be the market.

32
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:40,379
So hardcore, mature game.

33
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:44,657
And our way, because we would have creative independence,

34
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:46,138
so we would choose our own solution,

35
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:49,359
how we would build this game, or these games.

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,841
So our first project, we had very specific goals.

37
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:55,682
We knew we wanted to do an ore game,

38
00:01:55,842 --> 00:01:58,164
because we're really passionate about this genre.

39
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:01,385
It would be an asymmetrical multiplayer game.

40
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:05,127
That was the unique aspect to the game.

41
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,408
It would be long-lasting.

42
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:09,950
We would aim to keep this game growing and alive

43
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,030
for as long as we could.

44
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,053
and it would introduce a behavior digital to the world, to players.

45
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:19,597
So, a lot of big goals for a first project.

46
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:24,701
And Dead by Daylight is exactly that project.

47
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,923
So, I just want to know if you can raise your hand

48
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:31,386
if you played Dead by Daylight or if you watched Dead by Daylight.

49
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:33,688
Okay, that's great. Thanks.

50
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:39,811
So, just for the benefit of people of the future that might be looking at the video,

51
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:43,238
I'm still going to explain really quickly what the game is, so that we're all on the same page.

52
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,191
Survivor gameplay, right?

53
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:48,313
So it's a asymmetrical multiplayer game,

54
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:51,096
4v1 in a procedural world.

55
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,840
You can play the survivor role or the killer role.

56
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,984
The survivor goal is you spawn into that procedural map,

57
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:00,526
he needs to find five generators, repair them,

58
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:02,208
that will power an exit gate.

59
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,250
They go and activate that gate

60
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:06,032
and escape to live another day.

61
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:10,003
The killer objective is simple, find the survivor,

62
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:12,545
hit them twice to put them on the ground,

63
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,306
pick them up, and bring them to a sacrificial hook

64
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,568
where they're gonna bleed out and be sacrificed

65
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,188
to a giant monster that lives in the sky,

66
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:20,769
which we call the entity.

67
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,330
Simple.

68
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:27,815
We released the game on June 14th, 2016 on Steam

69
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,998
with this offering, so we had three killers at the time,

70
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,721
four survivors, all with their unique perks,

71
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:37,904
a lot of different items with different upgrades.

72
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:40,887
There were two mode, one ranked and one offline

73
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:41,867
called Kill Your Friends.

74
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:47,072
12 maps across three teams, all procedurally generated.

75
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,598
And this is where we are today.

76
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:52,620
We've added a lot of content to the game.

77
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,383
We, a lot of players have tried the experience.

78
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:59,645
We've added, yeah, new killers, new survivors,

79
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:01,066
a lot of new maps and themes,

80
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:05,850
and also iconic characters now are guests to our universe.

81
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,271
This is pretty cool.

82
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:11,044
And what is really special of the game is that

83
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:15,085
in this space, it's pretty rare to see community

84
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:16,926
and player engagement such as this.

85
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:20,507
Players are staying, they play our game for a long time.

86
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:23,528
So yeah, it's really special.

87
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:28,370
So we did this game, we had ambition that it would work.

88
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,791
Obviously we had ambition for the game.

89
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:34,853
But we were the first surprise of how it exploded.

90
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:37,376
in popularity on release.

91
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:41,461
So today we wanted to talk about the good things we did

92
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:44,385
to achieve this, some of the mistakes we did too,

93
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:45,867
because we did quite a few,

94
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:49,231
and our learnings and experience on this project.

95
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,236
First let's start with the origin of the project.

96
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,092
So we were thinking about doing this game for a long time,

97
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:58,153
almost a decade.

98
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:02,197
We did a lot of pitch at that time,

99
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:05,020
and we had issues getting partners.

100
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,202
It was, we heard a lot of different things.

101
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:10,225
Auror would not sell, it's too risky to build,

102
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,627
or the tech wasn't there necessarily

103
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:13,688
to do this type of game.

104
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,190
But...

105
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:17,787
Over all these years, every time we could,

106
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:21,651
we would still use these mechanics that we wanted to do.

107
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,112
Like, for example, in Naughty Bear,

108
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:26,115
there is an asymmetrical multiplayer mode in there.

109
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:29,277
A tree, normal bear versus naughty bear,

110
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:31,880
the killer bear, using bear traps to trap them.

111
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,942
So like, it feels similar, right?

112
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:36,344
It's pretty close to what Day by Daylight is.

113
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,086
But one day.

114
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:45,114
we've decided to start this project

115
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:48,677
and we tasked a designer to start doing

116
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:50,358
a lot of different prototypes

117
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,961
to test this asymmetrical aura gameplay.

118
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,724
So this is stage one, we call it the pretotype,

119
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:59,086
it's actually prototypes before the real prototype

120
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:02,248
where a lot of different ideas were tested in Unity.

121
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:07,895
At that time it was a 1v1 local multiplayer.

122
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:09,417
I'm gonna explain the photo real quick.

123
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:12,261
Actually, what you see here is a giant piece of cardboard

124
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:13,562
that we still have in the office,

125
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,987
which is used to separate a giant TV screen

126
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,250
to simulate the multiplayer aspect of the game.

127
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:22,033
Very analog.

128
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:26,138
The demo was absolutely on balance,

129
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:27,859
the killer was super powerful

130
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,600
and it was just one survivor with lives

131
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,220
to simulate the four players aspect.

132
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,882
And we were already trying different procedural scenarios

133
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:37,283
or random scenarios for the maps.

134
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:40,624
And really quickly out of this prototype,

135
00:06:40,644 --> 00:06:44,025
we could find, we found the one, the one that was fun.

136
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:46,106
So we could identify the core loops

137
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:49,027
of the survivor and the killer really, really quickly.

138
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:57,428
So this prototype was so fun and promising that we decided

139
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:01,711
to create a pitch to actually start this project for real.

140
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,274
What is great at Behaviour is that there's no red tape.

141
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:09,717
We can actually go in and see the executive and try to get

142
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:10,678
their pitch.

143
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,874
faith to build this kind of project.

144
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,797
So what you're seeing here is actually part of the original

145
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,598
slides that we use for the Greenlight process.

146
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,842
Dead by Daylight was a working title, but it stuck.

147
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:28,026
So the goal of this Greenlight demo was to recreate the

148
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:31,690
pretotype, but in a five-player multiplayer.

149
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,791
So it would be networked at that point.

150
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:39,136
The fantasy, still the same as we have in the game right now.

151
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,268
Slasher has the feeling of power,

152
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,111
survivor is having fun being scared.

153
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:49,196
We had very strong inspiration.

154
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:50,778
I kept this slide to show it today

155
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:51,999
because what's really cool about it

156
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,142
is that we actually have a lot of these killers

157
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:54,883
in the game right now.

158
00:07:57,549 --> 00:07:59,191
And three big goals.

159
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:02,895
We wanted to show that fear could be real.

160
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:08,361
We didn't want any UI or mechanics that would show that

161
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,703
your character is scared.

162
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:13,608
We wanted to prove that the player would be scared and

163
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:15,830
would make mistakes because he's stressed.

164
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:20,835
We wanted also to prove a visceral combat system, something very binary.

165
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:24,278
The killer finds you and hits you, you're dead, you're done.

166
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,182
And we wanted to prove that this game would be long-lasting,

167
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,965
that it would be ever-changing,

168
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:33,287
that every time you play, you would have a different experience.

169
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:43,240
So we got permission to create this stage two prototype.

170
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:46,562
The company add Fate into the product.

171
00:08:47,022 --> 00:08:51,945
So we continued in Unity to build this real prototype that

172
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:52,445
is networked.

173
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:55,687
So this one was 4v1 networked.

174
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:59,609
It was a more balanced experience of what the final

175
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:00,550
game would be like.

176
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,591
And we're still using random maps.

177
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:08,031
The idea where we succeed with this demo

178
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:09,974
was to prove that the fear and tension

179
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:11,095
would be real and fun.

180
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:15,680
We solidified the core and we could focus on the core

181
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,724
and cut everything that was secondary right now

182
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:19,524
and assess the risk.

183
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:20,746
Oops.

184
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,091
And it worked.

185
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:25,013
This demo was built, we played it a lot,

186
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:28,855
and we passed the internal green light

187
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:31,297
so that we could get to the next stage

188
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,378
and actually make it happen.

189
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:35,940
The process was so good that we now have a division

190
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:40,744
within the studio called Yugo, which only does this.

191
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:43,866
So they build prototype after prototype all day.

192
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:46,608
We test them, and when we find a gem,

193
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:50,851
something that's really fun, they can become actual games.

194
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,638
So here the lesson is a very basic one,

195
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:57,899
but a very important one.

196
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,381
Find the fun fast and stick to it.

197
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:06,106
As you can see, the first prototype already showed

198
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:07,467
what the final game would be like,

199
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,728
and we really stuck with it.

200
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,131
So stage three, we actually start production.

201
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,653
We switch engine, we go to Unreal,

202
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,195
and we start building a team.

203
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:19,977
So the photo you see here is more of a,

204
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:24,911
A recent team, it's the biggest team we have yet.

205
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,496
But when we started, it was quite small.

206
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:29,299
We were about 20 on the team.

207
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:30,482
Each.

208
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:37,538
member of the team was handpicked to make sure that everybody had the same goal and were passionate about the same subject

209
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:42,400
that they really wanted to build that game and this was key because

210
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,562
one of the best tool we use during production are

211
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:52,525
regular playtests, constant playtesting of the game. Every time we change something all the team would play and try the game

212
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:55,766
and what was amazing for us and that we

213
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:57,547
tried to keep

214
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,054
is that when team members would stop to play the game

215
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:06,739
and go get a coffee, instead of talking about features

216
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:10,102
or bug or a specific mechanic, they would talk about

217
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,825
the stories, the emergent scenarios that happen

218
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:13,827
during the match.

219
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,650
This was really, really interesting and something

220
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,333
that we wanted to keep until the game was actually released.

221
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,839
It's also in that time that we discovered a new goal.

222
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,681
One time we showed the game to the whole company

223
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:32,361
during an event, an Halloween event.

224
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:36,042
So players would play the game

225
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:39,023
and we had this giant screen in the cafeteria.

226
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,333
we discover and created a new goal is that our game was not only fun to play

227
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:48,197
but also really fun to watch.

228
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:52,763
And this became a key into the development of Dead by Daylight and its success.

229
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,831
So get the right people for your project, absolutely

230
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,372
important, and take care of them.

231
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:05,356
Just as a reminder, we really wanted to have a long lasting

232
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:08,939
game, and really the hard work really starts when you

233
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,060
complete your game and release it.

234
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,683
So don't burn the team.

235
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:14,643
Take care of them.

236
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,386
Actually, at Behaviour, on that specific project, we did

237
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,948
very, very little overtime.

238
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:20,968
We're quite proud of it.

239
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:23,350
And it's perfect, because as soon as you get live.

240
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,131
people are still fresh and want to continue to work.

241
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,393
Alright, so we're in production,

242
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:31,914
there's a lot of things I could talk about,

243
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,674
but I would never have the time in an hour,

244
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:36,796
so I selected two important features

245
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:39,437
that I think are interesting to talk about today,

246
00:12:40,597 --> 00:12:42,238
that support the longevity of the game.

247
00:12:43,158 --> 00:12:45,439
Sorry, my mouth is super dry, give me a second.

248
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,861
Alright, so first one is procedural maps.

249
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,854
We use a tile-based system to generate all the maps.

250
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:00,698
So the tiles have different assets on them, different gameplay.

251
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,882
So we adjunct them together, so every time it's different.

252
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,370
And we use also random spawners to have the survivor spawn in the unknown.

253
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,432
And our intention with that was to...

254
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:15,634
create billions of different scenarios

255
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,576
so that every time you play it feels really different

256
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:19,657
and you don't know what to expect.

257
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,098
So it creates uncertainty,

258
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:25,100
but it is also a very sustainable way to create new maps

259
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,101
because you don't have to end craft them.

260
00:13:29,022 --> 00:13:30,363
So our idea was really,

261
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:34,246
players are gonna have million of different maps,

262
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:36,147
it's gonna be amazing.

263
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:41,113
But we found out really quickly that the players

264
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,615
testing our game would really have a feeling that

265
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,156
there's just one map.

266
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:53,741
The chaos that we put into the random generator was not

267
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:55,242
appreciated to its fullest.

268
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:58,324
Like they couldn't really explain where they were or

269
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:01,266
what the difference was between all the maps or all

270
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:01,886
the permutation.

271
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:04,536
So we went back to the drawing board

272
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:10,159
and found some rules to use to fix this problem.

273
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,563
So first off, we would build about five maps

274
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:17,544
within each team.

275
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,145
So we created that concept of teams.

276
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:21,407
So you have here, Macmillan Estate,

277
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,288
Coldwind Farm, Otoeven Wreckers,

278
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:24,969
the first teams that we created.

279
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,191
They have very different mood and lighting,

280
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:29,232
so they're recognizable.

281
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,174
Second rule is that every map would be.

282
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,994
would have a specific name and a specific building

283
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:36,994
that would be static.

284
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:38,615
So usually found in the middle of the map,

285
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:39,776
they're really recognizable.

286
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:43,477
And you know as soon as you see the name of the map

287
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:45,698
where you are and what to expect on that front.

288
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:47,799
The other thing that we made sure

289
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:50,820
is that we use a landmark asset

290
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,501
that were used usually in corner of the map

291
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:56,322
to be used as navigational point

292
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,643
and also recognizable that you can actually

293
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:01,124
know where you are and recognize them.

294
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:07,739
So this fixed our problem and added something really

295
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,260
interesting.

296
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,622
So as soon as the map is loading and you see the name

297
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,783
of the map, the player would be able, even though that

298
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:17,085
there's a lot of random component, they would be able

299
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,446
to start preparing their strategy because they knew

300
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:22,908
that something specific would be in there.

301
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:27,130
Also, the people watching the game could also start

302
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:30,844
hypothesis of what the player should be doing to win.

303
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,225
So that was really interesting.

304
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,605
We gave the players and the watchers a language

305
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:37,086
to be able to talk about the experience too.

306
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,387
This awesome thing happened to me

307
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:41,347
on the second floor of this asylum

308
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,248
is something that couldn't be made before

309
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:47,269
because the random aspect, there were no anchors.

310
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:51,510
So lesson learned here is that you need,

311
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,791
well, we needed to create expectation and anchors

312
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:55,971
in the procedural world.

313
00:15:56,613 --> 00:16:04,160
Going fully random and fully chaotic is not something that is really pleasant or that you will feel good in your game.

314
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:09,254
Next big component I want to talk about

315
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:13,275
that we did during production is load out and progression.

316
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:18,036
So our goal, our intent was to create a lot of,

317
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:21,257
you know, bulk of items, add-ons, offerings,

318
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:23,838
and all of these things that you can

319
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,218
customize your character with.

320
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,879
So we had items that gives you secondary reaction

321
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,159
in the game, such as.

322
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:33,473
a toolkit for example that repairs generator faster,

323
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:38,236
add-ons, two add-ons to add to these tool to customize them.

324
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:41,038
Each character would have four perks

325
00:16:41,538 --> 00:16:42,999
that would also change their abilities,

326
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,000
and the offering is the wild card

327
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,922
that actually changes how the match is gonna be played

328
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:51,464
and how the procedural aspect of the map could be tweaked.

329
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:55,367
And we thought that the more we would put in the game,

330
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:58,929
we would allow player to experiment, that would be fun.

331
00:16:58,989 --> 00:16:59,550
So every time.

332
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:02,484
you go into a match, you put these components,

333
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:04,265
it changes the map, it adds chaos,

334
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:07,186
it adds different stories, and it adds uncertainty.

335
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:13,389
The other thing that we did is this infinite progression

336
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:14,609
through the blood web.

337
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:17,771
So this is a procedural skill tree,

338
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:20,432
and all of the nodes, the component that you can buy

339
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:22,173
to evolve your character are also.

340
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:23,956
procedurally chosen.

341
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:26,757
So you, every time you evolve your character,

342
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:28,778
you don't know exactly what it's gonna be

343
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,558
and you need to choose how to build your character.

344
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,240
So again, this was to create a near infinite progression

345
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,720
so that players could play for a long time.

346
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:39,502
The first, really, the big problem that happened,

347
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:40,702
so at first it was really good.

348
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:43,163
I mean, it was appreciated that there was a lot of content,

349
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:46,364
but experimentation stopped quite quickly.

350
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,385
In a competitive game,

351
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:50,976
players want to win.

352
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:53,437
So obviously there's gonna be a meta build,

353
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:57,579
the build that is judged perfect for survivors and killers.

354
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:59,440
It's gonna be on the web,

355
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,421
and then players will want to have this specific thing.

356
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:07,203
And our procedural skill tree, the blood web,

357
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:09,204
would become more frustrating than anything

358
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:11,745
because you really wanted to be able to achieve

359
00:18:11,805 --> 00:18:12,765
this specific loadout,

360
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:14,706
and it was really difficult to get there.

361
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:18,048
Also, it stopped.

362
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,160
completely experimentation, like this is what you would see.

363
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,563
So the way we changed our approach with that now

364
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,366
is that instead of doing bulk of different items

365
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:28,927
to release when we do an update,

366
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:32,650
we focus on less things but that are more meaningful

367
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:35,553
and that shakes the meta so that the players

368
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:38,436
actually start to experiment and adapt again to a new meta.

369
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:42,799
Another problem with a bulk of items like that

370
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,862
is that it adds exponential weight on your team.

371
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:50,592
So an example of this is the moon offering.

372
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:55,399
So these are a set of four offerings that changes the

373
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:56,260
lighting of a map.

374
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:59,064
So you can change the moonlight so that the level is

375
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,266
brighter or darker.

376
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:04,269
And every time we create a new map,

377
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,332
the artistic team need to do a basic lighting pass

378
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,674
for the normal experience, and then make sure

379
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,376
that the combination of all the different moon offering

380
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:16,838
that the players can play will have a great lighting too.

381
00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:19,980
And then we also add a perk that would also affect

382
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,921
the lighting of that specific character.

383
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:24,023
So there's all these permutations to,

384
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,245
it's a lot of work just to have a perfect lighting

385
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:27,985
for all of these things.

386
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:34,803
So our solution for that, I mean it was a great gimmick of an idea at first, it was cool,

387
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:39,126
but since it's not used that much and adds so much problem to the team,

388
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,268
we decided to retire these items.

389
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:44,771
That's fine too, so they just disappeared, they don't appear on the blood web anymore,

390
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:47,013
players cannot play them anymore.

391
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:52,824
So the lesson here is, don't be afraid, be courageous.

392
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:56,908
You might have released with something awesome,

393
00:19:56,948 --> 00:19:59,932
but the game evolves in a way that you don't need it anymore

394
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:01,954
and that you should change so that the game

395
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,676
becomes interesting again, and that's fine.

396
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:08,342
All right, so fast forward to end of production.

397
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,163
We have a great game in our hands.

398
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,104
We know that it's fun to watch, it's fun to play.

399
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:16,704
But nobody knows about our studio,

400
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:17,845
nobody knows about our game,

401
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:22,246
so we started thinking about building a community

402
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,066
and iPlayers.

403
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,427
So I wanna, in this section,

404
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:27,428
go quickly over the different tools that we use

405
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,988
to get that community built up.

406
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:33,884
So for us, we started on Steam.

407
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:35,825
Obviously, this is where we released the game.

408
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:38,486
So the Steam forum is where we wanted to start

409
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:40,367
talking with the players.

410
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:44,529
And at that time, we had a partner, Starbreeze,

411
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:47,991
who have a game you might know about, Payday 2.

412
00:20:48,711 --> 00:20:50,452
And at that time, they had one of the biggest

413
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:51,772
community on Steam.

414
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:54,053
They had about three million members in their community.

415
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:57,335
So the deal we did with their player is,

416
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:59,076
come join our community.

417
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:03,065
and you will unlock three awesome masks in Payday

418
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:05,006
teamed on Dead by Daylight.

419
00:21:05,787 --> 00:21:08,649
So a lot of players came in the community.

420
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:11,671
Obviously a lot of them were there for just the free shit,

421
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:15,714
but we had a way to talk to them.

422
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:17,615
So now every time we did an announcement

423
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:21,278
on our community page, they would receive this message.

424
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:24,060
And quite a few of them were converted.

425
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,521
I mean, they wanted to know more

426
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:27,842
and started to follow the project.

427
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,263
Another big thing we did is our first event.

428
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,964
We went to PAX to talk about our game.

429
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:39,885
And this was a first for the company.

430
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:41,785
We didn't know really what to expect.

431
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:45,526
We shipped five PCs, and most importantly,

432
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:49,267
the dev team to go there and talk about the project.

433
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:54,308
We had a super cool, nondescript black box of boot

434
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,208
with only the title.

435
00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:00,192
And the most important thing was the giant TV screen

436
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,152
all around the booth.

437
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,875
We knew our game was fun to watch,

438
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:07,118
so players would come here and test the game

439
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,480
and play a real match and then people around

440
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,222
would be able to look at what was happening

441
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:13,763
and have fun just watching the game.

442
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:17,947
The first day was selling the game,

443
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:20,910
you know, one person at a time, super difficult.

444
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:23,812
But people were intrigued, they were looking around.

445
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:26,297
It's the second day that was awesome for us

446
00:22:26,337 --> 00:22:30,379
and a revelation really because there was a lot,

447
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,720
a lot of people just packed around the boot

448
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,201
and we didn't need to explain the game anymore.

449
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:38,343
The crowd was able to explain to newcomers

450
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:39,663
what was going on.

451
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:42,885
The concept is easy to grasp and easy to explain

452
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:46,207
and it's awesome for this kind of events.

453
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:49,877
And most importantly, at the end of the event,

454
00:22:49,997 --> 00:22:52,539
we had a lot of content creators, streamers, YouTuber,

455
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,242
that came to see us to tell us

456
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:56,963
that they were hyped about the project.

457
00:22:56,983 --> 00:22:58,705
They couldn't wait to get their hands on it

458
00:22:58,985 --> 00:22:59,886
to be able to stream it.

459
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:03,349
They understood the power of this product

460
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,351
as a really entertaining game to watch.

461
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:10,575
It was actually so important, this factor,

462
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:12,396
that when we came back.

463
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:15,872
We really had the choice in production before release,

464
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:17,894
we had the choice to create one extra mode

465
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:18,734
that we needed to choose.

466
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:21,817
Do you want to do an offline mode, kill your friend mode,

467
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:25,281
or the survivor friend, the social group

468
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:27,323
that you form survivor with your friends?

469
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:29,785
And we chose kill your friends

470
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:31,687
because of the content creator.

471
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:36,231
We wanted to give them a platform that's safe and offline

472
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:38,013
so that they could create their videos and have fun.

473
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:40,169
And it served us really well.

474
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,716
I mean, the streamers really pushed visibility on the

475
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,618
beta-lite on release.

476
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:50,579
Another tool we use is that we started at that time doing

477
00:23:50,939 --> 00:23:53,622
the weekly Devstream, which is something we still do.

478
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:57,686
We're going to do our 100th episode soon.

479
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:03,111
And we started to talk with the community on Twitch.

480
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,294
So people would come and interact directly with us

481
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:08,896
in the Twitch chat to be able to

482
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:10,597
ask questions about the game.

483
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:12,640
and we would show them some gameplay,

484
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,402
show them how it works, answer these questions.

485
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:18,606
And it's at that time that a lot of questions

486
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:22,551
would come back, and it was clear that we needed,

487
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:25,394
as a team, to start and take commitment

488
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:27,336
and do promises for the future of the game.

489
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:30,479
So it was time for...

490
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,087
big promises.

491
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:35,951
So doing promises to the community is scary,

492
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:38,475
but you really need to do it to start building trust

493
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:39,195
with that community.

494
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:42,159
And for us, I'm gonna expose you what the three

495
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,420
big promises we did were.

496
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:46,284
They were quite easy to do because they're a part

497
00:24:46,304 --> 00:24:47,886
of our values as a team.

498
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:51,285
No pay to win.

499
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:54,189
It's something that was asked out of our community.

500
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:57,574
It's something that a lot of them lived in other projects.

501
00:24:58,695 --> 00:25:01,800
And they wanted us to make commitment that there wouldn't

502
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,561
be any pay to win.

503
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:03,782
And it's something that

504
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:10,329
I mean, that we've put some systems in the game to make sure that perks, abilities would

505
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:14,112
be available to everybody, even though we sold DLC.

506
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:20,138
We actually just announced today that we're adding a new system or a new way to unlock

507
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:20,979
characters in the game.

508
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,064
So all of our original characters will now be unlockable with playtime.

509
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:30,908
So that's how we fulfilled this promise.

510
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:34,022
We actually did pay to lose.

511
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:38,664
The first DLC we released was a customization pack,

512
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:41,645
really flashy, themed on the 80s.

513
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:44,286
And of course, if you're a flashy character

514
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:45,787
in a game where you need to hide,

515
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:47,407
it's pay to lose, right?

516
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:52,050
Our second promise is no fracturing the community,

517
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,271
and how we did this is every map we released

518
00:25:55,531 --> 00:25:57,552
was going to be free and accessible to everybody.

519
00:25:58,372 --> 00:25:59,393
That was super important to us.

520
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:03,115
And last one, we'll be as generous as we can.

521
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:10,420
Since the release of the game, there's two full DLC content

522
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,841
drop that we did completely for free, because we

523
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:13,662
could at that time.

524
00:26:15,383 --> 00:26:15,783
So that's it.

525
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:19,225
And also some charity case to give back to the community,

526
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,086
something we did with the streamers.

527
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:25,589
We created specific items for them, and then sold them, and

528
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:26,610
all the money went to charity.

529
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:29,566
super appreciated by the community.

530
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,549
So the lesson here is start building your community

531
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:33,489
as soon as you can.

532
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,071
Be transparent, be available.

533
00:26:37,793 --> 00:26:40,094
You can't wait till the game is out, obviously,

534
00:26:40,174 --> 00:26:41,475
so as soon as you can.

535
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:45,118
Interacting with them is super valuable.

536
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,420
And if everything is going all right,

537
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,461
you'll have a community.

538
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:55,905
So for us, we wanted as a team to be really involved

539
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:56,786
with the community.

540
00:26:57,246 --> 00:27:01,348
We didn't want the company to be the person

541
00:27:01,448 --> 00:27:02,389
interacting with the community.

542
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:07,211
So all of us on the team, we did go into the forums

543
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:10,173
and answered directly and interacted with the members

544
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,614
of the community, answering their questions, their concerns,

545
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:15,115
and having fun with them, creating characters,

546
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:18,977
talking about the lore, and this was truly amazing.

547
00:27:21,622 --> 00:27:25,065
Since then, we've added or we transformed some people

548
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,226
into dedicated community manager,

549
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,909
because it's a lot of work

550
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:31,970
and we have to do other things, obviously.

551
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:34,272
So let's talk a bit about community.

552
00:27:34,312 --> 00:27:35,073
Let's start with the bad.

553
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:36,254
Let's get this out of the way.

554
00:27:36,574 --> 00:27:39,176
I actually saw a couple of conference this week

555
00:27:39,376 --> 00:27:40,657
about exactly this problem.

556
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:43,700
It's something that every one of us need to tackle,

557
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,401
especially in the online multiplayer

558
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:48,584
with subject like killing, like our game.

559
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:54,155
you're gonna get your personal life invaded.

560
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:57,859
Like if you have your personal Facebook or Twitter

561
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,000
and you're having fun on there,

562
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,901
fans are gonna find you,

563
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:02,103
they're gonna ask you questions.

564
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:04,725
Some of them are really toxic as well.

565
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:09,189
And it's dangerous to start and work 24-7 really

566
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,450
because you have your phone

567
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,811
and you want to interact with them.

568
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:15,254
And because the game is worldwide, it never stops.

569
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:17,016
This is something you need to be careful about.

570
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:21,360
When toxicity becomes really, really high, some of them, I

571
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:27,644
mean, will also get to threats targeting you directly.

572
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:31,386
And my point here is that, I mean, these things, it

573
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:32,887
shouldn't happen, but they happen.

574
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:37,049
And you need to be ready to support team members that are

575
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:40,551
going to live these kind of scenarios so that they feel

576
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:41,752
supported and protected.

577
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,475
But the good of having community tremendously outweighs the bad.

578
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:52,260
It's great for motivation, interacting with the community,

579
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,925
seeing what they build, the arts and craft, they write stories,

580
00:28:57,266 --> 00:29:00,029
they contribute, and make the game much better.

581
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,707
I add only one slide to show you the kind of thing

582
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:04,728
that our community is doing.

583
00:29:04,908 --> 00:29:07,889
They create their own chapters, the Shia Surprise.

584
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,850
It's awesome, I wanna build that eventually.

585
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,311
Tattoos of our main character, it's crazy.

586
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:14,612
I mean, cosplay obviously.

587
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:17,533
Videos, I mean, they're all over

588
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,133
and they make the game richer.

589
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:23,835
Lesson, ear is one of the most important one.

590
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,156
When you release a game that's going to be live,

591
00:29:27,737 --> 00:29:27,917
you...

592
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:32,361
create a relationship between you and your community.

593
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,523
And you need to give them this ownership.

594
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,364
It's gonna make the game richer.

595
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,146
It's gonna make the game better.

596
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:42,007
So it's as much as theirs as it is yours.

597
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:42,888
You should embrace that.

598
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,032
All right, so stage four, we release the game.

599
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:49,092
We're now live.

600
00:29:49,312 --> 00:29:51,254
We have the biggest team yet.

601
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:53,255
I wanna talk a bit about the early days,

602
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:56,077
what we did in the first month.

603
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:59,163
about on the live operation of the game.

604
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:03,565
So continuous monitoring, communication with the community,

605
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:06,106
super important, fixing bugs aggressively,

606
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:09,287
and starting work on our major updates.

607
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:15,778
So here is a, it's quite small, it's the first things that we

608
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:17,240
released during the first month.

609
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:21,804
So we've listened to the community demands, and one of

610
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:24,647
the features that was asked the most was the survive with

611
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:25,408
friends feature.

612
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:28,251
So that mode that we had to cut before release.

613
00:30:28,651 --> 00:30:30,853
So a way to be able to play with your friends.

614
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:35,043
So obviously, because it was a top demand,

615
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:38,844
we wanted to show that we had a commitment to that game

616
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:41,185
and to them, so we started working on that.

617
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:44,266
Other thing we did is that we monitored

618
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:46,427
the different languages in the community,

619
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:50,168
and we found out that we had a big community in China

620
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,688
and a big one in Russia as well,

621
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:54,869
but they didn't have their language supported in the game.

622
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:57,890
So they had to deal with English.

623
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:03,367
we added these language in the first month as well,

624
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:05,007
which was really, really appreciated.

625
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:09,610
We also released free content, maps, outfits,

626
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,551
just to show that these are the type of things

627
00:31:11,571 --> 00:31:14,292
that we would give away, and again,

628
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:16,373
to show commitment that we would support this game.

629
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,975
It's not because your community is asking

630
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:23,397
to change a game that you should do everything, though.

631
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:26,178
There are some small rules that we kept

632
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,299
that we never touch.

633
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,860
I just want to do the first two example.

634
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:38,844
I think that since release, every single day, someone asks for voice in the game.

635
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:42,467
I want to be able to talk to other players.

636
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:45,489
I want to be able to scream in the game with a mic.

637
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:51,152
And for us, we knew that this would break completely the immersion, so we've always

638
00:31:51,232 --> 00:31:54,414
said no to this feature, and even today we don't have it.

639
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,987
One other thing that was asked a lot was the ability to,

640
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:00,328
actually goes the other way,

641
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:04,310
the ability to change the survivor third person perspective

642
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,770
to go into first person,

643
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,312
to have a better immersion and be more scared,

644
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:10,492
basically as a survivor.

645
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:12,493
And we've always pushed back

646
00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:15,614
because survivors are supposed to work as a team,

647
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:17,515
and if you make your experience harder

648
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:18,535
by going first person,

649
00:32:18,996 --> 00:32:22,197
you might make the other survivor experience kind of sucky.

650
00:32:23,017 --> 00:32:24,378
So we've decided not to go there.

651
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:28,396
There are some small rules we broke, though,

652
00:32:29,056 --> 00:32:29,737
in the first month.

653
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,078
Killer speed is an interesting one.

654
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,418
When we developed the game,

655
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:37,220
the chase economy,

656
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,842
the speed of the killer and of the survivor

657
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:43,083
was sacrosanct values

658
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,484
that we decided that we would never change.

659
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,285
But then the first killer that we released post-launch

660
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:51,286
is our nurse.

661
00:32:51,606 --> 00:32:53,527
She teleports, she goes through wall.

662
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,606
So we add to balance her by lowering her speed.

663
00:32:57,826 --> 00:33:00,227
So this is something we broke in the first month.

664
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,849
Survive with friends, like I explained,

665
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,610
in our vision, original vision,

666
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,352
we wanted players to experience the game

667
00:33:10,832 --> 00:33:12,152
alone with strangers.

668
00:33:12,412 --> 00:33:15,794
This is like the uncertainty makes the game better that way.

669
00:33:16,134 --> 00:33:18,935
But, I mean, something that was requested a lot,

670
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:20,416
so we decided to break that rule

671
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:22,917
and let survivors play together with friends.

672
00:33:23,717 --> 00:33:25,798
And last one, last example, new killer powers.

673
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:29,639
We were supposed, when we originally designed the game,

674
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,719
that every killer that we would release post-launch

675
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:35,040
was going to be stat change and little tweaks

676
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,160
to create these new killers.

677
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,221
So we start with a trapper and we change this

678
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:41,601
a little bit, things here and there.

679
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:44,642
But we decided to go another way,

680
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:46,403
which is much better in my opinion,

681
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:51,324
whereas we basically created complete new powers

682
00:33:51,704 --> 00:33:52,884
for these killers.

683
00:33:55,818 --> 00:33:57,579
So lesson here, be confident, not stubborn.

684
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,161
I mean, it's fine changing your game.

685
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:03,042
You still need to be true to your vision,

686
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:06,784
but the community is gonna ask for something in your games

687
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:08,865
and it's also fine to change it.

688
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:10,186
It's gonna make something better.

689
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:13,908
So there's two types of things

690
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,208
that we do during live operation.

691
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:17,430
Pretty basic stuff.

692
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,912
We add new content and we do some services.

693
00:34:25,183 --> 00:34:26,964
So this is an example of a content drop

694
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,025
that we do in Dead by Daylight.

695
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:29,526
We call them chapters.

696
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:33,128
It's a format that we use that is always the same.

697
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:35,289
So when we release a content drop,

698
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:37,730
we have a killer, we have a survivor,

699
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,512
and we have a new map that's accessible to everyone.

700
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:42,333
Survivor comes with new perks,

701
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:44,334
and the killer is the most important of all,

702
00:34:44,594 --> 00:34:48,236
comes with new fiction, a new lore,

703
00:34:49,617 --> 00:34:54,119
and a new power that redefines the gameplay of the game.

704
00:34:57,676 --> 00:34:58,817
So, here are some examples.

705
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:01,660
When we create these new characters,

706
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,602
we really try to break the game in a good way.

707
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:08,027
So, the nurse teleports, changes the chase completely,

708
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:09,769
so breaks the game in a good way.

709
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:10,770
Really interesting.

710
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:12,472
Players need to adapt.

711
00:35:12,912 --> 00:35:16,196
The Entryist, which released one year after the launch.

712
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,816
is our first character with a range attack.

713
00:35:18,837 --> 00:35:20,938
So again, changes the dynamic completely

714
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,361
because all of the others would have normal melee.

715
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:26,603
So again, need to adapt to this new gameplay.

716
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:29,846
The pig, which is the last killer we released,

717
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:33,329
adds a new objective to the survivor completely.

718
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,812
So she adds a reverse bear trap.

719
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,493
So she's from the Saw franchise.

720
00:35:38,394 --> 00:35:41,396
She adds the reverse bear trap on the head of the survivor.

721
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:46,902
and they can't escape even though they repaired the five generators

722
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:48,443
and they have the exit gate open.

723
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:51,445
They have to find the jigsaw box and find the correct key

724
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,146
to get this thing off their head.

725
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,808
So it adds a new core loop to the experience.

726
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:01,131
So again, need to adapt drastically to this new character.

727
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:05,040
So what is cool about having a format like that

728
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:09,408
is that it creates a solid pipeline for your team.

729
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:11,172
So having the same kind of format

730
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:13,417
every time you create a DLC, the team.

731
00:36:14,954 --> 00:36:17,597
knows exactly what they have to do and what to expect.

732
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:20,659
It is also very clear for players.

733
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:21,960
When we announce a chapter,

734
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,822
they know exactly what is going to be in there.

735
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,585
And it adds to, well, everyone experience.

736
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:31,348
In our case, adding a new killer with new gameplay

737
00:36:31,549 --> 00:36:34,271
means that you can play this killer

738
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:35,212
and have a new experience,

739
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:37,574
but you can also, as a survivor,

740
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:39,075
encounter this new character.

741
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,898
So it's like we're adding a new boss fight to the game.

742
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,379
Limitations though, redefining the whole gameplay

743
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:52,121
every time we do a content drop is difficult for a small team.

744
00:36:52,582 --> 00:36:54,983
It takes a lot of dedication and bandwidth,

745
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:57,285
so it takes away a little bit of focus

746
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:59,246
of supporting what's already in the game.

747
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:03,028
It adds complexity to the players.

748
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:05,750
We're actually reaching critical mass at the moment.

749
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,772
By adding all of these new gameplay components

750
00:37:08,872 --> 00:37:10,533
every time we release a killer, it

751
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:14,216
deepens the gap between veterans and new players.

752
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:18,980
So to fight this problem, we just have to do a lot more

753
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,583
on-boarding about these characters, add more ints,

754
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:25,186
and teach our players these new gameplays

755
00:37:25,386 --> 00:37:27,188
so that they don't get confused.

756
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:30,872
Now, services.

757
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:36,477
So this is the first year of all the updates we did.

758
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,121
There's a lot of stuff, a lot of service.

759
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:41,262
So service, just so that we're on the same page,

760
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:44,864
there are free updates, just make the game better.

761
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:49,126
And I just wanted to go quickly over some of the ones

762
00:37:49,146 --> 00:37:49,966
that served us better.

763
00:37:49,986 --> 00:37:52,187
It's good to put names on them.

764
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:54,849
Base features.

765
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:59,051
So we had to cut a lot of things

766
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,491
to focus on the core of the game,

767
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,052
so that it would be solid.

768
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:06,706
Releasing a game on PC, there's obviously things

769
00:38:06,726 --> 00:38:08,909
that the player will expect day one.

770
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:13,493
In our case, for example, we didn't have remapping.

771
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,174
We couldn't customize the control.

772
00:38:15,194 --> 00:38:18,237
This is something that players expected day one.

773
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:20,299
So these services are really nice.

774
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:21,700
You should do them early as possible.

775
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,462
If you can just add these features,

776
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:24,883
make your community happy,

777
00:38:25,364 --> 00:38:26,805
so that it feels like a more complete game.

778
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,008
Onboarding, we do it regularly,

779
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:31,910
just like I explained with the chapter,

780
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:35,173
to support a new player, to explain new mechanics.

781
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:38,936
We actually released the game with two videos,

782
00:38:38,976 --> 00:38:40,237
that was our tutorial,

783
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:43,519
and they became outdated really, really quickly.

784
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,642
So we had to get rid of the videos,

785
00:38:46,682 --> 00:38:48,823
and we changed that to a manual,

786
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:51,405
so text-based explanation and tutorial,

787
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,407
and that was much easier to update.

788
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:56,650
So it's a much better choice for a long-term onboarding.

789
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:02,884
Quality of life are updates that lowers frictions

790
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:03,604
within the game.

791
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:08,126
One example that we lived recently,

792
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,948
we had issues sometime with our matchmaking,

793
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:14,669
sometime people would be with players that would be laggy,

794
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,551
and they had no way to know their ping.

795
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:19,372
So they would...

796
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:24,417
go out of the game and use a third party software to be able to know the ping of the players.

797
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:27,379
And we didn't want that, we didn't want players to get out of the game for that.

798
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,785
So we've added this feature to the game, lowers friction, makes the experience better for all the players.

799
00:39:33,826 --> 00:39:36,849
And these guys are based on community needs.

800
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:41,193
So when community is asking, requesting for something like that, we make it happen.

801
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:45,597
Safety, not glamorous, but something that we have to do

802
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:49,458
always, so every day, making sure that the game is a safe

803
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:50,738
environment.

804
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:55,299
We've added a lot of features, actually, since release.

805
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:58,780
Report function, so a way to report players.

806
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,341
Ban function, and also making sure that the new cheats and

807
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,841
the new cheat engine are addressed, so that there's no

808
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:08,502
cheating in the game.

809
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:13,887
Events is one of the most interesting ones, something

810
00:40:13,907 --> 00:40:15,829
that we started last year, actually.

811
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:21,854
So Halloween, a winter event, the anniversary, they're great

812
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,477
to create excitement around the event for a week or a

813
00:40:25,537 --> 00:40:29,000
weekend, and they're a great way to test

814
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,221
special gameplay as well.

815
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:35,455
and they are great to lower the toxicity for a moment.

816
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:37,377
Every time we do events with Objective

817
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:38,918
that are usually community-based,

818
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:42,481
we see that within the game, the toxicity is lowered,

819
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:44,603
it brings the community members together,

820
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:45,904
so that's really interesting.

821
00:40:47,365 --> 00:40:49,307
And last one but not least, balance,

822
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,868
something we do regularly as well,

823
00:40:51,188 --> 00:40:53,790
so to balance issues and to shape meta.

824
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:57,453
So I'll go back with more on balance a little bit later.

825
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:00,616
So lesson here is really to

826
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:04,064
if you're aiming to have a live game

827
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:05,565
that you're gonna update regularly,

828
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:07,946
you need to focus on the foundation

829
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:09,387
of your game at the beginning.

830
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:12,669
It's okay to cut a lot of secondary system

831
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:15,350
because you'll have time afterwards.

832
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:18,292
If the players buy in and wanna be part

833
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:19,353
of the experience of your game,

834
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,354
then the rest can come later

835
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:23,355
and you can do that indefinitely.

836
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:26,717
All right, let's go to balance now.

837
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:29,839
So, balancing a game is difficult.

838
00:41:31,012 --> 00:41:33,792
I think we can all agree, balancing an asymmetrical

839
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:36,193
multiplayer is really difficult.

840
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:41,314
And I really wanted to go quickly how or what we use

841
00:41:41,674 --> 00:41:42,835
to balance the game.

842
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:48,596
So we use three sources, gut instincts, data analytics,

843
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,097
and community feedback.

844
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:52,437
All important.

845
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:58,179
Quick note about gut instincts, when you're creating

846
00:41:58,219 --> 00:41:59,599
something new, we're, I mean.

847
00:42:00,694 --> 00:42:03,896
We had no clue doing the symmetrical multiplayer horror game.

848
00:42:04,536 --> 00:42:07,437
Doing new characters, that changes the game completely.

849
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:12,740
Working in design, you don't have players,

850
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,921
you don't have analytics, you don't have anything to use.

851
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:17,942
So you know your game, your team knows the game,

852
00:42:17,982 --> 00:42:21,064
so a team debate and going with your instinct

853
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:22,965
is the normal way to go at that point.

854
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:30,687
Data analytics is really interesting for us, for the team.

855
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:34,450
It was the first project where we actually used analytics.

856
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:38,673
One of the best addition, that's Julien by the way.

857
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:41,895
Hello, hello Julien, you can say hi.

858
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:45,057
He's a really fun guy, a data analyst

859
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:49,080
that we added to the game, to the project, sorry.

860
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,742
He's a PhD evolutionary biology.

861
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:54,443
So this guy is.

862
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,566
awesome addition, E will crunch through our data,

863
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:02,808
but also can make link to the psychology of our players.

864
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:06,791
So E works with our designer to find

865
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:10,633
what we can change in the feature or what we can balance to

866
00:43:10,653 --> 00:43:14,236
address some specific personality-based

867
00:43:15,216 --> 00:43:15,516
problem.

868
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:19,936
Data analytic is not optional.

869
00:43:20,537 --> 00:43:22,458
Now we make sure that everything we design,

870
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:25,721
everything we add, it's a part of the scope.

871
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:28,523
We think about what we'll need as analytics

872
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:31,586
and it's always thought in the future.

873
00:43:33,888 --> 00:43:34,789
Be mindful of the hooks.

874
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:41,074
When we, before release, we weren't sure

875
00:43:41,094 --> 00:43:44,637
what we needed as hooks into analytics.

876
00:43:45,177 --> 00:43:45,838
So we've added.

877
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:48,835
hooks everywhere, analytics about everything.

878
00:43:49,435 --> 00:43:51,096
And this is a problem, it's something that you won't

879
00:43:51,136 --> 00:43:51,857
be able to use.

880
00:43:52,057 --> 00:43:54,558
If you get data about everything, it's gonna bloat

881
00:43:54,738 --> 00:43:58,781
your data, it will be super expensive, and you won't

882
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:00,242
be able to analyze this data.

883
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:04,464
We had to scrap most of it, actually, and make it lighter.

884
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:09,588
So, not enough is a problem, too much is also a problem.

885
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:12,970
You just need to design and be mindful of what you need.

886
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:16,955
And the last point, data versus perception,

887
00:44:17,015 --> 00:44:17,835
is really important.

888
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,877
Data analytics is really strong,

889
00:44:19,937 --> 00:44:22,999
but when the community thinks that there's a problem,

890
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:26,661
it doesn't matter how strong is your data.

891
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:28,242
They won't believe you.

892
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:31,404
Like, the perception is much stronger.

893
00:44:31,424 --> 00:44:33,545
And that's why it can't be the only tool

894
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:34,686
you use to balance the game.

895
00:44:35,946 --> 00:44:37,027
So another tool that we use.

896
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:39,016
is a Discord group.

897
00:44:39,296 --> 00:44:42,477
So we formed that last year with an elite group

898
00:44:42,877 --> 00:44:44,458
of our players.

899
00:44:45,278 --> 00:44:47,779
So we found players that had more than 1,000 hours

900
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,419
in the game, that were really invested,

901
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,580
that could play the game really well,

902
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,041
and that add constructive feedback about these features.

903
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:57,862
And we invited them into the Discord group

904
00:44:57,902 --> 00:44:59,723
where our designers, some engineers.

905
00:45:00,273 --> 00:45:02,935
and community manager interact with them directly.

906
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:05,597
We actually talk with them pretty much every day

907
00:45:05,757 --> 00:45:08,879
to talk about a balance path that we want to do,

908
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:10,940
a new feature, to get their feedback.

909
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:14,243
They really represent the community

910
00:45:14,283 --> 00:45:15,283
and what the community thinks.

911
00:45:16,064 --> 00:45:18,185
They're also under NDA, so it's possible for us

912
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:20,507
to create specific builds just for them,

913
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:21,588
and we can play with them.

914
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:25,610
And they are so invested in the game

915
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,153
that they're much better than anyone in the team.

916
00:45:29,606 --> 00:45:31,626
so their feedback is super valuable.

917
00:45:34,387 --> 00:45:37,468
So just Trulison learned about balance.

918
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:40,308
First of all, don't react to first reactions.

919
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:43,729
We found out that every time we release new content,

920
00:45:44,229 --> 00:45:47,210
it takes at least two weeks for the players to adapt.

921
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,091
The data analytics that you receive

922
00:45:50,111 --> 00:45:52,351
in these first two weeks is rubbish, you can't use it,

923
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:56,312
and their reaction is also not real.

924
00:45:56,472 --> 00:45:57,672
They need that time to adapt

925
00:45:57,752 --> 00:45:59,433
and understand what has changed in the game.

926
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,448
Leave no one behind.

927
00:46:01,808 --> 00:46:07,093
When we do a balance pass for a problem that is for the

928
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:10,156
higher ranks, for example, we always need to make sure that

929
00:46:10,356 --> 00:46:12,598
this change will not affect in a bad way the

930
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:13,759
lower ranks players.

931
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:15,740
So we need to be inclusive.

932
00:46:17,022 --> 00:46:17,882
And communicate a lot.

933
00:46:18,203 --> 00:46:20,965
When we do changes like that, we usually communicate before

934
00:46:21,005 --> 00:46:23,147
we do the change to get the feedback.

935
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,461
We communicate when we do the patch,

936
00:46:26,782 --> 00:46:28,463
and we communicate a lot afterwards

937
00:46:28,563 --> 00:46:30,504
to make sure that there's no wrong interpretation

938
00:46:30,644 --> 00:46:31,365
of the changes.

939
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:35,147
Right, so patches.

940
00:46:36,989 --> 00:46:37,589
Last segment.

941
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:41,191
So, obviously, if you're gonna do a lot of services

942
00:46:42,172 --> 00:46:43,033
and a lot of the content,

943
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:44,854
you're gonna do a lot of patches.

944
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:49,717
And we have a crazy cadence where we would do patches

945
00:46:49,757 --> 00:46:51,979
and not fix every two weeks about.

946
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:55,681
So, we did about five million, give or take,

947
00:46:56,121 --> 00:46:58,502
different patches, and I think that we did

948
00:46:58,742 --> 00:47:02,044
all the mistakes possible when doing patches.

949
00:47:02,644 --> 00:47:05,906
So, I prepared a blitz of different mistakes,

950
00:47:06,286 --> 00:47:07,587
so we'll go quickly through them.

951
00:47:09,128 --> 00:47:11,309
Huge patch to download with no player-facing changes.

952
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,810
Patches are too far apart.

953
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:15,851
Patches are too close together.

954
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:18,293
IPing a patch that never comes.

955
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:20,804
Iping a patch that doesn't deliver.

956
00:47:21,645 --> 00:47:23,526
Forget to communicate about an awesome patch.

957
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:24,527
Nobody knows about it.

958
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:26,669
Patching without patch notes.

959
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:30,031
Leaving space to interpretation in the patch notes.

960
00:47:30,652 --> 00:47:32,774
Forgetting to mention the change in the patch notes.

961
00:47:33,694 --> 00:47:35,556
Forgetting to remove the mention of a change

962
00:47:35,576 --> 00:47:37,037
that was reverted in the patch notes.

963
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:41,000
Patching on a Friday because of limited support

964
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,222
during the weekend, that's bad, you know about that one.

965
00:47:43,963 --> 00:47:46,064
Patching on a Thursday because one day is not enough.

966
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,340
Patching on a Wednesday because two days is not enough.

967
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:52,562
Patching on a Thursday because the last four patches

968
00:47:52,602 --> 00:47:54,843
were awesome and surely this one will be too.

969
00:47:54,863 --> 00:47:56,424
Horrible mistake.

970
00:47:57,325 --> 00:48:00,747
Patching just before the holidays against limited support.

971
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,688
Patching because it's time.

972
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:04,963
Horrible.

973
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:08,505
Patching a bug fix which heavily impacts the game balance.

974
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:10,986
Patching a balance pass on a character

975
00:48:11,006 --> 00:48:12,247
that released yesterday.

976
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:14,488
Nah, that can't happen.

977
00:48:15,188 --> 00:48:17,229
Patching with data we don't want to reveal just yet,

978
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:18,490
so we did a couple of leaks.

979
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,731
Patching PC way before patching on console,

980
00:48:22,072 --> 00:48:23,132
they're gonna be mad about it.

981
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:26,514
And patching console one hour before patching on PC.

982
00:48:26,714 --> 00:48:28,295
They're gonna be super pissed about it.

983
00:48:30,216 --> 00:48:32,057
So some best practices, I don't want to go through

984
00:48:32,097 --> 00:48:34,019
all of them, but some important ones,

985
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:36,841
if this wasn't clear enough, patch early in the week

986
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:38,362
so that you can outfix.

987
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:40,864
Have an emergency plan.

988
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,686
So we put a pipeline for this, which is great.

989
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:47,428
So if something happens during a weekend or an evening,

990
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:50,851
the team members can know who to contact

991
00:48:50,871 --> 00:48:52,912
so that the problem is fixed as soon as possible.

992
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:57,526
And PTB, so public test build, super easy on Steam.

993
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:03,267
Whenever possible, you can create this specific build,

994
00:49:03,547 --> 00:49:05,948
give to the player before it's actually released.

995
00:49:06,328 --> 00:49:08,348
They will test it, they will be able to comment.

996
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:10,769
If you have the analytics in there, it's super useful

997
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:12,649
to see if your patch is gonna be okay.

998
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:14,589
And you can even do a survey to make sure

999
00:49:14,629 --> 00:49:16,810
that you get the feedback you want from your community.

1000
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,671
So lesson here, probably the lesson of lesson

1001
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:22,431
for our project.

1002
00:49:24,385 --> 00:49:26,005
You can fail, it's fine.

1003
00:49:26,346 --> 00:49:28,586
We did a lot of mistake, it's fine.

1004
00:49:29,547 --> 00:49:31,948
Acknowledge, learn out of them,

1005
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:34,049
become better, and then repeat.

1006
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:40,591
So as a summary, I want to expose what I feel

1007
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:44,393
are the big points that made our project successful.

1008
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:47,734
One, create a remarkable game

1009
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:49,095
with unique flavors and emotions.

1010
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,936
Two, consistently redefine the game

1011
00:49:51,976 --> 00:49:53,216
with new content and updates.

1012
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:56,596
Three, work end-in-end with the community,

1013
00:49:56,876 --> 00:49:57,777
give them ownership.

1014
00:49:58,837 --> 00:50:00,659
Four, be available to your players,

1015
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:02,740
be transparent, honest, and generous.

1016
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:06,583
Five, be passionate and stay true to your vision.

1017
00:50:08,424 --> 00:50:09,845
And thank you.

1018
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:22,393
OK, so we have a bit of time here, if you want to ask

1019
00:50:22,413 --> 00:50:25,295
questions, and then we can go somewhere else.

1020
00:50:25,335 --> 00:50:27,716
I think there's a wrap up section that we

1021
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:29,076
can use afterwards.

1022
00:50:31,137 --> 00:50:32,998
Matt is also with me, so if you have questions for him,

1023
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:40,001
please go to the mic if you have some.

1024
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:45,123
All right, easy peasy.

1025
00:50:50,116 --> 00:50:53,737
So you talked a little bit about responding to the meta.

1026
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:58,419
Has there been anything you've seen where you created an item

1027
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:02,160
or a perk, and you expected it would be used in one certain

1028
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,681
way, and then as soon as you saw the way players were

1029
00:51:03,721 --> 00:51:05,181
actually using it, you were like, that wasn't what that

1030
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:08,562
was for, that wasn't our intention with that change?

1031
00:51:10,663 --> 00:51:11,243
Absolutely.

1032
00:51:11,643 --> 00:51:12,023
For sure.

1033
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:16,765
I don't have an example that comes to mind.

1034
00:51:17,025 --> 00:51:17,425
Do you have one?

1035
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:20,489
The party starters?

1036
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,511
That was use, that was use okay, I guess.

1037
00:51:26,452 --> 00:51:27,352
I don't know, yes.

1038
00:51:28,393 --> 00:51:32,715
I mean, or we didn't expect to be that important.

1039
00:51:33,095 --> 00:51:34,356
That is one that happened.

1040
00:51:34,836 --> 00:51:38,258
For example, borrowed time or decisive strike.

1041
00:51:38,418 --> 00:51:39,858
We knew they were going to be important.

1042
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:42,560
You know, second chance perk or huge.

1043
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:46,942
But that they would cause so much pain to the killers,

1044
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:47,702
that was a surprise.

1045
00:51:49,602 --> 00:51:52,483
Um, yeah.

1046
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:15,547
So doing licensed character are super interesting creatively actually because you know

1047
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:22,909
They they're already established and making their power fit into our game is sometime a big challenge when we started working on Freddy

1048
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,791
You know which exist in another world only in your nightmares like okay?

1049
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:31,752
This is gonna be it's gonna be a challenge and these limitation are actually super fun

1050
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:36,494
Original character where we can go you know anywhere is also is also a lot of fun

1051
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:40,035
But yeah licensed character with this challenges is it's quite cool

1052
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:41,392
I mean, it's not a problem.

1053
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:43,434
It's really a fun thing to have.

1054
00:52:45,235 --> 00:52:45,956
One last question.

1055
00:52:46,517 --> 00:52:50,840
How many killer ideas did you come up with did you not use?

1056
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:52,222
Wow.

1057
00:52:53,323 --> 00:52:59,528
We have a dump of character in our documentation.

1058
00:52:59,548 --> 00:53:02,751
And we might have.

1059
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,670
30-ish, just waiting there.

1060
00:53:07,031 --> 00:53:08,551
So they might come up in the future.

1061
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:10,391
They're not necessarily cut,

1062
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:12,272
but sometimes it's just a matter of time,

1063
00:53:12,312 --> 00:53:15,833
like this one is too complicated for now, so, or, yeah.

1064
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:19,173
It's one that's definitely cut, yeah.

1065
00:53:20,094 --> 00:53:20,834
Oh yeah, the flying one.

1066
00:53:21,354 --> 00:53:23,114
Well, maybe one day, I don't know.

1067
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:25,635
Yeah, we did have a killer in the prototype

1068
00:53:25,655 --> 00:53:29,476
that was flying, so of course it's kinda OP in that case.

1069
00:53:29,996 --> 00:53:30,856
Yeah, we got rid of that one.

1070
00:53:33,036 --> 00:53:33,177
Yes.

1071
00:53:33,515 --> 00:53:37,478
I just had a question about how you worked together with the Payday 2 team to do that

1072
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:39,019
kind of cross-promotion with the masks.

1073
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,762
Did you have any kind of information exchange?

1074
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,544
Did you learn stuff from them on Payday 2?

1075
00:53:44,884 --> 00:53:45,945
Do you still speak?

1076
00:53:47,046 --> 00:53:48,167
Yeah, for sure.

1077
00:53:48,247 --> 00:53:54,032
I mean, our relationship with Starbreeze when we started this project, we learned a lot

1078
00:53:54,112 --> 00:53:55,193
of them, out of them.

1079
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:59,757
I mean, how to build up that community, that's, I mean, for sure.

1080
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:03,654
Do you have anything to add to that question, Matt?

1081
00:54:04,614 --> 00:54:04,794
No.

1082
00:54:04,894 --> 00:54:09,016
I thought the collaboration was, especially at the beginning,

1083
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:10,837
it was sort of invisible to us.

1084
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:14,099
Like, they did the masks, and they showed us afterwards.

1085
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:14,979
And I'm like, yeah, OK.

1086
00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:16,920
That's sort of what they like to do,

1087
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,381
because they didn't really know the game.

1088
00:54:18,441 --> 00:54:20,882
But they trusted us to do the game.

1089
00:54:20,902 --> 00:54:23,343
And they sort of left us to do it.

1090
00:54:23,483 --> 00:54:23,663
Yeah.

1091
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:25,904
And they were just super supportive.

1092
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:27,645
But they didn't want to touch it.

1093
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:27,925
Yeah.

1094
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:36,950
But it was good because they said, you will do the push to

1095
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,831
push the visibility of this project.

1096
00:54:41,232 --> 00:54:42,653
You will have to work hard for it.

1097
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:44,755
And we wanted to do this.

1098
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:49,338
It's our game, and we wanted to be involved in our community

1099
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:50,098
and build it up.

1100
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:54,401
So it was guidance, and then we did all the hard work,

1101
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:54,621
really.

1102
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:56,998
Just had one kind of follow-up question.

1103
00:54:57,799 --> 00:55:00,360
Did you find that you had a lot of overlap from players that

1104
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,542
were, you said you had a pretty good conversion of players

1105
00:55:03,562 --> 00:55:06,603
who tried Dead by Daylight that came from the Payday 2

1106
00:55:06,884 --> 00:55:07,184
audience?

1107
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:08,785
I think so.

1108
00:55:08,985 --> 00:55:10,786
I don't have any stats.

1109
00:55:11,446 --> 00:55:14,968
But I mean, at first, building that community and having

1110
00:55:15,008 --> 00:55:18,950
people in our beta, a lot came from the Payday community.

1111
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:19,571
That's for sure.

1112
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:21,912
The first 10,000.

1113
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:22,172
Right.

1114
00:55:22,792 --> 00:55:23,873
So he said the first 10,000.

1115
00:55:25,752 --> 00:55:27,093
At least, give it a go.

1116
00:55:28,655 --> 00:55:28,795
No.

1117
00:55:30,456 --> 00:55:31,017
Great, thanks.

1118
00:55:31,477 --> 00:55:31,878
No problem.

1119
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,821
Anyone else?

1120
00:55:38,723 --> 00:55:39,064
OK.

1121
00:55:39,084 --> 00:55:40,765
Thank you so much.
