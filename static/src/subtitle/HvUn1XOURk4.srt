1
00:00:06,984 --> 00:00:09,425
So today we're here to talk about

2
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:13,827
unpacking player spending in free-to-play games.

3
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:17,089
First, I'm gonna tell you a little bit about me.

4
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:17,569
Who am I?

5
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:19,070
That's a great question.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,273
I'm VP of Insights and Analytics at Kongregate,

7
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:26,915
and I do some other stuff other than games,

8
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:30,937
and I've had a fair amount of experience in the industry.

9
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:34,699
And I have great help when building decks.

10
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:39,724
So, telling you a little bit about Kongregate first.

11
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:44,072
So, Kongregate has been around for 13 years now.

12
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:45,635
We started as a web platform.

13
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:48,832
We're also a mobile publisher.

14
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:53,717
We have over 200 million mobile installs since 2013,

15
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:59,023
over 10 million monthly active users, over 60 games published,

16
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,386
and over 120k games on the web.

17
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:04,429
And a lot of the data that I'm going to be using today

18
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:05,711
is from those games.

19
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:05,751
So.

20
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,873
What's really interesting about being a publisher

21
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:11,555
in a web platform is that we get access to a lot of data.

22
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:15,998
So we can do these analyses across many, many games

23
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:19,081
and get some understanding on general trends

24
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:22,163
across all of these free-to-play games.

25
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:27,827
Some games that we've published, Adventure, Capitalist,

26
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:31,650
Animation Throwdown, I'm going to use both of them

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,493
a fair amount today and a couple of other more recent games

28
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:35,833
as well.

29
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,613
So what can you expect today?

30
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:42,918
I really hope I can deliver on that promise

31
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:44,660
of analytics and insights,

32
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,887
and be able to share with you as much data as possible,

33
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:51,611
go into a little bit deeper analysis,

34
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,054
intermingle some examples in there.

35
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:58,396
Hopefully it's a lot of data that is very useful

36
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:02,598
and that gives you not a checklist of best practices,

37
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:06,520
but more of a framework on how to think about monetization.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,100
My goal is not to give you,

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,882
hey, go implement this feature, this feature,

40
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,002
and this feature.

41
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,023
That's up to you on how you do that.

42
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:17,865
My goal here is to give you ideas and inspiration

43
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:21,166
on develop what works best for your game.

44
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:26,661
All right, so to warm up a little bit,

45
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:28,883
and please don't be shy,

46
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:32,225
we're among a small gathering of friends.

47
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,746
Can you please raise your hand

48
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:36,368
if you've ever played a free-to-play game?

49
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:39,631
Cool, leave them up, leave them up, leave them up.

50
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:41,832
All right.

51
00:02:41,832 --> 00:02:43,413
Can you put your hand down

52
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,855
if you've only played a free-to-play game for work?

53
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:50,617
Cool, awesome.

54
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:54,879
Can you, okay, lower your hands.

55
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,640
Don't get tired.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,842
Can you please raise your hand if you've ever spent

57
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:04,044
on a free-to-play game?

58
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:04,284
All right.

59
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,505
Plenty of hands, but not as many.

60
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:08,246
And you can put them down.

61
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:13,688
Can you raise them again if you've only spent for fun,

62
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:14,368
not for work?

63
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:18,813
So.

64
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,076
way fewer hands.

65
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:25,600
And even though it was a fair amount of hands up there,

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,382
you can see that it was a small group of people

67
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:29,603
or a smaller group of people.

68
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:34,787
And this is even an audience and people of the industry

69
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:39,151
that know how things happen, how the sausage is made,

70
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:40,492
why you should spend,

71
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:42,633
and it's still a small percentage of people.

72
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,776
So that is basically why we're here

73
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:48,278
to talk about spending in free-to-play games.

74
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:56,958
So, over the years, the free-to-play industry has really matured how we think about monetization.

75
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,199
We've learned things over the years.

76
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,960
We've diversified our revenue sources.

77
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:09,263
But at the end of the day, you know, even looking at our own revenue sources for Congregate,

78
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:11,004
in-app purchases are still a big chunk.

79
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:13,325
We've been able to diversify this.

80
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:15,879
it's still extremely important.

81
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,800
And throughout all these years,

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,560
one of the things that I was googling

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,261
for preparing for this talk,

84
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:24,881
and I was like, okay, let's see

85
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,382
what the conventional wisdom is on the internet,

86
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:31,403
because obviously that's a source of truth.

87
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:35,624
And most blog posts and, you know,

88
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:38,825
deconstructs from 2012 to today,

89
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:42,466
they all kind of have two big pieces in there.

90
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:47,869
Most players will never spend in your game.

91
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:52,536
And most revenue will come from a small, very small,

92
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:55,120
percentage of players.

93
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,245
But now we know, IAP is important.

94
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,701
But where do these learnings come from?

95
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,682
We should not take these at face value.

96
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:07,464
We should continue to validate whether this is true, and

97
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:09,665
we should be able to understand it further.

98
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:11,565
We have more data now.

99
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:16,367
So first, I'm gonna start by validating some of these

100
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:19,148
kind of conventional pieces of wisdom.

101
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:23,290
And then I'll dive into understanding what's happening

102
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,311
with spending patterns and free to play spending.

103
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:31,422
So a little bit of a philosophical question.

104
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:34,645
Can anyone that walks into your game can become a spender?

105
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:40,771
And it is a question that's hard to answer.

106
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:43,935
But we can at least look at some data

107
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:48,259
to better understand what the patterns and trends tell us.

108
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:53,888
If we look at percent buyers, we split this across genres

109
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:56,771
of games that we've published at Congregate,

110
00:05:56,771 --> 00:06:01,697
and we looked at how many players have ever spent.

111
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:06,722
And looking at it by genres, we have a few games

112
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:11,147
that are casual and hyper-casual, idle incremental games.

113
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:16,920
So you can see that the ranges are different,

114
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,800
but it's still a very narrow band.

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,922
In fact, most games see kind of a max of 5%

116
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:26,763
of players will ever spend.

117
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:29,524
So it kind of does validate that idea

118
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:32,265
of a very few percentage of players

119
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:33,386
will ever spend on your game.

120
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,030
But I wanted to validate this a little bit further.

121
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,552
So I looked back to kongregate.com,

122
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:42,034
as I said, we have a lot of games up there.

123
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:48,019
So I took the same time frame, 2014 to today, or yesterday,

124
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:49,541
and I took the top 500 games.

125
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:55,306
And it's a little bit of a busy chart,

126
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:58,128
but at the bottom, it's the rank by revenue,

127
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:02,171
and on the y-axis is the percentage of payers.

128
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:09,708
And what we can see here is that most games fall on the 1% to 3% buyer rate.

129
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:15,733
So it validates what we're seeing on mobile games and

130
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:19,916
across many, many more games, a bigger pool of games.

131
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:25,100
And we see there a little bit,

132
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,965
few games going up 5%, 6%, but it's still this narrow band.

133
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,124
I will caveat a little bit this.

134
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:37,244
Looking back, kind of 2010, 2011.

135
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:43,434
2012, Kongregate did get a lot of Asian MMOs uploaded

136
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:45,755
and very popular on the platform,

137
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:48,296
and those games, I exclude them intentionally

138
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:50,376
because they have very different mechanics

139
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:52,917
and they do see very different metrics.

140
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:56,118
And at that point, we are seeing

141
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:59,199
kind of go beyond those ranges,

142
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,540
but it is not representative of like

143
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,881
the majority of recent games that we've seen.

144
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:07,502
So, this took us to a next question.

145
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:12,318
are some players more likely to spend than others?

146
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:15,480
So is there something there that some players

147
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,684
have this inclination to, or higher likelihood to spend?

148
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:27,388
So what we did here is, you know,

149
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:30,850
looking at our games in the portfolio,

150
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,032
see have they gone from one game to another?

151
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,493
Have they spent in both games?

152
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:43,365
All right, so taking the total spenders

153
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:48,830
have ever spent on a single congregate game on mobile,

154
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,514
we saw 40% play two or more games.

155
00:08:53,514 --> 00:08:57,857
And from there, 17% of those spend on at least two games.

156
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:02,890
And while this doesn't give us a concrete answer,

157
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,670
what it does start hinting at is that

158
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,811
these players are not your random player.

159
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:12,072
If we were thinking about that 5% that, you know,

160
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:14,453
you're any player on the street,

161
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,433
or likelihood of them spending,

162
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:19,054
only five of them will ever spend,

163
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:21,315
in this case, it's much higher.

164
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:23,695
So it is starting to tell us something about,

165
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:27,516
you know, there's certain players that are more willing or,

166
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:31,799
come in with a different expectation on whether they will spend on a game or not.

167
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:37,122
All right, so to summarize a little bit what we've seen up to this point,

168
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:44,407
our conventional wisdom holds, I would say.

169
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:46,608
Some players are more likely to spend than others.

170
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:53,172
And this is what gives us that narrow band of spenders or percent buyers.

171
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,199
And I have a little note there that says,

172
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,341
please don't call them whales.

173
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:03,264
This is a call out to a talk from

174
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:05,926
Congregate CEO Emily Greer.

175
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:08,308
She gave many years ago, and I really, really like it

176
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,251
because calling them whales kind of

177
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:15,714
takes this human piece out of the person,

178
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,915
we're just like hunting for whales,

179
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:21,037
and they're much more valuable to us than that.

180
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,679
They're real people that are passionate

181
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,360
about the games that we're building,

182
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,702
and we should treat them with that respect.

183
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:30,683
All right, so.

184
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,336
Other than that little side note,

185
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:37,700
the reason we want to talk about spend on monetization

186
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,962
is because, at the end of the day,

187
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:44,586
free-to-play lives and breathes out of being able to monetize.

188
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:49,431
So successful games, you want to live operate your game

189
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,912
for many, many, many years.

190
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,333
And the way to grow your game is grow your LTV,

191
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:00,136
grow your ARPU, that is, you want to maximize

192
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:01,977
your player's lifetime value,

193
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:05,579
or some people call it average revenue per user.

194
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,241
And yes, but how?

195
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:12,303
Or how can I measure my progress?

196
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,025
Or how can I focus my efforts?

197
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:18,129
If lifetime value, I can only measure it

198
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:23,490
at the end of the lifetime, how can I focus

199
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:29,331
into knowing that I'm changing and moving the right metrics

200
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:31,252
and putting the right content into the game

201
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:35,373
that's gonna give me that result?

202
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,493
So it all starts with a KPI letter soup.

203
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:43,423
Some of us are very used to just throwing acronyms out there.

204
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:46,045
And in fact, what I've encountered is that

205
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:48,727
some companies use them in different ways.

206
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:51,929
So I wanted to kind of just go through them quickly

207
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:53,970
so that you know what I'm talking about.

208
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,253
So we start with ARPU, Average Revenue Per User,

209
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,515
and I'm gonna use that to also

210
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:03,016
kind of reference lifetime value.

211
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:08,598
We have ARBPUPU, average revenue per paying user.

212
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:13,300
So this is all only your payers.

213
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,281
We have your percent buyers.

214
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,921
Some people call them percent buyers,

215
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:18,582
percent payers, percent spenders.

216
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:23,843
ARBDAO, average revenue per daily active user.

217
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,525
So this is once you start looking at daily metrics.

218
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,153
ARPT, average revenue per transaction,

219
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,115
so how big are those transactions?

220
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:40,998
Conversion rate, some people call it first-time spenders,

221
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:44,361
some people get confused with conversion rate

222
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:45,582
and percent buyers.

223
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:49,665
Percent repeat spenders, so once they spend once,

224
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:51,106
do they spend again?

225
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:54,449
Number of transactions, retention, lifetime sessions,

226
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,392
MAU, DAU, whew, but,

227
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,714
The first acronym I used was KPI.

228
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:09,036
And we forget that the first part there,

229
00:13:09,036 --> 00:13:12,217
KPI is key performance indicator.

230
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:17,159
So how can I be measuring my key performance indicators

231
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,659
if I'm looking at 20 metrics?

232
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:23,611
So the rest of today, I'm gonna spend digging into this

233
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:27,374
to hopefully unearth what we can actually think of

234
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:31,157
as our key performance indicators for monetization.

235
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:36,320
And it starts with understanding

236
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,045
that not all KPIs or metrics are created equal.

237
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:45,379
Some will give us more insight than others.

238
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:49,442
Some will give us more actionable insights than others.

239
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:53,985
And some are more relevant and more aligned with your goals.

240
00:13:53,985 --> 00:13:59,649
And for today, that goal and what we're talking about

241
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:02,611
is increasing your ARPU or your LTV.

242
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:07,874
So what we can do to understand this is determine

243
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:11,879
which KPI matters the most.

244
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,380
So how can we do that?

245
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,800
Back to our goal.

246
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,261
We want strong ARPU.

247
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,682
What we can do is figure out which KPIs

248
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:26,643
have a strong relationship with ARPU.

249
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:33,205
So in that case, if we move that KPI,

250
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,906
we will hopefully be moving our ARPU.

251
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:38,246
And...

252
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:41,275
At the end of the day, we can focus on these

253
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:44,078
to get the most out of the time that we're spending

254
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,541
on our roadmapping, live operations,

255
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:51,844
content generation, new feature releases.

256
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:53,185
And how can we do this?

257
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:57,809
So it is time for some correlation analysis.

258
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:02,614
So, what does this mean?

259
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:07,915
You can learn all the math, but you can also go and use Excel or R or Python

260
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:10,498
and actually do this very easily and quickly.

261
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:14,241
And we can model the relationship between two variables,

262
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,662
in our case, two KPIs.

263
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:19,465
And the question that we're trying to answer is,

264
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:22,688
can one KPI influence the other?

265
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:27,632
And we calculate our R-square.

266
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:29,874
What does it mean? Why does it matter?

267
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,871
What r-square tells us, and I'm gonna use,

268
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:35,271
I'm gonna show you the r-squares

269
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:37,433
of all the correlations that I did,

270
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:40,354
is if we are close to zero,

271
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:42,415
there's no relationship between the two things

272
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:44,276
that we're comparing.

273
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,519
If it's one, you're like predicting the future almost.

274
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,560
But there's a perfect correlation.

275
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,341
I've never seen that.

276
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:53,321
All right, so which KPIs?

277
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:02,888
have a strong relationship with RBoom.

278
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:04,469
And I'll keep coming back to this.

279
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:10,733
And similar to how I showed the percent buyers by genre,

280
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:14,235
I will be showing all of these KPIs and their ranges.

281
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:17,597
And one thing to keep in mind is that

282
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:19,718
it doesn't mean that a game within that genre,

283
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:22,079
because you might be like looking at this and be like,

284
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,681
oh, I have an idle game, and it's not that number.

285
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,202
It's higher or it's lower.

286
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,037
games can fall outside of these ranges.

287
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:33,659
What I try to do is narrow it to the most frequent behavior.

288
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,181
So, before we jump into our first correlation,

289
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:42,345
I wanna kind of go a little bit through

290
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:44,666
how to read a bunch of the charts

291
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,048
that we're about to look at.

292
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,990
So, in every chart,

293
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,111
the dots

294
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:57,906
signify one game, and the color is a genre.

295
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:02,327
The reason I did this is because for some correlations,

296
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:07,368
we're gonna go a little bit deeper and split it by genre,

297
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:10,689
because in some cases, that starts to have an impact.

298
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:16,791
On the x-axis, we're gonna have what we call

299
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,411
the independent variable, which is basically

300
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:21,892
the thing that we're trying to see

301
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:23,012
if it impacts the other thing.

302
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:28,485
And, sorry, transitions, okay.

303
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:32,968
And on the y-axis, we have our dependent variable.

304
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:38,593
One quick technical note for the math nerds.

305
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:44,496
In this case, monetization variables tend to be curves,

306
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,438
which means that a linear regression wouldn't have worked

307
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:48,419
for all of this analysis.

308
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,280
So the numbers that you see on the axis,

309
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,441
that's why I left them super small,

310
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,623
because they don't mean anything.

311
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:56,145
I actually transformed the numbers

312
00:17:56,145 --> 00:18:00,989
to take the logarithm values and be able to do

313
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:04,511
a safe linear regression that actually means something.

314
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:08,054
All right, with that out of the way.

315
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:12,867
time for some correlation analysis.

316
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:16,228
First, we looked at sessions.

317
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:20,409
And it all starts there, right?

318
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,129
We need players playing the games.

319
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:26,690
And I used sessions as a proxy for engagement.

320
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,211
The reason I did this is because it's universal

321
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:31,951
to all games.

322
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:37,826
And you know, you could do retention or days retained,

323
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,868
some other types of engagement,

324
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,209
but different games will measure it a little bit different

325
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,470
and it will impact that.

326
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,453
So, I chose this, you can choose another metric to do this.

327
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:56,137
So, on the correlation, what we saw is a correlation

328
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:57,518
or R-square of .46.

329
00:18:57,518 --> 00:19:00,960
And asking our correlation meter,

330
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,120
it said that it's pretty good.

331
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:07,408
And the reason it's pretty good is,

332
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:09,669
it's really hard, especially in kind of more

333
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:13,630
behavioral analytics, to get to higher numbers.

334
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,331
Like some other fields will want to aim for much higher

335
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:18,872
before they call it good.

336
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:21,013
But for behavioral analytics,

337
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:24,054
getting to this 0.46 range

338
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,534
is already a pretty good correlation.

339
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:29,516
And if you think about it, this makes sense.

340
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:31,617
The longer someone is in the game,

341
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:36,829
the more they will probably spend.

342
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:39,311
All right, so that's good.

343
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,772
We wanna keep players.

344
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:44,174
But we're gonna be talking mostly about monetization.

345
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:53,060
Next, I looked at average minimum price point

346
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,921
that players spend on.

347
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:58,783
So what this means is on average for a game,

348
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:03,169
what's the lowest amount that players spent?

349
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:08,072
And what this means is it's either

350
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:09,932
we're offering very low price points

351
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,673
if the number is very low,

352
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:14,975
or the lowest price points are the most popular ones.

353
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,699
Here's our pretty graph.

354
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:22,499
And asking a,

355
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:28,142
looking at the R-square is .31,

356
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:28,522
which.

357
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,932
It's not great.

358
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:34,354
And the reason I wanted to look at this

359
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:37,277
is because I often hear people say,

360
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,900
you know, you just need to get a player to spend,

361
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,681
even if it's at a low price.

362
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:48,026
Just get them to spend 99 cents, and then you're good.

363
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:52,190
And this actually tells you that that's not the case.

364
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,354
Let's go to the flip side, max price points.

365
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:57,575
Same approach with max points.

366
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:00,849
The reason I wanted to look at this is some teams

367
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:02,250
are scared of prices.

368
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:08,475
And the reality is, don't be scared of high prices.

369
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:12,238
Don't be scared of offering items and content

370
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,879
at very high prices.

371
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:19,784
If you have the right offering, players will wanna buy it.

372
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:26,869
So looking at our R-square, 0.6.

373
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,210
That is really strong.

374
00:21:31,113 --> 00:21:35,195
So, low prices, not great.

375
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:36,655
High prices, great.

376
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:39,236
Now let's look at the average.

377
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:45,038
So, for this I took average revenue per transaction,

378
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,179
that's what the acronym means.

379
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,240
And this is the average transaction size, basically.

380
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,361
And looking at our R-square, 0.5, that is?

381
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:57,755
Really good.

382
00:21:57,755 --> 00:22:02,997
So what this is telling us is that

383
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:04,518
the higher transaction size on average,

384
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:07,359
the higher the ARPU we'll see.

385
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,519
To recap what we have so far,

386
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,160
sessions matter.

387
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,141
This is where it all starts.

388
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:16,322
Make a fun game.

389
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:20,403
We're gonna talk a lot about monetization and revenue,

390
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:22,864
but what really matters is to start with a fun game.

391
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:27,281
And price point matters.

392
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:30,542
They really matter.

393
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:34,123
So we're gonna take a little break from correlations

394
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:36,943
and dig into pricing.

395
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:47,485
All right, wanted to start with

396
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:51,046
low concept of this is your game.

397
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:52,866
Your game is kind of like a monopoly.

398
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,961
It's its own economy.

399
00:22:55,961 --> 00:23:01,184
You are the only person offering those goods.

400
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:05,486
So if you are Animation Throwdown,

401
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:10,508
you are the only one selling gems and jiggity-whats

402
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:14,089
and golden turds and all sorts of other funky things.

403
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:19,332
And you need to look at your game

404
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:21,253
to determine how to price your game.

405
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:28,233
So, how should you decide your game's pricing?

406
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:34,036
It all starts with elasticity of goods.

407
00:23:34,036 --> 00:23:36,537
What does that mean?

408
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:40,759
Well, there's two types of goods.

409
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:46,362
Imagine your gems, animation throwdowns gems.

410
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:50,784
If we were to decrease the price of our gems,

411
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:57,646
and a revenue decreases, that means that

412
00:23:57,646 --> 00:24:01,447
we might have gotten more purchases by lowering our price,

413
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:05,169
but the revenue decreased,

414
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,169
so the gems are what we call elastic.

415
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:13,752
Basically, demand moves with price.

416
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,673
Now, if the revenue decreases,

417
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:18,433
sorry, that was revenue increasing.

418
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,754
So revenue increases, more purchases.

419
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,394
Gems are elastic.

420
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:27,394
Revenue decreases.

421
00:24:27,394 --> 00:24:29,195
Purchase go up slightly.

422
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:31,235
People are excited about this.

423
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:34,636
But not enough to make up for you dropping your price.

424
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:37,717
What that means is that gems are inelastic,

425
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:39,637
and you can think about that way.

426
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:45,918
Is it moving with the price elastically or not?

427
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:46,138
So,

428
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:50,959
Which one is gems or virtual goods?

429
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:55,222
And the reason this is important is because it helps us understand

430
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:57,824
how fluid you can be with your pricing.

431
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:06,037
For this, I am taking an example or case study

432
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:10,601
from one of our games, Adventure Capitalist,

433
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:14,304
by a studio up in Canada called HyperHippo.

434
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:19,348
And this is from about a little bit less than a year ago.

435
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:22,410
So, about a year ago,

436
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,714
the team had a first-time buyer special,

437
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:28,135
prize at $7.99.

438
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:28,575
And they,

439
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:35,791
they were wondering what happens if we lower the price?

440
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,893
We'll get more people to buy it.

441
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:39,433
What happened?

442
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:44,076
Let's look at the first purchase rate

443
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,518
because this is a first time buyer bundle.

444
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:53,003
And what happened is that demand just went up like crazy.

445
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:54,924
So way more people were buying this.

446
00:25:55,876 --> 00:25:58,980
Even legacy players that had never converted,

447
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,482
you know, people that had been playing for a year or longer,

448
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:04,246
had never converted, saw this special and went for it.

449
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:08,871
But, did this actually help revenue?

450
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:14,307
For this case, we can look at our ARPDAU

451
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:17,209
and average revenue per daily active user.

452
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:20,671
And I will caveat that games are messy ecosystems

453
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:24,814
and try to control this information as much as possible

454
00:26:24,814 --> 00:26:33,059
to look at just one piece of one segment in the game.

455
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,281
Right when the price was lowered,

456
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,922
our ARPDAU declined drastically.

457
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:44,395
which means that our revenue declined.

458
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:47,538
So back to our original question.

459
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:55,304
Are virtual goods elastic or inelastic?

460
00:26:55,304 --> 00:26:57,506
Well, purchases went up, check.

461
00:26:57,506 --> 00:27:03,011
It did not compensate for the price drop, check.

462
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:07,475
Revenue declined, check, unfortunately.

463
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:17,314
So this starts hinting at virtual goods are mostly inelastic.

464
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:18,815
And I know that you're all very worried

465
00:27:18,815 --> 00:27:20,495
that revenue declines, so good news.

466
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:22,036
The team identified this quickly.

467
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:23,977
They reacted right away.

468
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,798
Always good with the capitalist world.

469
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:35,576
Another question I often hear around pricing is,

470
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:37,956
okay, cool, elasticity, inelasticity,

471
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,797
I don't understand that econ,

472
00:27:39,797 --> 00:27:44,098
but what if a lower price point

473
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:47,358
will help me get players to spend again?

474
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:49,979
So maybe it's not all about that single purchase,

475
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:53,379
it's about what comes after that.

476
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:56,280
I get them to spend once, they spend again.

477
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,500
So for that, I looked at

478
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:02,208
repeat purchase rates.

479
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,610
So starting with the overall portfolio,

480
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,831
looking at the second purchase rate.

481
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:11,213
And what we see across all our games.

482
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:16,596
So we had seen, sorry I'll show split by genres,

483
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:20,498
but just the average across our whole portfolio, 50%.

484
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,460
I'll use that as our baseline.

485
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,283
And then we'll compare it against

486
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:36,773
What these buckets are is the price point of the first purchase.

487
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:45,557
So someone spent, their first purchase was between $1 and $4, they'll fall under that

488
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,078
bucket.

489
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:53,741
And we'll see if they have a lower second purchase rate for lower prices.

490
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:53,921
They don't.

491
00:28:57,873 --> 00:28:59,593
It's slightly lower.

492
00:28:59,593 --> 00:29:03,514
So for that lower price point,

493
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:07,675
we don't see better chances to get a second purchase.

494
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:13,396
When we get to the five to 10 price range,

495
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:18,377
it's about the same as the overall portfolio.

496
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:21,718
And higher price points, much higher rebate spent.

497
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,259
This means.

498
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:34,433
that lower price points do not increase repeat spend.

499
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:38,336
We found that our sweet spot, and that's why

500
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:42,278
you see that most of our games fall under that,

501
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:44,119
is between five and $25.

502
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,741
But it really depends on the game.

503
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:51,104
So what I would recommend is that you find your sweet spot,

504
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:52,665
the sweet spot for your game.

505
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,126
It might be a little bit higher,

506
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,367
it might be a little bit lower.

507
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,203
Next, there's another piece to purchasing

508
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:06,725
and the first purchase that players see,

509
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:08,747
which is that they set expectations.

510
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:18,415
So looking at how high or low is the second purchase

511
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:22,418
compared to the first one, what we see

512
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:27,903
is that most players, that first bucket, 48% of them,

513
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:32,339
their second purchase will be at a lower price point

514
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,561
than their first purchase.

515
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:40,283
32 will be right at the same price point,

516
00:30:40,283 --> 00:30:46,466
and only 28% of them will spend at a higher price point.

517
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:50,708
So, if you price too low your initial offers,

518
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:55,330
you don't give yourself or your players wiggle room

519
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,052
to go down on that price point.

520
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:03,799
back to AdCap, because they kind of did this.

521
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,502
So looking at lifetime transactions,

522
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:11,565
based on their first purchase,

523
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:14,007
and I have the players who spent,

524
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,629
their first purchase was that $7.99 special,

525
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:20,972
that new $2.99 special, and then everyone else,

526
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:23,134
that first purchase was somewhere else.

527
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:27,317
And what we see is that for those who spent

528
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:29,999
their first purchase was the lower price point.

529
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:34,436
They have higher number of transactions

530
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:36,617
throughout their lifetime, cool,

531
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:41,438
but the revenue per transaction is lower.

532
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:46,799
And that results in the overall RPPU for those players,

533
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,420
or the average revenue per paying user,

534
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,301
so how much they're gonna spend in their lifetime,

535
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,801
was much lower, as you can see.

536
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:58,282
So, these two things combined tell us

537
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:01,229
that price anchoring is a real thing.

538
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:05,272
What does this mean?

539
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:09,255
Anchoring is that it's a cognitive bias that we humans,

540
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:12,578
even if we're like, no, I'm not gonna do that, it's there.

541
00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:17,762
We use the first piece of information

542
00:32:17,762 --> 00:32:20,264
to make future decisions.

543
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:23,506
And remember, your game is your monopoly.

544
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:28,070
So it means that a player only has your game

545
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:32,202
to make comparisons.

546
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:35,402
So the first prize or the first offer

547
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:38,163
that you present to that player will really

548
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:41,044
set the expectations and perceptions

549
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:44,065
and impact the decisions that they

550
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:45,445
will make for future prizes.

551
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:49,926
What this all means is don't set too low of a bar.

552
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,647
It's not going to help with repeat spending.

553
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:59,806
and it's not going to help with, if they do repeat spend,

554
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:03,549
with what are they gonna choose to buy

555
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:04,650
on that second purchase.

556
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,834
Cool, Tammy, so should I just increase

557
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:12,297
all the prices in my game?

558
00:33:12,297 --> 00:33:14,759
No, it is a careful balance.

559
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,342
And the price that you put in front of a player

560
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:21,925
has to be justified by the value that you're offering.

561
00:33:23,623 --> 00:33:29,385
So, to summarize our little pricing detour,

562
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:32,226
correlations with ARPU,

563
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:36,767
low price points or minimum transaction size doesn't matter.

564
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,767
Having higher matters.

565
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,328
Average transaction size matters.

566
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:45,409
Games are mostly inelastic.

567
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:49,130
And watch out for price anchoring.

568
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,250
Now, back to our correlations.

569
00:33:52,274 --> 00:33:57,596
Our original question was relationships with ARPU.

570
00:33:57,596 --> 00:34:00,577
And next up, we're gonna look at percent buyers.

571
00:34:00,577 --> 00:34:04,498
How many players will ever spend on a game?

572
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:11,160
These are the ranges that we had already talked about.

573
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,522
And asking our correlation meter,

574
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:16,682
holy smokes, that's very strong.

575
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:20,954
And that's fairly intuitive, right?

576
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:24,195
The more players I have spending, that's better,

577
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,836
but it's also good to see it in the data.

578
00:34:26,836 --> 00:34:32,237
And back to this idea that what I started with

579
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:36,778
is that only a narrow band of buyers will ever spend.

580
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:38,559
That is true, but it is still important

581
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,480
to make sure that you're getting those players.

582
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:50,291
And I have one more correlation for you with ARPU,

583
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:53,173
which is Average Revenue Per Paying User, or ARPUPU,

584
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:55,595
my favorite one because it's fun to say.

585
00:34:55,595 --> 00:35:00,519
And you can see that in this case,

586
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,401
the ranges are pretty different

587
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,182
as you go from genre to genre.

588
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:10,007
All right, so let's look at this.

589
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:13,289
.69, that is really strong.

590
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,191
But the ranges were different for different genres.

591
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:25,913
So I went down and separated this by genre

592
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:29,975
and see how it impacts the correlation

593
00:35:29,975 --> 00:35:32,476
between your Rppu and your Rppu.

594
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:37,938
Midcore games, that is very, very high.

595
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:40,319
What does that mean?

596
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:44,448
High investment per payer really matters

597
00:35:44,448 --> 00:35:46,449
for these mid-core games.

598
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:47,910
And it is fairly intuitive, right?

599
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,831
It's games where players come with the expectation

600
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:54,053
that they're gonna go very, very deep,

601
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:56,073
both in gameplay and spending.

602
00:35:57,912 --> 00:36:00,613
For idle games, it's actually still really strong.

603
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:02,955
And I wanted to have this because there's

604
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,497
this misconception that more casual games, it

605
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,118
doesn't matter as much.

606
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,099
It does.

607
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,742
Encouraging this strong investment per payer

608
00:36:12,742 --> 00:36:14,083
is really important.

609
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:19,546
And for casual games, not as high, still decent,

610
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,268
but it also makes sense.

611
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:23,329
You have a wider audience, and it

612
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,091
relies on different monetization mechanics.

613
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:34,646
So to summarize, RPPU, or investment per payer,

614
00:36:34,646 --> 00:36:39,728
also matters, and it varies by genre.

615
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:44,791
So we already saw that percent buyers and RPPU

616
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,032
are really, really important.

617
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:51,715
So I decided to go in and say, ask the question,

618
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:56,057
which KPIs have strong correlation to these two KPIs

619
00:36:56,057 --> 00:36:57,118
that really matter?

620
00:36:59,688 --> 00:37:05,292
And starting with sessions, sessions and percent buyers,

621
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,314
very strong, it makes sense.

622
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:11,017
Again, the more time a player spends in a game,

623
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:13,459
the likelier they are to invest in the game.

624
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:19,303
Next up, repeat spending and RPP.

625
00:37:20,528 --> 00:37:24,131
And in this case, what it means is

626
00:37:24,131 --> 00:37:28,755
that enabling steady investment from players

627
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:32,477
who wanna spend will give you a long,

628
00:37:32,477 --> 00:37:34,279
a high investment from those payers.

629
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:38,122
So you wanna get them to that second purchase.

630
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,883
You wanna get them to that third purchase,

631
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:40,564
that fourth purchase.

632
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:47,649
You wanna really get them going through that funnel.

633
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:48,790
And splitting that by genre.

634
00:37:49,742 --> 00:37:54,525
A lot of people forget to track this second purchase rate, and

635
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:57,507
it's very, very important.

636
00:37:57,507 --> 00:38:00,588
You already captured the people that were willing to spend, but

637
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:05,771
you wanna make sure that they're satisfied with their purchase.

638
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,092
Now, how can you measure that?

639
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:12,115
A very good way to measure that is, do they spend again?

640
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:17,953
So keep percent repeat spending in mind

641
00:38:17,953 --> 00:38:20,798
when you're monitoring your KPIs.

642
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:25,867
Quick example, and I'm gonna go super quick through this

643
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,369
because I think I'm running out of time.

644
00:38:28,978 --> 00:38:32,400
I wanted to use Animation Throwdown as an example here

645
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,641
because we see that they really have

646
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:37,202
best-in-class repeat spend.

647
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:42,064
And this is by a studio up in Chicago called Synapse Games.

648
00:38:42,064 --> 00:38:44,745
A little bit of history about Synapse

649
00:38:44,745 --> 00:38:48,626
is they have three CCGs, or card collecting games,

650
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:52,408
in the market already, and they've iterated

651
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:55,709
taking what's working from those games to the next one

652
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:56,850
and improving what isn't.

653
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:03,819
In 2013, they released a sci-fi one called Tyrant Unleashed.

654
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:08,343
The next iteration in 2015 was trying to reach a broader audience,

655
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:11,846
kind of a fantasy theme, Spellstone.

656
00:39:11,846 --> 00:39:18,471
And in 2016, we released Animation Throwdown with all five IPs

657
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:24,436
and a lot of very fun ride in getting that ready to launch.

658
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:28,937
So looking at their second purchase rate,

659
00:39:28,937 --> 00:39:31,698
so I'm just highlighting, this is the purchase funnel,

660
00:39:31,698 --> 00:39:34,419
but I'm just highlighting the second purchase.

661
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:37,180
Tyrant Unleashed had incredible repeat.

662
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:43,317
purchase rate. So from all the players that spent, 75% of them spent at least

663
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:52,201
another time. That is huge and it kind of makes sense. It was a very niche, hardcore

664
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:58,764
game. So next iteration, Spellstone, we saw a little bit of a drop but still very

665
00:39:58,764 --> 00:39:59,785
very strong. 67% for

666
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:03,246
spells down with a more approachable theme,

667
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:05,766
but still very strong monetization metrics.

668
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:08,707
In Animation Throwdown, 62%, it's still really strong.

669
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:14,449
More than half of the players who spend once

670
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:15,870
will spend two times,

671
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:20,591
and we were able to reach a bigger audience

672
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,412
even though the metrics took a small hit.

673
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:25,032
So it was kind of this balance between reach

674
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:26,273
and strong monetization.

675
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:32,107
Why and what do they do to be able to kind of repeat this

676
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:36,349
over the course of the years and multiple iterations

677
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:42,172
of the same type of game is their live service strategy.

678
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:46,615
So it has a very well-defined,

679
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:48,215
and this is for animation thrown out,

680
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:51,177
I just took a month, for example, or six weeks,

681
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:54,639
very strong and well-defined cadence of events.

682
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:58,784
and just quick info on the structure of a card

683
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:01,646
on animation throwdown.

684
00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:04,569
There's skills, we don't care about those,

685
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:07,492
attack, we don't care about those, and traits.

686
00:41:07,492 --> 00:41:10,494
You can see there's no numbers there.

687
00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:13,076
The other two are self-explanatory.

688
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:15,739
They're gonna do things against your opponent.

689
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,341
But traits, are they useless?

690
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:23,840
And they're not, but they're only useful for a limited time.

691
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,941
And this rotates.

692
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:29,826
So part of that LiveOps cadence has become,

693
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:34,190
for all these games, to grant a specific bonus or penalty

694
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,573
or something special happens to a trait

695
00:41:36,573 --> 00:41:39,536
for a limited amount of time.

696
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:42,339
And what that does is that it creates this

697
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,449
puzzle-solving mentality for players.

698
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:47,490
They want to find the right combination

699
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,893
that will give them the most powerful deck during this time.

700
00:41:50,893 --> 00:41:53,434
And you can't read that on the left,

701
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:58,358
but that's a Reddit post that as soon as a new bonus

702
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:02,620
was announced, the drunk one, people started posting,

703
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,881
like, just help me out.

704
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:05,783
What's the best combination?

705
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:08,484
What are the best combos that I can put together?

706
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,845
How should I optimize my deck?

707
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:12,265
so at the end of the day,

708
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:15,468
that they can have the strongest deck.

709
00:42:15,468 --> 00:42:19,952
So, part of this is timing also

710
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:22,714
the offers that are presented to the player.

711
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:26,737
And this is something that the team has iterated on

712
00:42:26,737 --> 00:42:30,160
very much, and finding the right cadence

713
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,485
of what types of exclusive cards should be offered

714
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:36,746
to match that active trait.

715
00:42:36,746 --> 00:42:38,447
In this case,

716
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:44,565
Original design that Animation Throwdown had

717
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:48,386
was this box idea, which has a bunch of boxes.

718
00:42:48,386 --> 00:42:52,787
You spend, you pull a card, and you can keep spending.

719
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:55,207
And basically, you can go through the whole box.

720
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:58,668
It literally is as if you're pulling things out of a box.

721
00:42:58,668 --> 00:43:04,050
In some, there's more kind of weak cards

722
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,570
than super strong cards.

723
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,611
But the idea is that, you know,

724
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:11,933
you pull everything, in this case,

725
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:14,334
nine, I don't know how many cards they had,

726
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:18,575
but if you pull everything out of the box,

727
00:43:18,575 --> 00:43:21,817
you get all the very, very strong cards.

728
00:43:21,817 --> 00:43:29,000
And what we see is that there's a very even engagement

729
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,160
with these boxes.

730
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:36,003
So the most committed players will regularly spend

731
00:43:36,003 --> 00:43:38,824
to get those cards from these boxes.

732
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:42,276
and it creates a very steady gem sink.

733
00:43:42,276 --> 00:43:44,417
So you see kind of these ups and downs,

734
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:46,337
that comes with the release of a new box.

735
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:49,959
But on average, you can see that throughout

736
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,600
week over week over week,

737
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,121
it is a very, very steady sink of gems,

738
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:58,903
which means that ultimately is people will need more gems

739
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,003
and spend more in the game.

740
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:07,383
Now if we look at just high spender players,

741
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:09,505
it is much higher, it is actually 2x.

742
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:12,186
So that tells us that your big spenders

743
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:19,090
are going even deeper.

744
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,691
In fact, 70 to 80% of the gems spent on these boxes

745
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:24,072
come from those spenders.

746
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:29,757
Just to summarize real quick, and I apologize

747
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:34,661
that I didn't get a chance to go a little bit slower on this,

748
00:44:34,661 --> 00:44:40,146
but it's really important to have a regular and deep content

749
00:44:40,146 --> 00:44:41,948
updates.

750
00:44:41,948 --> 00:44:45,191
And what you'll see is that it will give you

751
00:44:45,191 --> 00:44:46,972
what we call strong depth of spend, which

752
00:44:46,972 --> 00:44:51,516
means that players will want to go and do

753
00:44:51,516 --> 00:44:53,438
that second, third, fourth purchase.

754
00:44:55,532 --> 00:44:58,414
but only if it is a good purchase.

755
00:44:58,414 --> 00:44:59,554
So remember that.

756
00:44:59,554 --> 00:45:01,415
It's not just giving them things.

757
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:03,556
It has to make a difference on their game.

758
00:45:03,556 --> 00:45:07,058
And the way that we can measure the success of this

759
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:10,639
is by looking at repeat purchase rates.

760
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:11,720
And at the end of the day,

761
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,101
spending players will want to spend

762
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:16,082
if it's worth it, again.

763
00:45:16,082 --> 00:45:21,304
All right, so back to correlations.

764
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:22,165
This is the last one.

765
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:29,321
Which KPIs have a strong relationship with percent buyers in rppu? In this case, rppu.

766
00:45:29,321 --> 00:45:32,523
And I looked at lifetime time transactions.

767
00:45:32,523 --> 00:45:40,427
And the idea here is that, you know, it's not only about big purchases or getting them to that second purchase,

768
00:45:40,427 --> 00:45:43,848
but it's also about those multiple purchase. So

769
00:45:43,848 --> 00:45:47,870
many many more after the second one and hopefully you win by doing that.

770
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:53,007
and the correlation is super strong, .72.

771
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:55,088
That is one of the highest that we've seen.

772
00:45:55,088 --> 00:46:00,589
So you want to increase the number of transactions

773
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:03,650
that players are doing throughout their lifetime.

774
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:11,652
And I'm going to go back real quick to Animation Throwdown

775
00:46:11,652 --> 00:46:14,013
for an example on this.

776
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:18,340
Recently, the team actually iterated

777
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,780
on the design of their boxes.

778
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,242
So the boxes that we just looked at,

779
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:26,643
they've been running those in all of their games.

780
00:46:26,643 --> 00:46:31,805
And in December, they tested a new type of box,

781
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:33,846
which is called tier boxes.

782
00:46:33,846 --> 00:46:38,168
So tiers guarantee cards.

783
00:46:38,168 --> 00:46:42,049
You buy more, you go up tiers.

784
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,050
You're at a higher tier.

785
00:46:43,604 --> 00:46:44,745
the prize goes up.

786
00:46:44,745 --> 00:46:48,586
So it's kind of like a step, you're going up that ladder.

787
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:53,809
But the higher that tier, the better the value.

788
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:57,430
Kind of reduces a little bit of the randomness.

789
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:01,392
And just as an example here,

790
00:47:01,392 --> 00:47:04,353
in this case, you can buy for 200 gems.

791
00:47:04,353 --> 00:47:08,055
After you buy that tier, you are gonna go up

792
00:47:08,055 --> 00:47:11,296
and it's gonna be, I think, something like 500,

793
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:13,497
and it's just gonna keep going up.

794
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,551
and the best card is always there in front of you

795
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:22,593
so that you really, really, really want it.

796
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:26,095
All right, so looking at,

797
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:30,918
back to that percent DAU buying boxes, what happened?

798
00:47:30,918 --> 00:47:35,581
Well, on green we have our regular boxes

799
00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:36,422
that we had looked at,

800
00:47:36,422 --> 00:47:40,124
and in orange we have tier boxes.

801
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:43,026
During the testing period,

802
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,288
and even as we added it into our regular cadence,

803
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,972
it increased tremendously.

804
00:47:49,972 --> 00:47:52,492
So what this started saying is,

805
00:47:52,492 --> 00:47:54,533
you know, there's a similar system,

806
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:57,113
but it's more approachable.

807
00:47:57,113 --> 00:47:59,134
You're getting a breadth of players,

808
00:47:59,134 --> 00:48:01,434
more players are engaging with the boxes.

809
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:03,335
But is that good?

810
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:05,476
Is that actually going to help,

811
00:48:05,476 --> 00:48:07,796
you know, bring in more revenue?

812
00:48:07,796 --> 00:48:15,178
So if we look at gems spent per engaged player,

813
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:16,598
we saw lower gem spend.

814
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:18,954
Is that bad?

815
00:48:18,954 --> 00:48:22,237
Well, it's a balance, right?

816
00:48:22,237 --> 00:48:24,159
We had talked about this.

817
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,922
So when we look at overall gem spend,

818
00:48:27,922 --> 00:48:31,525
you can see that in orange,

819
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:38,411
the tier boxes have much higher gem spend,

820
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:41,773
generate more, a bigger sink of gems.

821
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:46,313
So, the lower starting price point

822
00:48:46,313 --> 00:48:48,995
gives a much higher engagement,

823
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:53,718
and players, and we found the right balance

824
00:48:53,718 --> 00:48:56,960
between approachable and scaling that system.

825
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,603
So what we saw with that is this breadth,

826
00:49:02,603 --> 00:49:04,284
kind of what I was talking about.

827
00:49:04,982 --> 00:49:09,145
Once the boxes, you can see that when it was tested,

828
00:49:09,145 --> 00:49:11,046
percent first-time buyer went up.

829
00:49:11,046 --> 00:49:16,010
And then once it was added into the regular cadence,

830
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,191
it also went up.

831
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:21,154
And didn't I say I wish we didn't focus on this too much?

832
00:49:21,154 --> 00:49:24,596
Still something that we want to optimize, right?

833
00:49:24,596 --> 00:49:28,719
But what we also saw was increase in average transactions.

834
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:30,861
So we also created more depth.

835
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,747
more players are spending,

836
00:49:34,747 --> 00:49:38,152
but they're also going through more transactions.

837
00:49:38,152 --> 00:49:44,220
So it's a little bit of a win-win, right?

838
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,923
So, quick summary there.

839
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:49,948
Iterate and test different approaches.

840
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:52,289
I think that's very important, and we talk about,

841
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,710
you know, found really good monetization strategy,

842
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:00,952
and you go all in, and you wanna kind of take a step back

843
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:03,793
and iterate and test different approaches.

844
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:06,314
You can find the right balance between

845
00:50:06,314 --> 00:50:09,675
getting more players to spend, so finding that breadth,

846
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:12,936
and getting them to spend multiple times,

847
00:50:12,936 --> 00:50:13,537
so getting that depth.

848
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:20,344
And in reality, you can increase both

849
00:50:20,344 --> 00:50:22,066
without underpricing your game.

850
00:50:22,066 --> 00:50:26,269
Because once again, spending players

851
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:28,731
will want to spend if it's worth it.

852
00:50:28,731 --> 00:50:33,875
All right, so, to summarize a little bit

853
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:37,097
of what we talked about today,

854
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:42,321
some players are more likely to spend,

855
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:44,203
this is still true,

856
00:50:45,068 --> 00:50:47,550
This is the nature of free-to-play games.

857
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,711
And that percent buyer rate is a narrow band.

858
00:50:50,711 --> 00:50:52,952
But when optimizing monetization, go deeper.

859
00:50:52,952 --> 00:50:56,034
Think beyond percent buyers.

860
00:50:56,034 --> 00:50:58,035
And don't call them whales.

861
00:50:58,035 --> 00:50:59,575
And what are your KPIs?

862
00:50:59,575 --> 00:51:03,317
So go back to that.

863
00:51:03,317 --> 00:51:07,939
Went through a bunch of correlations.

864
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,081
And we want to think about what's key.

865
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:13,022
So key.

866
00:51:14,144 --> 00:51:17,605
Our percent buyers, it still matters.

867
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:21,187
This tells you that a player who is willing to spend

868
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:24,108
comes into your game, they're enjoying it,

869
00:51:24,108 --> 00:51:28,290
and they see the value there, and they give you a chance.

870
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:33,452
Our PIPU percent repeat spenders in number of transactions

871
00:51:33,452 --> 00:51:36,573
tells you that after that first purchase,

872
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:38,253
they saw the value.

873
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,722
it's kind of their stamp of approval.

874
00:51:41,722 --> 00:51:43,783
They were satisfied with their purchase,

875
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:46,365
and they're willing to spend again on your game

876
00:51:46,365 --> 00:51:50,949
and go deeper and really, really go deep into your game

877
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:53,831
and take it up as a hobby many times.

878
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:58,975
All right, so if you don't remember anything else

879
00:51:58,975 --> 00:52:02,218
in all the numbers that I talked about

880
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:05,780
and all the KPIs and the alphabet soup,

881
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,521
remember that.

882
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:10,795
It all starts with a fun, engaging game.

883
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:16,562
Don't underprize your game.

884
00:52:16,562 --> 00:52:19,405
And spending players will want to spend,

885
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:23,750
provide the content that lets them do that,

886
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,773
go deeper, and feel good about it.

887
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:28,196
Thank you.

888
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:42,715
And I think we have five minutes for questions.

889
00:52:47,013 --> 00:52:50,396
Hello, thank you very much for an awesome lecture.

890
00:52:50,396 --> 00:52:52,738
I just had probably one question.

891
00:52:52,738 --> 00:52:55,721
When you showed the graph of dependence between the price

892
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:58,543
of first purchase and the percentage of players who are

893
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:01,005
repeating to make second purchase after that, isn't it

894
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:02,706
just kind of a bit biased?

895
00:53:02,706 --> 00:53:06,369
Because when you make first purchase really cheap, it kind

896
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:10,172
of accumulates very large user base within it, including all

897
00:53:10,172 --> 00:53:13,635
those low spenders, like those who are super rarely spent.

898
00:53:13,635 --> 00:53:15,537
So it's kind of biased by cohort.

899
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:18,997
And it's like, I don't know.

900
00:53:18,997 --> 00:53:21,538
And like those who are willing to spend $100

901
00:53:21,538 --> 00:53:24,478
on the first purchase, they like,

902
00:53:24,478 --> 00:53:27,519
of course they will more likely spend more

903
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:29,940
because they're just this small golden cohort of whales.

904
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,220
It is, and sorry, the question was,

905
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:36,721
if when you look at the second purchase rate,

906
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:40,562
isn't it the buckets are a little bit biased?

907
00:53:40,562 --> 00:53:42,262
And the answer, it is.

908
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:44,223
But part of that is because

909
00:53:44,927 --> 00:53:46,909
it's not going to help you to get those,

910
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:48,851
kind of what you were saying,

911
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:53,975
the low-spending players that are only going to spend $1.

912
00:53:53,975 --> 00:53:56,997
You're undervaluing your game because they're not

913
00:53:56,997 --> 00:53:58,639
going to repeat spend again.

914
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:03,363
So part of it is, in many ways, don't even

915
00:54:03,363 --> 00:54:06,665
providing those offers.

916
00:54:06,665 --> 00:54:12,851
OK, thanks.

917
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:16,652
So did you run anything, any A-B tests on that as well?

918
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:19,893
Or was it just looking at the same game and conversion points?

919
00:54:19,893 --> 00:54:21,814
We've also ran A-B tests.

920
00:54:21,814 --> 00:54:24,755
This is the most recent example that we had,

921
00:54:24,755 --> 00:54:28,576
and it was kind of a relearning in many ways.

922
00:54:28,576 --> 00:54:32,658
We've ran multiple tests, and we've always

923
00:54:32,658 --> 00:54:34,179
encountered that same result.

924
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:37,240
Thank you very much for being so open and sharing all the data.

925
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:37,680
It's amazing.

926
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,140
Thank you.

927
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:38,400
Thank you.

928
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:43,837
You mentioned there were key performance indicators,

929
00:54:43,837 --> 00:54:45,619
and you gave us a whole bunch of alphabet soup.

930
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:47,762
I had a question for you around DAO and ARPDAO,

931
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:50,124
because you mentioned it at the beginning,

932
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:52,788
but then it never showed up in any of the other analyses.

933
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:54,490
Is this something that's more of a red herring?

934
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,392
Is this something that we shouldn't be chasing

935
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:57,814
when we're measuring performance?

936
00:54:57,814 --> 00:55:00,217
Or is that just sort of your dependent variable

937
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:00,617
at this point?

938
00:55:01,402 --> 00:55:04,324
So, ArpDAO, I have strong feelings about ArpDAO.

939
00:55:04,324 --> 00:55:07,186
And the question was that I showed the alphabet soup,

940
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:11,190
and then I had ArpDAO and DAO in there,

941
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:14,212
and then almost never talked about it again.

942
00:55:14,212 --> 00:55:19,316
And so, ArpDAO is a, I have strong feelings about it

943
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,418
because it's a really bad metric,

944
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:25,601
because you're looking at your revenue

945
00:55:25,601 --> 00:55:27,703
and your users on a daily basis.

946
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:33,313
and what happens is that it's aggregating everyone, right?

947
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:35,334
But in your game you have players

948
00:55:35,334 --> 00:55:40,519
that have been playing for one day, that just installed,

949
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:42,921
and players who have been playing for 100 days,

950
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:45,223
or hopefully two years,

951
00:55:45,223 --> 00:55:47,925
and their behavior is gonna be very different.

952
00:55:47,925 --> 00:55:50,888
So by aggregating all of them, you are...

953
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:54,727
effectively not getting a lot of insight.

954
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,048
It's much more vanity metric.

955
00:55:57,048 --> 00:55:59,089
When it really becomes useful

956
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,010
is when you start segmenting it

957
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:04,331
by those kind of milestones or player ages.

958
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:08,133
So if you're looking at your ARPDAU for your new players

959
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:11,495
versus your midlife players versus your elder players.

960
00:56:11,495 --> 00:56:11,875
Thank you.

961
00:56:15,981 --> 00:56:19,964
Great talk. I just want to ask you about price elasticity.

962
00:56:19,964 --> 00:56:24,107
So you just, you kind of summarized that in general virtual goods are inelastic.

963
00:56:24,107 --> 00:56:29,271
In previous data I've seen on games, it was highly dependent on the price.

964
00:56:29,271 --> 00:56:33,153
So we kind of used a rule of thumb where like below five bucks prices were inelastic

965
00:56:33,153 --> 00:56:36,096
because people didn't care whether they spent one dollar or five.

966
00:56:36,096 --> 00:56:40,499
But above that you did start to see some, you know, elasticity in the prices.

967
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:43,862
Do you, have you found anything like that or is the, you know, rule of thumb kind of changed?

968
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:50,580
I think part of it is also, sorry, is the price elasticity, is it kind of a rule of

969
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:57,108
thumb across everything, or you were mentioning that if you go higher in prices, it starts

970
00:56:57,108 --> 00:56:58,950
becoming a little bit more elastic.

971
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:04,852
And I think that's why I have kind of the mostly,

972
00:57:04,852 --> 00:57:09,114
because it's not entirely inelastic.

973
00:57:09,114 --> 00:57:11,535
So it also depends on the game.

974
00:57:11,535 --> 00:57:13,555
And it also depends, I think,

975
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,456
on who you're presenting those offers to.

976
00:57:16,456 --> 00:57:21,338
So yes, I think they're mostly inelastic

977
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:22,778
kind of as a broad umbrella,

978
00:57:22,778 --> 00:57:25,399
but you will encounter situations

979
00:57:25,399 --> 00:57:28,580
where you need to be a little bit more careful about that.

980
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:29,159
Cool.

981
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:29,359
Thanks a lot.

982
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:29,520
Hi there.

983
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,462
Thank you for the talk.

984
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:33,363
It was very good.

985
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:36,486
So much like you were talking about R squared sort

986
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,529
of being lower because games is a messy business,

987
00:57:39,529 --> 00:57:41,451
from one math nerd to another, sort of how

988
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:45,075
do you deal with sort of like the variables not being ideal,

989
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:46,956
like p factor and things like that?

990
00:57:46,956 --> 00:57:48,718
So I just sort of wondering your general philosophy

991
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:50,380
for sort of measuring math and things like that.

992
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:55,461
A lot of it is, we use ranges.

993
00:57:55,461 --> 00:58:01,245
So math, the question was from one math nerd to another,

994
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:05,287
games are messy environments and how do we deal with

995
00:58:05,287 --> 00:58:09,330
the R scores not being perfect and other types of variables.

996
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:12,412
And a lot of it, we have a luxury of having

997
00:58:12,412 --> 00:58:14,634
a portfolio of games, so that also helps us

998
00:58:14,634 --> 00:58:19,657
in having ranges, so it's kind of a little bit of a cheat

999
00:58:19,657 --> 00:58:21,058
in that way because we can.

1000
00:58:21,738 --> 00:58:27,901
look at these behaviors and these analysis across multiple games,

1001
00:58:27,901 --> 00:58:32,062
and determine when a range is good versus a range is bad.

1002
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:33,702
Thank you.

1003
00:58:33,702 --> 00:58:38,264
All right. Thank you, everyone.
