00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:17,589
Hello everyone, my name is Blair, my pronouns are she, her, and this is Ambisonics and the

2
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:18,310
Great Outdoors.

3
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:22,717
So, as I mentioned, my name is Blair.

4
00:00:22,717 --> 00:00:30,180
I am an associate technical sound designer at Team Audio, and my credits include Modern

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,561
Warfare 2019 and Warzone.

6
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,302
But really, I'm just a nature lover and spatial audio fanatic.

7
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,363
So what is spatial audio?

8
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:43,106
Well, we can break that up into three main categories.

9
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:45,666
Spatial audio is the sound's position,

10
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:49,607
the space the sound is in, and the ear that hears the sound.

11
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:52,428
And we're going to go through each of these categories

12
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:56,168
one by one, starting with the sound's position.

13
00:00:56,168 --> 00:00:58,549
But in order to talk about a sound's position

14
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:00,349
in a virtual environment, we have

15
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:04,470
to understand how we perceive the position of a sound

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,570
in a real environment.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,171
So how does the human body interact with audio?

18
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:15,392
Well, we can break that up into two main categories.

19
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:17,194
The human body interacts with audio

20
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:20,698
with the head-related transfer function, or HRTF,

21
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:23,821
and the folds of the ears.

22
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:28,486
And these two concepts combine to create something

23
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:29,688
called binaural audio.

24
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:33,598
But the head-related transform function,

25
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:36,979
to clarify what that is, is it's really just the difference

26
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,841
between when you play a sound on one side of your head

27
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:43,542
and that ear hears it versus when

28
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:46,623
you play it on the opposite side of the head

29
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:47,603
and the same ear hears it.

30
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:51,705
It's how the shape of the head interacts with audio.

31
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:55,846
The folds of the ears, as I mentioned,

32
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:59,728
that's really just positioning sound a little bit more

33
00:01:59,728 --> 00:01:59,988
clearly.

34
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:07,579
But that combines with the HRTF to create this concept called binaural audio.

35
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:11,700
So when we talk about binaural audio, we're talking about

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,442
simulating the shape of the head and the folds of the ears.

37
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:21,204
Traditionally, however, we don't really use binaural audio in video games.

38
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:25,746
Most games use a channel-based audio approach.

39
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:31,556
So that means that for each speaker,

40
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:33,857
there is a channel of audio.

41
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:37,297
There aren't any differences between the channels of audio

42
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:41,958
that are being fed to the speaker system and the speaker

43
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,459
number themselves.

44
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,000
Dolby Atmos, for example, is generally 714, I believe.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,700
At least that's what this image is here.

46
00:02:52,551 --> 00:03:00,294
on the right. What that means is it's got seven speakers on the horizontal plane,

47
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:02,695
four speakers above, and one subwoofer.

48
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:13,620
However, when there's in this traditional game audio signal flow, the spatial resolution

49
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,442
of the player's audio is going to be limited to the amount of speakers that they have.

50
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:20,803
And this creates an equipment inequality.

51
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:25,656
with our players.

52
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:28,878
Because ultimately we can't all have setups like this.

53
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,760
We can't have a million different speakers

54
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,681
for hyper positionally accurate gameplay.

55
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:40,823
Instead, what I would suggest that we use

56
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:43,364
is something called ambisonics.

57
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:48,067
Ambisonics is a technology used for the simulation

58
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,448
and or capture of an environment's audio.

59
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:53,077
including height, by the way.

60
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:56,278
What does that mean?

61
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,519
Well, when we break up this sphere,

62
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,440
this sphere of potential listening positions

63
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,902
that sound can come from, if we break that up into,

64
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:16,784
let's say, four points, that is first order ambisonics.

65
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:18,385
Nine points would be second order.

66
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:28,100
16 points is third order, up to fifth order ambisonics, which is 36 points, sample points,

67
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:40,368
for each point on the sphere, rather, is broken up into... sorry, let me rephrase.

68
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:46,071
The sphere, broken up into 36 sample points, is fifth order ambisonics.

69
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,082
It's effectively how many speakers, virtual or actual,

70
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,023
we break up a sphere into.

71
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:56,944
And that's ambisonics.

72
00:04:56,944 --> 00:04:59,345
Ambisonics came about around the 70s,

73
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:04,708
but it wasn't really widely used until virtual reality

74
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,269
and digital signal processing.

75
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:11,071
There may be some research people

76
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:13,472
who might beg to differ with me on this.

77
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:17,726
Really, digital signal processing

78
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:21,828
allowed for widespread use of ambisonics.

79
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:27,251
And virtual reality, in general, allowed for consumers

80
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:31,813
to use ambisonics in their gameplay experiences.

81
00:05:31,813 --> 00:05:35,776
So ambisonics is a technology that

82
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:40,458
provides for varying amounts of spatial resolution

83
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:44,660
based on the order of ambisonics used.

84
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:44,761
So.

85
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:50,371
If we go back to that sphere of all possible positions

86
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:54,153
that a sound could come from, we would

87
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,834
sample that at four points for first-order ambisonics,

88
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,976
up to fifth-order ambisonics, which

89
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:04,058
would sample that at 36 points.

90
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:09,141
And that would result in a much higher spatial resolution

91
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:12,403
or spatial accuracy for listening.

92
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:18,812
So when we talk about that spatial resolution,

93
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,954
generally that's referred to as something

94
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:23,595
with spherical harmonics.

95
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:27,138
And I'm not going to go into that because, quite frankly,

96
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:30,380
it's a little bit dense.

97
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,683
But this is generally the diagram

98
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:34,684
that people will point to.

99
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:36,965
And what I want you to take away from this

100
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:40,328
is just, as the order of ambisonics increases,

101
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,507
the more specific each sample point gets,

102
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:47,288
the less amount of audio information

103
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,329
that sample point has to communicate,

104
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:55,811
but the more sample points there are.

105
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:59,392
And ambisonics allows for us to immerse our players

106
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:02,413
more fully and equally.

107
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:06,415
Because ultimately, when we use ambisonics

108
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:08,796
in conjunction with binaural audio,

109
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:09,516
we're able to...

110
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,543
really mitigate this equipment inequality

111
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:19,885
that comes from one player playing on a 5.1 setup,

112
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,206
but another player playing on headphones.

113
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:26,549
Because we, as game developers,

114
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,170
effectively need to design

115
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,911
for multiple different speaker setups.

116
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:34,393
But ultimately,

117
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:37,315
ambisonics allows for us to do so a little bit more easily.

118
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:45,484
So I believe that ambisonics provides a good solution

119
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:48,625
for the sound's position, providing good, high-quality

120
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,685
positional information.

121
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:54,286
And I believe it can also provide a solution for the space

122
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:55,626
that the sound is in.

123
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:57,467
Because ambisonics, if we're using

124
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:01,968
ambisonics to simulate the position of sounds,

125
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:05,889
that opens up the possibility for highly spatialized, precise,

126
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,630
and immersive convolutional reverb.

127
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:14,763
Convolution reverb is a type of reverberation,

128
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:18,967
reverb, echo, whatever you want to call it,

129
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:24,591
that takes a impulse response or a frequency sweep

130
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,933
or really even a gunshot in space,

131
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:31,797
a sound recorded in an environment

132
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:35,120
and it differentiates that between the sounds

133
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,800
that was played.

134
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:41,994
So by differentiating, say, a frequency sweep file

135
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:46,697
and the frequency sweep played in an environment,

136
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:51,160
we're able to come up with that sound information,

137
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,181
that difference, that reverb.

138
00:08:53,181 --> 00:09:01,106
But because of that reverb, sorry,

139
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:03,267
let me restart that sentence.

140
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:07,594
There are no high-order ambisonic impulse responses

141
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,896
of exteriors on the market at this time.

142
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:13,199
Because convolution reverb, while that opens up

143
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:18,163
the possibility for highly spatialized and exciting

144
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:23,888
information to be carried within the reverb that we have,

145
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:28,151
right now, there aren't any exterior impulse responses

146
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,233
that are in high-order ambisonic.

147
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:33,745
Think about what we could be hearing in our games.

148
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:37,508
We could be hearing sound bounce around us

149
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:39,950
like a cityscape from downtown San Diego

150
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:45,073
or the trees carrying and bouncing

151
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:48,095
and muffling sound in a really interesting way.

152
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:53,039
We could be hearing all of these environments in our games,

153
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,221
but because there aren't any high order

154
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,984
ambisonic impulse responses of exteriors out there,

155
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:00,344
we're not.

156
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:04,305
So I'm trying to fix that by recording

157
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,185
third-order ambisonic impulse responses

158
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:10,847
in exteriors across California.

159
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:15,528
So ambisonics is a technology that allows

160
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:18,289
for the simulation and or capture

161
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:23,371
of the 3D sound of an environment, including height,

162
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:27,032
basically taking that sphere of possible positions

163
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:30,113
and dividing it up into an amount of points.

164
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:35,378
But when we take all of that information,

165
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:37,019
we need to turn that into something

166
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,300
that the player can listen to,

167
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,682
because the player isn't gonna have 36 speakers.

168
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,903
They're gonna have two,

169
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:44,265
or they're gonna have a five one setup,

170
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:45,986
or maybe even Dolby Atmos.

171
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:50,970
So converting that format to the ear that hears the sound

172
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:58,656
is done through something called a binarization plugin.

173
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,157
Generally.

174
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:06,726
However, the PS5 accepts ambisonic input or object-based input from the game.

175
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:14,292
So we don't need to use a binarization plugin for that particular console.

176
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:18,795
But for the Xbox Series X and PC, while they do have native Dolby Atmos support,

177
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:22,618
it's still a channel-based approach.

178
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:26,421
So it still depends on the amount of speakers that you have.

179
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,823
And ultimately,

180
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:34,410
for developers shipping on the PC and on Xbox Series X

181
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,951
by neuralization or the converting of,

182
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:42,553
let's say, fifth order ambisonic audio.

183
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:48,256
The converting of any form of ambisonic audio

184
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:50,316
to a listenable format.

185
00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:52,957
That conversion or binauralization

186
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:55,378
must happen on the game side via a plugin.

187
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:59,620
Luckily, there's a lot of plugins out there for this.

188
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:07,878
especially THX spatial audio, which is something that I'm very excited about personally.

189
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:14,867
Oculus Audio SDK is a tried and true method that's, I believe Phasmophobia uses this,

190
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,209
but ultimately...

191
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:23,422
It struggles with handling more than two speakers.

192
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:28,766
Atmokey Ears allows for customizable HRTF based on age.

193
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:33,329
That is to say, it is really useful for adjusting

194
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:39,133
for if you're a child or a teen, I believe,

195
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,895
are the settings that it has.

196
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,617
But THX spatial audio is something

197
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:46,137
that.

198
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:51,688
I'm very excited about because it allows for multiple speaker

199
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,750
setups to be converted to.

200
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,093
That is to say, it allows for the conversion

201
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:07,217
of ambisonic audio to a 5.1 setup, or a headphone setup,

202
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:13,121
or a 7.1.4 setup, but all within the same plugin.

203
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:16,003
With binauralization, we can terrify.

204
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:22,006
Because binauralization allows for all of that positional

205
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:24,147
information to be simulated.

206
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:28,510
Speakers no longer have to be physical.

207
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,651
They can be virtualized.

208
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:32,713
It could be right behind you, and you wouldn't

209
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:34,594
have to have a speaker there.

210
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:39,497
Because ultimately, with binauralization,

211
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:44,229
we're able to take the positional information

212
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:49,811
from ambisonics and convert it into a smaller channel amount,

213
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:56,773
whether that be stereo or Dolby Atmos.

214
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:03,187
So there are a few limitations to most binarization plugins.

215
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:06,971
For instance, the Oculus One is only stereo.

216
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,173
And everyone does have a different HRTF,

217
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,856
or head-related transfer function.

218
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:16,138
So what might sound really positionally

219
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,540
accurate for one person, depending

220
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,264
on the HRTF that is used in the plugin,

221
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:24,265
it might not for another.

222
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:27,388
So these are just things to be aware of.

223
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:35,291
However, I believe that ultimately, modern games can use ambisonics and binauralization

224
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:42,854
to achieve high-quality spatial audio. That is to say, ambisonics allow for us to simulate

225
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:52,096
the sound's position in a positionally accurate way. We can take an environment.

226
00:14:53,093 --> 00:15:00,136
And instead of breaking it up to, let's say, a 5.1 setup,

227
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:04,377
we can sample it at up to 36 different channels.

228
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:10,579
And from there, we can simulate the reverberation

229
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:16,701
of that space on those channels and convert that all

230
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:20,062
into something that the player can listen to regardless

231
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:22,303
of their speaker setup.

232
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:22,663
Thank you.

233
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,350
Yeah. Questions?

234
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:37,973
You mentioned that you capture impulse,

235
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:43,354
impulse responses in the city using a third order ambisonic microphone.

236
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:47,715
So I wanted to ask what I mean, where do you place the chirps,

237
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,636
the sweeps that you play?

238
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:52,857
How many trips would you play and where would you place them?

239
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:02,087
Um, I am in the process of recording and pulse responses. I have yet to, um, I

240
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:07,212
have yet to practically record in the city at this point. Um, I'm in the

241
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:10,815
process of making that happen. Uh, but if I, um

242
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:23,502
Off the top of my head, I would be careful with placing it directly in the center of the street because that would result in potential phasing issues.

243
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:28,766
That's really something that I want to be careful of when I do record in the city is.

244
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:34,409
I want to be careful of phasing issues, so I would probably.

245
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:37,712
Place that speaker in.

246
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:39,092
Roughly off center.

247
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:42,946
like just a little bit off-center enough so that

248
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:48,129
Like if this was a

249
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:54,253
If this was a two-way street, I would place it in one lane of traffic

250
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:58,176
Obviously not while cars are going by but

251
00:16:58,176 --> 00:17:01,878
That's how I would do it because

252
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:05,037
I would worry about facing otherwise.

253
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:09,298
And that way, we can say, OK, this

254
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:12,079
is how one area kind of sounds.

255
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,660
And from there, you can kind of build out

256
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,441
through different positions.

257
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:23,203
You can build out different types of impulse responses.

258
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:26,164
You could try it on the sidewalk.

259
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:28,845
You could try it in a tighter city street.

260
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:34,030
Yeah, there's really a million different ways to do it,

261
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,550
but that's just how I would do it.

262
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:35,690
Got it.

263
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,570
And one last question.

264
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:44,173
Maybe you can give your thoughts of how to transition

265
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:48,735
from 3Daf capturing to 6Daf rendering.

266
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,475
I mean, how would the ambisonic,

267
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:55,557
a static place that the ambisonic was captured from

268
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:57,778
being utilized in a 6Daf gameplay?

269
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:58,198
All right.

270
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:13,473
In terms of converting from various singular captured impulse responses to 6 DOF gameplay,

271
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:16,374
I would say that...

272
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:27,159
I honestly don't have a great answer to that question, unfortunately.

273
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:36,389
Yeah, I just would record as much information as I could with individual sample points,

274
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:41,432
and kind of like ambisonics, try and mitigate the...

275
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:55,660
I would try and take those sample points and build from that a particular image, if you will.

276
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,621
I don't...

277
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:05,215
have um I don't have a great answer for you unfortunately in regards to uh the six degrees

278
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:10,601
of freedom um but that being said um

279
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,412
I would say that if you were doing Six Degrees of Freedom,

280
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:21,995
try and record with multiple microphones

281
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,135
at the same time, potentially.

282
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:28,477
That I know Azalea has a Six Degrees of Freedom's

283
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:32,199
like time-coded link setup that they use.

284
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:36,921
That's something to look into, potentially.

285
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:39,042
Thank you so much.

286
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,893
Hi, thanks for the talk.

287
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:54,042
Are, is ambisonics or binauralization impacted or reliant upon standardizations of like other

288
00:19:54,042 --> 00:20:00,548
audio protocols or standards in volume and format and platform?

289
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:09,723
Do a number of things have to be aligned to make, to maximize the effect of ambisonics

290
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:11,064
in binauralization?

291
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:13,306
Is that making sense?

292
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:13,907
Yes.

293
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:19,672
Are you basically asking if ambisonics is a fit for every game?

294
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:21,874
Yes, every game and every platform.

295
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:26,039
every sound format?

296
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:32,804
Like, are there external influences that really throw a wrench in the gear of this

297
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:35,526
having the desired effect?

298
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,467
Yes, very much so.

299
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:40,270
So I find that

300
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,153
building a game for PC and current gen consoles,

301
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:49,917
especially if that is a first or close third person,

302
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:58,429
a game, like a RPG type layout, that is where ambisonics really shines because then there's

303
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:04,217
uh because there is a little bit of a performance cost as I understand it.

304
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:13,548
with ambisonics because it's handling that much more information, but that's not something that,

305
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:20,951
as I understand it, is much of a problem unless you're going into, say, the PS4 and

306
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:30,234
potentially going into mobile and things like that. So if I was building a RTS,

307
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:34,395
I would maybe not use ambisonics.

308
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:43,097
really, I'm presenting this as a tool, if that makes sense, because I'm finding that

309
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:52,422
in the types of games that I have worked on and am working on in the future, I

310
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:58,705
have found that Ambisonics has provided me with more information and more

311
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:04,208
more gameplay information, really, for the player.

312
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:11,822
So this is all to say, no, Embisonics is not a one-size-fits-all solution.

313
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:11,983
Perfect.

314
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:12,283
Thank you.

315
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:20,120
Hi Blair.

316
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,741
I'm wondering as an indie developer

317
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,943
how ambisonics might be able to be integrated into my work.

318
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:32,505
And if there are any cool ideas for gameplay

319
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:35,147
that would be really awesome with ambisonics

320
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,588
that you have and would like to share.

321
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:37,768
Yeah.

322
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:41,950
So ambisonics is ultimately

323
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:53,763
That would be where you would set up your listener to use an ambisonic format.

324
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:57,786
If you're, say, making a first-person horror game, let's use Phasmophobia, for example,

325
00:22:57,786 --> 00:23:02,390
because I love that game, and I die a lot in it.

326
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:08,976
But if you're making, say, Phasmophobia, you would set your listener to...

327
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:22,860
third order, fifth order, ambisonics, whatever you deem gives you the right amount of balance between performance and audio information.

328
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:35,085
And from there, you can take that and when you play sounds, whether they be mono or...

329
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:38,286
Well, I think they would have to be mono in this particular case.

330
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:43,636
But when you play sounds and it's picked up by that listener,

331
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:50,639
that would then get converted down to the listener's format

332
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,139
through the binauralization plugin.

333
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:52,579
I'm so sorry.

334
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:55,541
I lost my train of thought.

335
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,481
Can you please repeat your question?

336
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:06,655
Yeah, I asked as an indie developer how I might be able to integrate ambisonics and if you have any awesome

337
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:10,757
Gameplay ideas that would be absolutely perfect with ambisonics

338
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:17,021
Okay, I think gameplay wise

339
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:19,822
Ambisonics is really good at

340
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:22,644
emphasizing positional information

341
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:27,186
so if you want to be able to say hey, there's a sound exactly there and

342
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:32,293
Ambisonics is great at that.

343
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:36,814
So really, in terms of gameplay,

344
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:43,996
it's really limited by what you want to do with your sound design.

345
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:46,337
And in terms of integrating it as an indie developer,

346
00:24:46,337 --> 00:24:50,478
kind of like the previous question was saying,

347
00:24:50,478 --> 00:24:56,020
it is a bit limited by the platform and the...

348
00:24:57,536 --> 00:25:02,581
Yeah, really it's limited by the platform and the genre of game.

349
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:06,965
So ultimately, I don't see any reason why an indie developer

350
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:10,328
might not be able to use Ambisonics if they're

351
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:15,153
shipping on the same platform as a larger developer might be.

352
00:25:15,153 --> 00:25:21,058
Yeah, I hope that answered your question.

353
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:21,719
Yeah, thank you.

354
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:26,598
Hi Blair, thanks for the talk.

355
00:25:26,598 --> 00:25:30,320
It's cool to see interest in spatial audio.

356
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,502
There's a lot of folks here.

357
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:36,603
When I was looking into spatial audio

358
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:40,165
maybe five or six years ago,

359
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:43,147
it seemed that the variation in HRTFs

360
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:47,890
from person to person was a big hurdle at the time.

361
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,974
I guess hoping to see that with a lot of the VR, you know, steps forward that have been

362
00:25:53,974 --> 00:26:00,457
happening that there might be some advancements in that, but it seems like that's still kind

363
00:26:00,457 --> 00:26:01,318
of an obstacle.

364
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:06,921
Are you aware of any recent research or steps forward to combat that?

365
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:15,860
A lot of spatial audio developers, like taking the THX Spatial Audio, for example,

366
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:25,982
they're focusing on, they provide an out-of-the-box, in their words, high-quality HRTF,

367
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:33,604
but there's also, people are trying to implement the personalized, rather.

368
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:40,028
HRTF of each consumer.

369
00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:46,431
So I think with the THX spatial audio,

370
00:26:46,431 --> 00:26:52,114
the goal is to implement like you would take pictures

371
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:54,775
of your head from different angles

372
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:59,018
and then send that off to THX and they would

373
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,079
generate an HRTF for you.

374
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:05,980
That is really the only big advancement with that

375
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,521
that I've noticed.

376
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:12,083
I think a lot of people are trying to make a one size fits

377
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,084
all.

378
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:18,526
And if I recall correctly, there are different companies

379
00:27:18,526 --> 00:27:23,949
that are trying to work on customizable solutions

380
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:24,610
like with preset type.

381
00:27:25,837 --> 00:27:31,401
HRTFs, but ultimately that is still a hurdle.

382
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:36,325
Customizable HRTF, if someone makes that plugin,

383
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:42,310
like a plugin with a swappable HRTFs based on your age,

384
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,591
based on your head shape,

385
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:49,255
and you can pick the one that's best suited for you, that.

386
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:53,287
that is something I would be interested in seeing.

387
00:27:53,287 --> 00:27:55,991
But ultimately, I think the closest we're getting

388
00:27:55,991 --> 00:28:00,457
is the promise of personalized HRTFs from THX at this point.

389
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:00,537
Cool.
