1
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:07,251
So thanks for coming, it's the end of the day

2
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:08,913
so I really appreciate it.

3
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:11,136
And let's start off by getting vulnerable.

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,998
I actually thought this room would be empty,

5
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:15,861
so I'm very pleased to see so many of you here.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,834
A quick background, I am Cherry, and I'm an accessibility expert.

7
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:26,658
I've collaborated with teams of many different disciplines on everything from workshops to

8
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:31,602
accessibility reports, inclusions with art, narrative, and writing teams.

9
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:36,345
Past work includes giants like Ubisoft, Xbox, and Microsoft Studios, all the way through

10
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:40,408
mid-sized AAA like Guerrilla, and indies like Gambrinus.

11
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:45,553
Oh yeah, in the words of Ben Schroeder,

12
00:00:45,553 --> 00:00:48,398
I also practice ultraviolence but for feelings,

13
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:49,219
so get ready.

14
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,086
My disabilities affect my memory and speech

15
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,950
and are an excellent excuse to break the rules,

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,753
so I also read my presentations.

17
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:00,976
Content warning, I will be discussing difficult things

18
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:03,556
related to disability, death, stigma, and mental health.

19
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:06,617
If you need to leave at any time, please do.

20
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:09,078
I have a lot to cover, so I'm afraid it's unlikely

21
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:10,419
there will be time for questions,

22
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:13,000
but please remember if you have any to catch me afterwards.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,661
If there's enough of us, we'll move to a wrap-up room.

24
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,522
Otherwise, I'm happy to answer you on Twitter,

25
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:20,222
so always feel free to get at me.

26
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:27,038
So, representation, excuse me, I'm already breaking up.

27
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:28,398
It's a loaded subject.

28
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:31,220
I'll set the scene with some words from Emily Grace Buck,

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,621
who is a wonderful narrative designer

30
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:34,502
that you should all follow on Twitter.

31
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:37,523
You can't do narrative design in a social,

32
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:38,964
cultural, or political vacuum.

33
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:41,685
You're providing players tools to live a story.

34
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,727
Their story is informed by the real world.

35
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,228
If you're not considering what your players, all of them,

36
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:51,431
might want to do and how they might feel at every moment

37
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:54,673
as they experience the stories in your game,

38
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:57,135
you're not doing narrative design.

39
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:59,356
Thinking intersexually isn't a plus, it's a must.

40
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:02,918
As the pace picks up with accessibility

41
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:05,140
and more disabled people are playing our games

42
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,600
than ever before,

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,442
it's perhaps time to have a frank discussion on inclusion.

44
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:12,384
I'm pretty sure this is the first ever talk at GDC

45
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:15,286
on disability representation, so no pressure.

46
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,209
According to Twitter, people really like my title.

47
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,373
I gave version 1.0 of this talk at the Games Accessibility

48
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:26,096
Conference in Paris last year and got a similar response.

49
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:28,879
But it's more than just a clever nod to a very famous game.

50
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,141
It embodies what I truly feel needs to change

51
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:32,523
about how we view disability.

52
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:38,946
Working in games so often means pouring our heart and lives

53
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:41,309
into them, and it can be hard to hear criticism.

54
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:44,012
So I want to reassure you that it's not personal.

55
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,756
I really don't think games that get representation wrong

56
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:47,917
are bad games.

57
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,699
I truly appreciate every one of you.

58
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,422
I just think that the mistakes we make

59
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,266
are often down to gaps in knowledge and experience.

60
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:57,711
But, oh, I went ahead.

61
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,793
We do that sometimes.

62
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:01,376
But I'm not a monolithic voice for all disabled people.

63
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:05,462
While I've done my best to bring in perspectives

64
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:06,724
from the larger community,

65
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:08,707
at the end of the day, I'm just one person.

66
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:14,565
I always struggle with how to give 30-minute lectures without an hour-long intro on disability

67
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:19,828
culture and today is no exception because bad representation derives from social stigma.

68
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:21,509
Well, here's my story in a nutshell.

69
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,231
Until my late 20s, I didn't consider myself disabled.

70
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:27,613
Then I took an arrow to the knee, which is not true at all.

71
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:29,835
I wish my story was that cool.

72
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:35,118
I lived with a lot of undiagnosed physical and cognitive disabilities, which meant difficult

73
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:36,519
times and unique stigmas.

74
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,773
At 31, I had a sudden stroke when an artery supplying my brain tore.

75
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,871
I wasn't even doing anything cool, like pumping iron or crashing a sports car.

76
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:51,451
I was slowly walking back from my coffee break at the beach.

77
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:55,993
It turned out my physical disabilities are degenerative, and at this point I found myself

78
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:59,373
in and out of hospital, trying to rediscover who I was.

79
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,274
I learned a lot about how negatively I viewed disability.

80
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:05,935
I found vocabulary and culture and figured out why I'd always struggled so much.

81
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:07,375
It was a revelation.

82
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:13,537
By being forced to acknowledge it, I could finally see myself and my disabilities positively.

83
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:18,516
It's what you make of your situation that defines you.

84
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:20,017
Lara Croft in Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

85
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:23,178
A common phrase we hear is that we shouldn't let

86
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:24,719
our disabilities define us,

87
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,800
but of course my disabilities define me.

88
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,760
And I don't just let them,

89
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,501
I work hard to make them a positive part of me.

90
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:34,463
They're an inescapable part of who I am.

91
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:38,104
I experience the world through my disabilities every day,

92
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:39,464
all with things like chronic pain.

93
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:43,565
I'm proud to be defined of what I make of my situation.

94
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:44,865
I want to celebrate it.

95
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:47,426
If Lara gets that, why can't everyone else?

96
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:50,347
All right, myths and stereotypes.

97
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:52,288
Surprise, I use a wheelchair.

98
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:56,530
I had to ask them to move a table so I could make that joke.

99
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,390
People wrongly assume all wheelchair users

100
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,911
have total paralysis,

101
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:02,652
but there are so many other reasons for using one.

102
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:05,173
For me, it's multifaceted due to my muscles,

103
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:06,493
pain, and frequent injuries.

104
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,627
Lots of us can stand up or even walk a little bit

105
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,972
with the help of crutches, canes, or walkers.

106
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:15,597
It's not a miracle or someone faking.

107
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:17,560
Yes, I have had people yell this at me,

108
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,145
including in a hospital of all places.

109
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:25,297
Here's a list to inspire you when you're thinking of including wheelchair users in your games.

110
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:30,540
This might not be exhaustive, but they are common reasons to use a wheelchair.

111
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:37,043
Muscular weakness, amputation, severe fatigue, bone or muscle malformations, chronic pain,

112
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:43,527
bone and soft tissue fragility, a risk of injury or falls, motor control and movement disorders, and even more.

113
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,212
The type of wheelchair we use depends on our disabilities and the cost.

114
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:52,874
But somehow, the most common wheelchair we see in games are ugly, heavy things

115
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:56,035
that have rarely been used outside of hospitals, airports,

116
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:59,858
and other temporary situations for more than 30 years.

117
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,159
Cloning wheelchair assets looks pretty silly, too.

118
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:05,581
I've never met anyone with the exact same wheelchair as mine,

119
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,362
and I'd love to see more power chairs.

120
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:09,044
Here's a hot tip.

121
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:12,287
If you're Googling for manual wheelchair reference,

122
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:15,851
use the term everyday wheelchair, not just wheelchair.

123
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:19,294
As you see, the results are quite different.

124
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:21,636
More ideally, work directly with people who use them

125
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:23,238
so you can learn more about how they work.

126
00:06:25,113 --> 00:06:28,557
Another myth, autistic stereotypes, nonverbal kids,

127
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,479
savants, or men who lack empathy

128
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,561
to the point of hurtfulness or violence.

129
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:34,563
The biggest issue with autistic characters

130
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:37,266
is we're rarely written as fully developed people.

131
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:40,669
The most famous and 30-year-old example,

132
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:42,912
Rain Man's defining traits aren't even autism

133
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,494
like most people think.

134
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:46,055
It's something called savant syndrome.

135
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:50,077
We have personalities, we're as human as anyone else,

136
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,457
even if we move or communicate differently.

137
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,098
Most stereotype breaking of all,

138
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:57,238
my empathy can be so intense it overwhelms me,

139
00:06:57,238 --> 00:07:00,879
but I don't process emotions or sensory information very well.

140
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,960
I do actually like trains,

141
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
but I'm also incredibly enthusiastic about birds

142
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,301
and can sort of talk to cats,

143
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,561
when that's only half a joke.

144
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:12,109
The fictional characters who I think are most autistic

145
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,169
aren't usually written as such.

146
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:17,150
Futaba from Persona 5 was extremely autistic,

147
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,070
but she was described as a shut-in.

148
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,031
Similarly, Hilda, the Netflix cartoon,

149
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:24,832
has many qualities as a young autistic girl,

150
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:26,412
but it's likely accidental,

151
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,172
which doesn't really count

152
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:30,693
because it doesn't foster the wonderful sense

153
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:33,633
of acceptance, inclusion, and being seen

154
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,394
that can be so powerful with deliberate inclusion.

155
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,066
One quarter, sorry.

156
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:43,888
Reflecting worldwide population statistics,

157
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:47,390
recent studies are showing one quarter to 30% of players

158
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,771
identify as disabled.

159
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,352
And that's a big chunk of the market.

160
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,386
And games are massively important to the lives

161
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:56,247
of disabled people.

162
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,608
Time is too tight to go into too much detail on how,

163
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:01,470
but on a personal level, video games saved my life.

164
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,591
I said this during a design sprint

165
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:05,733
with the studio who make Gears of War.

166
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,034
I meant it half jokingly, but as always,

167
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:10,536
I didn't realize how deeply I meant this

168
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,717
until I met the eyes of one of the developers

169
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:15,358
and he quietly and vulnerably said, me too.

170
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:21,177
Regardless of who we are, this can be our most profound common ground.

171
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:24,099
It's one of the things that makes us so passionate in our work.

172
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:28,443
Games have helped me through so many difficult times all through my life,

173
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:31,946
but maybe nothing greater than through pain and degenerative disability.

174
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:38,048
So, if a quarter of players are disabled, why are less than 1% of our game characters?

175
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:43,349
Whether it's hiring practices, community efforts, creator platforms or representation,

176
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,830
disability is often forgotten from larger diversity efforts.

177
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,852
Even if it's not intentional, by not explicitly including us, you're excluding us.

178
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:58,427
It both matters how often and how we're represented in games,

179
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:00,868
maybe for no greater reason than how it feels.

180
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:04,591
The lack of representation, or even worse, bad representation,

181
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,332
can reinforce stigma.

182
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:09,494
Everything from ideas that disability should be hidden,

183
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:12,836
it makes us worthless, evil, untrustworthy, a burden,

184
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:15,218
or even whether we should want to die.

185
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:16,278
More on that in a moment.

186
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,604
It can cause rifts in friendships when we talk about it,

187
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:22,906
or it can acutely affect our enjoyment of a game.

188
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:27,109
It can incite and underpin onslaughts of hatred and toxicity

189
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,631
when gamers use slurs like retard to shut us up.

190
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:34,753
Negative representation can impact our mental health

191
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:36,434
and self-esteem on every front.

192
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,896
To put it simply, it alienates us.

193
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:45,754
Conversely, the feeling of seeing even a glimpse of who you are in a positive light is profound.

194
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:49,375
It's a nudge that you're not alone, and more importantly, you're welcome.

195
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:53,217
A little indie called To The Moon was one of these moments for me.

196
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,658
When I started playing, I had no idea that it was relevant to me.

197
00:09:56,658 --> 00:10:00,760
So when it captured so much of what it's like to be autistic, I cried.

198
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:06,177
And I don't mean I got teary and could hold it together.

199
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:09,360
I mean I openly sobbed, breathless, wordless,

200
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,421
and completely broken.

201
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:13,223
Of course, this was live on the internet

202
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:14,965
for everyone to see.

203
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:16,486
I was an absolute mess.

204
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:19,349
I'm not kidding, but this segment goes on for 20 minutes.

205
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:22,152
It unlocked feelings I had no idea were so intense

206
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:25,635
that when I finally saw even a shadow of myself,

207
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:26,696
how powerful that would be.

208
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,575
The way one of the autistic characters experienced the world and the barriers she faced were

209
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:32,676
so familiar.

210
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:37,962
Through a deeply affectionate lens, the story told of how hard she fought.

211
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:40,505
She had autonomy, desires, and opinions.

212
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:44,810
She wasn't a burden, and she had a profoundly meaningful relationship.

213
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,313
The delicacy and beauty were unparalleled.

214
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:53,536
Inclusion is so powerful. I deeply adore games because they are great experiences and conduits,

215
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:58,879
no matter the scope or genre. As storytellers and world builders, you have the capacity to

216
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,742
move hearts and souls like no other industry I know. Hashtag disability representation matters.

217
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:11,083
I asked people on Twitter how being represented makes them feel, and the responses I got were

218
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,584
overwhelmingly about belonging and visibility.

219
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:16,605
I particularly liked Jamie Knight's response.

220
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:20,527
If I exist in the game world, it helps me to persist in the real world.

221
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:25,310
Helps me see a space, event, or community I can be a part of, rather than feeling like

222
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,490
a permanent outsider.

223
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,112
At the end of the day, that's what it comes down to for disabled people.

224
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:32,613
We already feel like outsiders.

225
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:33,633
Games transcend that.

226
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,960
Disabled people are still often segregated,

227
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,601
whether we're stuck at home

228
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,784
or when sitting in less desirable sections on transit,

229
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:45,065
music venues, sports arenas, or cinemas

230
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:46,927
away from our friends.

231
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,508
Sometimes we can't even access basic facilities

232
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,369
like toilets.

233
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:56,031
Too many bars, restaurants, clubs, cafes, shops, parks, and more still aren't accessible.

234
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,353
Even if we can get into buildings, things like table height or limited space exclude us.

235
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:05,734
Regardless of the poor state of representation, we're less segregated in games.

236
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,635
We feel less alone and undesirable. Take this tweet, for example.

237
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:10,315
Sorry, this one makes me very emotional.

238
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:17,828
Daughter is autistic. She doesn't fit in.

239
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:20,529
She doesn't get praise outside of her close family.

240
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:22,991
During the first Forsaken mission,

241
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:24,232
her favorite character told her

242
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:26,773
to keep us would be proud of her.

243
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:27,234
She cried.

244
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,875
Thank you, Bungie.

245
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,057
You have no idea how much this means from Andraste Blaze.

246
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:36,345
So what about escapism?

247
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:39,047
I know people who don't want to be reminded

248
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:40,347
of their disabilities.

249
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:42,408
They just want to feel stronger, more powerful,

250
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,789
and in less pain.

251
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:45,329
Sometimes it's just about having fun.

252
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,350
I understand this.

253
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,932
I'm in pain constantly, and I'm weaker than a six-year-old.

254
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:53,653
I've spent hundreds of hours in Horizon Zero Dawn

255
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:56,875
losing arrows with a ridiculous accuracy and strength,

256
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:57,935
sneaking around in the grass

257
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,217
like my knees aren't made of glass.

258
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:02,358
I don't want to replace this facet of gaming.

259
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:06,939
I believe that enjoying escapism or power fantasy doesn't mean that disability should

260
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:09,820
be enraged entirely, as it so often is.

261
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:16,142
This quietly reinforces the idea that disability is wrong, and that the ultimate goal for humanity

262
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:17,602
is that we don't exist.

263
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:21,483
Something we have to come to terms with as disabled people is that cures are extremely

264
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:26,144
unlikely, especially given the vastness of disease and the complexity of some disabilities.

265
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:28,925
I mean, we can't even cure the common cold or flu.

266
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,088
Some don't want a cure.

267
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:34,193
For example, I believe that to try and cure me of being autistic

268
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:36,276
would erase me as a person.

269
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:38,139
I also love my wheels,

270
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:41,084
but I'd happily take a cure for my failing digestive system

271
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:42,646
or never-ending pain.

272
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:44,369
It's more complicated than you might think.

273
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:50,315
Mad Max Fury Road was proof that disability and power fantasy can coexist.

274
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:56,358
Furiosa was wicked powerful, not despite her need for a prosthetic, but because of it.

275
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:59,139
It was so empowering to see her on the big screen.

276
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,162
Even Mad Max himself has worn a leg brace since the very beginning of the franchise.

277
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:08,045
That's me, wearing braces, trying to invoke my inner rogue, always.

278
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:12,288
We have plenty of escapism, so there's really loads of room

279
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:13,709
for improving representation.

280
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,572
When we do see disability in games, it's mostly extremely negative.

281
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,414
So let's rip off this bandage.

282
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:21,876
Here's what I call the trilogy of tropes.

283
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:26,824
We all know the squeaking of a wheel,

284
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,967
the empty wheelchair rolling into a creepy hallway.

285
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:32,429
Disability is often used to frighten people.

286
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,450
The stigma is so pervasive,

287
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,613
it took me two years of being progressively housebound

288
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:39,614
to work through it mentally.

289
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,556
Disability can sometimes be scary

290
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:42,877
to the person going through it,

291
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:45,579
but it shouldn't be horrifying to other people.

292
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,701
It's similar to the difference between laughing at someone

293
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:49,642
and with someone.

294
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:55,045
The empty wheelchair is probably one of the most used pieces of a creepy environmental

295
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:57,308
storytelling after human skulls.

296
00:14:57,308 --> 00:15:00,852
It's definitely the most common way to encounter a wheelchair in games.

297
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:07,861
In Fallout 4, I saw the same bulky, unfuturistic wheelchair about 563 times throughout the

298
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:08,822
entire world.

299
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:13,526
Now Bloodborne has empty wheelchairs and wheelchair-using enemies.

300
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:17,530
On one hand, it's cool to think that these enemies are fully capable.

301
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,893
Once I saw one of them miraculously descend a flight of stairs

302
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:23,255
without tipping over, all while shooting me.

303
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:27,818
To quote the quote on this slide,

304
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,181
I feel so emotionally ravaged by this game

305
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,602
and not in a good way,

306
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:34,105
was not about the notorious difficulty.

307
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:35,506
While I loved playing the game,

308
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:39,350
the awful way wheelchairs were used crushed me.

309
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,112
To top it all, the story ends with the player's character

310
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:44,194
being trapped into the wheelchair,

311
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,097
implying that it's a terrible cycle of fate

312
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:48,739
doomed to be repeated forever.

313
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:57,547
Apparently, being disabled is the ultimate horror in a world that's nothing but nightmares

314
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:58,808
that killed you 194 times.

315
00:15:58,808 --> 00:15:59,949
Yes, I counted.

316
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,004
It's left a wound that's prodded every time someone tells me how much they loved the story.

317
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:08,926
Despite the common narrative that we're trapped in our wheelchairs,

318
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:13,110
bound to them against our will, for many of us they give us freedom.

319
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,753
I adore my wheelchair. I've never felt as free and bloody cool as I do,

320
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:21,117
zooming around five times faster than I've been able to move in two decades,

321
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:22,838
and with a fraction of the pain.

322
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:26,801
It's a beautiful piece of engineering too, and it's not at all creepy.

323
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:28,303
This is where I'd pov a wheelie.

324
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:31,281
But it probably isn't the safest thing to do on stage.

325
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,343
Our body's mind or the devices we use

326
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:39,347
shouldn't be used as a threat to make players feel scared.

327
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:42,450
I'm tired of the same old depictions of disability

328
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:48,414
and mental health that reinforce the negative ways others see me.

329
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:49,555
And it doesn't come down to one game.

330
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:50,195
It's like drops in an ocean.

331
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:54,659
When disability is often seen as worse than death,

332
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:57,141
maybe it's natural to assume we want to die.

333
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:01,624
Disabled people face death for many reasons,

334
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:04,327
from terminal disease to serious accidents.

335
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,168
Or, like me, I live with the risk

336
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:08,291
that my body can break down without warning.

337
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,214
I've cheated death several times.

338
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:15,498
Humans are survivors because life is so worthwhile,

339
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,140
even with disability or pain.

340
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,266
Why is it so easy to imagine non-disabled characters doing anything necessary to survive

341
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,928
a horrifying apocalypse?

342
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:29,533
When it comes to disabled characters in mundane settings, they probably want to die.

343
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:34,632
In Life is Strange, Chloe becomes profoundly disabled due to a car accident.

344
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:39,996
The player, as Max, is presented with the dilemma of helping her by killing her, or

345
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:45,920
forcing her to keep living a life with no friends and nothing to do but stare at blank

346
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,281
walls while in a lot of pain.

347
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:49,924
Perhaps a more important story to explore

348
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,124
would have been about quality of life.

349
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:54,165
Why and how is the world failing Chloe

350
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:57,727
that she's been left with this as her only wish?

351
00:17:57,727 --> 00:18:00,928
And why is it seen as a moral gray area

352
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:02,949
whether her best friend murders her or not?

353
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:07,141
The difficulty is there's a dash of truth.

354
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:10,084
But for me, the ethics behind the way it's presented

355
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:10,925
are all wrong.

356
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:13,527
I have friends who have been in accidents like Chloe,

357
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,049
and until they learned to adapt

358
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,973
and achieve the quality of life they deserved,

359
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,594
they did struggle with suicide.

360
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:23,177
But it's a mental health and social issue.

361
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:26,400
It's not the fundamental state of being disabled.

362
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,401
It's heartbreaking.

363
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,484
We're passing up truly interesting narratives in favor of overtly negative cliches

364
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:35,248
that center stigma and fear.

365
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:41,295
If only these stories would examine why we all have these fears as able-bodied people,

366
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:43,117
and like the systems that fail us,

367
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:46,861
and end up with disabled characters being supported and finding new purpose.

368
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:53,279
Detroit Become Human's disabled character Carl has a super cool wheelchair, which is

369
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,803
actually something I've always wanted to see in games, but at the same time it was totally

370
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:03,487
inappropriate for him given his apparent inability to self-propel and reliance on being carted

371
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:04,788
around by an android.

372
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:11,312
No one I know enjoys or prefers to be pushed around by other people, so it made little sense.

373
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:15,735
Additionally, since the motion capture was an able-bodied actor in a crappy wheelchair,

374
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:22,039
I have seen the pictures. He also moved really weirdly. There were so many glaring errors,

375
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:26,382
I took bets on which bad cliche he was going to be. The bitter, angry rich guy,

376
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:33,687
or the kind but pitiable one. It was the latter. His character is largely a burden and two-dimensional.

377
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:38,670
It was rooted in pity, and by focusing on how incapable he is,

378
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,312
it broadcasts how compassionate his android carer must be,

379
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:45,914
and therefore rouses empathy for the android.

380
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:48,375
Spoiler, of course he dies,

381
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,237
which is the catalyst for the android's full sentience.

382
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:54,719
These stories or characters really aren't about our inclusion,

383
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:58,881
they're plot devices for motivating players into having bad feelings

384
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:03,423
by exploiting stigma, fear, or imagined ideas of what it's like to be disabled.

385
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:07,427
It might not be intentional, but it is self-reinforcing.

386
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:13,494
Ultimately, when this is how you're used to seeing characters like you, it's sad and exhausting.

387
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:19,332
This is where Hellblade Senua's sacrifice was surprisingly different.

388
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:21,794
It felt so much less exploitative.

389
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:26,018
I've spent a long time analyzing why a game that focused on psychosis

390
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,360
felt mature and respectful.

391
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,923
Ninja Theory didn't just work with doctors who diagnose and treat psychosis,

392
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:35,866
they worked with people who have lived experience of it,

393
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,388
actively working to correct assumptions.

394
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:41,291
After all, they're the real experts in psychosis.

395
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,483
In other avenues of diversity, we understand the importance of having marginalized people

396
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:48,244
tell their own stories.

397
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:52,788
If not as part of the team directly, then via consultation and sensitivity checks.

398
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:55,770
We should be speaking to disabled people.

399
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,494
Her Web was a piece of art, as evidenced by the awards it won, but it was more than that.

400
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:04,539
I don't live with psychosis myself, but it spoke to me greatly.

401
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,984
I've lived with anxiety, I have PTSD, and have episodes of dissociation,

402
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:12,969
and most importantly, I've often felt an outsider as Senua is.

403
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:16,874
For me, they managed to transcend the tropes I associate with the thriller genre.

404
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:20,156
Senua was powerful, tender, loving.

405
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:23,018
The world was hard and cruel to her.

406
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,039
She wasn't terrible.

407
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,420
She wasn't pitiable.

408
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,103
She's a survivor who feels grief, love, and most importantly, hope.

409
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:33,035
It was empowering.

410
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:34,377
The game never looked down on her.

411
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:37,320
Senua also had a sight that meant she could solve puzzles

412
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,803
and see hidden meanings.

413
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,745
As an autistic person, this resonated,

414
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:44,208
as I'm very good at quickly seeing patterns.

415
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,410
Often, though, this kind of magical ability

416
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,612
frustrates disabled people.

417
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:52,015
Several deaf and blind people shared with me that this is their least favorite trope,

418
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:55,218
the savant, such as in Perception and The Quiet Man.

419
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:59,241
This is written in a variety of ways, and usually poorly.

420
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:02,023
For example, echolocation for sightless characters

421
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:04,745
is ironically often shown visually to players.

422
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:10,230
These cliches only reinforce misconceptions people have about deaf and blind people,

423
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,652
as well as projecting the fact that these characters are broken

424
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:16,034
and can only be capable with magical abilities.

425
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:19,796
I think Hellblade dodged this because it wasn't replacing anything,

426
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,557
and it wasn't fundamental to her existence.

427
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:24,958
It was just like any other skill in an adventure game,

428
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,939
like God of War or Spider-Man.

429
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:29,060
Again, it was empowering.

430
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,961
I highly recommend watching the talk given at GDC last year by the team.

431
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:33,442
Spoiler.

432
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,783
They came to the great revelation

433
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:38,544
that psychosis is just one of many ways to experience reality,

434
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:40,885
i.e., we're all human,

435
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:43,426
and disability is just normal human variation.

436
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:49,725
More than anything, I'd love to see for disabled representation to be more casual.

437
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:52,846
You really don't have to write about the disabilities.

438
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:57,368
I see people beside themselves on social media whenever a character happens to be disabled

439
00:22:57,368 --> 00:23:00,429
in games like Overwatch because it's that rare.

440
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,550
This is Angel Giafria, cosplaying as McCree.

441
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,411
She's a one-handed actress that has a real bionic arm.

442
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:08,772
Hashtag, representation matters.

443
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,962
I really enjoyed Shadow of the Tomb Raider,

444
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:16,004
and I was shocked and excited when not one,

445
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:19,148
but three NPCs were blind and disfigured.

446
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,950
For all but one, there was no discussion

447
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,192
of their disabilities, it was just who they were,

448
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:25,615
and they were good people, and they didn't die.

449
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:31,486
Back to my visit with the Gears of War team.

450
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:32,986
There was discussion of representation

451
00:23:32,986 --> 00:23:34,627
and how that might look in a game

452
00:23:34,627 --> 00:23:36,888
with very physically fit characters.

453
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:40,049
Now, I don't know for sure that it was my input,

454
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,490
so I can't really take credit,

455
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,731
but in the reveal trailer for Gears 5,

456
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:47,393
we see one of the main characters, JD Phoenix,

457
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,614
stop for a moment, wince in pain,

458
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:52,215
and activate a futuristic prosthetic.

459
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:54,776
Major chronic pain representation, just like that.

460
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:03,113
The best place to start from is to realize that there are more subtle ways to show a

461
00:24:03,113 --> 00:24:04,875
character might have a disability.

462
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:10,182
Main characters or not, side characters, bit characters, hell we need to be seeing more

463
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:14,447
disabled people in crowded street scenes since that would just better reflect reality.

464
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:23,840
So, start small. Braces on a character's wrists, elbows, shoulders, or knees. An indication

465
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,022
that they have chronic pain. Young characters with canes, crutches, or wheelchairs. Just

466
00:24:29,022 --> 00:24:33,884
make sure they're not antiquated or inappropriate. Make deaf or blind characters that aren't

467
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:35,524
old people or savants.

468
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:39,007
How about a character that communicates with a smartphone?

469
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:43,210
Stop giving the disfigurements, limps, or limb differences to the evil characters.

470
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,731
An important note, as with any other character,

471
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:48,733
disabled people are as diverse as all of humanity.

472
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:50,635
We're not just white men.

473
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:54,998
We need to see more disabled people of color, women, LGBTQ+, characters.

474
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:56,459
Someone could be all of these.

475
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,660
I have multiple disabilities.

476
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,342
I'm bisexual, non-binary, and an adventurer.

477
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:04,231
At this point, you might be thinking, screw it.

478
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:06,715
I'm going to make a game about cats because cats are easy.

479
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:09,319
Well, hold it right there because this

480
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:12,543
is my one-eyed boy, Odin, and he's here to tell you

481
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:14,386
that you don't get off that easy.

482
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,405
Ah, the missing eye.

483
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:19,466
So what's this about villains?

484
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:21,647
Evil characters are almost always crazy,

485
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:23,208
disfigured, or disabled.

486
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,048
Even when it's player choice to be evil,

487
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:26,769
as in Mass Effect or Fable,

488
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:29,050
you become disfigured and scarred.

489
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,931
Deus Ex was ripe for exploring disability

490
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:34,852
and what transhumanism might mean for us.

491
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:36,533
But like most cyberpunk narratives,

492
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,314
no disabled people or accessible streets

493
00:25:38,314 --> 00:25:39,534
are to be seen anywhere.

494
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:43,017
I live with implants that make me an actual cyborg.

495
00:25:43,017 --> 00:25:45,939
There's a lot of people creating these futuristic worlds

496
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:50,743
without exploring the kind of devices disabled people live with here and now.

497
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:51,984
I use wheels.

498
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:55,167
I get nutrition by IV and have a port that goes directly to my stomach.

499
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,748
They're not a choice.

500
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:58,550
They keep me alive and autonomous.

501
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,832
They have potentially life-threatening malfunctions.

502
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:06,368
I love the character design in Deus Ex. Look at that.

503
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:10,109
That's absolutely what I want my disability representation to look like.

504
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:12,890
It's one of my absolute favorite IPs.

505
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,650
But Hugh Darrow is the villain in Deus Ex Human Revolution.

506
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,892
He's genetically incompatible with the technology he invented, augmentations,

507
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:25,233
and unable to cure his own disabilities, he became hellbent on destroying augmented people.

508
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,995
It came so close.

509
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:30,517
Genetic incompatibility is quite realistic.

510
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:31,958
I frequently think about the fact

511
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,899
that if I were to need prosthetics,

512
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:36,941
they wouldn't be an option for me because I'm too fragile.

513
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:39,804
But why does that lead to Darrow becoming bitter,

514
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:42,025
hateful, and instrumental in augmenting

515
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:43,326
people's persecution?

516
00:26:43,326 --> 00:26:46,428
This is bigotry, and disability doesn't make us bigots.

517
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:48,810
Of course, he also dies.

518
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:53,308
Spider-Man on the PS4 was another recent example.

519
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:55,789
Dr. Otto Octavius became evil in part

520
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:58,230
because of his disabilities, even though he

521
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,771
had altruistic origins.

522
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:02,072
The only real depictions of disability in the game

523
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:04,493
were through the lens of devastating disease and cure.

524
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,394
Now, I don't want to make the claim

525
00:27:06,394 --> 00:27:10,436
that disabled people can't ever be bad, but too often,

526
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:13,958
disability is only a signpost or catalyst for evilness.

527
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:16,619
If we saw disability applied more positively

528
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,260
in the world building, these games

529
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,621
would have come off much better.

530
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:25,764
Perhaps we haven't earned the right to make the bad guys and enemies disabled

531
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:28,365
until we're more deliberate in inclusion.

532
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:30,046
And here's a shocking idea.

533
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:33,128
Maybe have even more than one example of disability

534
00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:34,729
in order to mitigate cliches.

535
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:38,491
When you only have a single representation in a fictional world,

536
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,692
they'll by design be a stereotype.

537
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:44,634
And since, as I say, a quarter of the world is disabled,

538
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:46,615
it just also makes more sense.

539
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,217
Now Overcooked is a fun series.

540
00:27:50,217 --> 00:27:52,458
One of the playable characters, a raccoon,

541
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,779
is a wheelchair user.

542
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,420
I love it so much.

543
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,061
We don't know why he uses a wheelchair

544
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:58,362
and we don't really need to.

545
00:27:58,362 --> 00:28:01,063
Of course, this requires making the levels accessible,

546
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:03,024
but that should be happening more anyway.

547
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:05,046
There's nothing weirder than playing a game

548
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:07,187
and noting the city I'm walking around in

549
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,868
doesn't have a single disabled person,

550
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:11,630
a dropped curb, or that there's stairs everywhere.

551
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,270
Where did we all go?

552
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:15,907
Now, Nights in the Woods was a cult favorite.

553
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:18,008
This is partly because the whimsical story

554
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:20,949
and characters really had a lot to identify with.

555
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,890
It had excellent LGBTQ plus representation

556
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,971
and surprisingly good mentions of sleep issues,

557
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,111
mental health and movements like flapping.

558
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:31,112
There was no physical disability,

559
00:28:31,112 --> 00:28:34,133
but many of us appreciate the affectionate nods

560
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:35,734
to mental health and neurodiversity.

561
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:41,588
So Hammerlock in Borderlands 2 was probably one of my favourite disabled NPCs.

562
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:44,610
He had robotic... well, half his body was robotic.

563
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,992
He was so funny and as wholesome as it gets in the Borderlands universe.

564
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:53,193
Half his quests were ridiculous escapades of revenge on the creatures that took his body parts.

565
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:56,857
Mass Effect is a difficult one to celebrate,

566
00:28:56,857 --> 00:28:59,359
because it had one of the most horrific depictions

567
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,020
of an autistic character that I may have ever seen.

568
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,781
He was tortured.

569
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:05,883
But it also had one of the best

570
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:08,004
physically disabled characters.

571
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:10,005
Joker was the Normandy star pilot.

572
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:12,086
It's a shame he wasn't a main party character,

573
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:15,609
but he was extremely capable and damn hilarious.

574
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:17,410
His disability was brittle bone disease,

575
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,071
which incidentally is a sister disease to mine.

576
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,952
And so I saw a lot of myself in the Joker.

577
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:27,474
He made fun of his own disabilities and the crew's awkwardness about it in a very endearing

578
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,694
and realistic way.

579
00:29:28,694 --> 00:29:33,676
The crew highly respected Joker and Shepard even risked her life to save him.

580
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:37,337
Yes, sorry Shepard will always be a woman to me.

581
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:40,678
I actually photoshopped that because I could only find one with male Shep in it.

582
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:46,439
Finally, Moss was the first character that used sign language in a game.

583
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:50,760
Since I'm not deaf, here's what Susan, who recently passed away, had to say on Twitter.

584
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:55,908
Seeing Moss use ASL brought me to tears.

585
00:29:55,908 --> 00:29:59,489
Seeing the language I've used my entire life

586
00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:01,630
finally be put in a game as a mechanic

587
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,151
and not a plot device for some victim.

588
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:05,292
It was just incredible.

589
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:09,454
So I'm really not saying never explore disability

590
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:12,515
as a main story arc because if done without assumptions

591
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:15,417
and the right lens, it can be pretty powerful.

592
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,717
Otherwise, we're still at a point

593
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:19,618
that even when it's not overwhelmingly negative,

594
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,300
stories about disabled people aren't exactly positive.

595
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:26,181
Now, the wheelchair in The Surge is a total surprise

596
00:30:26,181 --> 00:30:28,442
as you take hold of the controls.

597
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:31,683
I was so excited that I actually squealed out loud

598
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:33,303
and spent an hour wheeling around

599
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:35,203
where there was no game content

600
00:30:35,203 --> 00:30:37,804
because I knew the inevitable was likely coming.

601
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:39,444
The wheelchair wouldn't last.

602
00:30:39,444 --> 00:30:42,465
The inevitable cure takes the form of an exosuit,

603
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:46,366
which is a common plot device along with magical medicine.

604
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:48,206
Much like Deus Ex and Spider-Man,

605
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:50,467
the assumption seems to be that all disability

606
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,468
must be cured and that technology will be the answer.

607
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,734
The end of the game is again contempt and fear of the wheelchair, with it being used with horror to taunt the player.

608
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:06,058
I have really convicting feelings about The Surge because I love the game.

609
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:14,305
In the end, I'll always fondly remember wheeling around an empty, boring train station, enjoying somewhat accurate wheelchair physics for the first time ever.

610
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,628
Although, they did forget the cushion in the seat.

611
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:23,596
Let's just move toward telling disabled stories in more positive and respectful ways with less sad stereotypes.

612
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:24,757
Okay, let's do a quick summary with some takeaways.

613
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:36,154
Please do include disability in your characters, crowds,

614
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:36,854
and worlds.

615
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,674
Include disability in diversity efforts.

616
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:41,895
Portray disability positively.

617
00:31:41,895 --> 00:31:44,316
Make disabled characters diverse.

618
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:46,996
Include disability and mental health.

619
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:48,957
And consult disabled people.

620
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:51,137
But please don't make assumptions.

621
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:53,738
Exploit disability as a tool for negative emotions.

622
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:55,958
Erase disability entirely.

623
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,499
And please don't make it the villains disabled.

624
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:04,706
TV Tropes is an excellent resource to acquaint yourself with common mistakes on representation

625
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:05,526
across the board.

626
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:07,707
I meant to put the link in there, I just remembered I did not.

627
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:07,967
Or did I?

628
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,187
Oh, I did.

629
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:09,087
TVTropes.org.

630
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:09,308
Thank God.

631
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:09,848
A footnote.

632
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:15,609
Language is hard, and especially since there are cultural differences between countries

633
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:18,010
and even among individuals.

634
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,851
For example, do we say disabled person or person with disability?

635
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:25,312
I prefer disabled person, as do most of my friends,

636
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:28,253
so the short of it is, it's not rude to ask,

637
00:32:28,253 --> 00:32:30,133
so please don't be afraid to.

638
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:33,374
In fact, questions are so much more appreciated

639
00:32:33,374 --> 00:32:36,394
than using terrible euphemisms like differently abled.

640
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:39,215
Final footnote, as an accessibility expert,

641
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:42,555
I have to ask, if you're going to feature stories

642
00:32:42,555 --> 00:32:45,596
about disabled characters, please do your best

643
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,076
to make the games physically and cognitively accessible

644
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,697
to those players themselves.

645
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:52,869
So it's dangerous to go alone.

646
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:53,372
Take us.

647
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,817
If you involve disabled people in your process,

648
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:59,499
as early as possible, you'll be less likely to fall

649
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:00,860
into the common traps.

650
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,362
Whether actively hiring more disabled people on your team

651
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:04,623
or bringing in consultants,

652
00:33:04,623 --> 00:33:07,025
ultimately we're the experts of what it's like

653
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:08,046
to live with disability.

654
00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:11,468
Assumptions are naturally informed by stigma,

655
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:14,130
and imagined ideas of living with any aspect

656
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,152
of the human condition can never be accurate

657
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:18,374
because it's really quite different

658
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:20,035
when you live it every day,

659
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:22,517
adapting, surviving, and thriving.

660
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:26,719
Grab my details, but I also encourage you to look for more perspectives.

661
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:30,700
I could put you in touch with my community or utilize your own.

662
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,862
Please also value people's time and expertise appropriately.

663
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:37,944
I truly believe that positive disability representation can

664
00:33:37,944 --> 00:33:42,686
begin to heal trauma and stigma, and it doesn't need to be an explicit message.

665
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:47,768
At the moment, we often just don't exist on a fundamental level in games.

666
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:54,297
A less direct approach can reach greater audiences than we take a giant hammer with change written

667
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:56,000
on it and huge letters.

668
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,949
Games are just so powerful because they penetrate people's lives no matter the genre, platform

669
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:01,951
or how serious they are.

670
00:34:03,732 --> 00:34:05,954
I adore this industry to my very core.

671
00:34:05,954 --> 00:34:10,698
I admire and appreciate all of you that work so hard to make games inclusive.

672
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:14,701
I fully recognize that in order to get better, we need to make mistakes.

673
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:19,245
As always, I hope I haven't been too unkind and I'm leaving you with some practical ideas

674
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:21,187
and a spark of inspiration for moving forward.

675
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:26,131
The magic of representation happens when all our various disciplines work together and

676
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:27,512
it's just part of our culture.

677
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:30,813
Remember, one quarter of the world are disabled,

678
00:34:30,813 --> 00:34:35,614
including people of all genders, races, cultures, sexualities, backgrounds.

679
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:39,255
And games are profoundly important in so many disabled people's lives.

680
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:41,475
And finally, please don't forget I took an arrow to the knee

681
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:42,335
and I'm still an adventurer.

682
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:42,735
APPLAUSE

683
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:43,715
Wow, that was pretty traumatic, wasn't it?

684
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:44,556
But such is the life of an adventurer.
