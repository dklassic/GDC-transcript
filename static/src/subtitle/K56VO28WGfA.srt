1
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,464
First off, I want to thank all of you for coming.

2
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:08,206
It is the first session of the day,

3
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:10,568
and if you're like me, you are super tired.

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:12,870
So I appreciate that you took the time to be here,

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,213
because if it weren't my talk,

6
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:17,474
it'd be hard-pressed to get me

7
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:18,735
somewhere at 9.30 in the morning.

8
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,436
So, hello everyone.

9
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:28,160
I am Tara and today we're going to be talking about Evolve and Adventure in Accessibility

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:28,680
Retrofitting.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,684
So basically, I always say, and I tell people this over and over, you should always consider

12
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:35,765
accessibility from the very beginning of a project.

13
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:38,027
But what happens when you don't?

14
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,748
And that's what this session is about.

15
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:44,831
So if you want, you can also follow me on the Twitter.

16
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:46,352
It's right down there at the bottom.

17
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:51,596
In case you have a question we don't get to and you want to ask me later.

18
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:55,999
But fair warning, my Twitter account is mostly pictures of cats and beer.

19
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:02,715
All right, so about me. I have worked on some stuff.

20
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:05,456
I always think these slides are kind of silly,

21
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:08,058
because it is like, why you should listen to me on this subject?

22
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:11,439
But basically, I have been in the video game industry for about nine years.

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,901
Mostly working at AAA studios on stuff like Saints Row 2,

24
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:19,203
Evolve, obviously, Bioshock Infinite, Red Faction Guerrilla.

25
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:22,584
But I have also been in game accessibility for eight years,

26
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:25,685
starting with AbleGamers, later becoming the chairperson

27
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:27,806
of the IGDA Game Accessibility SIG,

28
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:29,427
where I championed some.

29
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:34,332
cool stuff, and then just last Monday there was the first ever

30
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:40,158
game accessibility conference, hashtag GAConf, and I was the co-chair

31
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:45,242
or co-director, whatever you want to call it, of that conference.

32
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:49,747
I guess I've done work in this field, just trust me. I promise I'm not lying to you.

33
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:55,632
So in this presentation, what are we going to be talking about today?

34
00:01:56,773 --> 00:02:01,054
So step one was how did we evaluate our accessibility after the fact?

35
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,495
What did we eventually do to make our game more accessible?

36
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:06,736
What did we learn during this process?

37
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:11,618
And how can you just take what we did, use that knowledge to make your projects better,

38
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,478
and not make the same mistakes we did?

39
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:19,506
So obviously the first question was, how well did we do?

40
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:22,728
And something interesting about asking that question is

41
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,769
you have to have a benchmark to grade yourself against.

42
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,191
And we didn't actually have one.

43
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,433
So although there are plenty of guidelines out there on

44
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:32,035
how you should develop an accessible game, there isn't

45
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:34,697
really a scorecard to check your game against.

46
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:36,258
So that's where we started.

47
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:36,858
We made one.

48
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:42,891
We took the guidelines that were published at GameAccessibilityGuidelines.com,

49
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:46,173
the includification guidelines by AbleGamers,

50
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:49,875
the special effect wish list, and then all of the recommendations

51
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:52,357
by the IGDA Game Accessibility SIG,

52
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:55,499
and we combined them into a giant feature list,

53
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,041
of course moving duplicates because there were some,

54
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:00,523
and kind of starting off that.

55
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:05,867
In the end, we had about 150 unique accessibility action items

56
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:08,308
that we could check against to see if we had done it or not.

57
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:13,859
So once we basically had this giant list of features,

58
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,699
we know not all features are created equal,

59
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,700
so we evaluated each feature for a few different things.

60
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,161
So number one was its reach,

61
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:23,461
or the number of people it would benefit.

62
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,182
The next one was the impact,

63
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:27,782
so the difference it would make to the people it reached.

64
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,563
And then the cost.

65
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,963
Now when we considered the cost,

66
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,804
we did that in the amount of effort

67
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:34,704
that would have been needed.

68
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:38,927
if we had done it originally, not what the cost of retrofitting it was, but if

69
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:43,351
we had planned for it from the beginning, how hard would this to have been

70
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:43,811
implemented?

71
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:49,325
It was really convenient to get this list together and organize in that fashion.

72
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:54,667
Because most of the lists, particularly the Game Accessibility Guidelines and Includification,

73
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,008
are already bucketed in the same way.

74
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,330
Based on this information, we placed each of the different features into a tier and

75
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,491
we assigned it a point value.

76
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:08,532
Something basic would be like subtitles.

77
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:11,653
Just having subtitles, really basic feature, really easy to do.

78
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:21,282
3 points, but having subtitles that have optional letterboxing, multiple size value, repositioning

79
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:25,445
options, a lot more work but make the subtitles a lot better, 10 points.

80
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,928
So it was kind of how much work did you put in for this?

81
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:33,633
So we went through item by item and we awarded points for fully met goals.

82
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:43,376
Partial goals for partial implementation or subpar implementations, like technically we meet this requirement, but it's not a good user experience.

83
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:47,823
Zero points for just not having anything or marking it as not applicable.

84
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,274
if it didn't work for us.

85
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:53,976
So for example, if there was a guideline on how to do voice activation, we didn't have

86
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:57,517
that, so we weren't going to ding us for not having something related to that.

87
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,738
So what was our overall score?

88
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,879
We ended up having like 64%.

89
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,680
That's a D. Not exactly a great score.

90
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,522
Some would say it's near failing, actually.

91
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:14,449
So obviously we had a lot of room for improvement.

92
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,770
So we needed to figure out where to start,

93
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:20,011
and so we started going through the report card

94
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:22,032
and looking for those basic items first

95
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,953
to see where to start and what could be an easy win.

96
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:30,097
And the key points were looking to see, like I said, if there were any of those basic features

97
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:30,678
that were missed.

98
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:34,541
And then we went through and started collecting player feedback.

99
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:39,665
So one of the areas we really looked for was in our forums and seeing what players were

100
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:43,469
already saying that they wanted and kind of cross-checking those two things to see if

101
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:47,792
there was something that, oh, this would be easy and it's already something that players

102
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:48,653
are requesting a lot.

103
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:55,367
So, once we identified the list of features, we started scoping out the work and set our

104
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,009
plan into motion.

105
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,851
So what was the first thing we did?

106
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:03,532
Actually, one of the most requested features

107
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:06,033
for game accessibility was amazingly simple,

108
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,493
and it had next to no cost.

109
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:10,154
Gamers with disabilities often do not know

110
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:12,815
if they can play a game until they buy it

111
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:14,096
and bring it home, open it.

112
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,117
And this is due to the lack of information

113
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:20,198
about the accessibility features contained within the title.

114
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,824
This information normally isn't made public, so again, it puts these gamers with disabilities

115
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:29,227
in the situation that they've bought something that now they're stuck with because they can't

116
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:29,687
return it.

117
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:34,111
I guess you could trade it into GameStop for like $5, but that's not exactly a great value

118
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:34,671
proposition.

119
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:39,795
So all of the references, every list we looked at, just asked for this.

120
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,017
So we grabbed the game accessibility icon,

121
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:46,219
this little controller wheelchair guy,

122
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,121
which is available from One Switch for just, you know,

123
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,502
creative commons use, as long as you're denoting

124
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:54,324
game accessibility information.

125
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:56,925
And we made a simple online post,

126
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,646
and we also posted this in our forums,

127
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,008
that was just a factual list.

128
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:06,259
We had to state what features we had, the options associated with those features, and

129
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:09,006
we were honest about what our title didn't have.

130
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:14,152
Pretty early on, we decided that we would rather be open about our game's features,

131
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:17,753
and if we did not have something, be honest about it,

132
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:19,853
and hope that in the future we could be better.

133
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,114
Maybe even deter someone from buying our title in some cases,

134
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:27,315
rather than having them buy it and go through that experience

135
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,735
where they just spent their money on something they cannot use.

136
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,136
I was talking to one of the co-founders, Phil,

137
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,977
and kind of advocating on why we should do this.

138
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,717
He was like, yes, we need to put that information out there.

139
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:39,498
Not doing it would just be shitty.

140
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,442
So it was very nice to get that kind of buy-in

141
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:46,847
Because I don't know if you guys have ever been at a studio like that where you don't say

142
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:50,632
You don't say anything that could stop someone from buying your title. So it was very

143
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:54,096
refreshing to be someplace that that was honest and

144
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:56,820
Didn't want to have a gamer buy something they couldn't use

145
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:05,080
So, the next feature we actually got as one of the number one requested things out of

146
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,267
the forums, and it also fell into the basic category on our list, was being colorblind

147
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:10,547
friendly.

148
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:19,195
So one of the things we quickly realized was we had a lot of UI elements that were using color only to identify the state of things.

149
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:26,960
So one example was our ping system, which used red or green circles based on what you were pinging or marking.

150
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,624
And the fix was really simple and it actually inspired us to make the ping system much more useful.

151
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:39,465
So we ended up using a series of symbols to denote what wildlife was what.

152
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:43,647
So you can see on the example on the left, the monster instead of a red circle now has a paw

153
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:49,270
print icon. This plant that's going to eat you now has an exclamation mark. I don't know,

154
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,491
I don't remember what I was pinging on the far right, but that was something friendly. So it

155
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:58,034
just has the less scary paw print icon. So we were able to make things more recognizable and

156
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:02,976
give people more information. And all of a sudden, you know, this section was now colorblind friendly.

157
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,842
Something else that we noticed was in our game,

158
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:10,485
if you were looking at player names,

159
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:12,607
that was how you could identify what class

160
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:15,891
someone was in if you just didn't know the characters.

161
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:19,475
We realized that the names were just colors.

162
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,998
So if you can't tell the difference between the colors,

163
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,001
you don't know what class that person is in,

164
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:26,883
unless you're super knowledgeable about the game.

165
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:30,508
So with that one, we ended up doing something really simple.

166
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:36,011
We ended up just placing all of the icons above the name.

167
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,652
So that if you had colorblind mode turned on, these icons

168
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:39,832
would appear and you could tell the difference.

169
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:44,954
But we actually had some larger problems.

170
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,755
Now I know the screenshot is probably a little blurry, but

171
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,736
I liked it because it.

172
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,186
showed one of our larger problems.

173
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,247
We had several in-game visual effects

174
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:56,990
that would either display the state on color,

175
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,871
which was one problem,

176
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:00,253
but it was compounded with this problem,

177
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:01,754
and it was some visual effects

178
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:03,575
were just getting lost in-game completely.

179
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,957
So here, for someone who is red-green colorblind,

180
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:09,759
this red icon in the green swamp would just get lost.

181
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:16,493
We knew early on that adding a color filter was not the right answer.

182
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:20,254
Colorblind issues, number one, only applied to certain visual effects,

183
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:22,495
not everything, not the entire game.

184
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:26,357
Furthermore, adding a colorblind filter could fix the problem,

185
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:29,199
but it would also make the game really, really ugly,

186
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,400
and it could potentially shift other colors that weren't a problem.

187
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:37,167
into a problem state. So we knew that was not going to be what we wanted to do,

188
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:41,154
but we still had to deal with this in some way. This was obviously still a problem.

189
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:46,840
What we ended up doing was making an additional three version

190
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,102
of that visual effects that the player would select

191
00:10:50,162 --> 00:10:52,244
before loading into the game.

192
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:55,205
Let that sink in, that is right.

193
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:58,908
For the features we found causing issues with color blindness,

194
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:02,670
we ended up with four separate versions of that effect.

195
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,792
The one we shipped with, and then three additional ones

196
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:09,114
for the most common types of color blindness.

197
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:15,576
Obviously, the cost of retrofitting colorblind mode for us was extraordinarily high.

198
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,517
It literally quadrupled the work of some of the visual effects.

199
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:25,740
But we knew this was something that we needed to be aware of going forward, and we kind

200
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,922
of made it our internal goal to not introduce anything new because we were still releasing

201
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:32,142
hunters, monsters.

202
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:37,304
We didn't want to introduce a new character that would need to be hooked up into the system.

203
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:45,193
In my screenshot here, I really like this screenshot because you can see that, like

204
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:49,874
I said, when we turned on Colorblind Mode, it is not changing everything in-game.

205
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:54,056
It is only changing these problem visual effects.

206
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:59,038
The only thing that is different are the footprints on the left and the targeting reticule in

207
00:11:59,058 --> 00:11:59,398
the middle.

208
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:00,818
This is really important.

209
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:02,819
There are people who do Colorblind Mode wrong.

210
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:04,440
all the time.

211
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,580
So I really, it's like, just let this soak in,

212
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:07,561
absorb it.

213
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:09,462
If you learn something about colorblind mode today,

214
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:11,142
it's that please don't do a filter,

215
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:13,183
just address the problem areas.

216
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:18,525
Now, like I said, we ended up being smart

217
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,266
and basically starting at the concept phase.

218
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:24,641
we would tell if a visual effect was gonna be a problem

219
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,382
in colorblind mode.

220
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:28,025
So if a gun had two different states,

221
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,666
like charging and ready to fire,

222
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:32,229
but the concept art looked like the picture on the left,

223
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,371
we knew that wasn't gonna fly,

224
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,254
and we'd just send that straight back.

225
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:43,456
But if it had a other visual difference, something other than color, a second way of displaying

226
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:50,438
that information, like the one on the right, we knew that that was going to work, that

227
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,399
was good, we could use that one, and then we'd actually go about building the visual

228
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:54,679
effect.

229
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:59,250
In the end, we did have several additional updates to Colorblind Mode

230
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,990
after the initial patch that contained it.

231
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,591
We updated even more UI elements,

232
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:06,331
and we caught things such as in-game outlines

233
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:09,492
to make them also part of the system.

234
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:12,473
The class icon fix that I mentioned previously,

235
00:13:12,493 --> 00:13:16,554
that ended up being so popular, we had non-Colorblind players

236
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:19,875
using Colorblind Mode so that they could see that icon.

237
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,935
In the end, we actually pulled that out of Colorblind Mode,

238
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:25,516
made it its own toggle that was on by default.

239
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:30,985
That just goes to show accessibility features will be used beyond your core player base

240
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:33,189
and makes games better for everyone.

241
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:38,719
The next one we decided to tackle was remappable controls.

242
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:43,809
Although we had remappable keyboard controls on PC,

243
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:45,649
we did not have anything for the controller,

244
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:47,410
meaning that console players were left

245
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,751
completely without the ability to remap.

246
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:52,552
This was a highly requested feature and

247
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:56,334
incredibly helpful for gamers with various impairments,

248
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,775
or if they were using a specialty controller

249
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:02,897
that did not work with our out-of-the-box control schemes.

250
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,458
What was interesting for me personally

251
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,758
while I was digging into this feature,

252
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,359
I mean, kind of pushing it to get made,

253
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,480
was I learned at one time.

254
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:12,940
This feature had actually been in development, but it ended up being cut.

255
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,204
Although there was a couple people who had championed it previously, they had kind of

256
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:23,609
attempted to simply duplicate the system that was on PC onto console, and it led to a kind

257
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:24,790
of buggy design.

258
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,574
And the result was a system that really wasn't worth the effort, and so it got cut.

259
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:34,228
Now, once we decided that, no, we're going back,

260
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,409
we're going to do this right, is something we need to tackle,

261
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:39,069
we actually took inspiration straight

262
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:40,750
from a previous GDC talk of mine,

263
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,651
which I'm sure you all saw, No More Excuses, Your Guide

264
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:47,471
to Accessible Design, and we implemented the button swap

265
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:47,851
method.

266
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,012
Now, although I'm sure you all saw it,

267
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:52,613
let me go ahead and refresh your memory on what that was.

268
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:57,736
We offer the player different preset control schemes.

269
00:14:57,816 --> 00:15:01,579
Evolve actually shipped with five different control schemes for Hunters

270
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,740
and four for Monsters that the player could choose from.

271
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:11,679
The next part of this process is making sure the control schemes group different actions together.

272
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:16,281
If you look at this one, you can see that Action Reload is grouped together on the left.

273
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:19,662
Then on the right, Action Use Cover is grouped together.

274
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:22,803
That is what I am talking about when grouping things together differently.

275
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,725
This mixture of actions, not just rearranging the buttons,

276
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:31,946
allows the player more customization when they are trying to remap their controls.

277
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:37,709
Once a player decides on what control scheme they want,

278
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,992
the player is simply given the option to switch what is mapped between two buttons.

279
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,754
Everything that is with that button goes with it.

280
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:51,438
It is not like, I want useCover to move with action but reload stays there.

281
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,221
No, you would have to find another control scheme that offered that pairing.

282
00:15:56,282 --> 00:16:01,245
I know a lot of people get, like, Tara, my button Y does six things.

283
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,412
just have everything that goes with Y move in this method.

284
00:16:07,114 --> 00:16:09,296
So for getting this in and getting this tested on Evolve,

285
00:16:09,997 --> 00:16:11,959
it was actually really easy.

286
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,661
We avoided a lot of the pitfalls of remappable controls

287
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:18,805
because we already had a remapping system on PC.

288
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,989
So our UI was already set up to be able to update.

289
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:25,832
We already had the UI elements for all of these icons

290
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:26,653
already available.

291
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,531
We had like one small thing where like a monster scheme and hunter scheme had

292
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,973
something that was shared on controller but we just had to split that and that

293
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:40,597
was pretty much all we had to do. The largest loss of work was the first time

294
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:45,661
someone tried to do it and it actually got cut. Now so this is a system for us

295
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:49,183
that had very little overhead in terms of getting it implemented.

296
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:52,142
But as I was saying previously, if we didn't already

297
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:55,083
have a PC remapping available and we didn't already

298
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:57,824
have all that art ready with UI, this

299
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:58,725
could have been something that would

300
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:04,727
have been way more expensive to add in after the fact.

301
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:07,989
So these two features were the first accessibility patch

302
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:08,949
that we actually got launched.

303
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,008
Sorry, excuse me.

304
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:16,589
We decided that we were just going to roll out

305
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,010
the accessibility features in chunks as they were ready,

306
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,632
rather than waiting for the game to be 100 percent accessible,

307
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:23,973
because that will never happen anyway.

308
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,994
In our weekly livestream,

309
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:30,036
we took time to educate our audience on, number one,

310
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:32,217
the idea of what game accessibility is

311
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,778
and why it was important.

312
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,520
Not why just it was important to us as developers,

313
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,901
but to us as gamers.

314
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:45,570
and we showed off all the features and told players how they could provide additional feedback,

315
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:50,457
requests, and we really opened the door for accessibility conversations with our players.

316
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:52,761
We wanted it to be a dialogue.

317
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:58,416
So the accessibility portion of our live stream lasted over 30 minutes of Evolve's weekly

318
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:01,458
live stream on the Twitch channel, which has over 23,000 followers.

319
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,900
And it was also hosted by the Turtle Rock Twitch channel.

320
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,081
So I got to be on there.

321
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:06,922
I was really excited.

322
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:13,386
I didn't, you know, there aren't many live streams that highlight accessibility.

323
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:15,888
So for me personally, it was a big day.

324
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:21,976
But obviously, we didn't just stop at two separate features.

325
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:24,377
Around this time, we were actually

326
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:27,798
getting ready for the launch of Evolve Stage 2, which

327
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,479
was the free-to-play relaunch of the game.

328
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:35,401
And we wanted to make the game even more accessible.

329
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:40,466
We ended up having a big update on our visual effects.

330
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:44,769
One of the things that became very apparent was there was a lot,

331
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:47,631
like a literal shit ton of things happening in our game.

332
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,693
There were four different guns that could be fired,

333
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:53,555
there were area attacks, monster attacks, there were wildlife,

334
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:59,198
and some of it was very, very obtrusive and often happening simultaneously.

335
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:05,141
To be honest, a lot of these visual effects were not only making it difficult for players

336
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:08,103
with visual impairments, it was just hard for players in general.

337
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:13,445
We took this approach at overhauling the visual effects and we updated almost half of them

338
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:18,068
with the goal of clarity, less noise, and defined borders.

339
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:23,611
If you look at this example, this is Hyde firing his flamethrower in a toxic grenade

340
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:23,931
cloud.

341
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:27,820
And the before and after is drastic.

342
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,408
In the left, like, you don't even know what he's firing at.

343
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:34,234
So obviously, like, these were big changes.

344
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:38,864
These changes were across the board.

345
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:44,769
If you look at this screenshot, you can see the before and after of Kratkin's Aftershock.

346
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,992
Before, it was a completely fuzzy vortex.

347
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:52,817
But after the redesign, it had a well-defined and high contrast edge that allowed players

348
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:55,060
to know where the end of this was.

349
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,102
What was the hit zone.

350
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,162
This actually helped to relieve a major problem that we had been experiencing.

351
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:06,304
Only players who played against Kraken all the time, who were really experienced,

352
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:10,026
knew how far you had to dodge to avoid getting hit.

353
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:14,288
You just had to know before these changes went in.

354
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:17,930
Now that I had a defined border and a clear outline,

355
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,672
it was easy to see all players, even new players,

356
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,973
knew where they needed to go to get out of the way.

357
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,012
As I mentioned previously, we often had multiple complex visual effects happening simultaneously.

358
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:34,074
Sometimes they would stack and stick.

359
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:40,617
Another thing we did to help this was develop a unified language for all of our visual effects

360
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:44,559
to make them similar so you had a better idea of what was happening, where it was going

361
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,120
to happen, so we didn't have too much happening in one place.

362
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,303
Much like with the concept art in dealing with colorblindness, we had a very similar

363
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:54,843
approach on making sure we weren't.

364
00:20:55,524 --> 00:20:58,304
doing things that were going to be too busy or might cause new conflicts

365
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,285
become a problem going forward.

366
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,507
One thing that also became clear to us

367
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:10,368
was although our tutorials allowed for a safe space for the player to learn

368
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:14,049
the controls without dying, it wasn't a good representation

369
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:17,690
of seeing if the player actually understood the game, the cues around them,

370
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,131
or even just how to play.

371
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,782
Originally, we only offered Goliath and Markov tutorials.

372
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:28,244
Later, we expanded them to include these Hunt tutorials,

373
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:30,887
which were basically advanced tutorials.

374
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:35,571
Each one catered to a specific character in that class,

375
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:38,334
who we determined was sort of the best starter character

376
00:21:38,354 --> 00:21:40,676
for that group, the one that was normally the easiest to use.

377
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,158
And these tutorials allowed for everyone

378
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,559
to get a better grasp of the basics before moving on.

379
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,802
And it was a space that the player could take their time

380
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:51,184
and adjust to any class without pressure

381
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:52,305
and helpful guidance.

382
00:21:52,765 --> 00:21:54,106
So in our original tutorials,

383
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:56,968
let's say we had a gamer with a specialty controller

384
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,590
who was trying to see if they could, you know,

385
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,151
use their controller to play.

386
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:07,107
They couldn't learn that from our original tutorials because it wasn't really playing.

387
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:11,369
It was, you are here, press A to jetpack there.

388
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,190
Not a very good representation.

389
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:18,493
So with these advanced tutorials, it was much better for someone trying to understand if

390
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:19,854
they could play or trying to learn to play.

391
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:24,777
These tutorials were actually one of the most complex things we ended up retrofitting.

392
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:29,020
It was a great experience for us as devs, though.

393
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,462
Not only, number one, did we have to see if we actually understood how to play our game,

394
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:35,985
we had to teach how to play it to others.

395
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:41,829
We ended up actually having to develop a new audio queuing system to ensure the most important

396
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:46,013
VO, which was the voiceover from Abe and Kyra, who were leading you through this tutorial.

397
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:49,274
make sure they were heard above other noises.

398
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:53,136
We also had to develop a priority system for the subtitles

399
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:56,557
because we also didn't want them to get stomped out

400
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:58,338
by less important systemic lines.

401
00:22:58,398 --> 00:23:00,439
Like if Kyra was telling you something important

402
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:01,699
about how to fight this monster,

403
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:04,020
we didn't want Hank saying reloading

404
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,781
to push her subtitle off screen.

405
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:12,150
So, and this also was, you know, heavily scripted and just required a lot of man work to get

406
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:12,430
done.

407
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:17,432
So, this was something that doing it after the fact and trying to teach players, you

408
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:20,433
know, how to do this afterwards was pretty high.

409
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:28,808
Another one of our largest efforts was actually updating our in-game UI and having it match

410
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:31,790
the existing visual effects.

411
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,290
There could be a disparity.

412
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:39,253
A UI element could be a blue bar on a health thing, but a green cross in the world.

413
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:42,314
You may not realize that was telling you the same information twice.

414
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:47,878
And we also found out that we had a ton of in-game occurrences that were either sound-based

415
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:53,540
and sometimes so subtle that players, even without hearing impairments, just didn't know

416
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:59,822
that they existed, or the UI was so subtle or lacking contrast that they were overlooked

417
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:01,002
and frequently just unused.

418
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:05,943
So we took efforts to double down on communicating a lot of this information, and this included

419
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:10,145
being poisoned, healing. The Defense Matrix is shown here.

420
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:17,448
Previously, if someone was being shielded, they would have a little bar on top of their health bar.

421
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:21,690
But here, as you can see, the visual effects, boom, it is right on top of the character.

422
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,692
It is a lot easier to see. Also, if you had a Defense Matrix on you,

423
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:31,574
I should have got a better screenshot now that I think of it, but on the left you can see you

424
00:24:31,654 --> 00:24:34,155
have that same icon showing up for you.

425
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:39,486
It looks the same, the visuals are the same, they're bolder, they're a lot easier to see.

426
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,213
We also did this for shielding fire damage.

427
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:49,197
Beyond this, we also took steps to make a lot of other things visually clear.

428
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:55,021
Visual tells dead carcasses, so if a monster killed a wildlife and went on its way,

429
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:59,064
that carcass would be there to let you know that the monster had gone this way.

430
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:02,546
But if you couldn't notice the carcass, obviously that's not helpful.

431
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:06,049
We ended up putting outlines on them so you could see them more clearly.

432
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:09,151
We also did the same thing for elite wildlife.

433
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:09,851
If they had like a...

434
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:13,733
tower of light. They offered you buffs if you kill them, so you want to kill them,

435
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:16,254
but if you can't find them, it doesn't do you any good.

436
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:24,196
We also added new UI for major gameplay events, such as teammates dying, being revived, that kind of thing.

437
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:29,125
Of course, you cannot add UI elements for everything.

438
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:30,546
That would be terrible.

439
00:25:31,886 --> 00:25:34,187
We also decided to put an in-game announcer

440
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,647
who was capturing a lot of these events.

441
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:40,688
If something was there visually, but maybe not strong,

442
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,188
or it was not something we thought should have a UI element,

443
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:47,029
the VO of the announcer could help reinforce that

444
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:49,170
and display that information in a second way.

445
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,221
Like I said, we just kind of went crazy.

446
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,522
We got all sorts of new UI things.

447
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,143
We had the ping that changed, and now all of a sudden,

448
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:01,483
if you are harpooned, you get an icon for that.

449
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:03,264
Stuff that, again, we had a lot of things

450
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:06,245
that we just kind of expected players to figure out.

451
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:09,526
At one point, we updated how Behemoth's armor worked,

452
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:12,186
and no one knew what was happening.

453
00:26:12,246 --> 00:26:13,867
We ended up adding information for that.

454
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:15,647
We are telling you when your dropship is coming.

455
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:19,148
Really, there was a lot of information we realized

456
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:20,808
that if you just didn't know it.

457
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:25,452
then you are not going to get it from in-game anywhere.

458
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:30,176
That was a lot of what we were doing.

459
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:31,737
One of the other things we realized,

460
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:33,818
and I think that goes in tandem,

461
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:35,680
is that Evolve had a difficulty problem.

462
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,562
We found that our gameplay was frequently inaccessible.

463
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,590
You know, if one player were underperforming, as it were,

464
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,732
it could ruin the experience for the entire team

465
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:49,574
and put them in a situation where they couldn't recover.

466
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:53,096
It was creating this extraordinarily toxic

467
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:55,998
get good kind of community,

468
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:57,859
which obviously wasn't what we wanted.

469
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:05,819
So one of the things we did was change our gameplay to more evenly distribute these gameplay tasks.

470
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,569
Make it so that more people could take a chance at doing some of this stuff.

471
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:17,259
It meant that if there was a struggle for a certain player with a particular class,

472
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,580
the team could balance it out and still have a chance at winning.

473
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:24,983
We wanted to create gameplay that was inclusive, where a whole team could work together

474
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:28,444
rather than punish new or inexperienced players,

475
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:32,006
or a player who was struggling because they weren't good at a particular class.

476
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:34,247
We ended up changing a lot.

477
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:40,450
We reworked three of the major class abilities, which are kind of like, you know...

478
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,992
staples in the game. For me, the best example of this is the mobile arena, or

479
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:51,834
as players just called it, the dome. It originally could only be thrown by the

480
00:27:51,914 --> 00:27:55,956
trapper, and the trapper would have to throw it to where they thought the

481
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:56,916
monster was going to be.

482
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:03,798
For some players, such as myself, being a trapper was legitimately stressful.

483
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:08,401
I personally lacked both the skill and reflexes to capture the monster.

484
00:28:09,162 --> 00:28:12,564
I was known for throwing domes and catching absolutely nothing in them.

485
00:28:13,264 --> 00:28:16,046
It had a significant recharge time, so once I threw that dome,

486
00:28:16,426 --> 00:28:20,869
missed the monster, we'd all have to hang out for another two minutes until I get to try again,

487
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:23,851
at which point I'd probably still miss the monster.

488
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:29,292
We changed it for stage two so that all classes could throw the dome.

489
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:34,576
Even better, when you went to throw the dome, it came down automatically over the monster.

490
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:39,259
Now anyone could throw it, and you were guaranteed to capture the monster.

491
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,582
We had to make some changes to how the dome worked once you captured the monster because of that,

492
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,264
but it was still so much better.

493
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:50,828
For myself and a lot of other people, the class went from something we literally dreaded

494
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:53,710
to something that was new and exciting to explore.

495
00:28:55,648 --> 00:28:58,150
Some of the characters even got more than one class change.

496
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,293
With Behemoth, we actually took time to not only redo his abilities,

497
00:29:02,994 --> 00:29:04,735
we fixed tons of long-standing bugs.

498
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:06,716
He basically got a full refactor.

499
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:11,960
But we did some other stuff, like tinkering with how our Aim Assist worked,

500
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,643
changing our controls on our...

501
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:19,992
What's the right word? The sensitivities on our controller to make it better.

502
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,133
I mean, we just went ham.

503
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:27,235
I've never worked on another project that basically took so many core tenets of gameplay

504
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:29,036
and we're like, fuck it, doing it live.

505
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:32,417
Again, patching every week. We're crazy people.

506
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:36,138
But it was all better, and it made a lot of improvements.

507
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,721
Now, as I mentioned earlier, in many cases,

508
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:44,125
gamers with disabilities don't know if they can play a game

509
00:29:44,305 --> 00:29:47,629
until after they buy it, at which point,

510
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:48,910
they'll find out it doesn't work.

511
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,513
And that's why it was so important for us

512
00:29:51,553 --> 00:29:54,095
to publish that list of game accessibility

513
00:29:54,135 --> 00:29:54,976
features that we had.

514
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:57,759
But in-game, after we went free to play,

515
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,941
we had a similar problem.

516
00:29:59,021 --> 00:29:59,842
So now,

517
00:30:00,662 --> 00:30:02,783
Anyone could download the game, anyone could play for free,

518
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:07,864
but you could still spend either real money or in-game currency

519
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:10,305
to unlock new characters, unlock new perks.

520
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:15,067
And again, we really had no way for any particular player

521
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:17,607
to know if they liked that character

522
00:30:17,627 --> 00:30:20,108
or if they could even use that character or that perk

523
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:22,629
without that initial investment.

524
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,102
Again, we wanted to give the players this information.

525
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,605
For us, we figured the best way to do this was to remove the problem

526
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:35,868
by implementing a try-before-you-buy system for all characters and perks.

527
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:39,451
The player is actually able to go into single player and play anything,

528
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,613
any of the characters, any of the perks, as much as they wanted,

529
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:44,394
for no cost to them.

530
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:48,077
They could go in and see if they liked it before they spent their money.

531
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:51,259
Obviously, playing in single player isn't quite the same.

532
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,180
as playing in multiplayer.

533
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:56,783
We also offer free characters on rotation every week

534
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:59,625
so that players could try these new characters

535
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:03,488
that they didn't own in multiplayer as well as single player.

536
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:11,690
Something else that was really fun was for Global Accessibility Awareness Day,

537
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,731
which is in May every year,

538
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:17,435
we saw Uncharted 4's awesome video

539
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:20,017
that they released about their game accessibility features

540
00:31:20,537 --> 00:31:22,879
as part of Global Accessibility Awareness Day.

541
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:25,802
Basically, I got super jealous because I was like,

542
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,204
we've done accessibility work, this isn't fair.

543
00:31:28,284 --> 00:31:31,066
Why does Naughty Dog get an awesome video?

544
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:33,488
So I was like, we should do something.

545
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:34,589
We should do something right now.

546
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:41,836
So literally right right then we're like, well, what we can do we can do a stream and so we

547
00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:44,958
Didn't even like go to our we have a

548
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:49,101
Like a streaming area with like a proper green screen and all that stuff. We didn't even do that

549
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:54,103
We like rocked a whiteboard up behind my desk and erased it put a camera on my desk

550
00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:55,924
We're like we're doing it here. We're doing it right now

551
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:02,563
So yeah, we just did a global accessibility awareness day stream about Evolve just straight from my desk in the office.

552
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:08,290
So on the stream we talked about some of the changes that were due to be released in our next big update,

553
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,293
which were some of the things that I've kind of talked about up to this point.

554
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:12,615
And

555
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:15,298
we talked about some other changes.

556
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,600
that were going to be coming up as well.

557
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,641
And what was really great was the amount of people

558
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:23,482
who showed up to the stream,

559
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:26,663
and very few of them are actually gamers with impairments.

560
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:28,484
They were just gamers who were excited to learn.

561
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,011
The stream was also a great opportunity for us.

562
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:36,993
Our, again, low-budget, at-my-desk stream with a whiteboard as the background got picked

563
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:40,615
up by a few blogs who were rounding up the news for the day, for Global Accessibility

564
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:41,175
Awareness Day.

565
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:45,557
And so we got exposure through accessibility that we wouldn't have otherwise gotten.

566
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,839
And we also announced two other features that, at the time, didn't have a cemented ship date

567
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,440
that were still in the works.

568
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:56,916
Now, one of these features were closed captions.

569
00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:03,003
This was a feature we actually started developing way back at the same time as remappable controls

570
00:33:03,124 --> 00:33:06,548
and colorblind mode, but it didn't get done in time for the first patch.

571
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:15,356
Although hooking up the system to give the options of subtitles and closed captions was done really quickly without many issues,

572
00:33:15,956 --> 00:33:20,821
the major stumbling block was actually what sounds should be triggering a cue.

573
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:24,644
You know, what sounds do we have in game that are actually really important to gameplay?

574
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,118
So along with the engineer who built the system,

575
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:32,241
I took a stab at making a first draft of lists of

576
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:36,564
what sounds I thought were important and should be triggered with the system.

577
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:40,106
So once I had the list, I brought it over to our balance group.

578
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:43,549
So our balance group was comprised mostly of QA

579
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:47,011
that we had hired out of the competitive community that

580
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,794
would make sure that when we made changes we weren't breaking our game at

581
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:51,755
a super high level.

582
00:33:52,976 --> 00:33:57,259
They knew how to properly utilize every cue in game, so I brought it to them.

583
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,263
Here is an accurate rendition of how our conversation went.

584
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:07,067
Hey guys, look, I have this list of awesome game accessibility things that should trigger

585
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:07,367
sound.

586
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:08,648
Can you give it a once over?

587
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:09,529
I am sure it is perfect.

588
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,432
Tara, you left spotters off the list.

589
00:34:15,093 --> 00:34:16,474
I have no idea what you are talking about.

590
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,938
Tara, don't you know spotters make a noise when they hear the monster?

591
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:24,454
No, I didn't know that.

592
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:30,781
So, although I will admit I don't have the best hearing,

593
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:33,445
I had no idea that that sound was even in-game.

594
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:37,970
And that was just one of the many sounds I learned in-game

595
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,134
that meant something that I had no clue about.

596
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:45,336
This coupled with UI changes I mentioned earlier,

597
00:34:45,356 --> 00:34:48,337
were just another way we had information

598
00:34:48,457 --> 00:34:50,818
that was not getting to not just our core players,

599
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:53,900
but especially those who had impairments.

600
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,621
What ended up happening with this was,

601
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:59,862
at the same time we were trying to identify the sounds,

602
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:01,623
we had started making a lot of

603
00:35:01,663 --> 00:35:03,964
these crazy gameplay adjustments.

604
00:35:05,247 --> 00:35:10,109
We ended up holding off until after the adjustments were made and seeing what new UI we were adding

605
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:15,271
before we went to put sounds on the closed caption system, so we could wrap our head

606
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,172
around what wasn't being reinforced in some way.

607
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,173
Unfortunately, this was a feature that never shipped.

608
00:35:21,273 --> 00:35:26,995
It was still in progress when Turtle Rock's contract ended with 2K for Evolve.

609
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:31,596
It was something that I was personally really excited about, so I was pretty bummed when

610
00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:32,197
it didn't get out.

611
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,814
The other one was the comm wheel.

612
00:35:38,694 --> 00:35:42,095
One of the things that had become very apparent

613
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:45,457
was if you weren't using a mic or couldn't use a mic,

614
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:49,018
our game was nearly impossible to play.

615
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:52,619
Communicating with your teammates and other players was key.

616
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:56,041
So sure, on PC, you had in-game text chat,

617
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:58,561
but number one, that wasn't always fast enough.

618
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:01,382
If you're in the middle of a fight,

619
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:03,283
like hitting enter type stuff,

620
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:06,104
not very efficient.

621
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:09,685
There wasn't actually any way to do that on console at all.

622
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:12,926
If you are on console, there was no way for you to talk to your other players

623
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:14,087
if you didn't have a mic.

624
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:16,807
We started developing a Commwheel.

625
00:36:18,028 --> 00:36:20,188
This is the original concept art.

626
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:24,490
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get an in-game screenshot of

627
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,611
what it ended up looking like.

628
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:28,631
It was fairly true to this.

629
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:29,671
Basically, our goal was

630
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:34,412
Identify the most important things you need to tell your teammates.

631
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:42,217
I am down, we should group up, that kind of stuff, like heal me, blah, blah, blah.

632
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:47,501
Once you triggered it, it would have some sort of in-game visual effects.

633
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:51,103
For example, if you wanted to group up here,

634
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:53,645
a little visual effect popped up in the world

635
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:55,266
to show you where you wanted to group up.

636
00:36:57,418 --> 00:37:03,943
Honestly, the largest problem we encountered was trying to have a comm wheel that nicely

637
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:06,805
integrated with both platforms in terms of controlling it.

638
00:37:08,947 --> 00:37:14,110
Since we'd used so much real estate on the controller, particularly already, for everything

639
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:14,571
that you could do.

640
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:18,529
And we had play tested it.

641
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,391
We're still kind of tweaking it to make it

642
00:37:21,831 --> 00:37:23,612
a truly great usable experience.

643
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:26,494
And also around that time was when our contract ended

644
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:27,274
with Evolve.

645
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:29,136
So this was another thing that was in progress that

646
00:37:29,156 --> 00:37:32,118
didn't get to ship, but we were pretty excited about it.

647
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:38,722
So what should you learn about Total Rock and Evolve's

648
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:40,923
adventure and accessibility retrofitting?

649
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:45,889
So some of the things we implemented weren't that much work to add them in after the fact,

650
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:49,752
but some things that should have been stupid simple, like colorblind mode,

651
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:51,853
ended up being huge endeavors.

652
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:57,638
But none of the stuff would have been that difficult or hard if we had just thought about it early in development.

653
00:37:58,298 --> 00:38:00,820
If one person had mentioned it or kept track of it,

654
00:38:01,341 --> 00:38:03,642
maybe we wouldn't have made so many mistakes to begin with.

655
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:08,886
So I know this doesn't sound like an actual lesson, but apparently it is worth repeating.

656
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,649
Pre-production is the time to think about accessibility.

657
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:15,751
Doing accessibility from the beginning is not expensive.

658
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:18,973
Retrofitting accessibility can be incredibly costly.

659
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:20,034
Please don't do it.

660
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:24,296
The other thing we learned is, you know your game.

661
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:26,018
You know how your game works.

662
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:29,140
But to really understand how players engage your game,

663
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,041
you need playtests with people who

664
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:32,202
do not work on your project.

665
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:35,364
At minimum, they should be on a different project, friends

666
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:35,804
or family.

667
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:40,490
people from outside your studio who don't know your game like you do.

668
00:38:41,524 --> 00:38:44,505
get some user research up in there, up in that business.

669
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:46,785
So we knew how to play our game,

670
00:38:47,385 --> 00:38:49,706
but we needed to see if other people did.

671
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:53,527
One of the things that I was also really jealous of,

672
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:55,747
I mean, this talk should be subtitled

673
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:57,008
Tara Jealous of Naughty Dog.

674
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:00,248
We didn't have the resources to do it,

675
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:02,049
but one of the things that Naughty Dog did

676
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:04,629
when they were putting in their game accessibility features

677
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,690
was they actually had gamers

678
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,251
with different physical impairments come in and test it.

679
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:14,117
that was something that I would have loved for us to have the time and

680
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:15,039
resources to do.

681
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,704
So if you get that chance, do it.

682
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:23,830
Another thing was a lot of the changes that were massively beneficial to gamers with disabilities

683
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:27,193
weren't always even proposed for accessibility reasons.

684
00:39:27,553 --> 00:39:33,559
They just happened to have a huge impact for these gamers while improving the experience of the core audience.

685
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:37,803
Most accessibility features fell into this category.

686
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:43,427
We didn't implement a single accessibility feature that hurt the core audience.

687
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,032
And that's something that I have to fight all the time.

688
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:49,553
I get told, oh, but no one will use this.

689
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,374
This only, the core gamers won't like it.

690
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:54,736
That's just absolutely not true.

691
00:39:55,156 --> 00:39:57,297
So don't think that that's bad.

692
00:39:58,778 --> 00:40:01,459
And lastly, our accessibility efforts

693
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,900
wouldn't have been nearly as successful

694
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:06,442
if we hadn't told people about them

695
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:08,483
and got buy-in from our community.

696
00:40:09,463 --> 00:40:13,769
So we shared this information on our live streams, our forum, our social media accounts,

697
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:19,357
and we created a dialogue with our players and we created an avenue to get feedback from them.

698
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:23,082
We became more connected with our player base.

699
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:26,806
And really the coolest thing about this was

700
00:40:28,547 --> 00:40:31,588
we created our own little army of accessibility advocates

701
00:40:31,649 --> 00:40:32,349
out of our players.

702
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:34,470
So users in our forum,

703
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,391
they were helping other players find what they need.

704
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:40,152
The forum members were tagging devs and being like,

705
00:40:40,432 --> 00:40:42,493
hey, did you see so-and-so's request?

706
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:44,114
I think this falls under accessibility.

707
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:47,015
Or in some cases, they would want a feature and ask us,

708
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:48,616
hey, I was interested in this.

709
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:50,977
Would this also help someone with an impairment?

710
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:52,537
And that's awesome.

711
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:53,198
They were...

712
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:58,659
getting empathy for these other gamers. I mean even today they still

713
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:06,502
tweet at me cool accessibility stories or if they see it in the news and they share it with me and they're excited about

714
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:09,743
helping more gamers game and

715
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:15,725
like I actually have something to to back this up. So one of the coolest things that happened was Shara

716
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:20,667
which is Shane and Tara, really official,

717
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,828
sponsoring Hashtag GA Conf,

718
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:25,909
or the Game Accessibility Conference

719
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:28,210
that happened for the first time last Monday.

720
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:33,452
At Total Rock, the now Community Marketing Manager and I, Shane,

721
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:36,273
we would just stream us playing video games

722
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,534
and making mixed drinks after work on Tuesdays.

723
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:42,116
Collectively, we became known as Shara.

724
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:46,742
Shane and I were both working at the Game Accessibility Conference.

725
00:41:46,762 --> 00:41:50,066
At the time, we were still doing fundraising for the conference,

726
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:53,291
and we decided it would be awesome to try and raise money

727
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:57,636
to become a Bronze-level sponsor on our goofy-ass Tuesday Twitch stream.

728
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,985
So we brought it up one day, and within an hour, we had raised the funds.

729
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:07,150
So these names on the right, they are just Twitch users,

730
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:09,733
with the exception of Mommy Au Pair, who is my mom,

731
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,340
who decided that they loved games, and they want everyone to be able to play

732
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,883
games, and they put their money towards the cause.

733
00:42:19,044 --> 00:42:22,185
So by talking about accessibility with your community,

734
00:42:22,785 --> 00:42:24,705
they'll grow as people,

735
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:29,507
they'll get empathy and it comes down to gamers want to play games,

736
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:32,868
gamers want other people to be able to play games.

737
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:34,428
For us, like I said,

738
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:38,149
they literally put their money behind us to help us teach

739
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:42,251
other game developers how to become more accessible and help everyone.

740
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:44,931
So.

741
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:50,430
You may be interested at this point on doing your own accessibility adventure.

742
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:56,841
So I was going to go ahead and go over in a little bit more detail what we use to make

743
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:57,482
our report card.

744
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:05,118
So the first one is in Cluedification, which is done by a really popular charity for disabled

745
00:43:05,138 --> 00:43:08,061
gamers here in the US called Able Gamers.

746
00:43:08,081 --> 00:43:11,446
And they have, you can download it as a PDF or they just have their website.

747
00:43:12,287 --> 00:43:15,491
For me, what's really nice about this is it gives you...

748
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:22,758
empathetic stories. They'll be like, hey here's a feature, but then they'll also

749
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:29,244
either give you a real-life scenario of like, oh I see that you are trying to ban

750
00:43:29,464 --> 00:43:34,288
this type of third-party feature in your game. Well let me tell you a

751
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:38,712
story of how because of another studio doing that, this girl with

752
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:42,375
cerebral palsy was no longer able to play her game because it was flagged as

753
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:43,116
cheating software.

754
00:43:44,353 --> 00:43:50,498
It gives you lots of heartfelt examples on why some of these features matter.

755
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:55,101
It also has some great letters from the community and other game developers.

756
00:43:56,562 --> 00:44:02,427
If you need emotional validation on why the work you're doing is good, this is a great list.

757
00:44:03,965 --> 00:44:06,869
So the other one we used was the Game Accessibility Guidelines.

758
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:08,791
This is actually the one I prefer,

759
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:11,153
because I don't need that stuff.

760
00:44:11,253 --> 00:44:13,796
I just want a straight list of, do you have this?

761
00:44:14,137 --> 00:44:14,897
Who did it best?

762
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:16,079
Who did it wrong?

763
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:17,000
Let me learn.

764
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:20,844
So this is just gameaccessibilityguidelines.com.

765
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:25,049
It was put together by tons of different accessibility

766
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:25,549
advocates.

767
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:28,611
Like I said, they work together.

768
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:29,952
It is a living document.

769
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:34,194
They updated it fairly regularly with either new examples,

770
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:36,956
new cases, new best case examples.

771
00:44:39,397 --> 00:44:42,119
Like I said, this is one that I reference all the time.

772
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:52,298
The other one was the IGDA, Game Accessibility Special Interest Group.

773
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:54,098
They have a set of guidelines.

774
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:58,940
This one is a little bit more...

775
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,961
The other ones have been more recently updated, but it is still really good.

776
00:45:03,861 --> 00:45:07,902
What is really awesome about the IGDA Game Accessibility website is they have an awesome

777
00:45:07,962 --> 00:45:12,103
resource page that links out to tons of places to get additional information.

778
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:14,364
You can also just email...

779
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,971
They have an email list and if you have a question,

780
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:24,714
I want to do this, I'm not sure how, you will within two days get like 10

781
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:29,677
responses from other accessibility people who will either point you in the

782
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:31,998
right path, give you the resources you need, tell you

783
00:45:32,018 --> 00:45:35,740
how to do it. It's a great tool to find

784
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,061
people who can help you.

785
00:45:39,363 --> 00:45:42,584
Now the other thing I did is if you go to this terrible long

786
00:45:43,499 --> 00:45:54,345
URL. Sorry, this is what Google did when I published the document. You can actually go and download the scorecard that we used, if you want to have your own scorecard.

787
00:45:54,945 --> 00:46:07,511
So it's pretty easy. On the left, we have the item, if I could link easily to one page I did, the available points, what type of implementation you had, and then the awarded points.

788
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:10,653
You know, it does some formulas and spits out a number at the end.

789
00:46:12,056 --> 00:46:16,866
So I'll leave this up for another second so you can take a screenshot because that URL is terrible.

790
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:26,115
You know, that's really it.

791
00:46:27,055 --> 00:46:28,856
So I'm gonna take some questions.

792
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:30,377
I'm also gonna remind you right now

793
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:32,238
to please fill out your surveys

794
00:46:32,378 --> 00:46:34,459
and tell everyone how great I was.

795
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,200
And so yeah, there is a microphone right here.

796
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,522
So if anyone has questions, you can come up and ask it.

797
00:46:41,442 --> 00:46:44,363
And yeah, so let's take some questions.

798
00:46:44,423 --> 00:46:44,824
What do we got?

799
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:49,666
Come on.

800
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:51,086
Here we go.

801
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:55,440
I guess so. Oh, what feature did you most want to put in that

802
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,569
for whatever reason at a time budget, whatever you just

803
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,131
couldn't

804
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:07,376
I think for me personally it really was the closed captions, especially since with the,

805
00:47:08,296 --> 00:47:12,438
you know, Turtle Rock did the original Left 4 Dead and it had closed captions and it was

806
00:47:12,498 --> 00:47:17,521
one of the first games that was kind of recognized by the accessibility community as having closed

807
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:22,423
captions so that was one that I was always really sad didn't go out because, you know,

808
00:47:22,463 --> 00:47:25,165
Turtle Rock had kind of set this benchmark of, hey, we have closed captions.

809
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:27,846
And then unfortunately, Evolve didn't.

810
00:47:27,906 --> 00:47:31,429
So it was both needed and I had an emotional investment

811
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:32,269
of wanting to get it out.

812
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:33,250
So I was sad that it didn't.

813
00:47:37,052 --> 00:47:40,535
Hi, first time caller, long time fan.

814
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:45,798
What can platforms be doing and what can middleware

815
00:47:45,858 --> 00:47:51,502
be doing to help make this process of adding accessibility

816
00:47:51,522 --> 00:47:52,443
to your titles easier?

817
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,762
So I was actually just talking with some of my friends

818
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:57,624
at Ready at Dawn at the Oculus party last night,

819
00:47:58,204 --> 00:47:59,446
and they came up to me and they were like,

820
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:02,368
Tara, I really, really love that there's the backup

821
00:48:02,448 --> 00:48:07,093
of platform level remapping, but they want an easy way,

822
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:10,216
so if a player does want to remap their controls,

823
00:48:10,276 --> 00:48:12,718
they would love to have a way to basically read,

824
00:48:12,738 --> 00:48:14,540
I don't know, maybe some sort of API or something

825
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:14,860
that's like,

826
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,981
This player wants their controls remap to be like this,

827
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,062
and the game to just be able to look at that file

828
00:48:20,502 --> 00:48:22,482
and load it up and do it that way.

829
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:25,923
So I think there is a craving for a, hey,

830
00:48:26,043 --> 00:48:27,624
if they're using these accessibility features

831
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:30,744
on the console level, let me as a game look at that stuff

832
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:32,605
or look at that stuff more easily

833
00:48:32,965 --> 00:48:36,006
so that I can mirror those same choices they're making

834
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,386
at a platform level in my game.

835
00:48:38,486 --> 00:48:39,106
Yes, what do we got?

836
00:48:40,076 --> 00:48:49,008
So in terms of convincing your studio to make good choices about accessibility, did you have like a really compelling source of stats or anything about player accessibility needs or disabilities?

837
00:48:49,815 --> 00:48:53,538
Yes, so I did and it was actually really funny. So with Total Rock

838
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:59,083
When I went to convince them that we should be doing it I did I had a whole presentation together

839
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:05,688
So 22 percent of Americans have an impairment that could affect the way they game and I I did I had all these stats

840
00:49:05,728 --> 00:49:08,811
Right, you know, it's like yeah, you know a low-balling estimate is, you know

841
00:49:09,271 --> 00:49:12,334
9% of colors are players are colorblind and I did I put together like a 20 page

842
00:49:13,455 --> 00:49:19,280
deck and I was like we got this and I was on like slide two and you know Chris and Phil were like

843
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:24,044
we just want to be good people and have people play our game and I was just like no but I worked

844
00:49:24,064 --> 00:49:28,928
really hard like I got I've got transitions like can we just go through it like I have this star

845
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:33,412
wipe in here I'm really proud of. Use the star wipe that um you're you're so lucky I've got to

846
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:38,376
say like because you know sometimes you need to like convince them. Yeah well every um other time

847
00:49:38,396 --> 00:49:40,478
that I'd gone to have that battle um.

848
00:49:41,535 --> 00:49:46,738
I mean, I think the fact that I called it a battle shows how it went, which was why

849
00:49:46,898 --> 00:49:51,461
I prepped this whole talk before I even went to talk to them, because I assumed I would

850
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:55,664
have to go in like, here's the business case, here's why it makes sense, here's how we can

851
00:49:55,724 --> 00:49:58,846
reach a broader audience and improve our core players' experience.

852
00:50:00,487 --> 00:50:03,890
And Turtle Rock were just like, no, we're good people, let's not be shitty.

853
00:50:04,716 --> 00:50:04,896
What?

854
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:06,076
Yeah, that's great.

855
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:09,417
Any source that you would use if they were harder to convince?

856
00:50:09,457 --> 00:50:12,858
Where would you go to find good player disability stats from now on platforms?

857
00:50:13,398 --> 00:50:15,218
Ian Hamilton's Twitter account.

858
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:16,019
Hey, Ian.

859
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:17,039
Hey, Matt.

860
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:18,419
I've been looking for him, actually.

861
00:50:18,439 --> 00:50:19,039
We used to work together.

862
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:20,060
Yeah, we worked together.

863
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,440
Oh, yeah.

864
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,100
Yeah, no, just ask Ian.

865
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:22,720
Yeah.

866
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,721
No, I'm too intimidated by him.

867
00:50:25,741 --> 00:50:26,661
All right, cool.

868
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:27,041
Thanks for...

869
00:50:27,061 --> 00:50:27,181
Yeah.

870
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:27,301
Yeah.

871
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:27,421
Yeah.

872
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:27,981
Yeah.

873
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:28,221
Yeah.

874
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:28,322
Yeah.

875
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:28,442
Yeah.

876
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:28,582
Yeah.

877
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,853
Yeah, but I think you can also get a lot of that information in the guidelines that I

878
00:50:32,893 --> 00:50:37,777
mentioned earlier. They're kind of peppered throughout. The IGDA website does have some

879
00:50:37,797 --> 00:50:42,860
of that basis information, or like I said, Ian Hamilton underscore on Twitter. He just

880
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,823
posts relevant articles all the time. So there you go. Follow Ian on Twitter.

881
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:53,747
Hi. I was wondering how did you balance making, like, you have all these UI elements for

882
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:57,490
accessibility, but how do you balance having an intimidating UI versus an accessible one?

883
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:07,274
Yeah, that was something that it was hard for us because it wasn't so much intimidating

884
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:11,060
for us as cluttered because we had a lot of things happening.

885
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:13,383
For us, it was...

886
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:18,677
The big question really became, does this need to be UI?

887
00:51:19,178 --> 00:51:22,982
Or is there another way that we can reinforce this?

888
00:51:23,422 --> 00:51:25,904
So sometimes, instead of a UI element,

889
00:51:26,025 --> 00:51:27,066
it became a visual effect.

890
00:51:27,506 --> 00:51:31,910
Sometimes it became something we would add a sound for,

891
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:34,753
but ensure that it was captured in subtitles.

892
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:38,680
So we did kind of go about the process of identifying key

893
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,523
things that were being missed and then adding them first.

894
00:51:42,743 --> 00:51:45,265
And then sort of stuff more on the periphery.

895
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,107
We really looked to see, does this need to be UI?

896
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:51,349
Or can we give this information in a different way?

897
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,691
And just play testing.

898
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:55,072
Like, is this too much?

899
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:56,453
Is this too intrusive?

900
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:57,694
Do players understand it?

901
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:58,335
That kind of thing.

902
00:51:59,135 --> 00:51:59,335
Thank you.

903
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:07,116
Hi, did you make any changes based on players with epilepsy, by chance?

904
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:11,538
We did, actually. We cut the intro trailer.

905
00:52:13,059 --> 00:52:17,801
So, we found out after we had shipped,

906
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:21,403
and this was only for Evolve Stage 2, since it didn't get brought over to consoles,

907
00:52:21,443 --> 00:52:22,984
we actually got contacted by...

908
00:52:23,004 --> 00:52:31,188
I am blanking on her name, but a woman in the UK who...

909
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:40,314
I don't know how it happened, but she had run parts of Evolve through the test that

910
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:45,016
shows if you have patterns that could trigger epilepsy. And we found out in the very

911
00:52:45,056 --> 00:52:50,618
beginning sequence that Markov with his lightning gun, it actually hit that pattern. And

912
00:52:50,638 --> 00:52:54,080
so we just cut it. Which worked out great anyway because we were like, oh, we need a

913
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,101
lower install. And so we were like, great, yeah, let's get rid of this video anyway.

914
00:52:58,181 --> 00:52:59,102
You know, it could cause seizures.

915
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:04,315
And after that, it was definitely something that we were more aware of.

916
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:06,597
Like, I'm going to be honest, even as an accessibility person,

917
00:53:06,998 --> 00:53:09,240
I frequently forget to consider epilepsy.

918
00:53:09,941 --> 00:53:13,704
Um, but yeah, that was the main change that we made.

919
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:18,168
Um, for some reason, the in-game version wasn't hitting it.

920
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,290
It was like something about this pre-rendered cutscene

921
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:22,672
specifically that could cause problems with epilepsy.

922
00:53:23,473 --> 00:53:23,693
Thank you.

923
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:32,228
Thanks for that talk. So my question is beyond subtitles and UI, were there any other

924
00:53:32,268 --> 00:53:39,214
common feature requests from deaf gamers? The comm wheel was the other big one. The fact

925
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:43,158
that there wasn't a way to communicate with other players if you couldn't hear them on

926
00:53:43,198 --> 00:53:48,683
console like I said. On PC it wasn't so bad because you know there was the text chat but

927
00:53:48,723 --> 00:53:51,006
you know in the event of like quick action.

928
00:53:52,387 --> 00:53:55,348
You know, it's not like, oh my god, there's a monster.

929
00:53:55,368 --> 00:53:57,109
Let me hit enter and start typing.

930
00:53:57,149 --> 00:54:00,631
That's not as good, which was why we wanted to get the comm wheel out so bad

931
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:04,673
that so we could allow for quick communication for people who couldn't

932
00:54:04,693 --> 00:54:09,095
hear it or, you know, even talk with other players.

933
00:54:09,535 --> 00:54:10,476
So really the comm wheel.

934
00:54:11,216 --> 00:54:11,556
Okay.

935
00:54:11,576 --> 00:54:18,000
So there wasn't much feedback in terms of flashes or, uh, base sounds.

936
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:24,436
No, but I think it was mostly because, like I said, there was so much information that

937
00:54:24,557 --> 00:54:29,681
even core gamers didn't realize were being transmitted by sound, that people didn't know

938
00:54:29,721 --> 00:54:30,862
that they didn't have the information.

939
00:54:31,722 --> 00:54:35,846
So obviously, like, deaf gamers weren't hearing about things they didn't know because the

940
00:54:35,886 --> 00:54:40,469
core gamers didn't know, which is a problem in and of itself.

941
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,772
I think if more players had realized...

942
00:54:44,353 --> 00:54:47,141
how much more information we've been given by audio alone,

943
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:49,207
I think there would have been an increase.

944
00:54:50,264 --> 00:54:53,827
you know, oh, the, like, you could hear the monster sniff,

945
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,088
like if the, you know, monster was looking for the hunters,

946
00:54:56,548 --> 00:54:57,729
and you were a hunter, you could hear that,

947
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,591
and it was so quiet that, like, that was another thing

948
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:03,353
that I was like, oh, that's an audio cue we have in game?

949
00:55:03,453 --> 00:55:04,314
I had no idea.

950
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,796
So I, like I said, I think if more core gamers

951
00:55:07,956 --> 00:55:10,178
had knew the kinds of sounds that gave information,

952
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,579
I think the deaf gamers would have been more aware

953
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:13,700
that they were also missing it,

954
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,661
but we were so bad at just letting people know

955
00:55:15,701 --> 00:55:18,223
to begin with that there wasn't a lot of requests.

956
00:55:18,643 --> 00:55:19,644
All right, great, cheers.

957
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:34,584
Hi, thanks for your talk. I'm interested in the conflict between engaging your high skill cap players and the introduction of accessibility features, which could potentially be called dumbing down the game.

958
00:55:35,284 --> 00:55:46,127
How do you resolve that? A good example that you spoke about would be the mobile arena. How does that balance come into play and how do you resolve that desire to provide a high skill cap for certain players?

959
00:55:46,685 --> 00:55:47,845
Yeah, so what we ended up doing,

960
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:49,707
so I worked a lot with the balance team directly,

961
00:55:49,727 --> 00:55:53,970
and we started thinking about how

962
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,791
the range of our skilled players,

963
00:55:57,412 --> 00:55:57,572
and

964
00:55:59,529 --> 00:56:03,092
Basically, our goal was to like, so if you think about like,

965
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:06,854
this is your range of skill available to players.

966
00:56:07,254 --> 00:56:11,197
For us, step one was bringing up this bottom bubble.

967
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:14,119
So you can still play up here if you want.

968
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:16,600
You still have to know or be faster,

969
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,042
you know, that kind of stuff in these players down here.

970
00:56:20,563 --> 00:56:22,684
But, you know, we wanted the base level.

971
00:56:23,605 --> 00:56:24,786
to be a little bit higher up.

972
00:56:25,246 --> 00:56:27,187
So that was really when we started thinking,

973
00:56:27,207 --> 00:56:30,289
it was like, how can we bring this bottom level up

974
00:56:30,709 --> 00:56:33,391
while keeping people with super fast reactions

975
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,873
or super great planning, allowing

976
00:56:35,913 --> 00:56:37,714
them to climb up to the top.

977
00:56:38,975 --> 00:56:44,159
So, for example, when we changed the mobile arena so that anyone could capture the monster,

978
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,382
like, that was when we were like, okay, well, now we have, like, a different meta game that's

979
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:53,406
happening within the dome, and, like, we needed to provide an opportunity for the monster

980
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:58,289
to be able to get out of it now, because he would always get domed before he could dodge.

981
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:01,051
So, like, if you were a good fighter, you could...

982
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:07,578
get out of the dome quickly. You know, just kind of, like I said, it really for us was about

983
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:13,024
bringing up the bottom players while letting the top players stay up there without taking

984
00:57:13,084 --> 00:57:19,230
away, if we took something away from them that would boost them up higher, giving them

985
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,992
something to replace it essentially.

986
00:57:21,427 --> 00:57:24,250
Okay, thanks. Just as a kind of follow-up, because no one's waiting.

987
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:28,954
Is there like a communication aspect to that to out to your community?

988
00:57:29,134 --> 00:57:31,856
Like, did you, when you made those changes, did you receive any negative feedback

989
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:33,818
from people who perceived this as a negative change?

990
00:57:33,938 --> 00:57:34,679
Oh, yeah, yeah.

991
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:35,519
How did you address that?

992
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:36,540
We ruined our game.

993
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:43,526
Exactly. We hate gamers. We hate our game. We're ruining it. We know nothing about our game. We know nothing how to play.

994
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:50,392
No, we it was really interesting. So there were like two camps. There was like the first camp that was like, oh my god

995
00:57:50,452 --> 00:57:51,172
This is great

996
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:56,337
Like now I can play with this other set of friends and you know all this other stuff and then there were people there are

997
00:57:56,357 --> 00:58:03,202
Still people today who are like I'm loading up the vault beta branch because classic evolve is better like that uh

998
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:09,340
There are always going to be people like that, but for us, we worked really hard to communicate

999
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,622
the changes and why we were doing them.

1000
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:17,608
And we were able to win over a lot of people by just having a dialogue.

1001
00:58:17,648 --> 00:58:21,631
I think if we had just been silent, be like, we're making these changes, we're not talking

1002
00:58:21,651 --> 00:58:24,774
to you about it, it would have gone over super, super poorly.

1003
00:58:25,815 --> 00:58:31,379
Especially because a lot of the times we would try to explain things to them before they actually saw it

1004
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:35,661
So like we would warn them and we're like, hey guys, I'm gonna make this change

1005
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:40,184
That's why we're gonna make this change. Oh my god. I hate you. Stop ruining evolve. We're like no we swear

1006
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:40,884
It's making it better

1007
00:58:42,605 --> 00:58:47,987
and then we would do stuff to back that up. We were public with our telemetry. So we were

1008
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:54,969
like, hey guys, so we're changing this monster because this monster is just not very good

1009
00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:58,290
right now. That monster is the best monster. That monster always wins. Okay, well looking at

1010
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:02,112
the telemetry, that monster only wins 16% of the time, so maybe you're just really bad.

1011
00:59:04,452 --> 00:59:07,413
And just putting that information out there so that they could see it.

1012
00:59:07,513 --> 00:59:10,734
And like I said, explaining why we were doing things.

1013
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:11,994
And most of the time we got buy-in.

1014
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:15,355
Of course there were some grumpy guesses, but they're always going to be vocal anyway.

1015
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:20,017
Okay, thank you very much.

1016
00:59:20,397 --> 00:59:20,457
Hi.

1017
00:59:20,777 --> 00:59:25,958
What were you doing about accessibility for players that don't really have a disability

1018
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:29,520
but are really bad with observation and awareness?

1019
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:35,295
So I think a lot of the changes we were making, like,

1020
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:39,177
so for example, the announcer was something like that.

1021
00:59:39,537 --> 00:59:43,900
So I know I got really self-involved when I would play as Bucket,

1022
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:48,622
and I would frequently not pay attention to, like, if my teammates were dying

1023
00:59:48,662 --> 00:59:50,944
because I was too busy having fun shooting rockets.

1024
00:59:52,805 --> 00:59:55,406
So, you know, being able to, like, have the announcer there that's like,

1025
00:59:55,706 --> 00:59:57,227
your teammate has died, and you're like,

1026
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:59,068
oh, shit, I should have been paying attention.

1027
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:07,562
You know, we also, like I said, we increased different cues

1028
01:00:07,782 --> 01:00:11,124
and more prominent UI elements to really put the stuff

1029
01:00:11,164 --> 01:00:13,486
that you should pay attention to in your face.

1030
01:00:14,507 --> 01:00:17,129
Because we found, oh, trying to put it subtly over here

1031
01:00:17,169 --> 01:00:20,111
on the right, like, oh, hey, someone's down.

1032
01:00:20,371 --> 01:00:21,612
There's a little arrow over here that's

1033
01:00:21,632 --> 01:00:22,733
like pointing that someone's down.

1034
01:00:22,813 --> 01:00:24,394
No, no one saw that.

1035
01:00:24,674 --> 01:00:26,355
Like a giant thing in the middle of screen that's like,

1036
01:00:26,475 --> 01:00:27,516
someone so died.

1037
01:00:28,177 --> 01:00:31,079
It's like, oh, OK, I can't miss that because it's right here.

1038
01:00:31,479 --> 01:00:33,121
So for us, it was really identifying,

1039
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:34,662
what should people not miss?

1040
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:35,903
What do they have to know?

1041
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,285
OK, yeah, just put it in their face.

1042
01:00:38,305 --> 01:00:38,866
They have to see it.

1043
01:00:39,646 --> 01:00:39,986
Thank you.

1044
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:42,949
So I think I have time for one more question,

1045
01:00:43,009 --> 01:00:44,250
if there are any more questions.

1046
01:00:44,911 --> 01:00:45,331
All right.

1047
01:00:46,052 --> 01:00:46,832
Just a simple one.

1048
01:00:47,193 --> 01:00:49,655
So you mentioned that there was a colorblind mode.

1049
01:00:50,115 --> 01:00:52,637
Where did you put that in terms of selecting it,

1050
01:00:52,657 --> 01:00:54,479
and why did you put it there?

1051
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:56,080
I think we ended up putting it under.

1052
01:00:59,387 --> 01:01:00,227
Thank you.

1053
01:01:18,689 --> 01:01:22,712
I would love for Evolve just to have had an accessibility menu.

1054
01:01:22,952 --> 01:01:24,953
Again, this talk should be subtitled

1055
01:01:25,233 --> 01:01:26,494
Terra Jealous of Uncharted.

1056
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:30,396
So for example, the latest Uncharted just

1057
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,918
has an accessibility menu where all of these accessibility

1058
01:01:32,938 --> 01:01:33,578
features are in there.

1059
01:01:33,638 --> 01:01:35,520
So you can go and look and find them in one place.

1060
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,681
because you frequently do need to use them together.

1061
01:01:37,701 --> 01:01:43,385
So if you're low vision and you need to up contrast,

1062
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:45,287
you're probably also going to want to

1063
01:01:45,447 --> 01:01:47,108
have your aim assist cranked up a little bit.

1064
01:01:47,408 --> 01:01:49,030
So putting those all in one menu

1065
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:51,511
would make it really easy to get to in your one-stop shop.

1066
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:52,772
So if I had to go back,

1067
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:54,814
I would love for an accessibility menu.

1068
01:01:55,374 --> 01:01:57,896
So that's it, I am out of time.

1069
01:01:57,916 --> 01:02:00,998
I will be drinking a tea for like 10 minutes

1070
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,019
over in the wrap-up area.

1071
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:04,021
If you have any questions you were dying to ask me.

1072
01:02:05,443 --> 01:02:08,589
Otherwise, you can follow me on Twitter, and please, please, please fill out your speaker

1073
01:02:08,609 --> 01:02:10,873
surveys and let everyone know that I was awesome.

1074
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:12,035
Thank you!
