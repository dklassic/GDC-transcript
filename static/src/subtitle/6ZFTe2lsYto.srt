1
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:09,463
Starting over.

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:11,483
I'm Kristen Queeby.

3
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:13,543
I work at Microsoft Studios.

4
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:16,764
I was the publishing sound supervisor

5
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,204
on Sunset Overdrive.

6
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:20,045
And my name is Brian Higa.

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,005
I'm a sound designer at Obsidian Entertainment,

8
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,025
formerly of Microsoft,

9
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:25,085
and I was the associate sound supervisor

10
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:26,046
on Sunset Overdrive.

11
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:28,166
First and foremost,

12
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:29,786
we want to give a huge call-out

13
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:31,407
to the Insomniac audio team,

14
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:33,187
and we'll talk a little bit

15
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:34,527
how we collaborated with them,

16
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:35,687
how we worked with them

17
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:37,308
throughout this entire process.

18
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:41,866
But they have an amazing team down in Burbank,

19
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,450
headed up by Paul Mudra, their audio director,

20
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,656
and Dwight Okahara, yeah, did it good,

21
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:52,561
as their audio lead, and a bunch of other amazing sound

22
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:53,021
designers.

23
00:00:54,372 --> 00:01:00,794
Next is a look at the Microsoft audio staff that ended up working on Sunset at any given point in time

24
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:06,136
throughout the project and a little bit about how we work. During Sunset Overdrive

25
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:11,718
I was a part of a content services group there, and we have a bunch of audio directors,

26
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:14,299
sound supervisors, and

27
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:21,401
sound design staff, and we will scale and do basically distributed development depending on project needs.

28
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:28,067
So we took on certain aspects of the Sunset Overdrive audio production as well as just

29
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:34,092
assist in whatever area is possible throughout the production. So a quick intro

30
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:37,215
just for those who don't know, what is Sunset?

31
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:40,977
Yeah, so can I get a show of hands of everyone that's played Sunset Overdrive?

32
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:41,978
Sweet.

33
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:42,379
Awesome.

34
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:45,081
Well, for the people that haven't played it, I'll explain a little bit.

35
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:50,005
So basically, Sunset Overdrive is an open-world, third-person action shooter adventure set

36
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,106
in the awesome apocalypse.

37
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:56,490
The Fizco Corporation has poisoned the population and turned them into mutants, so you have

38
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,534
to shoot, jump, fight, and just kill your way out of it in one piece.

39
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:02,995
So when we first got on the project,

40
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:06,817
we decided we wanted to create standards or audio pillars.

41
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:08,558
And the first one we went on was

42
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:11,339
we wanted to be unique, iconic, and identifiable.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,841
One of the joys of this, working on this project,

44
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:15,481
was it was a completely new IP.

45
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,622
So we had to figure out, you know,

46
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:19,003
what's the sound of Sunset Overdrive?

47
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:20,484
What's the language of audio?

48
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,645
And it was a joy just trying to figure out

49
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:24,226
exactly how we wanted it to sound.

50
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:26,347
So we wanted to make sure that players...

51
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:27,868
When they were listening to the sounds,

52
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:29,870
like, these are new sounds that they've never heard before.

53
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,792
We wanted to make sure that Sunset was iconic.

54
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:36,796
So the next pillar was amplifies gameplay.

55
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:40,319
We always wanted to make sure that the moves that the player did

56
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,641
was always fun and humorous and dynamic.

57
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,665
We wanted to make sure that the player's choices were fulfilled through the audio.

58
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,012
And then the next one is excels in high production value.

59
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:52,953
And this is something that we all try to achieve.

60
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:54,635
And we just wanted to make sure that,

61
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,176
along with the systems that were in place

62
00:02:57,356 --> 00:02:58,717
that we were working on, we just wanted to make sure

63
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:00,999
that all the systems in Sunset

64
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,821
were held to a high bar of standard.

65
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:06,823
And then lastly, we wanted to be culturally relevant.

66
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:08,064
So we wanted to introduce...

67
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:17,209
We wanted to introduce contextual, non-literal moments in the mix, just to kind of amplify

68
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:21,433
the gameplay and make it sound more fun and kind of reach into the psyche of the player

69
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,195
to gather emotions that they would feel.

70
00:03:25,617 --> 00:03:27,638
And so here's a trailer for Sunset Overdrive.

71
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:36,866
Before this whole thing started, I just floated through life.

72
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:42,839
I know this is going to sound crazy, but my life didn't start until the world came to an end.

73
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,596
All right, nerds. This ends now!

74
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:13,976
I sense some epic missions in my future.

75
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:14,316
To battle!

76
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,020
Together we'll take Bizco down.

77
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,340
Or we won't.

78
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,341
But we'll get some wicked respawn animations!

79
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:50,204
I'm ready to die, asshole!

80
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:50,865
Oh, shit.

81
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,208
Are you okay?

82
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,571
What a fuck-up.

83
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:57,292
Yeah.

84
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:58,453
I meant you.

85
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:01,997
XBOX SOUND

86
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:14,171
So we just thought we'd break down some of the audio systems that Microsoft helped support

87
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:16,114
the Insomniac team with.

88
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,098
We did a lot of coverage on some of the base OD'd.

89
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,464
We helped support UI content and in-game pickups.

90
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:30,069
We worked with HDR and really collaborated highly with them to deep dive into this.

91
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,451
We'll go a little bit into more detail on this later,

92
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:37,313
but it was very much a new system to us, so a lot of learnings there.

93
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,594
We helped support some additional cinematic content,

94
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:44,577
and as well as some music support for the interactive system,

95
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:48,499
and Robert Ridihall, a programmer on our side and Paul Lipson,

96
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,700
collaborated with Paul Mudra on that.

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,482
But the two systems we really wanted to focus all focus around the hero.

98
00:05:56,202 --> 00:06:01,885
We spent a lot of time building out, really we like to use the hero as a starting point

99
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:06,266
for any one of our productions because it's something that's really persistent throughout

100
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:06,646
the game.

101
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:09,668
It's something that tends to come on really early online in production.

102
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:15,810
And we really think, you know, it's an experience that really glues you into your environment.

103
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,514
So, two of the systems we ended up focusing on, which is your LOA, or what we call your

104
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:23,536
level of awesome.

105
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:27,339
And this was basically a style tier based system.

106
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:32,342
They had an in-game style meter that would change based on combos you were pulling off

107
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:36,986
in the game, how you were pulling off attack moves against your traversal.

108
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:42,688
You would level up, and we wanted to create a more dynamic, interactive experience and

109
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,948
make the player feel more powerful as they progressed.

110
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:48,689
Another system we're going to focus on is the vanity system.

111
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,851
There's a ton of art assets in that game, as anyone who's played it knows.

112
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,571
Ton of different outfits for the player.

113
00:06:56,972 --> 00:07:02,998
And we thought this was a really great opportunity to really make players' decisions matter.

114
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:08,904
And so we decided to focus on getting as many different sounds as we could and making each

115
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:10,966
individual sound as unique as possible.

116
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:17,388
Something I always like to look at, because I like looking at numbers and graphs, is take

117
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:21,950
a comparison as to where we are, where we were versus where we are.

118
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,472
And basically what you're seeing here is a breakdown of the number of assets that we

119
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:34,015
had on Crackdown 2, which I think is a very similar project, open world experience.

120
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:37,677
And essentially that totaled, with a DLC pack, about 13...

121
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:46,544
And in the center graph, what you're looking at is essentially a breakdown of the number

122
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:50,448
of assets that we created for the hero alone for Sunset Overdrive.

123
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:56,173
And that was 10,000 assets between Vanity, Footsteps, and your LOA.

124
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:59,516
And what you're looking at on the right was an all-up.

125
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:03,507
the number of assets that ended up in our originals directory on Sunset Overdrive.

126
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:08,291
And while probably not 100% accurate on the number of sounds that shipped in the game,

127
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:13,216
it goes to show how many assets got imported into the project at any given point in time.

128
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,920
I also like to talk about a breakdown of our schedule

129
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,503
and how long it actually took us to build all that content,

130
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:21,225
because it was a lot of content.

131
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:31,214
So, basically, LOA took us about two months, and we ended up, for Vanity and Footsteps,

132
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,315
a total of six months.

133
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:39,404
We ended up having to do three full hero passes on all the animation sets.

134
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:45,347
There were a bunch of different animation sets broken out for the average male, female

135
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:52,311
characters, a heavy set male hero, and essentially the LOA, vanity, and footstep system all tied

136
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:58,094
into basically an animation tagging system and really piggybacked on one another in terms

137
00:08:58,154 --> 00:08:59,115
of the implementation.

138
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:04,157
We ended up taking about 15 days to do a full pass

139
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:06,619
on just tagging animations in the project.

140
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:11,241
And we ended up for, and we'll talk a little bit more about this,

141
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:14,523
for the vanity, they had a configuration file

142
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,844
for every piece of clothing that you could wear.

143
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:19,946
And we had to go tag every one of those

144
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:23,408
to be able to drive our appropriate switches and switch containers.

145
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,050
And that took two days.

146
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:34,754
For shipped assets in the project, just a quick breakdown of what we ended up building.

147
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:40,216
4,520 assets just for vanity and clothing pieces.

148
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:45,318
5,633 footstep assets, which seems like a lot, but it's awesome.

149
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:48,939
We ended up supporting, you know, tons of materials as well as shoe types.

150
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,960
And we'll deep dive that a little bit.

151
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,404
And that totaled over 10,161 assets just on the hero alone.

152
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:03,977
So next we want to talk about how we started our creative process.

153
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:08,641
So much like how artists have storyboards where they can concept their art on a page

154
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,762
on the wall, we wanted to do something similar with audio.

155
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:13,024
So we had audio previs storyboards.

156
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:18,609
And so when we first started doing this, we collaborated with Insomniac for many weeks,

157
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:23,392
like many phone calls, and we were trying to come up with different concepts and genres

158
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:27,956
that we kind of wanted to fill out with what we thought the sound of Sunset Overdrive should

159
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:28,056
be.

160
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:30,718
So the first one we decided on was we wanted to do

161
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:32,218
a gritty fantasy world.

162
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:34,419
So this was kind of like a Tim Burton,

163
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,700
Harry Potter, dark fantasy feel.

164
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,842
The next one we wanted to work on was retro superhero.

165
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:43,444
And this was heavily influenced by the movie Scott Pilgrim.

166
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:45,365
So, like, very big moments,

167
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:47,646
non-contextual, or contextual moments,

168
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:49,647
and retro 8-bit sounding audio.

169
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:52,188
And lastly, we wanted to do humorous horror.

170
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:55,269
And we wanted this to be ultra-violent and gory,

171
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:56,990
but with this cartoonish flair to it.

172
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,711
So, which do you fit?

173
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:00,071
Well, it was two of them, actually.

174
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:03,892
We went with retro superhero and humorous horror.

175
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:06,753
We really thought the mixture of both these genres

176
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,354
added to the style direction we wanted

177
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:11,855
with the systems that we worked on.

178
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,395
So in this video, we're going to...

179
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:14,496
It's actually just an audio,

180
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:15,516
so you don't have to see anything.

181
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:16,477
But in this video,

182
00:11:16,797 --> 00:11:18,257
we're going to play those two genres.

183
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:19,457
And at the beginning of each one,

184
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:22,398
we introduce the traversal movements with the foley,

185
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:26,020
and then we introduce characters, enemies, and combat.

186
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:46,092
Oh!

187
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:47,553
Whoo!

188
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:49,294
Oh yeah!

189
00:11:49,394 --> 00:11:50,154
I shot you.

190
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,644
Where do you think you're going?

191
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:24,724
Ack!

192
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:25,305
Ack!

193
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:25,465
Ack!

194
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:25,745
Ack!

195
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:26,466
Ack!

196
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:26,766
Ack!

197
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:27,166
Ack!

198
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:27,326
Ack!

199
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:27,607
Ack!

200
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:28,828
Ack!

201
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:31,190
Ack!

202
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,270
Thank you very much.

203
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:32,891
No!

204
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,712
No!

205
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:38,916
There it is!

206
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:46,042
Ah!

207
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:49,384
So in that audio.

208
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:49,625
Love this.

209
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:53,733
Thank you.

210
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:58,717
Just if you could hear at the very end, we had those really contextual moments with the

211
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,418
bells and then the music playing.

212
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,240
So that's kind of what the idea we wanted to transfer back into the game.

213
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,262
So after that, we moved on to design documentation.

214
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:10,665
And this is pretty much taking the systems that we had and setting high-level goals for

215
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:11,786
each of our games.

216
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:13,487
everything for that system.

217
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:15,348
And from there we had to think of,

218
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:16,608
all right, so we have a high-level goal,

219
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:18,349
and then how do we execute that?

220
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,331
So it's, um, how technically,

221
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:21,811
how can we achieve this high-level goal?

222
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:25,113
And from there, once we had our system in place and designed,

223
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:26,574
we went to execution.

224
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,735
And this basically just came down to

225
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,816
what needed to be designed and what needed to be fully.

226
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:33,198
And so this leads us to our next portion of the talk,

227
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:34,458
the LOA system.

228
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,321
So you're a level of awesome.

229
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:41,623
So the question that kind of arose when we got to this

230
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:44,805
is, how do you let the player feel more powerful and awesome

231
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:45,846
as they traverse through the world?

232
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,868
One of the gameplay mechanics that really stood out to us

233
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,990
was the traversal mechanic.

234
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,771
And we really brainstormed and thought

235
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:56,713
about how we can highlight this through the audio.

236
00:13:57,213 --> 00:14:00,075
So we had lots of influences and lots of games that we love to play,

237
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:03,057
so we, like, including Assassin's Creed series,

238
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:05,259
Mirror's Edge, and Prince of Persia.

239
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,961
We played a lot of these games, and we really thought, you know,

240
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:11,543
these were, like, kind of the benchmark in terms of the movement for the player,

241
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,545
and we wanted to add Sunset Overdrive to that list.

242
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:15,366
So, interesting enough...

243
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:19,797
Early on in development, the basic idea of the style meter came online.

244
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:26,499
And this is just basically, as a player traverses through the world, they gain style points.

245
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,121
And so when they're meleeing and fighting, as they get more style points, they graduate

246
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:34,041
to the next level of their style.

247
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:38,502
And once that happened, once we saw that, we were like, oh, let's tune in on that.

248
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:41,723
It felt like that was a good moment where we could highlight that through audio.

249
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,984
That's how kind of Level of Awesome was born.

250
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:47,590
So you go back to the question,

251
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,193
like, how do we let the player feel more awesome and powerful

252
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:52,114
as they traverse the world?

253
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:55,718
So we answer that by utilizing Wwise's switch event system

254
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:59,321
to change completely the audio of the player's movements

255
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:01,002
as they gain levels in their style tier.

256
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:06,167
So the next thing we're gonna talk about

257
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,449
is our design goals for the Level of Awesome system.

258
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:14,105
The main goal we wanted to achieve was we wanted to have stylized gameplay feedback

259
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:15,665
as the player traversed through the world.

260
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:19,527
When you start off the game, you start at level zero.

261
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,708
It's just kind of from the get-go.

262
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:25,509
And we just wanted to make this kind of intimate and realistic.

263
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:30,411
So it's just realistic foley, no added movement, only maybe in certain places where we wanted

264
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,632
to emphasize some movement, but it was just kind of basic.

265
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:37,254
But then as we went to level one, we wanted to introduce our next design goal, which was

266
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:38,575
having cinematic content.

267
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:42,197
So we just wanted to add more weight and more

268
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:44,158
of that cinematic flair to the movement,

269
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,440
just to make the movement more exciting.

270
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:49,582
And then once the player hits level two,

271
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:52,784
we wanted to have another layer of fun

272
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:54,486
to fill out the audio spectrum.

273
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:59,389
And so we added an old school ninja movie style audio.

274
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,892
So really nice high end swishes, just

275
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:06,494
to give more speed to the player as they're traversing.

276
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,342
And then, lastly, level three, once you hit your max level,

277
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:14,265
we wanted to introduce retro 8-bit style audio

278
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,486
with hyper-realistic cartoon realism.

279
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,409
And we like to call that organic cartoon realism.

280
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,831
But lastly, our last goal, we wanted to make sure

281
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,232
that we kept everything clean

282
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:25,734
and it didn't clutter the experience,

283
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:28,796
because with all the scope that we wanted to fulfill,

284
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:29,957
that was the danger of...

285
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:32,099
we had the danger of kind of cluttering everything.

286
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,820
So we wanted to make sure that everything was clear,

287
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,021
distinct, and felt good.

288
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,545
So here's our design matrix for the Level 3 Awesome.

289
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:43,591
This was the level where we kind of had a lot more fun,

290
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:47,757
because we could add things that normal games wouldn't play in their audio.

291
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:50,761
So how do we make the game sound more fun and awesome?

292
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,664
Well, we were heavily influenced by...

293
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:55,186
The classic Looney Tunes style audio.

294
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:57,048
So, like, when you're watching Bugs Bunny,

295
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,750
and they're hitting each other,

296
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,451
there's, like, lots of percussive sounds,

297
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,593
kind of these non-literal moments,

298
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:06,517
just to kind of sell the humor and the funness of the cartoon.

299
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:09,720
So we wanted to take that influence and that style

300
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,261
and apply it to Sunset Overdrive.

301
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:13,043
So we really had to figure out, you know,

302
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,006
what's the language of level 3 awesome for Sunset Overdrive?

303
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:16,326
Well...

304
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:19,208
We wanted to make sure that the motions evolved.

305
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:22,069
On the left side of the screen, you can see we listed

306
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,590
every single action the player can take while they're

307
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,031
traversing.

308
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:30,093
And we wanted to see what audio can we add to the sound

309
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,234
to kind of sell that motion.

310
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:34,215
So for example, when the player is falling from a great

311
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:38,617
distance, when you're at level 0, 1, 2, it's just kind of

312
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:40,378
fully flapping, some wind in the air.

313
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:41,239
But once you hit level 3.

314
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:45,783
We added a jet, the sound of a kind of a shepherd's tone,

315
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,844
jet falling sound, just to kind of have that fun moment when you're falling.

316
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:55,567
For vaulting, we added more of the speed of kind of ricochets off of an object.

317
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:59,269
So we just took the old style Western kind of bullet ricochet

318
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,990
and added that in the mix, just to kind of help sell that motion

319
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,331
and make that motion more fun.

320
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:09,214
And so, lastly, we really wanted to put that 8-bit retro feel to the game,

321
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:13,196
but we wanted to pick the moments that we can do the most damage

322
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,097
or make the most influence in the game.

323
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:19,439
So we added them to the big moments in combat, so impacts.

324
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,841
Yeah, impacts, and then when you're falling from great height,

325
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:25,882
we decided to have the land sounds.

326
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:30,024
We added an 8-bit flare to the actual impact of the land.

327
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:39,191
So some of the tools that we used to achieve the 8-bit style audio was the plug-in Chipsounds.

328
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:43,273
It's a really awesome plug-in that we love to use.

329
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:47,855
We used an OP1, which is just a really awesome synth.

330
00:18:48,415 --> 00:18:51,317
That we, like, I needed an excuse to buy it,

331
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:54,600
so this was a great excuse to use for work.

332
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,441
But basically, you can take sounds.

333
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:57,842
It's almost like a portable hard drive

334
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:00,524
where you can take sounds and source and put it in there

335
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:03,766
and just kind of just destroy and have fun with the synths.

336
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:04,767
So we had a lot of fun with that.

337
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,348
And also, we used a lot of source

338
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:08,269
from the Sci-Fi Boom Library.

339
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:13,413
So here's a quick glimpse of the Wwise data structure

340
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:14,154
for Level of Awesome.

341
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:20,404
On the left side, you can see one of the things we wanted to make sure we achieved in Chaos

342
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:25,928
Squad, which is Sunset Overdrive's multiplayer mode, all the characters use the same hero

343
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:26,188
event.

344
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:30,110
So we wanted to make sure that we were able to switch between when the remote player was

345
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,391
playing sounds and when the local player was playing sounds.

346
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:35,693
Because we only want to hear you when you're playing.

347
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:39,456
We only want to hear the Level Awesome sounds on the player and not on other players because

348
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:40,857
it would just clutter the mix.

349
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:43,318
So as you can see, we had a local remote switch.

350
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:45,259
for the first level.

351
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,120
And then underneath that,

352
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,522
we actually had the Level of Awesome system.

353
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,963
So on the right side, you can see we had our sounds

354
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,205
for AirDash in this example

355
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:54,826
for level 0, 1, 2, and 3.

356
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,949
From there, we set our switch type event group

357
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:01,751
to Level of Awesome, or LOA,

358
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:04,192
and we just set our switch, our default switch,

359
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:05,373
to no LOA.

360
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:09,096
And from there, we can assign the different containers

361
00:20:09,196 --> 00:20:11,237
to the switches for each Level of Awesome.

362
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:16,025
And here is the video showcasing our level awesome system.

363
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:37,224
I'm not sure what the point of this is.

364
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:42,911
I'm not sure what the point of this is. It's just a game.

365
00:21:42,991 --> 00:21:44,433
It's just a game.

366
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:16,198
Thanks.

367
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,203
So another core element in the traversal system was grinding.

368
00:22:22,223 --> 00:22:26,768
Insomniac worked very heavily on this to create a really cool material, like, switching-based

369
00:22:26,808 --> 00:22:32,232
system for when you're grinding on rails versus, you know, wood railways and things of that

370
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:32,633
nature.

371
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:36,696
But really, kind of late in production, we ended up...

372
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:43,158
We ended up wanting to create a more interactive experience,

373
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:45,259
but we were actually post-code complete.

374
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:48,021
So we couldn't get any additional engineering time.

375
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:51,903
So Christopher Melroth, one of our audio directors,

376
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:54,805
and Jeffrey Domkowski, who's an extremely talented sound

377
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:58,226
designer at Microsoft, ended up setting up

378
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:03,089
an entirely event-driven RTPC changing value

379
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:04,770
for when you're grinding.

380
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:11,557
And this would drive a YawRTPC value of a minus 90 to positive 90 value

381
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:12,878
when you're undergrinding.

382
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,102
So depending on the angle of the player character,

383
00:23:17,202 --> 00:23:20,145
you would be able to drive things like EQ changes or...

384
00:23:22,808 --> 00:23:28,011
Things of that nature just to get a little bit of a more interactive experience and help make it feel better.

385
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:33,093
We also drove pitch changes based on the horizontal speed of the player.

386
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:37,675
So as you're doing your grind boost, you get that sense of really speeding up.

387
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,481
And we also did gain changes between high and low loops.

388
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:49,805
So as you would start to increase speed, we could bring in a more intense sound that made

389
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:51,186
you feel like you were going faster.

390
00:23:51,886 --> 00:23:54,668
So here's kind of a look at our Wwise data structure.

391
00:23:55,488 --> 00:24:01,689
You can see we have a top switch container that would then drive material switches.

392
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:09,351
And then if we looked at that top level container, we were driving makeup gain changes as well

393
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:13,332
as pitch changes to get that increased speed that we were talking about.

394
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:21,113
We also drove EQ changes at that container level, and essentially we would drive two

395
00:24:21,153 --> 00:24:24,194
different gains on two different bands.

396
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:28,117
And this is how the RTPC looked on the EQ.

397
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:33,301
And here's an example of how that ended up turning out in game.

398
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:38,365
But I just want to stress the amount of work that went in to get this in the game.

399
00:24:38,705 --> 00:24:44,690
Because you have to imagine every single grinding animation having to have a unique sound event

400
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:50,715
set up that would essentially go, what do I need this yaw RTPC value to be and how fast

401
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,916
do I need it to change?

402
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:53,697
And here's the video.

403
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,781
All right, just to wrap up this portion of the talk

404
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:46,723
of Level of Awesome, we want to talk about are we happy.

405
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:49,645
Well, I think we're really happy with the way it turned out.

406
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:51,487
When it's working, you can really hear it.

407
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:53,269
And I think it's really rewarding for the player,

408
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:56,272
the player that's, you know, doing the making fun,

409
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:58,053
or having fun and, you know, traversing

410
00:25:58,073 --> 00:25:59,054
and comboing together.

411
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:01,457
It almost, it rewards them for being awesome.

412
00:26:01,717 --> 00:26:03,439
And it also kind of incentivizes them

413
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,200
to keep that style tier high

414
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,763
so they can have that fun factor just always going.

415
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:10,200
Some of the things we could have hit up.

416
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,302
So one of the things we really wanted to support

417
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:14,404
that was one of our core designs

418
00:26:14,444 --> 00:26:17,686
was being able to track the end of grind rails

419
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:19,708
and to also have a lead-in

420
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:21,750
when you're about to make an impact on the ground.

421
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,752
So we just wanted to have that extra player feedback

422
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:27,554
just to let them know, hey, I need to stop grinding

423
00:26:27,594 --> 00:26:28,655
and move on to something else.

424
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,337
And also have that cinematic flare

425
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,559
as if when they're about to hit the ground,

426
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:34,900
we get that nice little whoosh.

427
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:43,865
This was a hard code tracking task that if we had maybe another month, maybe two, maybe less,

428
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:47,728
we probably could have achieved, but we just ran out of time, so we didn't get to hit it.

429
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:55,692
So then, one thing we would have done a little differently is I think we would have had even more fun with the level 3 content.

430
00:26:55,712 --> 00:26:58,353
We would have had more contextual, non-literal moments.

431
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:01,855
What the consensus was with the team was that...

432
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:07,297
with our original previous videos was that it added too much of a comical element to the game.

433
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,959
And so we were kind of trying to achieve a more mature style game.

434
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,101
But after the reception of the fans and the players, how much they loved the style of the game,

435
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:18,642
we really think we could have gone a little bit more, maybe just had more fun with the style

436
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:20,983
to make the system more distinguishable.

437
00:27:22,593 --> 00:27:26,855
So the next thing we want to talk, and that leads us into our vanity system.

438
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:33,177
The vanity system, there was a really heavy emphasis, even from the beginning of the project,

439
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:35,158
to just be who you are.

440
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,381
They really want to support the player's freedom, and the art team did such an amazing job at

441
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:47,222
Insomniac creating just so much different, unique content that the player can wear.

442
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:49,063
And we really wanted to showcase this.

443
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:51,939
So what did that mean for audio?

444
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:56,841
So we ended up creating a limb-based switching system

445
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:00,503
to be able to support all the different unique configurations

446
00:28:00,523 --> 00:28:02,324
of the outfits that you could actually put on.

447
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:06,165
What that meant is we ended up having different switch groups.

448
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,507
And we could have switchable content

449
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:12,569
based on your torso, your torso front, which was essentially

450
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:16,230
like jewelry or necklaces, your torso back,

451
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,571
if you put on a backpack.

452
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:22,740
We would support your legs, your arms, your waist, your feet.

453
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,710
All of that could be uniquely changed at any given point in time.

454
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,941
The nice thing about this system was that we,

455
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,403
we built it in a way that the pipeline was

456
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,625
really effective and efficient and actually didn't require a

457
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,186
ton of code support.

458
00:28:40,826 --> 00:28:42,588
So a lot of people are used to coders

459
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:45,710
having to go drive all their unique switches.

460
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,731
Any time you need a new one added,

461
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,853
but Insomniac was able to build a system for us

462
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:53,615
that enabled the designers to be able to go and

463
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,117
add switch groups or drive switches.

464
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:01,279
Any time we wanted on any unique piece of clothing at any given point in time.

465
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:03,919
So audio design goals for this system.

466
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,560
We wanted the hero to be unique based on whatever outfit they were wearing.

467
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,461
We really wanted to push how many different sounds we could get out of different clothing types.

468
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:16,881
Which is harder than it sounds.

469
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:21,162
A lot of materials end up sounding very similar and the same,

470
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:26,903
so we really worked hard to try and just create as much unique and identifiable content as possible.

471
00:29:28,272 --> 00:29:32,196
We wanted the audio to always mirror the choices that the player was making.

472
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:34,057
We really think the player matters.

473
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:38,681
We really want to make them feel like their decisions are important

474
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:42,344
and that that drives the experience of what they're having.

475
00:29:42,944 --> 00:29:47,468
And we wanted to support a high level of detail through the hero actions.

476
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:51,371
So, as you'll see in a bit, we supported a lot of different behaviors

477
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:53,633
that were completely configurable.

478
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:59,148
depending on which pieces of clothing you wanted to support at any given point in time.

479
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:04,990
What this meant, we ended up supporting about nine different behaviors on your hands, one

480
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:11,553
for your arms when you're falling and flailing in the air, and about 16 different behaviors

481
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:13,593
for any other limb set.

482
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:20,093
We supported material switching on the feet as well as shoe type.

483
00:30:21,394 --> 00:30:25,316
We also wanted to ensure that the pipeline was really quick and efficient.

484
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:31,240
We wanted to make sure that our designers were spending more time in the studio focusing

485
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:36,743
on content rather than working in the tools to have to just hook up the content, because

486
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:39,164
it was a very large number of assets.

487
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:44,273
We also wanted to ensure that your audio would prioritize based on visibility.

488
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:52,576
Sunset had a system where you could have an undershirt on, a shirt on, and then a jacket on top of that.

489
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:58,418
So we wanted to make sure that our switches were always switching appropriately when you were taking on and off clothing,

490
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:02,399
and would fall back appropriately to whatever you had had on previously.

491
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:05,176
So, what did this look like?

492
00:31:05,756 --> 00:31:07,736
And the number of content that we ended up supporting?

493
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:12,357
Here's an Excel list of all the number of different clothing pieces

494
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:13,717
that we ended up supporting.

495
00:31:14,918 --> 00:31:17,658
We used this as a status tracking tool as well.

496
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:21,539
At any given point in time, I could come see what was edited,

497
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,680
what was currently in game, who was in charge of it,

498
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,021
and also add notes, because I like to give feedback all the time, apparently.

499
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:36,804
There's also, this is an example of what our footstep tracking would have looked like.

500
00:31:37,184 --> 00:31:39,304
We had a status page that was in the front.

501
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:41,545
Same kind of deal.

502
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:44,886
You could see if something had been mastered, if it was final in the game.

503
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:50,988
And then each one of the below tabs is basically an asset list for that material.

504
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:57,229
And this is kind of a short snippet of what it might have looked like for the sneakers

505
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:57,970
and bare feet.

506
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:06,453
on asphalt, and we would always have images so that the designers could see exactly what the material looked like for when they went in to record.

507
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:09,595
We also had a color-coding system, so we could track

508
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:15,898
the state of what asset was exactly in-game, final, needed to get redone,

509
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:18,660
what was implemented, but temp content,

510
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:22,743
or what was, you know, what needed to get redone.

511
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:29,478
Brian got to spend a lot of time with some of our other designers in the Foley studio.

512
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:33,359
So here's an example of some of those images.

513
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:36,739
Yeah, so here's, on this picture, you can see our family of shoes.

514
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:39,940
We had six different shoes that we used throughout the whole project.

515
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,861
And I lived in the Foley room for three months.

516
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:50,763
Two months was the footsteps, and then the last month was all just the vanity clothes.

517
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:52,683
So some of the things that we learned.

518
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:55,765
When we were trying to perform the footsteps,

519
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:58,828
we initially thought, OK, let's actually put shoes on our feet.

520
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:00,750
That's what you would think.

521
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,072
But since we had 10 different actions,

522
00:33:03,132 --> 00:33:05,794
we really wanted to make sure that each action wasn't wasted.

523
00:33:05,894 --> 00:33:08,236
We wanted to make sure that each action really

524
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:09,457
exemplified that movement.

525
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:12,580
So runs sound like runs, jumps sound like jumps, and so on.

526
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,543
And we really couldn't achieve that with just our feet.

527
00:33:15,623 --> 00:33:17,745
So we hand-performed all of our footsteps.

528
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:20,487
And so we had lots of stinky hands for three months.

529
00:33:21,428 --> 00:33:23,089
But, yeah, so we did that with all the precepts.

530
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:25,890
And one of the other things we learned was mic placement.

531
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,591
We used an 8040 and a 416, as you can see in the picture.

532
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:35,214
Since some of the materials that we used were a lot quieter and sometimes we had to get

533
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:35,774
more detail.

534
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,455
We really had to kind of just crank that mic up

535
00:33:38,535 --> 00:33:40,135
to whatever we were recording,

536
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:41,936
especially for the vanity assets.

537
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:44,077
This goes against some of us.

538
00:33:44,117 --> 00:33:46,238
I mean, we got some advice, and people say, like,

539
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:47,818
you know, you should be a set length away.

540
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:50,859
And we soon discovered that there was no rules involved.

541
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:52,080
We just had to get the right sound.

542
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,460
So, yeah, and here's another picture

543
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,081
of just our beautiful, messy folder.

544
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,563
So, a quick breakdown on some of the details.

545
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:05,990
In the beginning for Vanity, we wanted to support 51 unique clothing types.

546
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:08,454
So, very ambitious.

547
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:13,040
But by the time we shipped, we'd actually ended up scaling it down to about 29.

548
00:34:14,242 --> 00:34:17,744
Reason being, like, as much as we wanted to and tried,

549
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:21,147
we just couldn't get that distinction between certain materials.

550
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:24,889
Another reason was that actually some of our recordings

551
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,011
turned out a little bit noisier than I would have liked,

552
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:28,552
so we decided to ax them,

553
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:31,394
even using RxAdvance to try and clean stuff up.

554
00:34:32,886 --> 00:34:35,328
For our footsteps, we ended up in the beginning

555
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:40,452
trying to support 30 unique surfaces across six different shoe types.

556
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:45,856
But by the time we shipped, we ended up scaling it down to about 13 unique surfaces,

557
00:34:46,156 --> 00:34:47,857
but still supporting six shoe types.

558
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:52,281
Some of the reasons why we ended up cutting some of the footstep content was

559
00:34:54,512 --> 00:35:00,499
Some of the surfaces weren't actually flagged from an art side, so we weren't actually hearing

560
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:01,140
them in game.

561
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,045
And based on how we were loading our bank content into the project, it was we would

562
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:09,389
load a shoe type as a bank.

563
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:13,854
So you would basically get one shoe across all surfaces loaded in at any given point

564
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:14,235
in time.

565
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:17,575
And we wanted to get some of that memory back,

566
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,176
so we ended up cutting some things.

567
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:23,439
We went through multiple pipeline iterations when working on

568
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:24,500
the vanity system.

569
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:28,723
Starting with each one of the implementation passes,

570
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:31,905
we would start as building a proof of concept

571
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:34,006
to see what the pipeline looked like in game.

572
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:38,309
Yes, so as you can see, we had some lofty goals and some big ideas.

573
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:42,971
And so our first pass we did, we did a complete pass in all the hero animations with a complete

574
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:46,712
outfit, something that was kind of the default outfit in the game.

575
00:35:46,752 --> 00:35:51,313
So just the top, pants, shoes, and some accessories for the player.

576
00:35:52,014 --> 00:35:54,715
And once we were tagging the animations, we realized that it wasn't...

577
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:57,918
our initial implementation wasn't limb-based at all.

578
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:01,780
It was based on animation tags per limb.

579
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:04,342
So this required about nine different steps

580
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:07,784
to actually tag animations through the animation.

581
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:10,186
And we also had to deal with something

582
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:12,648
similar to Unreal's Kismet scripting

583
00:36:12,728 --> 00:36:13,949
for each article of clothing.

584
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:17,251
And then for each new behavior that we wanted to support,

585
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,352
we had to have co-support.

586
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:19,512
So, you know...

587
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,503
As you can see, like, with our scope of the game,

588
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:24,844
we wouldn't be able to complete the game

589
00:36:24,864 --> 00:36:26,625
with the way we implemented it.

590
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:30,147
And also, with those nine different tags,

591
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,808
the timings were a little bit different for each,

592
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:33,769
and so we wanted to make sure that we can have all of them

593
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:36,590
play all at once so that the human ear

594
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,311
can just hear everything in one fluid motion.

595
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:40,773
Yeah, I want to really stress the amount of time

596
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:44,074
we took editing down to even the millisecond

597
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:47,256
to ensure that all our assets would always layer properly.

598
00:36:47,656 --> 00:36:49,157
For if you had a single action...

599
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,761
If you would jump, your content for your legs and your content for your torso had to be

600
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:57,022
in lockstep in order to feel natural.

601
00:36:58,362 --> 00:37:03,604
So for a second pass implementation, we kind of went back to the drawing board and flew

602
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:06,485
down to Burbank and worked really closely with their team.

603
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:11,706
Hurchill Bailey gave us a lot of help when trying to get this set up in game.

604
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:22,054
And we basically stripped it down so that we could drive switches based on a single event.

605
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:25,659
So we would have multiple switch containers for our switch groups.

606
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:29,574
And what this enabled us to do was define,

607
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,755
when we wanted to create a new behavior,

608
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,856
say it was a swing behavior,

609
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:37,257
say we wanted to hear the torso pieces but not the leg pieces,

610
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:41,338
we would just assign all the limb pieces that you wanted to hear

611
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,040
and exclude the leg switch group from that event.

612
00:37:47,441 --> 00:37:49,261
Here's, I think we ended up with something

613
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:52,742
a lot cleaner. They had vanity configuration files in

614
00:37:52,762 --> 00:37:54,982
the game, and essentially they just added text fields.

615
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:57,263
So we could go in and we could assign

616
00:37:57,323 --> 00:37:59,823
whatever switch group name we wanted applied to that

617
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:02,404
piece of clothing, and what switch would get assigned

618
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:05,625
to it. And we could actually apply multiple switch groups

619
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:08,465
and switches to a single piece of clothing. So

620
00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:11,046
if we had, say, a backpack, we could add

621
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:14,627
just a, like a cloth piece or a canvas piece

622
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:16,427
as well as, like, a jingle.

623
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:22,013
And we could drive both those sounds at the same time.

624
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:25,096
Here's a look at some of our vanity data structures.

625
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:29,000
What you're seeing here is just a list of our switch groups and our game syncs.

626
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:35,507
And then what you're seeing on the right-hand side is just all of the clothing pieces that

627
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,570
we would end up supporting and driving for just your legs alone.

628
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:44,198
What we're looking at next, I realize this might be small,

629
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:48,262
but I wanted to show it because this is a list

630
00:38:48,362 --> 00:38:51,865
of every single switch for any piece of movement

631
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:53,366
that the player would have played.

632
00:38:53,747 --> 00:38:55,688
And essentially, you could imagine when you look

633
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,812
at the top image, those are the switch containers

634
00:38:59,852 --> 00:39:02,454
that would have to be applied on an event just

635
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:03,555
for that one behavior.

636
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:05,957
So you would end up with five switch groups assigned

637
00:39:05,997 --> 00:39:06,738
to a single event.

638
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:13,697
And what you're looking at in the bottom image is a breakdown of the switch that would drive

639
00:39:13,757 --> 00:39:15,979
the clothing pieces again just on the legs.

640
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,505
And here's an example of a video showing how the vanity system turned out in game.

641
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:32,254
Oh, honey, it looks like you're wearing a poor person costume.

642
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,411
We also wanted to show a little bit of our

643
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,712
footstep data structure because we had the added

644
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:22,053
challenge of dealing with material-based switching.

645
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,534
So on the left side, you can see our footstep events.

646
00:41:25,135 --> 00:41:26,675
For each different action you can take.

647
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:29,197
And on here, it looks like we have ten different actions.

648
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:32,498
And so we were able to set the first switch to shoe type.

649
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:34,519
And we had the default set to sneaker.

650
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,382
And then on the next slide, you can see our switches

651
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:40,463
based on the different shoe type,

652
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:43,205
and then from there we had the action-based.

653
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:44,105
So this was run.

654
00:41:44,746 --> 00:41:46,947
And then on the right side, under the run switch event,

655
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:49,549
we had every single surface in the game playing.

656
00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:53,171
And here's a video of the footsteps in action.

657
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:12,306
So just to wrap up the portion of the talk

658
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:13,507
where we're talking about vanity,

659
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:16,249
we again want to talk about if we're happy with it.

660
00:43:16,649 --> 00:43:18,750
There are definitely things that I would do differently

661
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,771
if I were to go back and do it again.

662
00:43:21,952 --> 00:43:24,213
Overall, I think we're pretty happy

663
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:25,854
with the amount of detail

664
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,415
we were able to support in the project.

665
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:29,896
Again, this is just a glimpse of a few of the outfits

666
00:43:29,936 --> 00:43:30,997
that we were able to support.

667
00:43:33,175 --> 00:43:36,616
But, you know, ultimately, I, I think we could

668
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,597
have stayed in lockstep with the art team better.

669
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:41,619
There were definitely some art items that came into

670
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:43,620
the, the game that I would have absolutely just

671
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,281
killed to support, like jester shoes with bells.

672
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:49,563
Missed opportunity for me.

673
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:53,225
But also I think I would have scaled back

674
00:43:53,645 --> 00:43:56,247
on some of the behaviors that we were supporting

675
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:58,709
and just tried to spend more time playing with

676
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:03,172
our different materials to get more unique sounds out of them

677
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:04,893
and really distinguish them.

678
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:09,276
But I always want...

679
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:10,797
People always ask about this.

680
00:44:10,937 --> 00:44:12,518
I do have some really funny photos

681
00:44:12,598 --> 00:44:14,139
that we should have included in the picture slide

682
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,300
of Brian in some high heels.

683
00:44:16,873 --> 00:44:18,273
I would have loved to have done that.

684
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:23,856
Everyone always asks about the memory because it's a lot of content, so I thought I'd do

685
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:28,058
a quick breakdown of some of our memory structure information.

686
00:44:28,238 --> 00:44:33,881
So LOA and vanity just for data structure alone ate up 1.2 megabytes.

687
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,143
The footstep structure memory just for all our data was 1.6.

688
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:41,765
Total data structure, 2.8 megs.

689
00:44:42,786 --> 00:44:45,367
And when we look at some of our media support.

690
00:44:47,628 --> 00:44:51,149
One shoe type across all surfaces was about two megabytes.

691
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:54,430
You could in multiplayer end up with your worst case scenario

692
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,751
of having all the shoes loaded at any given point in time.

693
00:44:57,871 --> 00:45:00,873
So worst case scenario was actually 14 megs.

694
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,554
This wasn't really, I don't think, a problem for us

695
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:07,355
because enough stuff got unloaded during Chaos Squad

696
00:45:07,395 --> 00:45:11,296
from the single player experience that it wasn't making a huge dent.

697
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:22,923
for one outfit ate up 2.85 megs. And this is with a full outfit loaded. And here's kind

698
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:27,704
of a breakdown if you're going to look at the memory based on a per limb structure. And

699
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:31,485
I'll kind of run through this a little bit quicker. 0.68 for the bone necklace, 0.33

700
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:33,365
for the jeans, 0.57 for a backpack, and 0.53 for a t-shirt.

701
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,840
And then our chain belt was 0.74.

702
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:47,187
Again, this is like our worst case offenders for each limb piece.

703
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,432
And that totaled out to 2.85 megs.

704
00:45:52,887 --> 00:46:00,093
Something else I like to talk about when we talk about Sunset is HDR, which was new to us in Wwise.

705
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:05,417
This is their high dynamic range mix system.

706
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:09,921
Several games have been using it now, including Infamous, I think, shipped with it.

707
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:15,806
And Dice did a talk on their own HDR system that they built a couple years back.

708
00:46:17,936 --> 00:46:21,919
Essentially, we had to deep dive into this and really figure out how it was working and

709
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:29,026
wise and we collaborated very intensely with the Insomniac team, Chris Colander, I want

710
00:46:29,046 --> 00:46:33,910
to call him Colander every time, Chris Olander, his alias is Colander so I'm used to calling

711
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:34,210
him that.

712
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:40,887
We really looked at investigating how exactly this was working.

713
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:47,777
We ended up rebuilding our HDR system three different times throughout the production of the game.

714
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,733
But basically, we ended up with a category-based system.

715
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,296
So we were able to define what we wanted to certain categories.

716
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:58,418
And it was really based around loudness.

717
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:00,560
So if something loud happens in the game

718
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,721
and you want it to push out your quieter moments,

719
00:47:03,522 --> 00:47:05,084
that's exactly what this is good for.

720
00:47:05,104 --> 00:47:07,406
HDR system was really.

721
00:47:08,186 --> 00:47:16,192
Perfect for a game like Sunset and an open world experience where you just don't always know what kind of scenarios are going to end up occurring in the game.

722
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:20,535
But the two categories we ended up driving it with, of course, is voice volume.

723
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:24,378
Voice volume ends up driving HDR priority within Wwise.

724
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:31,703
But also, we had to look at our reverb sends and kind of come up with a category system that worked in lockstep.

725
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:34,705
with how we were using our voice volumes in the game.

726
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:39,849
Because this is additive volume, and it impacts the priority

727
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:42,491
in the HDR system we were observing.

728
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:45,513
So here's a breakdown of how we broke out

729
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:47,555
all our different categories in the game.

730
00:47:48,155 --> 00:47:50,817
And you can see it was based on things

731
00:47:50,857 --> 00:47:54,620
we wanted to be really loud versus just baseline content.

732
00:47:55,621 --> 00:47:59,662
And you can see on the right how we ended up driving our attenuation.

733
00:47:59,763 --> 00:48:04,505
So if something ended up being applied to the loudest category and you went to look

734
00:48:04,545 --> 00:48:09,327
at its attenuation and the reverb send in there, it would be set to minus three at max.

735
00:48:11,448 --> 00:48:15,490
So when we were approaching this, there were definitely some challenges along the way.

736
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:17,977
Yeah, so as you can imagine, we had...

737
00:48:18,177 --> 00:48:20,599
One of the things was just keeping it all cohesive.

738
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:22,740
We had three months of Foley recordings,

739
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,701
but we needed to make sure that it sounded like

740
00:48:24,721 --> 00:48:25,682
we recorded it in one day.

741
00:48:26,302 --> 00:48:30,525
So we had a very strict guideline to the timing.

742
00:48:30,565 --> 00:48:31,845
So we were down to the millisecond.

743
00:48:32,226 --> 00:48:34,187
We measured where our peak was in the file,

744
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:35,748
and we had to make sure every single file

745
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:39,590
kept this strict guideline that we did.

746
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,472
So we used a lot of Adobe Audition

747
00:48:42,512 --> 00:48:45,816
just to get to that granular level for the timing.

748
00:48:46,316 --> 00:48:47,777
And then we also had to make sure that, you know,

749
00:48:47,978 --> 00:48:49,539
once we were done with the Vanity and the LOA,

750
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,401
that these two systems kind of merged together

751
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:52,442
and played well.

752
00:48:52,902 --> 00:48:55,024
So we had to kind of carve out time and space

753
00:48:55,084 --> 00:48:56,085
for each one to be heard,

754
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,506
but not to overpower the mix.

755
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:02,008
We also experienced some changing style goals through development.

756
00:49:02,748 --> 00:49:05,969
This was kind of a new thing for me, being at Microsoft.

757
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:09,890
We did a lot of UR testing, which is very common across our games,

758
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:13,491
but it was the first time that I'd gotten a lot of feedback around audio.

759
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:17,112
Sunset was going for a mature-rated game,

760
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:20,253
and we were getting feedback that some of the more, you know,

761
00:49:21,786 --> 00:49:26,990
Fourth wall breaking contextual but not literal content

762
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:31,393
was lending itself to being a little kiddie or a little teen-based,

763
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:32,514
like Brian said earlier.

764
00:49:32,994 --> 00:49:37,678
So we really had to be careful about how we approached that.

765
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:40,760
And we ended up moving more towards trying

766
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,202
to go for more of a Hollywood cinematic design

767
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:46,924
with really light flavors of more of the 8-bit content

768
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:50,187
to try and help keep it set in more of this mature.

769
00:49:51,443 --> 00:49:52,051
Rated game.

770
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,840
Working with tools off-site can always be a challenge.

771
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,181
For us, we're based in Redmond up at Microsoft.

772
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:03,883
And this is something we've been doing for a good while now,

773
00:50:03,943 --> 00:50:06,844
taking tools that are typically built in studios

774
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:09,005
and taking them off-site and working with them.

775
00:50:09,565 --> 00:50:14,467
And Insomniac Games was, they were amazing at supporting us

776
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:16,468
and getting the pipeline set up off-site.

777
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:20,109
They were passing us EXEs and code builds

778
00:50:20,149 --> 00:50:22,370
to constantly be running the game again.

779
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:32,781
We had a lot of people sharing sessions with us, where we'd do desktop sharing sessions so they could help us see the issues that we were running into on our side.

780
00:50:32,842 --> 00:50:43,634
So ultimately it was a great experience and they're a wonderful team to collaborate with and they're very creative and they have an amazingly talented audio department.

781
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:48,017
And they're actually giving a talk on Friday on open world audio.

782
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:49,678
I think Dwight and Herschel.

783
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:53,121
So please, if you're interested in Sunset Audio, please go check that out.

784
00:50:54,402 --> 00:50:59,745
And then that's pretty much our talk on the Sunset Audio for vanity and tradition.

785
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,380
Thanks. If anyone has any questions, just step up to the mic.

786
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,020
Yes, thank you.

787
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:21,724
Did you find yourself recycling any of your imported assets in Wwise by using things like plugins, RTPC, whenever you could?

788
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:27,567
You know, like let's say you wanted to change the floor from metal to wood, would you use a reverb for that?

789
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:30,308
Or were you very strict on having a fresh piece of Foley?

790
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:59,595
We were very much fresh fully. We didn't necessarily do a lot with, on the processing side, to get more variations, but what we ended up doing was sharing content from piece to piece. If we weren't getting enough, like, enough of a distinction between it, we would share. For example, a lot of the footstep stuff, we did scuffs, push-offs, things like that, and when you're going from, like, a loafer to a sneaker, and really it's just a kind of slide motion, you're not getting

791
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,056
A super material based on the shoe.

792
00:52:02,136 --> 00:52:05,078
But there were definitely like more hard transient actions

793
00:52:05,118 --> 00:52:08,079
that were definitely unique per shoe.

794
00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:11,440
So we would keep those and share more generic experiences.

795
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,281
Also soft surfaces like grass and things like that.

796
00:52:14,722 --> 00:52:17,323
We shared assets across all the shoe types.

797
00:52:18,123 --> 00:52:18,643
Cool, thank you.

798
00:52:18,863 --> 00:52:19,023
Yeah.

799
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:27,867
Hey guys, thank you. So you touched a little bit on your file memory sizes for these limb

800
00:52:27,907 --> 00:52:33,189
systems in the vanity system. I was wondering if you had any specific tricks that you guys

801
00:52:33,209 --> 00:52:38,111
might have pulled off to maybe keep those sound banks from eating up all of your memory

802
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:45,773
and maybe how that influenced your process. Sure. We ended up...

803
00:52:46,348 --> 00:52:50,211
being able to pretty much load and unload all the vanity pieces uniquely,

804
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,253
because you're always in an in-game menu.

805
00:52:52,953 --> 00:52:58,357
So essentially, that's why we broke it out per material piece.

806
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:03,221
So like, I could load in a jacket just independently in the menu.

807
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:06,103
So we didn't have to carry all our vanity banks at the same time.

808
00:53:07,004 --> 00:53:07,184
Cool.

809
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:07,505
Thank you.

810
00:53:07,565 --> 00:53:07,645
Yeah.

811
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:10,447
You're welcome.

812
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:10,927
Hey guys.

813
00:53:10,947 --> 00:53:11,428
Hey Luca.

814
00:53:11,508 --> 00:53:11,868
Hey.

815
00:53:12,168 --> 00:53:12,388
Hi.

816
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:40,320
First, I just want to say as a guy who worked on a similar, like, infinite variation type game, I appreciate the scope and care of what you guys have done, and you made it look really easy to have all of these layers fitting together and switching and all making sense, but I know that that is an incredibly difficult job, and it's so cool that you guys made time to just push the envelope in that direction, because this is like the best movement system I've heard in a game in, like, basically forever.

817
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:47,478
So all that said, is there anything that you wanted to even do for the movement system that you didn't get to?

818
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:52,640
I mean, it seems like you basically, you know, ordered lunch and everything came.

819
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:58,383
So, any stuff you'd do for Sunset 2 that you just couldn't because you didn't have support, or...

820
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,164
Yeah.

821
00:54:01,374 --> 00:54:06,321
I think like Brian mentioned, being able to track the end of the grind runs.

822
00:54:07,602 --> 00:54:11,047
We really think it, you know, we wanted to help make that system feel really good.

823
00:54:12,008 --> 00:54:13,670
And maybe you can speak more to the lead-ins.

824
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,813
Yeah, so one of the things we wanted to do was...

825
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:21,397
You can hook onto the power lines from a set distance.

826
00:54:21,817 --> 00:54:23,198
And almost like if you press the button,

827
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,938
it kind of just leans in toward it.

828
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:28,100
So we wanted a sound almost like a magnetism type sound

829
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,901
to let the player know that they executed this

830
00:54:29,921 --> 00:54:31,922
and they're going to attach.

831
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:33,403
Just for more player feedback.

832
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:34,944
And that was one thing.

833
00:54:34,964 --> 00:54:35,764
That was along with that.

834
00:54:35,804 --> 00:54:37,806
It was just a lot of hard code tracking

835
00:54:37,866 --> 00:54:39,366
that we just didn't have the time to do.

836
00:54:40,325 --> 00:54:43,607
It's more like games are, it's really hard to be predictive, right?

837
00:54:43,687 --> 00:54:43,907
Yeah.

838
00:54:43,987 --> 00:54:47,549
That you're about to do something opposed to, hey, I'm doing this thing.

839
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:54,933
And a very, the majority of the voice for our base OD standing right here asking questions.

840
00:54:54,953 --> 00:54:55,773
So that's awesome.

841
00:54:56,394 --> 00:54:56,674
Thanks.

842
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:57,294
Yeah.

843
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:58,275
Thank you.

844
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,856
Props to talking rain seltzer for keeping me going.

845
00:55:01,377 --> 00:55:04,378
All right.

846
00:55:04,438 --> 00:55:04,959
Great talk.

847
00:55:04,979 --> 00:55:06,640
Thank you.

848
00:55:07,723 --> 00:55:12,105
I'm wondering if there were any unique challenges in terms of mixing and priority with the awesome

849
00:55:12,885 --> 00:55:15,766
and the vanity system.

850
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:19,307
How you dealt with that.

851
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:22,268
Well, yes is the answer.

852
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:29,210
HDR, like I said, we rebuilt it three times and I think HDR ended up driving the way we

853
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,411
were really mixing the game.

854
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:37,823
So, like, where and why you end up mixing really changes when you turn HDR on.

855
00:55:38,283 --> 00:55:42,565
So instead of being able to just grab your slider that's on your, you know, front page

856
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:47,547
when you click on an object, you're now going into a menu over and dealing with a lot of

857
00:55:47,587 --> 00:55:48,207
makeup gain.

858
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:53,169
And so we ended up, like, once our HDR rules were set...

859
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:55,571
You kind of don't want to mess with those.

860
00:55:56,091 --> 00:56:00,055
So we really ended up going into and driving the mix through makeup gain.

861
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:03,879
And we also learned there are multiple places that you can apply makeup gain.

862
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:06,321
So that was some, like, interesting gotchas,

863
00:56:06,341 --> 00:56:10,184
because there's makeup gain settings on the object level as well as the source level.

864
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:17,291
And so we were finding that people occasionally would edit the makeup gain in two places,

865
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:19,153
and we're like, why is this so loud?

866
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:19,553
Like...

867
00:56:19,994 --> 00:56:24,695
So it was really digging into a granular level about what was exactly going on.

868
00:56:24,775 --> 00:56:31,817
And there's just becoming a lot of gain stages, I think, in Wwise that are becoming awesome

869
00:56:31,837 --> 00:56:36,018
because it gives you a lot of freedom, but also you have to really come up with some strict rules

870
00:56:36,078 --> 00:56:41,740
about how you want to keep yourself organized and not kind of back yourself into a corner.

871
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:46,474
Do you start your buses at perhaps a lower level to give you more headroom?

872
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:47,235
Yeah, we did.

873
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:55,580
So, as you can see, we were obviously cranking up things above zero, but also with HDR, really

874
00:56:55,641 --> 00:56:58,863
that's a, depending on what your ratio settings are, that's a hard cap.

875
00:56:59,403 --> 00:57:04,567
And so anything that looks like it's going to be at plus 15 is not actually playing at

876
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:04,827
plus 15.

877
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:09,290
It's just saying, I'm the loudest thing that's supposed to be playing right now and stops

878
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:09,830
at zero.

879
00:57:12,082 --> 00:57:17,885
So yeah, we ended up turning down, I think, our HDR bus as well as our master bus above that.

880
00:57:18,065 --> 00:57:24,489
And we tried to meet our loudness all through and mix to a loudness standard of minus 23.

881
00:57:24,689 --> 00:57:28,271
So, hopefully, hopefully we achieved that.

882
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:29,412
Cool.

883
00:57:29,432 --> 00:57:30,973
Can I ask a quick follow-up?

884
00:57:31,153 --> 00:57:32,934
It's more for the awesome stuff.

885
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:40,123
Was that always action-based, or was there some sort of sequencing or event-based triggers

886
00:57:40,763 --> 00:57:45,266
so that they would be more random and so they're meant to be fun and sort of arbitrary, I guess?

887
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:50,049
Oh yeah, we just set these up in random containers and tagged to the animation.

888
00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:53,292
And sometimes if it was more complicated, we would have to hook it up through code.

889
00:57:54,192 --> 00:57:58,235
The only thing that worked really different was falling, and it was more of a layered-based

890
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:01,357
system opposed to a switching system.

891
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:06,564
And I love that it's becoming all the awesome stuff.

892
00:58:06,604 --> 00:58:08,145
Like, we can keep calling it that.

893
00:58:08,165 --> 00:58:11,268
Do we have time for one more question?

894
00:58:11,548 --> 00:58:13,430
Yeah, sure. Hey, thanks. Great talk.

895
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,432
I was really curious as to, like,

896
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,694
whenever you first started out,

897
00:58:18,214 --> 00:58:20,996
like, developing all, like, your ideas for the game,

898
00:58:21,637 --> 00:58:23,939
with such, like, a huge volume of sounds

899
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,440
that you're gonna have to, like,

900
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,522
come up with and, like, record,

901
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,726
Like, Brian, what were you thinking when you walked into the Foley Closet for the first

902
00:58:32,786 --> 00:58:39,534
time and you were like, well, I'm about to eat, sleep, live here for the next three months.

903
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:43,800
What's your mental process to kind of be okay?

904
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:44,785
I'm nervous.

905
00:58:44,805 --> 00:58:45,586
I don't know if I can.

906
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:45,766
I can't.

907
00:58:45,786 --> 00:58:46,026
I just can't.

908
00:58:46,046 --> 00:58:47,606
I don't even know if I'm gonna get it.

909
00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:48,386
I wrote the scripts.
