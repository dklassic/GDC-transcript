1
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:18,421
Fasten your seatbelts and prepare to come along with me on a journey into this scrappy,

2
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:25,968
unprofessional, chaotic and sometimes quite desperate adventure of solo indie game development.

3
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,205
Where there are no producers, no meetings, no one to delegate to, there is just you,

4
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:36,569
your computer, and your determination to see it through to the end.

5
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,815
So what is this talk going to be about?

6
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:47,301
So it's going to be a, it's not just a level design talk.

7
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:51,666
There's going to be a lot of explanation about how I built

8
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:53,148
my first game, Hangline.

9
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:57,232
So it's kind of like a post-mortem, but there is

10
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:58,894
going to be a lot of level design information.

11
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:13,963
So the reason I'm going to be talking about how I built my game and more about the game design and the creation and the structure of the game is because I think this is really fundamental into understanding the level design.

12
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:17,187
As a solo indie game developer,

13
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:21,352
You need to be able to not just be a level designer,

14
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:23,414
you obviously need to be a programmer,

15
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:24,736
you need to be a game designer,

16
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:27,419
you need to be a producer, you need to be an artist,

17
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,860
you basically need to be everything.

18
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:32,104
So I think it's really important in explaining

19
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:33,966
how I built the levels for the game

20
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,210
to also explain a lot about the game design itself

21
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,171
and the game creation.

22
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,463
I'm going to be talking a lot about how to build a process

23
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:46,344
for creating levels as quickly as possible,

24
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:48,464
because that's something that was really important

25
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,325
in making the game.

26
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:54,006
And I'm also going to be talking about how to feed your levels

27
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,087
to get them to stand out from each other

28
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:59,088
and to be memorable in the player's mind.

29
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:03,309
I'm going to be talking about how to teach game mechanics

30
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:06,730
in an organic way, not just through forced tutorials.

31
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:11,333
I'm also going to be talking about how to layer the systems of your game together

32
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:19,178
so that you can get maximum variety out of very few game mechanics.

33
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:22,941
Before I begin, I'm just going to show you a quick video of my game Hangline

34
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,202
so you can understand a little bit about what it's about.

35
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,372
All right, we're back.

36
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:55,953
Excellent.

37
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:58,115
Sorry about the technical difficulties there.

38
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,459
Rule number one of giving a talk at GDC

39
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,241
is don't use Google Slides.

40
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:06,165
So I'm going to talk a little bit about myself now.

41
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:10,328
So I spent a large amount of time in my career

42
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:14,891
as a designer or lead designer on various AAA games,

43
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:19,215
mostly games where you shoot people or blow things up.

44
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:22,417
But at some point after being through quite

45
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:24,379
a lot of different layoffs at different studios,

46
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,422
and also the only projects being available

47
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:29,363
were kind of, um...

48
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:35,423
like a lot of sort of sequels, prequels, continuation of franchises,

49
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:41,566
I started to think maybe I should try something different. And I started to think maybe I could

50
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:47,508
go indie and try and build something by myself. But this is quite a scary thing.

51
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:50,909
So the thing is making a game by yourself

52
00:03:52,430 --> 00:04:00,359
It's a very personal journey, and the way you navigate through that journey is very dependent on who you are as a person and your own shortcomings.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,283
So not just your actual skills, but your personality as well.

54
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:11,091
So I'm someone that worries a lot, and I'll think of like a thousand reasons why something isn't going to work.

55
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:16,573
So even the idea of me making a game by myself was a terrifying thought,

56
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:20,833
and obviously I thought of a lot of reasons why that is not going to work.

57
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:25,314
And I needed a lot of pushing to even decide to do that.

58
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:30,335
And for me, the push to do that, to become a solo indie developer,

59
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:37,097
actually came from reading an article written by a fake robot dinosaur.

60
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,842
So the article is called Win Like Stupid.

61
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:47,747
And it's all about basically being a bit more stupid and

62
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,689
being a bit more kind of not overthinking something and

63
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:54,171
kind of moving ahead even though something may not seem

64
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,052
like the greatest idea.

65
00:04:56,113 --> 00:05:00,616
So I can kind of show a little diagram from this article.

66
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:10,493
And the important thing about this diagram is that the kind of intersection there between geniuses,

67
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:16,758
so basically smart people, and like people that are winning in life and are successful,

68
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:21,262
it's extremely small. And the kind of point of the article is all about

69
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:25,385
being a little bit less judgmental of your own ideas.

70
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:29,807
So the whole article is actually written in capitals

71
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,667
because the sort of voice is meant to be

72
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:33,908
like Grimlock's voice.

73
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,008
So I'm gonna read you a few quotes from this article

74
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:38,729
and in order to do it justice,

75
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:41,009
I'm also gonna read them in the way

76
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,950
that I expect they should be read, so.

77
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,191
Smart people hate dumb ideas.

78
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:51,331
Only think of ways idea can't win.

79
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:55,487
Be too stupid for fear, too stupid to stop,

80
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:57,948
too stupid to fail.

81
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:01,009
And hopefully I haven't destroyed my voice

82
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,989
for the rest of this talk now.

83
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,369
So I think you get the point anyway.

84
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,810
So this article was super useful in helping me actually

85
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,850
start this journey.

86
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,651
But there were significant hurdles

87
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,132
to overcome upon doing this.

88
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:19,473
So basically, when I started this path of solo indie game

89
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,870
I had no team, and despite how much I kept going on

90
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,351
about wise robot dinosaurs,

91
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:27,851
no one really wanted to work with me.

92
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:32,092
I had no funding, no money for contractors,

93
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,653
no art skills, I'd not even built a 3D model in my life,

94
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:38,133
and I had limited programming ability.

95
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:40,514
The last time I programmed was at university.

96
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,955
So, yeah, it doesn't seem like a great start, right?

97
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:45,655
But...

98
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,290
Gotta remember the words of the article.

99
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,711
Be too stupid for fear, too stupid to stop,

100
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:53,431
too stupid to fail.

101
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,932
So, I went off and I started building this game.

102
00:06:57,572 --> 00:06:58,853
So that leads us to part one,

103
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:00,873
which is building the concept itself.

104
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:06,675
So, I left my job in San Francisco

105
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:10,316
and I moved to Spain because I was kind of scared

106
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:11,177
of the rent prices here

107
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,617
and thought this would be a lot safer.

108
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:14,678
And I constructed a plan.

109
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:20,037
And that plan was to make a game in about three to six months,

110
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:23,639
just do something super fast, super basic, get it done,

111
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,860
fail miserably, and then do another one

112
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,740
and make it much better.

113
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,242
So yeah, what could possibly go wrong?

114
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:34,763
The answer is many things.

115
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:40,284
So I started to figure out some or put some goals down

116
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,125
of what I wanted to try and achieve with this.

117
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,378
So I thought, let's keep things very small,

118
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,459
and I'll make a mobile game.

119
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,640
Didn't want to get anything that was too crazy with scope.

120
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,461
I thought, let's keep it really simple and small.

121
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,102
I also thought I'd make a free-to-play game,

122
00:07:58,162 --> 00:07:59,623
because I had a little bit of experience

123
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:03,144
at this, working at a small indie studio at one point.

124
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:07,090
I also wanted to do something that was very,

125
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,631
had a very relatable theme.

126
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:12,293
So I didn't want anything fantasy or sci-fi.

127
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:13,594
I wanted something very grounded,

128
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:16,155
just to appeal to a wide audience.

129
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:20,278
And I wanted very simple and easy to pick up controls.

130
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:23,039
This was something that was really important to me.

131
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,525
So I started writing ideas down,

132
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:28,745
and the one that I was most excited about

133
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:29,666
was a climbing game.

134
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:33,507
So I thought to myself that the mobile controls,

135
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,449
the touch screen, would be really effective

136
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:37,429
for making a climbing game,

137
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:38,590
because I thought you could kind of

138
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,331
move the character's fingers with your thumbs,

139
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:45,132
and sorry, move the character's arms with your thumbs,

140
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:46,493
and kind of move around, and I was like,

141
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,294
yeah, that'll work really well for a climbing game.

142
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:51,915
But I thought, okay, let's do a little bit of research

143
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:53,036
before I get going.

144
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:58,359
And as it turns out, there was a lot of climbing games.

145
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,162
Not only were there a lot of climbing games on mobile,

146
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:02,583
there was even climbing games

147
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:04,704
that used the exact same control system

148
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:05,865
that I was excited about.

149
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,468
So it was like, oh, okay, that's not a great start.

150
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:13,611
But then I thought, what if you could just kind of

151
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:15,732
give the guy a grappling hook?

152
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:17,507
a lot more interesting.

153
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:29,332
Most grappling hook games that were out at that time,

154
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:31,214
they worked in a similar way,

155
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:33,717
where you'd fire the grappling hook out,

156
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:38,041
it would hit a solid barrier, you would swing,

157
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,023
and then that barrier would also form

158
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:42,205
like the kind of the shape of the level, right?

159
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,907
So everything's kind of very,

160
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:46,830
kind of rigid 2D physics, let's say.

161
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,612
And the idea I had, or the twist on it, let's say,

162
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:52,733
is that I thought it would be really cool

163
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:56,876
is if you could just literally click anywhere on the screen

164
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,997
and send the grappling hook out to that point.

165
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,398
So you don't have to connect it

166
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:02,879
to a specific bit of collision.

167
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,401
And that way, you know, you would swing out

168
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,583
and it would give a lot more sort of finesse

169
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:10,563
to the controls.

170
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,125
And this seems like a simple idea,

171
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:15,566
but basically the entire game is built around this.

172
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:22,209
So I set off and I thought, okay, first thing we need to do is prototype it.

173
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:27,234
Obviously, you know, the first time you do everything, it's probably going to be a failure,

174
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:31,538
so you may as well test it out first. This is me testing out this exact GDC talk.

175
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,722
So I'm a pretty lazy programmer, basically.

176
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:39,963
I don't really want to program anything unless I absolutely have to.

177
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:44,866
So the very first thing I did was I looked on the Unity Asset Store,

178
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:49,389
just in case there was something which I could use for swinging you up a mountain.

179
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,892
Lo and behold, I found Easy 2D Grappling Hook for a mere $10.

180
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:59,335
And it turned out this was the best $10 I've ever spent.

181
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:07,016
So I got this going and before only a few days,

182
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:10,339
I managed to get a kind of Unity cube swinging about.

183
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,721
And this was already starting to look like,

184
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:14,802
you know, this could work.

185
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:15,883
So.

186
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:20,405
I started to think, okay, what is the actual point of the levels?

187
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:22,185
Like, how are things gonna work here?

188
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:23,046
What's the structure?

189
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,026
So I just kept with something very simple.

190
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,887
You start at the bottom of the mountain.

191
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:30,348
You have to navigate your way through,

192
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:33,809
and there'll be some pickups on the way, stars,

193
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:37,770
and then you have to get to the top and hit the flag,

194
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:38,951
and that's the end of the level.

195
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:40,769
So this was my plan.

196
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,414
Now, there were some first steps I needed to take here.

197
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:50,016
So obviously, I needed some barriers in the environment

198
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,199
to slow you down and to form the shape of the level.

199
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,522
And I need some hazards to avoid to make

200
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:57,883
it a bit more of a challenge.

201
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:01,225
But the other thing was I needed to make the grapple

202
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:04,628
a little bit more elastic and springy to fit the kind of feel

203
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:05,429
that I was looking for.

204
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,932
So next prototype.

205
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:13,377
So here you can see these Unity cubes scaled up and down.

206
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,058
That's the gray boxes there.

207
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,581
The grapple is a little bit more elastic.

208
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,543
And then as you're swinging around,

209
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,365
you've got some of these red blocks

210
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:23,726
that basically kill you instantly.

211
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:28,639
So this provided a few initial discoveries.

212
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,520
Swinging around was really good fun.

213
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:35,483
But it was very hard to be precise with the physics.

214
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:39,946
So the thing about physics is that it gives a lot of free

215
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:43,729
gameplay, like it has this unpredictability, which

216
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:45,690
creates a lot of emerging gameplay.

217
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,332
But the problem is that unpredictability can also lead

218
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:52,314
to frustration if you punish the player really severely.

219
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:56,375
So basically anything that instantly killed you was not such a good idea.

220
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:03,472
The other thing that this prototype taught me was that level design is basically everything in this game.

221
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:10,956
It's super duper important and the game is basically going to live or die based on the level design.

222
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:16,078
So the next thing I did was whack in a character into the game.

223
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:19,140
This was just some guy I'd made in a Blender tutorial.

224
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,942
He wasn't massively happy about being in the game, but he didn't really have a choice.

225
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:26,645
And so I thought, let's make some hazards

226
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:28,747
that don't insta-kill the player.

227
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:33,071
So the first of those was this kind of a falling snow panel.

228
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,294
Obviously here, it's just, again, a Unity cube.

229
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,537
But this kind of pulled you out your way,

230
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:41,819
and then it didn't kill you instantly,

231
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,020
but it put you into danger,

232
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:44,862
and you had to quickly react to get out of there.

233
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:51,630
So another sort of non-instakill hazard was this falling block.

234
00:13:52,211 --> 00:14:03,785
Similar kind of idea except this was a solid block that could actually crush you if it landed on top of you either too fast or if it crushed you against a sort of solid ground piece.

235
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:09,644
I also whacked in an avalanche because obviously this is a game about climbing mountains and

236
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:11,186
that seemed pretty appropriate.

237
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:15,693
So there's a bunch of things that I put in there that sort of knock you off the line,

238
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:16,854
but they didn't kill you.

239
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:20,500
So you still had some moments to react and continue playing.

240
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:27,323
Now, around this point, I started to think about marketing and sort of getting the word of the game out there.

241
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:35,051
And I met a chap who worked for a Spanish magazine at a game conference,

242
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:37,734
and then I was talking about my game, and then he was like,

243
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,736
oh yeah, let me know when it's something to look at.

244
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:42,278
And then at one point I sent him an email.

245
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,540
And I've got the email right here.

246
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:48,384
So this was the first point where I was trying to describe,

247
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:51,406
like, what is the game in one sentence, you know?

248
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,569
So I came up with this super quick tagline of,

249
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,110
you're a dude with a grappling hook,

250
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,692
and you have to swing your way up to the top of the mountain,

251
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:02,095
dodging falling rocks, avalanches, and angry mountain goats.

252
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:04,457
Thought, yeah, that sounds pretty cool.

253
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:07,572
Then he emails me back saying,

254
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:10,137
that line, angry mountain goats, really got me.

255
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:11,399
Smiley face.

256
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:15,166
I was like, oh, yeah, I don't actually have goats

257
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,713
in the game and I have no idea how they're gonna work.

258
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,268
But I guess I've got to put them in now.

259
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:25,851
So I built a goat using Unity cubes, obviously.

260
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,032
You know, as you can see,

261
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:30,073
artistic skills at this point were not great.

262
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:32,595
And I was like, well, what's a goat going to do?

263
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:35,037
I mean, probably he's going to kick you, right?

264
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:37,178
So, okay, let's put a trigger on it,

265
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,060
and we'll get him to fire an impulse as soon as you go near.

266
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:43,723
So I slapped it in there,

267
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:47,605
and once he actually gets to the mountain...

268
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,401
Boom, get smacked by the goat.

269
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:56,426
And miraculously, everyone that played the game

270
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:58,449
absolutely loved the goats.

271
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,532
And even all the way to the end of the game,

272
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:03,294
this was the thing that everyone seemed to comment on.

273
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:06,438
So if you don't take away anything else from this talk,

274
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:08,240
just basically put goats in your game.

275
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,993
So next thing I decided to do was test on the target platform.

276
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,715
So I built a mobile build as quickly as possible.

277
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:20,899
This came with a few discoveries.

278
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,781
It's very hard to see what's ahead

279
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:26,984
because you've got this kind of narrow field of view.

280
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:32,408
So basically, it was very easy to kind of smash into stuff

281
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,829
if you were moving left to right,

282
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,051
because you couldn't see too far ahead.

283
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:40,914
So basically, yeah, moving very fast, left or right directly,

284
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,196
was not good in the levels.

285
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:47,219
So basically, the levels needed more diagonal motion.

286
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,741
So to kind of explain this a little bit better,

287
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,708
I've got this crude diagram here.

288
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:57,251
So imagine you're sending out your grappling hook

289
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,053
to the red dot there.

290
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:03,917
What this is gonna do is kind of swing you in an arc, right?

291
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:06,920
So then we fire out our next grappling hook.

292
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:10,442
And then we're going to kind of swing back around.

293
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:13,182
So imagine we're kind of trying to move up the screen here.

294
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:15,563
And we fire another one out.

295
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:17,683
And then we're swinging in the other direction.

296
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:21,344
So essentially, you're kind of making curves as you move.

297
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:26,566
And basically, I realized this is kind of like a driving game.

298
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,206
So in a driving game, the cars are

299
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,379
are physics-based, right?

300
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,601
And you're controlling them, but they're also moving a lot

301
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,121
by the physics of the world.

302
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:41,143
And your racetracks are very smooth and curvy

303
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:42,103
because of that, right?

304
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,024
They're not just flat, straight lines.

305
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:47,245
So basically, this made me realize

306
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:50,747
that for an ideal-shaped level, I'm

307
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:53,107
going to need some sweeping curves.

308
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:56,909
I'm going to need more organic shapes, right?

309
00:17:58,562 --> 00:17:59,883
How the heck am I going to do this

310
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:02,044
if everything is made from Unity cubes?

311
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:05,046
So, like, this was what the levels were at that point.

312
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:07,507
It's all, you know, really straight lines, right?

313
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:12,070
So, this moves us neatly on to part two,

314
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,270
which is pre-production,

315
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,492
basically how to actually build these levels.

316
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:18,573
So, at this point, I was thinking,

317
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,234
I need to get into Blender

318
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,136
and start, you know, actually building a level properly.

319
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:33,215
But what I decided to do is find a way to take my crappy Unity cube levels and put them into Blender.

320
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:39,821
So I looked on the internet and I found this tool that was an OBJ exporter for Unity.

321
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:47,408
So this allowed me to take my basic, basic cube levels, take them out of Unity, put them into Blender.

322
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:50,350
play around with them, make them look a bit better,

323
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,411
and then pull them back into Unity

324
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:53,852
and they'd have all the same collision.

325
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:55,693
So that's what I did.

326
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:58,254
And this was kind of what I ended up with there,

327
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,555
which was, it was okay.

328
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:02,056
Starting to look a little bit better.

329
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,857
It looks a little bit more like a mountain now.

330
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,439
But I discovered...

331
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:09,905
The building level art is really slow.

332
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:14,429
So just to kind of get an idea of what I mean by slow,

333
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:18,412
so my goal for playing a level was that it should take

334
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:19,473
about three minutes.

335
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:21,355
This was like a rough approximation

336
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,356
when you're actually playing it.

337
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:27,880
So I was trying to make about like five hours of gameplay

338
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,481
for the first release of this game,

339
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,004
just so people would have enough to play

340
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:33,885
and they'd watch some ads and I would hopefully

341
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:34,406
make some money.

342
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,543
So if we times five hours by 60 minutes per hour,

343
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,425
we get some other number,

344
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,006
and then we divide that by three minutes,

345
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:44,787
and we get 100 levels.

346
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:48,330
That is what I would need for five hours of gameplay.

347
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:52,754
But really, probably more like 50 levels, right?

348
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,615
Because the player is going to die occasionally,

349
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:56,937
and we don't need them to, you know,

350
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:59,279
well, they're not going to just play through every level

351
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,120
one after the other.

352
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:04,037
But this was like, literally it was taking me five days

353
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:06,879
to build a level because of my crappy 3D art skills

354
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,281
and because this was just a really slow process.

355
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:12,583
So obviously five days to build a level,

356
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:17,006
you've got like 250 working days to finish this game,

357
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,807
like just the levels.

358
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:21,069
So this was not feasible.

359
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:23,330
And I started to think like,

360
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,592
what other solutions are there for solving this?

361
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:27,593
And then I thought.

362
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,232
Maybe I could generate the art automatically.

363
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:38,074
Automatic mesh generation.

364
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:40,736
So I started mentioning this to friends

365
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,016
and they were like, are you mad?

366
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:43,497
What the hell?

367
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:45,738
That's for serious programmers, not noobs.

368
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:49,020
This idea is dumb.

369
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,421
And I was thinking, yeah, this idea is really dumb.

370
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:55,076
But then I remembered the words of that wise robot dinosaur,

371
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,577
smart people hate dumb ideas.

372
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,559
Only think of ways idea can't win.

373
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:02,860
And I thought, okay, let's try this.

374
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,002
So again, I went on the internet

375
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:07,482
and searched for something that might help.

376
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,144
And I found this tool called PolyMesh.

377
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:14,046
So this is a tool that allows you to basically,

378
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:17,327
in the Unity editor, set up points

379
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,348
for creating simple 2D collision.

380
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:23,583
So I thought the plan was I could use this to kind of build

381
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:26,004
the shape of the level directly in the editor

382
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,365
and get a more organic shape.

383
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:30,407
So it also allowed you to kind of like,

384
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:32,648
as you plotted the points out, it would make the collision

385
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:36,530
and it would also kind of bevel or sort of extrude

386
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,871
the edges to make a shape.

387
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,572
So I started working on this, got it integrated,

388
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:45,132
got it together, and this was a massive step forwards.

389
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,493
I could then build levels that were a lot more

390
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:49,533
interestingly shaped.

391
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:53,194
So here you can see I've also got kind of a separation

392
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:56,935
between the back wall, which is like this snowy area,

393
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:59,155
which you can grapple and connect to.

394
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:02,376
And then there's also the solid gray rocks,

395
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:06,517
and sort of like a solid kind of front wall of rock

396
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:07,477
that you couldn't get past.

397
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:14,943
So this was a huge help, but it's still not looking that amazing yet, right?

398
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:16,125
It's quite basic.

399
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:23,531
So the next part of this step was figuring out, like, can I actually deform those meshes

400
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:25,173
to make them look a bit more interesting?

401
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:31,538
And again, I went on the Internet and started looking to see if there was some code I could use.

402
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:36,584
And I found this package called Coherent Noise Generation.

403
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:38,985
And this had lots of different noise curves

404
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,546
that you could apply to meshes.

405
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:42,507
So I started fiddling around with it,

406
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:47,690
and I managed to start manipulating some meshes

407
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,731
to make some interesting shapes.

408
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:54,354
And to cut a long story short, I came up with a process

409
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:58,977
to build more interesting looking rocks and level shapes.

410
00:22:59,057 --> 00:23:02,139
So this is kind of a top level summary of it.

411
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,761
Basically, I used the PolyMesh tool to shape the rocks.

412
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:11,184
Then I used another tool to triangulate them.

413
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:13,726
So this is about basically making

414
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:17,348
the mesh into lots of reasonably evenly shaped triangles,

415
00:23:17,368 --> 00:23:18,629
because that's really important when you

416
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:19,709
want to try and deform them.

417
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,951
Then I would add depth to that shape and pull it out.

418
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:30,973
Then I would apply the coherent noise algorithm

419
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:33,634
to deform it with a Voronoi curve.

420
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:35,834
So this kind of makes cells, and that's

421
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,795
why you get these sort of little rock shapes.

422
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:42,376
Then I would make the vertices all the same for each triangle

423
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:45,637
to make flat shading, because I wanted the low poly look.

424
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:50,808
Then I would simplify that using a decimator tool.

425
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,729
Again, some code that I found on the internet.

426
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,850
It was all free and all legitimate, I promise.

427
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,412
And then for the last part,

428
00:23:59,224 --> 00:24:03,667
I would basically check if the triangle is facing upwards,

429
00:24:04,148 --> 00:24:06,129
or roughly upwards, and then color it white.

430
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,471
I don't know why I've written snow shader there.

431
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:10,052
That was probably to sound more intelligent,

432
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:11,873
because at this point I had no idea what a shader was.

433
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:16,136
Okay, so this is basically what this looks like.

434
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:20,580
We've got our 2D simple shape for the collision of the level,

435
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,423
and it would deform it into this more interesting-looking rock.

436
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:30,451
And there is a GIF right here which shows it working.

437
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:34,074
So that's me kind of sculpting, pulling out the points

438
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:38,258
to make this more organically shaped rock collision.

439
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,483
And then after a few seconds of my computer wearing its fans

440
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,104
and doing all these calculations,

441
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:49,948
it would eventually create a more interesting looking rock.

442
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:52,870
Yeah.

443
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,270
So.

444
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,783
This was a massive improvement, and with a bit of lighting and some post-processing,

445
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:04,185
the levels now, to me, looked good enough for production.

446
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:07,527
So this changed everything, basically.

447
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:11,970
It allowed me to rapidly experiment and try lots of ideas out.

448
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:17,273
It created much more organic-feeling levels, or it allowed me to create more organic-feeling

449
00:25:17,293 --> 00:25:17,553
levels.

450
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:21,425
And it also allowed me to create more variety

451
00:25:21,465 --> 00:25:24,267
in the obstacles, because I had a lot of falling rocks

452
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:26,989
and things like that, which I could now custom

453
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:29,851
build the shapes for, which was a huge, huge improvement.

454
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:34,434
And basically, with this tool, I could build a level from,

455
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:36,516
whoa, this is scary, what the heck?

456
00:25:38,477 --> 00:25:40,359
Okay, I guess we'll just keep going.

457
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,261
I could build a level from zero to done in four hours,

458
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:46,043
which was a massive improvement from what we had before.

459
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:52,813
So yeah, basically, if we recalculate how long it would take to build 50 levels, it's more like about 25 days.

460
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,574
So this was massive.

461
00:25:56,735 --> 00:26:03,418
So the next thing I want to talk about, because it really relates to the level design, is the layering of game mechanics.

462
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:10,720
So at this point, I had kind of like made the mechanics

463
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,061
sort of in isolation, right?

464
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:14,604
So yeah, if you can kind of, you know,

465
00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:16,786
playing the game and you encounter one mechanic on its own,

466
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:17,626
that's cool.

467
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:20,949
But if we have several mechanics that interplay together

468
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,050
and connect together,

469
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:24,713
that's gonna be a lot more interesting.

470
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:29,470
So we're going to get slightly programmer-y for a second here,

471
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,110
but I assure you it's quite basic.

472
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:35,052
So this is the object hierarchy diagram for the game.

473
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:38,594
And I really feel like the whole electricity

474
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:39,334
is going to go off soon.

475
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:41,935
I need to finish this talk before disaster happens.

476
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:48,781
So here, as an example, I wanted the goats to do more than just kick the player.

477
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:50,823
I wanted them to kick other things too.

478
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:58,270
So I made this behavior of kicking happen on a destructible object,

479
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,051
which is at the top of the hierarchy there.

480
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,992
And so everything under destructible objects

481
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:05,673
also can do whatever a destructible object does.

482
00:27:06,153 --> 00:27:09,354
So because the goat could then kick a destructible object,

483
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:11,794
it meant that it could also kick dynamite,

484
00:27:12,274 --> 00:27:14,735
it could kick mountain cats, it could kick the player,

485
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:17,376
and a goat could even kick other goats.

486
00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:21,357
And this created a lot more interesting possibilities

487
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:22,757
with combining the mechanics.

488
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,739
So as you can see here, the cat jumps on the player,

489
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,561
the cat gets kicked by the goat, the goat falls on...

490
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:32,082
Yeah, okay, anyway, you can see basically

491
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:34,283
lots of cool stuff happens that's quite interesting

492
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:34,964
and unpredictable.

493
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:38,125
So that was a massive help in allowing me

494
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:40,887
to layer the mechanics together in the levels.

495
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:45,749
All right, so I knew how to make the levels

496
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,130
and what the process was gonna be.

497
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,632
So the next thing I needed to do was figure out

498
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:51,352
how to make them actually play well.

499
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:57,257
So I was, yeah, the next part was, yeah, basically what makes a good level?

500
00:27:58,537 --> 00:28:02,058
So there's kind of three basic things I'm going to talk about here.

501
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:04,399
So the one is, first one is tutorials.

502
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:07,260
So that's explaining these game mechanics to the player.

503
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,801
And I didn't want to do a scripted kind of stop the player and make them

504
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:15,022
read a tutorial message at all.

505
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:19,003
I wanted to make it much more organic and in the level.

506
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:20,903
And I'm going to talk about that in a sec.

507
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:27,427
Also, I found that variety was a really important thing in making the levels interesting.

508
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:32,670
And there's a lot of different aspects to that, which I'll talk about in a moment.

509
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,747
And also theming was really important.

510
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,227
So that's making the levels stand out from each other

511
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:40,268
and being each one of them being memorable

512
00:28:40,548 --> 00:28:41,368
in the player's mind.

513
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:44,049
So let's get into detail on these.

514
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:47,370
So the tutorials, as I said,

515
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,331
I wanted to not do guided tutorials.

516
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:52,392
I wanted the player to learn organically

517
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:56,993
by doing the thing that kind of shows the mechanic,

518
00:28:57,273 --> 00:28:59,974
kind of a bit more Nintendo design philosophy, I guess.

519
00:29:01,515 --> 00:29:06,540
So I had a dedicated level that would show you how to,

520
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,903
or kind of force you to experience the mechanic.

521
00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:12,785
And then what I would do is reinforce that mechanic

522
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:13,826
in the next few levels.

523
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,581
And then I will show the breadth of that mechanic afterwards.

524
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,304
So that means layering it with other mechanics

525
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,966
to show how it also fits into everything else.

526
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:26,809
So let's dive into a simple example.

527
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,312
So here we've got the goats.

528
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:31,494
This is the first level where you encounter a goat.

529
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:34,256
And the player starts at the bottom left of the level.

530
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:37,459
And they have really no choice but to go

531
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,321
through this quite tight gap here.

532
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:43,565
And on going through that tight gap, they see this cute little goat.

533
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:45,066
They don't really think much of it.

534
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:48,190
They will naturally accidentally swing into the goat,

535
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,591
and the goat will kick them in the face.

536
00:29:50,312 --> 00:29:51,413
And they will be quite angry,

537
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:54,596
but they will also understand exactly what a goat does.

538
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:59,632
Then, if we look at the rest of the level, zoomed out,

539
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:03,916
just in case the player misses that first goat somehow,

540
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:08,500
there is basically a goat on every single tight gap

541
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,341
in the entire level.

542
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,623
So by the end of it, they're basically swearing

543
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,325
because they got kicked by a goat so many times,

544
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:14,666
but they understand how they work.

545
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:22,236
Then, a few levels later, we start to add other mechanics in with the goats that we've

546
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:24,117
already kind of introduced before.

547
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:29,402
So here we've got those falling panels, which I've highlighted in orange, and we've also

548
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:30,963
got some falling rocks above.

549
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:33,984
So the falling panels, if the player connects to those,

550
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:35,405
then they might fall into the goat.

551
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,846
And also if they pull down one of those gray rocks

552
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:40,946
at the top, that might actually crush the goat.

553
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:43,527
So we start to teach the player that these

554
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:48,089
are these other mechanics that layer onto the goats.

555
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:50,910
Super quick example here.

556
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,910
Player pulls down the rock.

557
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,411
The rock shakes the dynamite.

558
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:56,491
The dynamite explodes and sends the goat flying.

559
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:57,311
So.

560
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:03,596
The next thing that I did relating to mechanics

561
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:07,618
was I made this diagram, which is basically

562
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:08,818
every level of the game.

563
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:13,460
And then it shows what mechanic features in that level.

564
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,562
So that's the colors you can see to the right-hand side.

565
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:21,844
So the point of this really is to just kind of sanity check,

566
00:31:21,884 --> 00:31:24,945
like, am I using those mechanics to their fullest?

567
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,626
You know, if there's huge gaps.

568
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:32,073
in this sheet, that means I'm kind of forgetting about a mechanic for a while, right?

569
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:38,803
So it's about, it's kind of like a reminder just to make sure that you've got an even dispersal of

570
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:43,289
these mechanics, so you're keeping things fresh and you're not kind of relying on one for too long.

571
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:49,932
Also, you'll notice this is kind of a curve that is coming in from the top there,

572
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:53,193
and that's basically the curve of kind of mechanic introduction.

573
00:31:54,113 --> 00:32:01,915
So the reason that is a curve and not a line is because you want to introduce mechanics much faster at the start of the game,

574
00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:06,476
because that is going to provide maximum interest to the player,

575
00:32:06,876 --> 00:32:11,878
so that they're more likely to keep playing because they're basically seeing a lot of new stuff at the beginning of the game.

576
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:16,253
This is super important for mobile games where people have really short attention spans,

577
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:17,915
especially if the game is free.

578
00:32:19,276 --> 00:32:21,639
So if it's a free game, they've had no commitment, right?

579
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:27,337
So next thing to talk about is variety and pacing.

580
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:30,099
So this was another really important aspect

581
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:32,741
that I found when making the levels.

582
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:36,203
So my kind of aim with the levels

583
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:39,245
was to make sure that there's no single part of the level that

584
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:42,828
would repeat in the same way later in the level.

585
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,950
So whenever I had some section of gameplay,

586
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,111
I'd make sure that if it was repeated,

587
00:32:49,212 --> 00:32:50,853
it would repeat in a different way.

588
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:57,357
So also I was trying to vary the spaces of the level.

589
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:01,820
So we'd have larger spaces where you could fully swing and move quite fast,

590
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,763
and then also have tighter spaces where it was harder to get through and you had to slow down.

591
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:12,026
And the idea I had was to try and vary between these two styles all the time.

592
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:19,889
Another thing that I was trying to vary was the difficulty of each level,

593
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:25,190
so that this would bounce up and down as you played through, i.e. some bits were easier and

594
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:31,592
some bits were harder, and this would constantly change as you go through. I'll just show a quick

595
00:33:31,652 --> 00:33:37,653
example of that. This is another level of the game quite early on. So this blue line here,

596
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:39,794
this is kind of the main route through the level.

597
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,301
So yeah, player starts at the bottom,

598
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:43,722
has to climb all the way to the top.

599
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:46,423
This is one of the more linear levels, I'd say.

600
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,885
And I've kind of labeled here the areas

601
00:33:49,985 --> 00:33:51,546
which are slow to navigate through,

602
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:54,308
where there is, say, like an obstacle,

603
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:55,669
or there's just a narrow gap.

604
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:57,590
And then there's also some areas

605
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,010
that are faster to navigate through,

606
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,331
where there's more clear space

607
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:01,772
and more things to grab onto.

608
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,674
And as you can see, this is varying

609
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,154
all the way to the top of the level.

610
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,212
Then I've also labeled up kind of the areas that are harder and easier in the level.

611
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:16,995
So, you know, the harder bits are the ones where there's maybe a dangerous obstacle.

612
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,097
The easy ones are where there's more things to grapple on to.

613
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:25,960
And as you can see, again, I'm trying to vary this throughout the level. So you're constantly

614
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,802
kind of getting an easy bit and then a harder bit and then an easier bit.

615
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:37,935
Another thing I was doing with variety was trying to make sure there was a variety of routes.

616
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:43,401
So I wanted to make sure there was more than one way for each obstacle.

617
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:51,029
So this basically meant having a main path through the level, but then lots of optional side paths.

618
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,393
So this is basically, again, thinking about like mobile,

619
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:58,215
where you've got a very wide audience

620
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:00,356
and you don't really want someone to get stuck on the game.

621
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:05,000
So my idea was to kind of make the main map relatively easy,

622
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,983
but then have optional challenge by the pickups,

623
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:11,264
like the pickups being in harder to reach places.

624
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:14,006
So yeah, as we were saying,

625
00:35:14,066 --> 00:35:15,427
mobile is a very wide audience,

626
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:16,708
so you don't want someone to get stuck.

627
00:35:19,128 --> 00:35:20,829
So, quick example of that.

628
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:23,690
This is the first level where you encounter falling rocks.

629
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:26,891
So, it's quite a simple level.

630
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:29,372
You kind of go straight all the way up, really.

631
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:31,893
The main path I've labeled in blue.

632
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:36,155
And you can see there's these side paths

633
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,656
in green to the edge there.

634
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,437
So, the player has optional routes they can go.

635
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:43,878
And those optional routes contain those pickups.

636
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:45,679
So, they're a little harder to get to.

637
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:49,497
You'll also notice that there's a few points here,

638
00:35:50,178 --> 00:35:51,399
especially right at the bottom,

639
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:54,021
where there's almost no way through

640
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:56,143
without encountering a falling rock, right?

641
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:58,665
So again, because this was a tutorial level

642
00:35:58,725 --> 00:35:59,586
for the falling rocks,

643
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:02,988
I was basically forcing the player to experience them.

644
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,010
And if they didn't experience the first one,

645
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,292
they sure as hell would experience one

646
00:36:07,452 --> 00:36:08,493
somewhere else in this level

647
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:10,194
because it's loaded with falling rocks.

648
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:14,788
So next thing to talk about is theming.

649
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:20,855
So one thing that I realized was really important in making the levels was

650
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:26,503
to try and find at least one unique and memorable element in every level.

651
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:33,810
So this could be something where there's a very unique use of a mechanic,

652
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:39,636
or it could even be something that the shape of the level is very different.

653
00:36:40,517 --> 00:36:46,163
So the point is, you're basically trying to make something where you're answering the question,

654
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:48,846
why does this level exist in the game, right?

655
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:51,689
Is there another level that's almost the same?

656
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,092
Then it probably shouldn't exist, right?

657
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:57,516
Does it add anything new to the current set of levels that I have?

658
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,071
So another way to think about it is imagine two people

659
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:05,511
that have played the game talking to each other.

660
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:09,472
Like, can they describe the level to their friend

661
00:37:10,132 --> 00:37:12,053
without telling them the name of the level

662
00:37:12,073 --> 00:37:13,193
or the number of it, you know?

663
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:14,854
They'd be like, this is the level

664
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:17,194
with the giant octopus or whatever.

665
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:20,735
So this was kind of what I was trying to go for

666
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:22,516
and something that I found really important.

667
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:25,796
So let's show a few examples of that.

668
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:30,516
So this level is actually called Leap of Faith,

669
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:33,198
and you'll notice there's this bit in the middle there

670
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,780
where the only way to get from this lower part

671
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,941
of the mountain where you start

672
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:40,463
onto that larger upper part

673
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:45,566
is by grappling a stalactite that can fall.

674
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:47,828
And it's literally the only thing you can grapple.

675
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:49,189
And then after you grapple that,

676
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:51,210
you really need to quickly grapple the other ones.

677
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,732
So it's kind of like, yeah, it's basically a leap of faith,

678
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,173
and it's quite a memorable moment in this level.

679
00:37:57,957 --> 00:38:03,849
So another thing that makes this level quite memorable is that it also kind of looks like Dr. Zoidberg.

680
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:12,717
So I'm just going to show you quickly now that level that you saw earlier in the game.

681
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:18,098
So this was another level where I wanted to make this feel very unique.

682
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:22,039
So I kind of, yeah, basically stole this idea from Indiana Jones, right?

683
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,999
Where you've got this giant falling boulder.

684
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:27,900
And this is like the kind of the largest rock the player has seen at that point.

685
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,600
And there's like no way to avoid it.

686
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:32,701
So this made this made the level very memorable.

687
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:33,861
So...

688
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:40,083
Just to kind of explain how I managed

689
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:42,526
to kind of keep this idea of theming in my mind

690
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:45,909
when I'm designing levels is what you see here

691
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:49,673
are two diagrams that I've drawn on paper.

692
00:38:49,753 --> 00:38:51,715
And they're just A4 sheets, right?

693
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:53,276
So this is quite a, each one of those

694
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,258
is a relatively small piece of paper.

695
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:58,802
And you can see I've crammed in like about, you know,

696
00:38:59,562 --> 00:39:04,284
six diagrams of an entire level into each kind of corner.

697
00:39:04,444 --> 00:39:07,045
And the reason for that was to force myself

698
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,866
to not get too detailed with each level

699
00:39:09,986 --> 00:39:11,607
and instead draw out like,

700
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:13,708
what is the unique thing about this level?

701
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:15,828
Like, how is it different to the other levels?

702
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:18,489
And by drawing super small,

703
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,510
I couldn't get focused on any details.

704
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,831
I had to literally think, okay,

705
00:39:21,951 --> 00:39:23,631
how to set this level apart,

706
00:39:23,691 --> 00:39:26,853
both in terms of its shape or through creating,

707
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:28,713
you know, a unique element in there.

708
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:37,351
Um, so another super important thing, um, that I'm going to mention just briefly is playtesting.

709
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:46,755
Um, so I literally gave this game to everyone to play, like my nephews, my friends, my mom, my dad.

710
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:49,877
You can see my mom there actually in the bottom left corner.

711
00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:52,299
She was a particularly useful play tester

712
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:55,101
because you can see the kind of claw grip she had on the mouse

713
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:59,944
was quite unique and meant that she had almost no control over the player characters.

714
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:05,507
So if my mom could beat a level, then that proved that it was safe for human consumption.

715
00:40:06,768 --> 00:40:10,050
So, yeah, getting your game in front of people is mega important,

716
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:13,733
not just because it's going to help you see a load of bugs that you wouldn't notice,

717
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:14,934
but it's also...

718
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:18,656
It's going to help you just feel better about the game

719
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:20,497
and realize there's people enjoying it.

720
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:23,658
So super-duper important.

721
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,221
And also, if you've got your game on mobile,

722
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:30,942
this is a mega big advantage because you can just literally

723
00:40:30,982 --> 00:40:31,803
whip it out your pocket.

724
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:34,004
You've got it on you all the time.

725
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:36,825
So anyone you meet, you can just say, hey, I'm making a game.

726
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:38,826
Want to play it?

727
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:39,907
So that's really useful.

728
00:40:41,408 --> 00:40:41,748
All right.

729
00:40:41,848 --> 00:40:43,669
So at this point, I was six months in.

730
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,891
I had all the game mechanics.

731
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:48,451
I'd figured out how to make good levels.

732
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:51,712
I'd close to final the environment art.

733
00:40:53,352 --> 00:40:54,293
I was almost done, right?

734
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:59,814
So I want to ask you guys if anyone can guess how long it

735
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:03,175
took me at this point to launch the game.

736
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:05,735
Just shout out anything you can think of.

737
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:11,583
Most of you are actually right.

738
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:12,703
I thought you were going to guess less,

739
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,984
but yes, it was one whole year.

740
00:41:15,064 --> 00:41:18,125
So original idea of three to six months,

741
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:20,985
yeah, that was completely not happening at this point.

742
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:24,486
So yeah, like the reason it took so long

743
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:26,727
was I still had UI to build,

744
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,928
a whole progression system and economy.

745
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:38,304
All this ads and monetization stuff, marketing, like, yeah, this was a huge challenge.

746
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:41,891
And also because these tests are like super boring.

747
00:41:44,244 --> 00:41:46,205
Seriously, if you ever have to deal with, like,

748
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:50,448
ad mediation networks and monetization stuff,

749
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:51,429
it is, yeah.

750
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,991
This is not the indie dream, let's say.

751
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,893
So anyway, at this point in the project,

752
00:41:56,953 --> 00:41:58,194
I was getting really anxious.

753
00:41:58,794 --> 00:42:01,376
I had a lot of friends asking me throughout the project,

754
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:02,777
like, oh, you're working on that game, yeah.

755
00:42:03,498 --> 00:42:05,619
How long is it gonna take you to finish that?

756
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:07,841
And I was always like, yeah, about three months maybe.

757
00:42:08,702 --> 00:42:10,542
And then it asked me three months later, like,

758
00:42:10,882 --> 00:42:12,503
yes, so have you finished yet?

759
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,263
Oh, no, it took about like maybe three more months.

760
00:42:14,303 --> 00:42:17,464
And this would happen every time and became like this running joke.

761
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,925
And I was getting really worried, to be honest.

762
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:22,706
Like I was thinking, am I actually going to be able to balance

763
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:23,786
the progression of this game?

764
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:26,167
All this economy stuff, it was super difficult.

765
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:29,848
Am I going to finish before I like I run out of money?

766
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:32,348
And is this even going to be successful?

767
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,221
Am I wasting my time?

768
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:38,183
These are the kind of thoughts that you have

769
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:41,045
when you are literally the only team member

770
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,808
and you're building this thing by yourself.

771
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:47,830
I asked a lot of people for advice,

772
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:50,432
like kind of professionals in the industry,

773
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:52,814
and to be honest, most people said,

774
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:54,875
just get the game out as soon as you can.

775
00:42:55,396 --> 00:42:57,037
It's probably going to fail anyway.

776
00:42:57,817 --> 00:42:59,759
And this was not terribly helpful.

777
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:03,961
It's very sound advice, but it is not that helpful.

778
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:07,683
So basically, I was kind of gambling.

779
00:43:07,904 --> 00:43:09,825
I was putting more chips on the table.

780
00:43:09,865 --> 00:43:11,826
But the longer I spent on the game

781
00:43:11,886 --> 00:43:14,347
and the more things I was adding to it to try and make it

782
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:17,009
better, it's basically like gambling.

783
00:43:17,049 --> 00:43:18,770
It's putting bigger and bigger bets

784
00:43:19,571 --> 00:43:21,412
in the hope of success and return.

785
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:24,078
And to be honest, even at this point,

786
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,800
even Grimlock's wise words were not helping,

787
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,062
because I was just feeling like, this is really scary.

788
00:43:31,102 --> 00:43:33,104
Like, I'm really running out of money,

789
00:43:33,484 --> 00:43:35,585
and it's just taking too long.

790
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:38,147
And it was actually a friend of mine,

791
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:40,228
actually the guy that I'd previously emailed,

792
00:43:40,428 --> 00:43:42,429
and he'd told me he really loved goats,

793
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:43,610
wanted goats in the game.

794
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:45,971
It was him that kind of,

795
00:43:46,692 --> 00:43:48,072
Yeah, gave me some advice.

796
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:52,215
Basically, he was telling me like he'd worked

797
00:43:52,275 --> 00:43:53,876
as a writer for a very long time,

798
00:43:54,736 --> 00:43:57,318
where he was kind of working at home and working by himself,

799
00:43:57,998 --> 00:43:59,979
whereas previously he'd worked with other people.

800
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,961
And yeah, I'm kind of butchering the quote.

801
00:44:03,061 --> 00:44:04,542
I mean, it's Spanish anyway,

802
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:05,562
and I think he told me in Spanish,

803
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,104
but basically he was saying that like,

804
00:44:08,724 --> 00:44:11,205
When you're working by yourself, you're not doing meetings,

805
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:13,367
you're not talking to other people,

806
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:16,088
you're not got distractions, you are solidly working

807
00:44:16,768 --> 00:44:19,390
and you are solidly improving your skills.

808
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,771
So basically you're getting a lot better

809
00:44:21,811 --> 00:44:22,531
at what you're doing.

810
00:44:23,392 --> 00:44:25,353
And so this was really helpful to me

811
00:44:25,373 --> 00:44:26,333
because I thought to myself,

812
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:28,514
well, even if I completely screw this up,

813
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,576
at least I'm gonna be better at making games.

814
00:44:32,156 --> 00:44:34,597
And this was kind of what I needed to keep going

815
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,158
and to actually get to the end.

816
00:44:37,527 --> 00:44:40,550
So this leads us to part four, the launch of the game,

817
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,492
but not the actual launch.

818
00:44:43,173 --> 00:44:44,354
This was the soft launch.

819
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:46,176
This was one and a half years in.

820
00:44:46,236 --> 00:44:49,540
I finally got to actually soft launch.

821
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,683
But of course, you know, the reason I chose to soft launch

822
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,746
is because there was still a few more things to do in the game.

823
00:44:54,886 --> 00:44:57,589
And also, I was terrified of doing a full launch

824
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:59,050
in case it was a complete failure.

825
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:03,953
So I used to compete to get a few installs for free.

826
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:07,094
I soft launched the game in India,

827
00:45:07,814 --> 00:45:10,495
basically because it was super cheap user acquisition.

828
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:13,577
And this is the stats here.

829
00:45:13,597 --> 00:45:15,958
You can see the number of users on the Y axis,

830
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,918
and then there's time on the X axis.

831
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:19,599
This was something like, I don't know,

832
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:21,720
five days after soft launch.

833
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,101
And you can see there's about 300 users there.

834
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:27,062
So, okay, this is useful when you get some data from that, right?

835
00:45:28,443 --> 00:45:28,783
And then...

836
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:34,735
Next day, suddenly, there was a huge bump in users.

837
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:37,178
But when I was looking at the stats,

838
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:41,963
I was reading still 300 users in the Unity telemetry,

839
00:45:41,983 --> 00:45:46,187
and yet there was 3,000 users in the Google telemetry.

840
00:45:46,207 --> 00:45:48,209
Like, what's going on here?

841
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,211
And I was like, okay, let's just have a look.

842
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:51,933
Where are these users coming from, right?

843
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:52,934
It should be India, right?

844
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:55,590
Nope, it was Russia.

845
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,871
I was like, why, how?

846
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:59,591
The game isn't released in Russia.

847
00:45:59,651 --> 00:45:59,871
What?

848
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:04,493
Oh, that's what's happened.

849
00:46:04,993 --> 00:46:07,414
So yeah, basically the game got pirated.

850
00:46:09,115 --> 00:46:12,756
And then if we return to the graph, a few days later,

851
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,737
so I've scaled the graph down here

852
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:16,737
so that you can see it's 3,000 users

853
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:19,018
at the top of that little red curve there.

854
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:20,799
And I think you can guess what's gonna happen next.

855
00:46:22,078 --> 00:46:23,959
Boom, within a few more days,

856
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,121
suddenly there were 300,000 users.

857
00:46:26,582 --> 00:46:31,646
And this time it was not Russia, it was China.

858
00:46:33,348 --> 00:46:34,649
So basically after two weeks,

859
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:35,389
I got 500,000 illegal downloads.

860
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:36,130
And then...

861
00:46:41,213 --> 00:46:44,055
Suddenly I get this email from this company called Yodo One,

862
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:44,575
and they're like,

863
00:46:45,016 --> 00:46:47,538
hey, we've been playing your game and we really like it.

864
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:49,939
Do you want to have a conversation?

865
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:51,601
I'm like, well, that's interesting you're playing my game

866
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:53,322
because it's not actually released in China.

867
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:55,984
They're like, yeah, we found it on this site.

868
00:46:56,144 --> 00:46:57,845
And yeah, anyway, we want to talk to you

869
00:46:57,865 --> 00:46:59,747
about a possible publishing deal.

870
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,920
My, okay, sure, I'll have a chat.

871
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,980
Now, I actually knew about Yoda One

872
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,521
because they'd worked on Crossy Road, which was huge.

873
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:09,161
I think they'd done the Android version.

874
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,582
They'd also worked on a game called Rodeo Stampede,

875
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,122
and they were the publisher worldwide.

876
00:47:15,003 --> 00:47:15,983
And they were telling me about this,

877
00:47:16,023 --> 00:47:17,103
you know, when I chatted to them.

878
00:47:17,123 --> 00:47:18,783
And they were like, yeah, I think your game

879
00:47:18,843 --> 00:47:20,964
can be as big as Rodeo Stampede.

880
00:47:21,224 --> 00:47:23,545
You know, we only take on a couple of games per year.

881
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,507
And, yeah, we think your game could be

882
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:27,928
as successful as that game.

883
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:31,491
So, okay, let's have a little look how this game is doing.

884
00:47:31,591 --> 00:47:34,173
And like, Rodeo Stampede at that point

885
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:35,534
had 120 million downloads.

886
00:47:36,135 --> 00:47:39,377
And using my very basic maths of divide by a million

887
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:42,459
downloads to get the amount of money the gamers made,

888
00:47:42,499 --> 00:47:44,080
which I'm sure is massively accurate,

889
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:45,782
you get $12 million.

890
00:47:46,002 --> 00:47:46,402
$12 million.

891
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:56,330
So yeah, anyway, basically I was like,

892
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:59,171
okay, let's try and do some kind of deal.

893
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,232
And I managed to negotiate something

894
00:48:01,252 --> 00:48:04,333
where I got quite a large upfront sum

895
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:06,514
for kind of licensing the game to them,

896
00:48:06,674 --> 00:48:08,235
i.e. allowing them to be my publisher

897
00:48:08,315 --> 00:48:09,916
and then for us to work on the game

898
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:10,876
and make some improvements.

899
00:48:12,317 --> 00:48:16,158
And this basically took a lot of pressure off me

900
00:48:16,198 --> 00:48:18,259
because it kind of meant that even if the game

901
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:19,340
kind of didn't do that well,

902
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,221
I'd still have some security there.

903
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:26,145
So, they invited me to China to work on the game with them.

904
00:48:26,165 --> 00:48:28,527
They wanted to make some improvements to the progression system.

905
00:48:29,288 --> 00:48:34,653
This was amazing because I really liked dumplings and I got to eat as many as I wanted.

906
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:37,575
And then, yeah, we worked on the game for a while.

907
00:48:38,576 --> 00:48:42,358
And yeah, so now I'm going to ask you guys one more time.

908
00:48:42,478 --> 00:48:46,019
So at this point, after getting a publisher, bear in mind,

909
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:50,801
they put a team of 10 people on the game to work with me, right?

910
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,163
That's 10 times the original team size.

911
00:48:54,663 --> 00:48:59,225
How long do you guys think it took to finish from this point to the end?

912
00:49:01,462 --> 00:49:03,263
Wow, you guys are super pessimistic.

913
00:49:03,303 --> 00:49:04,904
Okay, it took a whole year,

914
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:07,926
which is a pretty long time, right?

915
00:49:08,686 --> 00:49:11,407
Anyway, so two and a half years later,

916
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:13,949
finally, the game was released.

917
00:49:15,209 --> 00:49:17,471
This is a few little gifs here from the final game.

918
00:49:19,872 --> 00:49:23,814
So, yeah, so how did it do?

919
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:26,996
Well, it got a feature with Apple and Google,

920
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:28,496
so that was really cool.

921
00:49:29,437 --> 00:49:30,858
It did not set the world on fire.

922
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,003
I did not become a millionaire, I am sorry to say.

923
00:49:36,424 --> 00:49:40,468
But it got over 2 million downloads on the Apple Store,

924
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:42,530
over 2 million on Google Play.

925
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:46,274
It recuperated all the opportunity costs and more

926
00:49:46,314 --> 00:49:49,597
for me, and it still has players.

927
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:53,621
So basically, for a solo indie developer, it was a success.

928
00:49:56,195 --> 00:49:57,196
So let's sum up now.

929
00:49:58,556 --> 00:50:00,677
So when I was working on the game,

930
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:04,998
I used a tool called Toggle, which tracks how much time

931
00:50:05,018 --> 00:50:06,019
you spend on a task.

932
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,180
So basically, when you start a task, you start this timer.

933
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,180
When you work for it for a few hours,

934
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,421
then you finish the task, you stop the timer,

935
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:15,862
and you write, this is what I worked on.

936
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:16,982
It's in this category.

937
00:50:17,662 --> 00:50:20,245
Then at the end of the project, you can get a nice little graph like this,

938
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:22,287
and it tells you how long you spent on everything.

939
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:26,412
So even though this game took a very long time to make,

940
00:50:27,153 --> 00:50:30,657
you can see level design is only 9% of that time.

941
00:50:30,677 --> 00:50:36,143
And if you think about it, this is like literally level design, level building, level testing, and all that business.

942
00:50:36,643 --> 00:50:38,805
Like, I think 9% is actually quite small.

943
00:50:39,546 --> 00:50:41,487
And so, and I think a huge part of this

944
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:44,349
was because I have this process of, you know,

945
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:46,691
using this editor, this custom bit editor,

946
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:48,953
to allow me to rapidly build levels.

947
00:50:51,254 --> 00:50:53,336
So, here's some key takeaways.

948
00:50:55,552 --> 00:51:02,140
So, yeah, I highly recommend if you're working as an indie dev to make a level design process

949
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:07,267
or a level building process that allows you to rapidly iterate, because this is going

950
00:51:07,287 --> 00:51:12,092
to help you to not only build levels quickly initially, but also change them later if you

951
00:51:12,132 --> 00:51:14,355
need to, to either fix bugs or make them work better.

952
00:51:15,748 --> 00:51:20,229
I highly recommend theming your levels around at least one memorable aspect

953
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:26,050
so that the levels, you know, players can remember them after they played them

954
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:27,830
and they feel more unique.

955
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:31,331
I'd also recommend layering your game systems

956
00:51:31,951 --> 00:51:36,072
so that they interplay with each other to create maximum variety out of,

957
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:38,092
you know, as few mechanics as possible.

958
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,353
I'd also recommend using other people's code wherever possible

959
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:44,053
and adding goats.

960
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:51,233
But yeah, basically, you want to try to follow your own unique path to success as an indie developer.

961
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:54,015
Because, yeah, it's a very personal journey.

962
00:51:55,016 --> 00:51:59,460
You're going to have your own advantages that you can bring to that,

963
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,982
but also you're going to have your own disadvantages,

964
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:06,125
and your personality is a massive part of making a game by yourself.

965
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:12,449
And as I was saying, my personality was basically worrying about things and worrying, like,

966
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,430
is this going to work?

967
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:19,073
And so I needed to overcome that by basically being a bit more stupid and not judging myself

968
00:52:19,113 --> 00:52:19,454
too much.

969
00:52:21,035 --> 00:52:24,837
So, yeah, just quickly, you might wonder, like, what am I working on next?

970
00:52:25,898 --> 00:52:27,179
Makes sense to do a sequel, right?

971
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:29,800
Or possibly another climbing game, another mobile game.

972
00:52:31,144 --> 00:52:34,646
Actually, no, I'm working on an action horror roguelike

973
00:52:35,307 --> 00:52:38,929
about a rapidly expanding, procedurally growing tentacle

974
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:39,350
monster.

975
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,893
And this game is way more ambitious than Hang Life.

976
00:52:43,273 --> 00:52:45,094
I'm still doing it mostly by myself.

977
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,898
So yeah, why am I working on such a huge project?

978
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:52,639
I'm being stupid.

979
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,181
Too stupid to fail.

980
00:52:55,981 --> 00:52:57,502
So yeah, that's the end of my talk.

981
00:52:57,922 --> 00:53:00,503
If you want to keep in touch, yeah,

982
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:01,904
there's actually a lot more details

983
00:53:02,024 --> 00:53:03,705
on how I built the game.

984
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:05,826
If you go to this link on Game Developer,

985
00:53:06,746 --> 00:53:08,907
there's free articles or more explaining

986
00:53:09,008 --> 00:53:10,268
much more detail on the process.

987
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:14,253
If you want to follow me, you can do it at edform on Twitter.

988
00:53:15,455 --> 00:53:17,758
You can also get in touch via my website, Dynaboss.

989
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,644
And please fill in your speaker surveys if you enjoyed the talk.

990
00:53:23,706 --> 00:53:24,426
And that's it. Thank you.

991
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:35,839
And due to that technical hiccup with the video,

992
00:53:35,939 --> 00:53:38,121
I actually have no idea how long I've spent on this,

993
00:53:38,141 --> 00:53:39,521
because the timer stopped.

994
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:41,783
So do we have time for questions here?

995
00:53:41,803 --> 00:53:43,724
We have five minutes right now.

996
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:43,944
Awesome.

997
00:53:43,964 --> 00:53:46,485
So if anyone has any questions, please step up

998
00:53:46,505 --> 00:53:47,226
to the microphone.

999
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,049
Only easy questions, though, if possible.

1000
00:53:52,189 --> 00:53:52,649
That would be great.

1001
00:53:53,262 --> 00:53:56,745
Hi, thank you for what you talked about, it was great.

1002
00:53:57,405 --> 00:53:58,786
And I have a question.

1003
00:53:58,926 --> 00:54:01,128
You showed a pic of the mountain,

1004
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:04,991
which showed the easy parts and the hard parts of the level.

1005
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,313
My question is, why did you decide

1006
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:09,854
to start with the hard part?

1007
00:54:10,154 --> 00:54:12,096
Isn't it frustrating for the player

1008
00:54:12,176 --> 00:54:15,278
to start a level with a hard part instead of an easy one?

1009
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:22,667
Yeah, so I think the question is, why did I start that particular level with a hard section?

1010
00:54:22,707 --> 00:54:24,728
Because this could be frustrating to the player.

1011
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:27,970
That is a great question, and you're basically right.

1012
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,051
You shouldn't really start with a hard part.

1013
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:33,112
It was really just for the example of what I was trying to show.

1014
00:54:33,212 --> 00:54:35,793
So, yeah, the diagram probably not terribly accurate.

1015
00:54:36,553 --> 00:54:37,234
OK, thank you.

1016
00:54:37,314 --> 00:54:37,854
No worries.

1017
00:54:40,564 --> 00:54:41,945
Hi, thank you, that was a great talk.

1018
00:54:43,286 --> 00:54:46,207
My question is about how you laid out your levels,

1019
00:54:46,447 --> 00:54:48,668
especially after your tutorialization.

1020
00:54:49,149 --> 00:54:51,050
So there's probably a good chunk of levels

1021
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,210
where you already have all your mechanics

1022
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:52,971
talked to the player,

1023
00:54:53,671 --> 00:54:57,773
and there's a particular challenge of sorting those

1024
00:54:58,033 --> 00:55:01,655
in a nice, satisfying order, maybe increasing difficulty.

1025
00:55:02,056 --> 00:55:03,896
I'm curious if you had anything to speak on

1026
00:55:04,237 --> 00:55:06,158
as far as how you organized that.

1027
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:08,138
So I think the question is like,

1028
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,619
how did I organize the levels in terms of like,

1029
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:11,860
I built a bunch of them,

1030
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,141
like how to assemble them like in the correct order

1031
00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:17,782
and flesh out the kind of gaps and stuff.

1032
00:55:17,822 --> 00:55:18,783
Is that what you mean, roughly?

1033
00:55:19,503 --> 00:55:21,804
More so after your tutorialization curve,

1034
00:55:22,004 --> 00:55:25,525
where I mean, it's easy to order things after,

1035
00:55:25,806 --> 00:55:27,406
well, relatively easy to order things

1036
00:55:27,486 --> 00:55:29,427
after how you're teaching things.

1037
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:29,927
Yeah.

1038
00:55:29,987 --> 00:55:30,868
After everything's taught,

1039
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:34,209
you have a bunch of level content that you need to organize

1040
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:35,510
and how do you do that?

1041
00:55:35,905 --> 00:55:37,286
Yeah, yeah, no, it's a good question.

1042
00:55:37,847 --> 00:55:43,473
So to be honest, I kind of still kept introducing new things

1043
00:55:43,493 --> 00:55:46,557
because the way the game was structured, it was split into several mountains

1044
00:55:46,617 --> 00:55:49,120
that had between five and ten levels in each one.

1045
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,324
And every mountain would introduce something new.

1046
00:55:52,404 --> 00:55:56,228
This was partly to just try to keep the game interesting as you went along.

1047
00:55:57,089 --> 00:55:59,771
But definitely the more levels you build for the game,

1048
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:02,633
for sure you're going to kind of start to, you know,

1049
00:56:02,753 --> 00:56:05,795
run out of, let's say, new mechanics to build.

1050
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:08,657
And to be honest, to me, it was about trying to

1051
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:12,420
then use the actual design of the level to create variety.

1052
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:16,663
So like, you know, making just more interesting shapes

1053
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:18,205
that the player hadn't seen before,

1054
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:20,626
instead of it just being one mountain, you know,

1055
00:56:20,646 --> 00:56:22,788
have three peaks or have like a, you know,

1056
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,570
mountain that's bending rapidly on its side

1057
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:26,311
and things like that.

1058
00:56:27,892 --> 00:56:32,096
And yeah, just basically trying to play with what you have

1059
00:56:32,176 --> 00:56:35,159
to stretch out that content as much as you can.

1060
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:39,404
Yeah, I mean, there's lots of other aspects to it, I guess,

1061
00:56:39,444 --> 00:56:43,407
but yeah, it's kind of hard to sum up in one line, but yeah.

1062
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:44,168
Thank you.

1063
00:56:44,188 --> 00:56:44,909
No worries.

1064
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:57,602
So I was just curious, so the first six months, was that just to get the vertical slice done?

1065
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:01,544
Or were you more focused on just completing the game in general, you didn't really focus

1066
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,786
on a more traditional development cycle?

1067
00:57:04,782 --> 00:57:08,925
Yeah, so the question is, what was I basically doing in that first six months?

1068
00:57:08,965 --> 00:57:10,305
Was that for a vertical slice?

1069
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:15,388
Yeah, the answer is that was the first six months basically was a vertical slice.

1070
00:57:15,488 --> 00:57:18,710
Yeah, it was about figuring out like how am I going to build this game?

1071
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,251
What is this game going to be?

1072
00:57:21,412 --> 00:57:23,333
And like, what are the main parts of it?

1073
00:57:24,053 --> 00:57:27,375
And making sure that I had all the tools to build it, basically.

1074
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:31,217
So it's kind of like, yeah, how am I making this game, basically?

1075
00:57:31,817 --> 00:57:35,959
But all the kind of longer progression of the game, let's say,

1076
00:57:35,979 --> 00:57:40,521
and all the stuff like UI, economy, and all that, that was later.

1077
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:41,962
Okay, thank you.

1078
00:57:42,362 --> 00:57:46,624
Yeah, no worries. Do we have one more question I think we have?

1079
00:57:46,944 --> 00:57:47,664
Yeah.

1080
00:57:47,704 --> 00:57:51,586
Yeah, you had mentioned that you were going to spend three to six months on this project,

1081
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:54,787
and then potentially on another. What was your runway like?

1082
00:57:54,827 --> 00:57:56,948
What was the amount of time you were planning on spending?

1083
00:57:57,439 --> 00:57:59,980
Yeah, basically, yes, good question.

1084
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,702
I think my runway was basically what I used.

1085
00:58:03,402 --> 00:58:05,584
So yeah, about a year and a half,

1086
00:58:05,684 --> 00:58:09,706
like, because I was planning to try to make a few small games,

1087
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:11,468
but yeah, it ended up being one game

1088
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:13,349
and then it ended up taking longer than that.

1089
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,650
But fortunately, signing the publishing deal

1090
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,012
that, you know, allowed me to keep going.

1091
00:58:19,032 --> 00:58:20,513
Cool, thank you.

1092
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,955
Yeah, so I think the idea is definitely

1093
00:58:23,175 --> 00:58:24,496
plan for maximum runway.

1094
00:58:24,516 --> 00:58:26,017
If you're anything like me, you're gonna end up

1095
00:58:26,057 --> 00:58:27,158
spending way longer than you think.

1096
00:58:28,823 --> 00:58:29,583
All right, thanks guys.

1097
00:58:29,644 --> 00:58:30,925
I think that's all the time for questions.
