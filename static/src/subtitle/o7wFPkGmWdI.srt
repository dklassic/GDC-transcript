1
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:13,355
I work for Arkin Studios in France and today we're going to talk about change and adaptation

2
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:17,877
from a VFX artist perspective and we'll see how working for a different company makes

3
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:19,238
your personal practice evolve.

4
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:23,521
So this morning with Ryan and Mike,

5
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,163
we were talking about the outside of VFX.

6
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:29,446
And we'll keep on talking about art here.

7
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:30,767
We're back to basics.

8
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:35,190
So we'll just focus on particles and their fundamental behaviors.

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,071
And this is where the title is coming from,

10
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:40,214
because everything will be just plain and elementary.

11
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:42,295
But this time, as opposed to this morning,

12
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:45,898
it's going to be a bit more focused

13
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:48,480
on the relationship with gameplay.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:48,760
So it's...

15
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:51,091
It's a bit more hands-on.

16
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:54,873
So here's how we're going to spend our time.

17
00:00:54,933 --> 00:01:00,474
The first half, we'll be going back and forth between two

18
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:01,555
games I've been working on.

19
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:05,096
And we'll compare how the VFX were made on each of them.

20
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:08,624
So first of all, we're going to introduce those games.

21
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:12,005
Then we look at some similarities between them.

22
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:14,766
And then, of course, we'll look at some differences.

23
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:18,466
And during the second half, we'll

24
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:20,587
dig deeper into Dishonored 2.

25
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:23,748
And as a quick intro, we'll define

26
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:26,608
what makes the style of the effects on Dishonored 2.

27
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:29,589
And then we'll look at gameplay.

28
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,630
And we'll see how the gameplay and the features

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,470
influence the way we create our VFX.

30
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:40,485
So as a super quick intro, I'll just tell you

31
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:44,647
how I got into real-time VFX, because this is the closing

32
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:46,268
theme for today.

33
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:49,710
So yeah, I thought this would be a nice place to start.

34
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,671
So back in France, I'm French.

35
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:58,434
I was studying arts and graphic design from the age of 15.

36
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:02,796
Then that got me to move to the UK to study new media.

37
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:07,358
And because at that time I knew people who were working in games,

38
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:13,421
then that got me to work on the compositing of the pitching trailer in After Effects.

39
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:17,884
And then eventually that got me to proper game development.

40
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:24,187
So this is a career path and move that I really wasn't expecting.

41
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,809
It just happened, but I'm really happy it happened.

42
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:29,450
And now I've been working in games for ten years.

43
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:37,819
The first five years I spent at Ninja 3, which is in the UK, and at the end of the five years

44
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:44,183
I got to a senior position, everything really felt nice and easy and comfortable, I was

45
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:53,048
in control, and then I moved back to France, my home country, and started working for Arkin

46
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:53,489
Studios.

47
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:57,370
And suddenly I was really out of my comfort zone.

48
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,631
Everything was new. It was a new company,

49
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,091
new people, a different type of game, new technologies, so

50
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:09,072
just overall new challenges. And that's when I realized I had to change my

51
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:13,073
habits. Before we get to that, I'll present to

52
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,774
you the two games that framed this transition.

53
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:19,615
So the last one I worked on at Ninja Theory

54
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:23,876
was Devil May Cry 5. So it's a third-person game.

55
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:32,149
Although this one was a reboot that was made in the UK, it comes from a Japanese license.

56
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:40,246
Because I'm short of a better word, I'd say that the gameplay is pretty dense.

57
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:46,151
And what I mean by that is that there's a lot of information to communicate in a very short amount of time.

58
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,814
So, as you can see, the game is pretty fast-paced.

59
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:52,596
Combo chaining is really encouraged.

60
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,600
You have several weapons, you have many moves per weapons.

61
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:02,062
You have different enemy states, some of those enemies are immune to certain weapons.

62
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:08,004
So all of that, and even more actually, needs to be understandable throughout the game.

63
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:13,566
And finally, the gameplay demands the player to be very reactive.

64
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:19,927
So everything is all about control skills and really knowing your moves and knowing your timing.

65
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:23,308
Now, what does all that mean for a VFX artist?

66
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:29,100
Well, first of all, because it's sort of a fantasy, it's not a realistic world,

67
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:33,944
we were able to make very stylized effects,

68
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:37,326
so it was a really, really fun playground as an effect artist.

69
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:42,930
But then, within that creative freedom, because we had so much to communicate,

70
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,033
we had to establish a visual language using shapes and colors.

71
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,124
And then finally, every move had to read as a signature

72
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:54,226
and be really clearly identified.

73
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:58,490
So now let's talk about Dishonored 2,

74
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:02,394
which is the first game I worked on at Arkane Studios.

75
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:04,977
So it's a first-person game.

76
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,679
And already you can see there's a contrast in pace.

77
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:10,803
It is an immersive simulation.

78
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:16,428
That's a sort of genre where it's all about saying yes to the player.

79
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:23,600
You want them to be in control of their adventure so that in a given situation they'll be able

80
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,242
to use a different approach.

81
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:33,090
So your duty as a developer is to embrace the player's creativity and make sure that

82
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,312
you don't break the illusion and that you don't remind them that they are playing a game.

83
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:44,195
So a lot of energy is spent in every department to make sure that this world really feels like

84
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:49,317
it exists, like it is tangible. There's a great emphasis on depth and on consistency.

85
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:53,480
And then finally, the game is giving you a toolbox

86
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,985
and encouraging you to experiment and find

87
00:05:57,026 --> 00:06:01,031
some creative ways to combine everything it has to offer.

88
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:05,097
So what does all this mean for VFX artists?

89
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:05,919
Well, first of all.

90
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:09,739
RFX needs to feel believable.

91
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,662
It's not necessarily photorealistic or anything,

92
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:14,523
but it has to feel right,

93
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:18,326
and it has to feel like it belongs to that world.

94
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:23,370
Then we can't really afford to be really minimalistic.

95
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,453
We need layers of details to echo the detailed world

96
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:28,734
that is surrounding RFX.

97
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:36,828
Finally, we need to cover every possible case, because you never know what the player is going to do.

98
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:40,133
So everything has to work in any given condition.

99
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:48,129
To give you an example, if you take a mouse, usually that's something that you just plant and it stays there.

100
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:56,591
But then if the player decides to plant it on something that they can carry around, such as a chopped head or a limb,

101
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:02,253
then you need to make sure that your effects are going to work also when they're in movement.

102
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:08,309
So my transition happened between these two games,

103
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:11,111
and they are pretty different in many respects.

104
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:16,495
But it's OK, because I come from an applied arts background.

105
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:20,458
So really early on, I was told to analyze and deduce,

106
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:23,600
and then create something, whilst always strongly keeping

107
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,421
the brief in mind.

108
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:27,443
And basically, that's exactly what we do when CreateFX.

109
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:34,648
So you think that should be a lesson learned, but when I started working for Arkane,

110
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:40,352
all those sudden changes made me realize that I was working out of habits,

111
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:42,553
more than I would have wanted to admit.

112
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:47,952
And I guess part of the reason is that I knew only one company.

113
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:50,654
I had only ever worked at Ninja Theory before.

114
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:53,036
So it was my first company, and it

115
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:55,919
was where I learned everything about games.

116
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,821
So I was lacking critical distance,

117
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:03,265
and I was lacking the means to put my practice

118
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:04,206
into perspective.

119
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,429
And so that change of company just did that,

120
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,291
give me a bit of perspective.

121
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:18,961
So now we're going to compare some examples between the way the effects were done on DMC and on Designer 2.

122
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:24,004
So first of all we'll look at some old tricks I still cherish to that day,

123
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:28,886
and then some other areas where you have to do things a bit differently.

124
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:35,340
So even though the title on the slide here says comparison,

125
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:39,244
I really want to stress out how there's no judgment value.

126
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:41,146
It's not about comparing the games

127
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:44,009
and trying to define if one is better than the other.

128
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:45,590
They're just different.

129
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,733
And they're also made on a different console generation.

130
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:55,436
What we are comparing here is how you create VFX in one context or another.

131
00:08:56,397 --> 00:09:02,559
And again, there's not a method that is better than the other because it's all about having

132
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,321
the right method for the type of game you're working on.

133
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:11,223
So first of all, we're going to talk about textures.

134
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:16,145
We all have our favorite go-to textures that we like to use all over the place.

135
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:19,851
And so all these that you're seeing now

136
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,855
are textures that belong to Dishonored 2,

137
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:27,161
but they mimic behaviors that were used on DMC.

138
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:31,046
And the reason for that is that I joined quite early

139
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:34,551
on the development of DMC, of Dishonored 2.

140
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:40,985
And at that time, there wasn't a full library of texture

141
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:44,767
being built. So what happened is that as I started working

142
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,668
through my first tasks, naturally I

143
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,429
was reminded of other effects I had been working on before.

144
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,291
So I created some textures with a direct influence

145
00:09:56,611 --> 00:10:00,292
of other methods I had been using previously on DMC.

146
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,353
So now we're going to have a look at two of them

147
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:04,594
in more details.

148
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:14,656
This first one, so that's the setup, how it is in a Designer 2, is just three textures

149
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:21,099
rotating at different speeds and multiplied together to get a sort of a shimmery feel.

150
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,703
And even though in that case it was made with three textures, you could just use the single

151
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:33,827
one and multiply it with itself as long as the rotating speeds are different, then it's

152
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:34,907
going to work just fine.

153
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:42,529
And so this is the way that it was used on DMC.

154
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:48,490
And by the way, throughout the talk,

155
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,910
I'm going to be mostly showing some effects

156
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,011
that I've been working on,

157
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,131
because they're the ones I know the best,

158
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:55,311
but every now and again,

159
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:57,892
we'll also see some effects from other people.

160
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:00,753
So if you compare that,

161
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:05,793
to how it's been used on Dishonored 2 is quite interesting because

162
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:12,783
the original material is extremely, extremely close and similar, but the use of it is different

163
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:16,248
because, you know, the games all demand something different.

164
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,350
The material really stands out on DMC.

165
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,511
It's big and flashy, and you can really quickly identify it.

166
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:26,812
Whereas in the Zoner 2, it's harder

167
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:29,133
to tell that element apart from the rest.

168
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,333
Everything participates to the explosion,

169
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:34,554
and that one just flows with the rest.

170
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,595
So the different contexts just means that you

171
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,836
need to adapt your method a bit.

172
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:51,497
Now our second example is just a simple lye streak, a very convenient and versatile kind of texture.

173
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:56,800
And again let's have a look at how it was used on TMC.

174
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:02,003
And it's the same thing here.

175
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:06,949
If we compare the use of that texture in the two games,

176
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,155
it stands out a lot more on DMC, because it's

177
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:13,597
telling something to the player.

178
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:15,479
It's telling the player to run away,

179
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,383
otherwise they're going to get really badly hit in a second.

180
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:19,344
Whereas.

181
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:24,750
In the explosion from Descendants, those streaks themselves, they don't have something

182
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:30,216
really particular, really special to say. They have a purpose, and that's to give rhythm and

183
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:38,065
emphasis to the overall effect. But it's all about participating to the main event.

184
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:43,106
So let's keep on talking about textures,

185
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:47,947
and more specifically, let's talk about shape variations

186
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:48,968
on sparks.

187
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,588
Now, this is the kind of texture that is often used for sparks.

188
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,269
And it's OK, but I think you can do better than this.

189
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:01,630
So let's have a look at some resources from Designer 2.

190
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,951
So what you can do is bake a whole cluster of sparks

191
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:06,691
into one texture.

192
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:12,699
You can make variations even on simple static shapes.

193
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:15,361
Even though those parts are going

194
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:18,003
to be quite small on screen, it does make a difference.

195
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:21,766
Then, of course, you can use animated materials.

196
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,909
And finally, you have flipbooks as well.

197
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:26,710
They're not just there for animations.

198
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,512
You can use them for texture variations as well.

199
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,970
Although, OK, this one is a bit of an overkill.

200
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,611
I think four of these map variations

201
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:38,892
could have probably been enough.

202
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:42,775
So yeah, I'll just optimize that for the next game, basically.

203
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:54,341
So in both games you see how the sparks are just more detailed than a simple round soft gradient.

204
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,064
And by the way, if you look at the example from Dishonored 2,

205
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:02,488
this one is using three of the textures that we were looking at just before.

206
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:11,915
And in both cases, there's also the fact that the textures that are, the spots that are oriented

207
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:17,920
towards the velocity, their textures have a leading edge, they're not symmetrical, so

208
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:24,265
that really enhances the motion and gives a better sense of direction.

209
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:29,330
And that's something that a round centered texture can't convey quite as well.

210
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:39,013
Now, before we move on to differences, we're going to have a look at a way to use the initial color.

211
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:45,062
So this is what you get when you apply the same base color

212
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:46,863
to every one of your sprites.

213
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:50,424
So in our proprietary engine, the void engine,

214
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:55,605
we have two initial controls for our color.

215
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:58,426
We have a base color, and that's multiplied by initial color.

216
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,926
But that's kind of a detail.

217
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:07,435
you could apply that same tint to everything by either using your texture color

218
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:11,422
or just specifying the same initial color on every of your sprites.

219
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:15,848
So anyway, to get a bit more variety than this,

220
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:19,250
what you can do is use a range on initial color

221
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,892
so that every sprite gets tinted slightly differently.

222
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:26,033
And I really love using a range on initial color

223
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:30,015
because it's a very simple way of just bringing

224
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,736
a little bit more life to your effect.

225
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,997
And it's also making the most of our tools

226
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,379
because if you're not tied to a texture color,

227
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,100
then let's exploit it.

228
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:42,328
However, that's a very, very sensitive value,

229
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:44,149
so you have to be cautious with it,

230
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:48,211
because this is the result that you get if you use the full 0

231
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:49,351
to 1 range.

232
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,113
And sometimes it might be what you're after,

233
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:54,714
but most of the times, it's not the case.

234
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:59,339
So anyway, you just use your restricted range.

235
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,840
And then on top of that, you can also

236
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,883
add your usual color of the life curves.

237
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:11,746
And that exact setup with those values

238
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:17,110
is one of the elements that are used in the grenade explosion

239
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,210
in Dishonored 2.

240
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:25,650
So that being said, sometimes you can use really, really pronounced colors,

241
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,933
but you have to organize them around a common tint.

242
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:34,519
Because you see, if you pose on single frames...

243
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:38,101
you see how sometimes you get really contrasted colors,

244
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:40,303
but it's controlled.

245
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,004
The way it was done in that case is

246
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,685
that there are several emitters, and some of them

247
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,867
are balanced towards green, and some of them

248
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:48,208
are balanced towards purple.

249
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:53,811
And so that none of them can go through the full color range,

250
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:55,012
as we've seen before.

251
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:59,234
And therefore, the overall perception of the effect

252
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:00,095
remains blue.

253
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:01,876
And.

254
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:07,443
If you have too little elements or your effects don't last very long,

255
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:12,205
and you can't really use that range on the initial color,

256
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:14,966
what you can do is, if you have several emitters,

257
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:19,288
just use a slightly different tint on all of them

258
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,869
and you'll get the same result.

259
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,670
Just make sure that not everything is exactly the same color.

260
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:31,619
Now, because gameplay dictates a lot of what you do,

261
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:34,461
there's obviously a lot of differences as well.

262
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:41,348
So our first example is going to be a bit of a case study.

263
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:45,051
And I'm going to show you the first effect I ever

264
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:46,432
showed to my art director.

265
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,015
And that's a sort of flashbang effect.

266
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:52,745
And at that time, I was still new at Arkane Studios,

267
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:58,049
and I was still working under the influence of DMC.

268
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:02,232
So because it's so old, I can't show you that exact version

269
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:02,992
that he reviewed.

270
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:06,195
So what I've done instead is I recreated

271
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,617
what I imagine I may have done at that time,

272
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:13,179
or what I would have done while working on DMC

273
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,681
and if I had been given the same brief.

274
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:16,502
So.

275
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:21,247
Obviously it's a very biased exercise but I've tried to do it as honestly as I could.

276
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:27,927
So his feedback on that or something along that idea

277
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:32,030
is that the effects were too smooth and too neat.

278
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:35,092
That the weapon that was shooting that

279
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,554
is handcrafted by a gang of thugs.

280
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:40,096
And he wanted that to be visible in the effect.

281
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:43,078
So overall, it needed to be more noisy

282
00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:46,500
and to give a sense that the weapon was almost

283
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,401
barely functioning.

284
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:50,971
And I really remember that moment

285
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:54,073
because it was the trigger for my understanding

286
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:55,094
of the arcane touch.

287
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:02,421
So this is the version that made it in the final game.

288
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:07,366
And both versions are using exactly the same elements.

289
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:11,009
So the difference between them is solely

290
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,951
on the way the particles behave.

291
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:17,016
And if we compare them into a bit more details,

292
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:21,337
well, first of all, the effects in Dishonored 2,

293
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:22,438
they're more realistic.

294
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:26,299
So we use dust and smoke and debris and so on.

295
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:28,959
You can see that I didn't put any smoke

296
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,800
in the sort of DMC-like version.

297
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,202
So we did use some dusty elements back then in the game,

298
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,543
but usually they were very secondary

299
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:43,123
in order to not interfere with legibility.

300
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:48,125
Let me just go back, because they're supposed to be in sync,

301
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,527
and then you can compare them a bit better.

302
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:54,451
So then there's the textures.

303
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,154
On DMC, because it's more of a fantasy register,

304
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:00,556
we can use more fictional elements.

305
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:03,739
And we are using some of those on Designer 2,

306
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,361
because they give a good impact, but they're not

307
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:07,362
the star of the show.

308
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:10,405
And they're a lot more prominent on DMC.

309
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:17,767
Then the timing, that's a single flash on the DMC-like version,

310
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:22,190
but on Dishonored, the elements, they appear one after the other.

311
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,852
It's not as neat in design, and the effects have more of a...

312
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:28,793
It's got more of a life of its own.

313
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:33,859
And finally, the timing is more stylized in DMC.

314
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,680
The elements, they can pop and flash,

315
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,121
whilst in the designed version, everything

316
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:44,664
is going to last a bit longer because the smoke just

317
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:46,345
needs time to dissipate.

318
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:47,146
This is the way it is.

319
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:48,286
Now.

320
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:56,477
In retrospect, if I look back at the version that made it through the final game,

321
00:20:57,037 --> 00:21:02,580
I think I could have taken it one step further in the sort of noisy and messy aspect,

322
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,461
because there are a lot of elements in there,

323
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:08,203
and there's probably more than you actually get to see,

324
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,244
because some of them, they just get lost in the mix.

325
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,986
So a better timing balance would have showcased them a bit better.

326
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:24,331
Now the first thing I wanted to build when I worked on that effect was a sort

327
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:28,714
of core of the bright flash and this is what I had in mind. This is the heat

328
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:36,059
impact from DMC. So I thought all I need to do is create my texture, offset it

329
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:41,543
from the center, duplicate it and rotate it and you know job done.

330
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:45,620
But this is something I can't do actually in Dishonored 2,

331
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:49,062
because in our game, the players have the ability

332
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:50,743
to slow down or stop the time.

333
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:55,545
And the thing is, if you freeze an effect that

334
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,026
is camera-facing and you start moving around it,

335
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:00,567
suddenly you can see how flat it is.

336
00:22:00,627 --> 00:22:02,108
And it looks quite cheap.

337
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:07,630
So if you don't go this way, but you distribute your layers

338
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,051
in proper 3D space, then.

339
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:18,068
it feels again that the, it feels like the effect is belonging to that world and it stops breaking

340
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:25,970
the illusion. And this is the method that had to be used to build the core flash of that effect.

341
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:34,272
Now we're going to talk about camera view. So we've seen that one game is a first person game

342
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:40,113
and the other one is a third person game. And yeah, what does that imply for VFX?

343
00:22:42,286 --> 00:22:49,172
In this example, you are seeing two features that appear in both games, and that's shooting and slashing.

344
00:22:49,712 --> 00:22:52,354
So, first of all, we'll have a quick look at the muzzle flash.

345
00:22:53,395 --> 00:23:01,422
To give you a bit of context, what you're seeing here is one of the different elements that make up the muzzle flash in Dishonored,

346
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:05,025
but it's been massively exaggerated just for the...

347
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:08,239
for the purpose of making a point here.

348
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:12,222
So the longest of those lines are 16 meters long.

349
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:16,185
And if you don't know about metric system,

350
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:19,348
then I can guarantee that's pretty massive.

351
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,111
What you're seeing on screen, the tiny black smudge

352
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:25,693
on the left-hand side, is the arms of the player.

353
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:28,836
And you can see the scale relationship

354
00:23:28,896 --> 00:23:30,397
to the longest of those parts.

355
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,880
But you have no idea about that from the first-person angle.

356
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:34,941
So.

357
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:43,321
everything that is almost in line with a camera gets really drastically reduced by the perspective shortcut.

358
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:48,484
And this is something that is of use for those of you who work on FPSs,

359
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:50,445
but you know, not everyone does.

360
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:57,329
And personally, when I started working for Arkane, I was quite disconcerted by that camera angle.

361
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,551
I just had to change a few things.

362
00:24:01,436 --> 00:24:05,138
So it's the same for muzzle flashes or trails

363
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:09,019
or anything that is aiming down to the center of the screen.

364
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:12,381
You have to find ways to make them visible

365
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:13,881
despite that camera angle.

366
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:19,023
And in the meantime, in a third-person game,

367
00:24:19,183 --> 00:24:22,105
it's pretty straightforward to just make

368
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:23,765
the muzzle flash look readable.

369
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,127
And these effects on DMC, the muzzle flash and the trails,

370
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:30,828
were done by my colleague at that time, Omar Parada.

371
00:24:32,311 --> 00:24:37,055
Now, the second thing that we are seeing in both games here

372
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:39,276
is the use of the sword.

373
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:45,421
So on DMC, that was a major feature for two reasons.

374
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:47,763
First of all, well, it's really important to gameplay

375
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:49,344
because it's scenario of effect.

376
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:54,147
So the visual representation has to be super accurate

377
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:55,689
to the gameplay data.

378
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,610
Otherwise, the game is going to feel unfair.

379
00:24:58,691 --> 00:24:58,931
And.

380
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,562
And then because it's a third-person game,

381
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:04,363
it's got all that room to unfold.

382
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:08,045
It's a very good excuse for a bit of a visual extravagance.

383
00:25:08,746 --> 00:25:12,188
So that feature back then has represented a lot of work

384
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:15,469
for many teams, for the engine team, for the animation team,

385
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,591
for the design team, and for the art team.

386
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:23,073
And whilst it is that really, really crucial feature on DMC,

387
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:26,915
in Dishonored, it's more of a visual enhancement.

388
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:29,716
It's less meaningful, and it's less significant.

389
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:32,798
And the reason for that is, well, first of all,

390
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:34,879
visually it just wouldn't work.

391
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:39,481
In that world, that kind of trails, the trails from DMC

392
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:40,741
would feel really out of place.

393
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:44,709
And then because of the camera angle,

394
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,314
you just couldn't cover the screen with long lasting trails

395
00:25:49,374 --> 00:25:56,762
because you wouldn't be seeing what you're doing in the game.

396
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:00,106
So anyway, we still have a trail.

397
00:26:00,787 --> 00:26:03,149
It's a game after all, but it's a lot more subtle.

398
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:08,709
And now for our last difference between the two games,

399
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:11,171
let's talk about animation smoothness.

400
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:15,375
And what I mean by that is how smoothly you

401
00:26:15,435 --> 00:26:18,818
make things flow between the different states of your effects.

402
00:26:21,717 --> 00:26:24,219
Here, you're seeing an attack being charged.

403
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,761
So if you release at the perfect time,

404
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:30,584
you're going to unleash a more powerful and more visually

405
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:31,625
rewarding attack.

406
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:35,768
And you have to release the button after just three frames.

407
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:40,052
So the tell to the player had to be really obvious.

408
00:26:40,352 --> 00:26:44,375
Originally, I was animating that glow in size and opacity.

409
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,378
But really quickly, we realized with our designer

410
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:49,980
that it had to be instant to allow

411
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,241
the player to react in time.

412
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:55,797
Now, that's exactly the same principle and timing,

413
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:56,817
but on a different move.

414
00:26:57,557 --> 00:27:01,318
And those two cases are really extreme.

415
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:04,339
But generally speaking, on DMC, we

416
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:06,879
were able to just swap one effect to another.

417
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,820
And you wouldn't see it popping as long

418
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,881
as it looked kind of similar, because your eyes and your brain

419
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:15,841
just fills in the gap.

420
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:19,745
But again, this is something that we cannot do on Dishonored 2,

421
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:24,890
because as I mentioned before, the players have that ability to slow down the time.

422
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:31,297
So everything has to flow really seamlessly between the different states of our effects.

423
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:35,301
And this one was done by my lead, Thibaut Guichard.

424
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:37,663
So...

425
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,464
Looking at the way the effects were done on these two games,

426
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:46,207
it tells us something that we know already,

427
00:27:46,427 --> 00:27:48,049
but that gets proven once more.

428
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:51,532
And it is that nothing is arbitrary in a game,

429
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:52,734
or at least nothing should be.

430
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:56,437
Because the particular game that we're working on

431
00:27:56,918 --> 00:27:57,518
is going to decide.

432
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,704
dictate what we do. We are here to serve its purpose. So that doesn't mean that

433
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:08,829
all your previous experience gets lost because every time you start

434
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,091
working on a new project.

435
00:28:12,003 --> 00:28:15,045
As an individual, you do come with your personal luggage

436
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:18,687
and your influences, and you bring your own perspective

437
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:19,347
to the table.

438
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:23,209
But every time, you just need to adapt it just a bit.

439
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:26,531
And it's actually a really interesting challenge,

440
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:28,772
because it's all about trying to make

441
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:30,533
the most of what you already know,

442
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:33,834
whilst respecting the current game you're working on.

443
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:38,837
So now it's time to focus on design two.

444
00:28:40,438 --> 00:28:40,578
And...

445
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:49,734
as an intro, will quickly define what makes the VFX style in Dishonored.

446
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:58,646
So these are a few weapons that have been created for Dishonored 2.

447
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:02,014
And they've been designed with a lot of love and care.

448
00:29:02,594 --> 00:29:05,337
And the reason why I'm showing you those right now

449
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:09,542
is that in this talk, I'm mostly describing

450
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:13,626
the sort of real part of the effects, the effects related

451
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,068
to weapons and gadgets.

452
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:20,567
because we also have magic and powers, but this is more about control.

453
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:29,150
And the effects for the weapons, they have to feel a bit shaky and noisy and accidental,

454
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,572
because if they are too neat, then it's going to feel a bit artificial.

455
00:29:33,592 --> 00:29:39,274
It's going to feel out of place in that world of many details.

456
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:44,315
So the noise that we bring to them helps them feel like they exist.

457
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:48,263
And as I mentioned before, it's especially the case

458
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:50,824
on the ones used by the thugs faction,

459
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:53,906
because they're made with bits and pieces.

460
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:58,508
So the idea is that we have to make things feel

461
00:29:58,528 --> 00:30:01,189
accidental and sort of random.

462
00:30:01,949 --> 00:30:04,930
And that has to do with the way we use our properties.

463
00:30:06,442 --> 00:30:11,365
So to try and illustrate this, I recreated what I see

464
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:15,568
as a sort of a generic gamey spark explosion.

465
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,769
And there's nothing wrong as such,

466
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:23,113
but there is a lot of room to sort of spice it up.

467
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:26,315
So right now, you're seeing eight different loops

468
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,996
of the same effect, but you can't really tell it.

469
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:31,278
I mean, they all look extremely similar.

470
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:36,094
And this is more what a spark explosion would

471
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:37,794
feel like in Descender 2.

472
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:39,995
Every time it feels different.

473
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:44,036
You can really tell that it's been recalculated every time.

474
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:47,436
And in between the two versions, that's

475
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:49,917
all the properties that have been modified.

476
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:52,737
So you don't have to read it all.

477
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:56,738
The idea is just to give you an idea of how

478
00:30:56,978 --> 00:30:58,998
every little thing and detail can

479
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:00,398
be pushed a little bit further.

480
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:05,872
And in the end, both versions, they are going to fulfill exactly the same function.

481
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:11,474
It's a bunch of sparks shooting radially and covering a certain gameplay area.

482
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:15,076
But this one feels more alive and more unpredictable.

483
00:31:15,096 --> 00:31:18,337
And that's exactly what we need in the world of Dishonored.

484
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:27,261
So now we're going to talk a bit about the relationship between gameplay and VFX.

485
00:31:28,323 --> 00:31:33,185
Now, even though the art direction is extremely important, of course,

486
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:38,027
it's not the only factor that is responsible for the visual of the effects.

487
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:43,729
The gameplay is also a very good contestant, because not only does it influence the look

488
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:48,791
of our effects, I mean, it defines, you know, the size of it and how long it lasts and so on,

489
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:53,013
but sometimes it can also influence the way we create them.

490
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:56,489
So first of all, we're going to have

491
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:01,316
a look at a particular grenade, because this one is non-lethal.

492
00:32:01,777 --> 00:32:03,539
It just causes a physics impact.

493
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:10,571
And even though our effects are quite detailed in the end,

494
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,833
we have to start simple.

495
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:16,696
And everything I'm going to talk about now

496
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:20,699
sort of crosses over what Mike Linden was

497
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,780
talking about this morning.

498
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,323
It's all about working simple from the beginning

499
00:32:25,383 --> 00:32:27,164
so you can iterate a bit better.

500
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:32,963
Because, yeah, making games is an iterative process.

501
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:37,546
So every feature is prone to evolve, maybe get cut.

502
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:41,489
So you can't make an effect look final on day one,

503
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:43,530
because the chances are you're going to have

504
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,811
to do it all over again.

505
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:47,833
Now, that level of simplification,

506
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:50,234
you don't necessarily use it very often.

507
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:54,237
But it can be useful for very early feature debugging.

508
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:59,875
It can be useful for your designer so they get the feel of the metrics and of the timing

509
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,198
and it can be useful for your gameplay coder because then they can make sure that

510
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:06,620
everything is triggered properly.

511
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:12,083
But then it's time to start on your research phase,

512
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:16,566
because from that raw gameplay data, which is just a radius,

513
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:18,568
then there's a world of possibilities.

514
00:33:19,008 --> 00:33:22,531
It's up to you to decide what sort of intent

515
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:23,652
you want to put into it.

516
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:27,735
So you get to decide how you want to break it up.

517
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:31,158
And at that stage, you just keep your element to the minimum

518
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,521
in order to just define your intention

519
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:35,922
and just get a feel for it.

520
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:37,163
And.

521
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:48,392
You know how Mike this morning was saying that he likes to draw that and not get... how to say...

522
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:51,584
not spend too much time with the tools.

523
00:33:51,704 --> 00:33:54,046
Well, I don't really draw.

524
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:58,529
I've never learned about drawing animation.

525
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,573
So this is my equivalent of his way of doing things.

526
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:06,476
And to not spend too much time on the tools

527
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:08,518
and on the engine, well, the idea

528
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:11,720
is just to keep everything to the minimum.

529
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,142
And it's a different method, but it's

530
00:34:14,423 --> 00:34:16,044
achieving the sort of same goal.

531
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:21,344
Anyway, when you're happy with the global field, your intention and your motion,

532
00:34:21,704 --> 00:34:25,491
that's when you're going to start to add a bit more details.

533
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,727
And this is kind of an obvious process,

534
00:34:29,787 --> 00:34:34,551
but I think that obvious reminders don't hurt sometimes.

535
00:34:35,331 --> 00:34:38,514
I know that I have a tendency to really get carried away

536
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:39,175
quite quickly.

537
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:43,578
So when I work, I need to be aware, constantly aware

538
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:46,240
of what I'm doing, so I can refrain myself

539
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,722
before I move on too quickly.

540
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:54,127
Now we're going to talk about the muscle flash.

541
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:58,404
So this is the muzzle flash on Designer 2,

542
00:34:58,884 --> 00:35:02,607
and this one is very much defined by the art direction

543
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,429
and by the narrative background.

544
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:08,252
It looks very sparkly because Designer 2 is not

545
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:09,393
set in modern times.

546
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:12,995
So what we've used as references is muskets.

547
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:20,341
and on those two still frames you can see the amount of smoke and sparks being produced when

548
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:28,608
you're shooting. Also the muzzle flash is like a really thin straight line coming out of the barrel.

549
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:33,232
And this is something where actually I couldn't really stick to the reference

550
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:40,120
because we've talked about it before, if it's too thin because it's aiming to the center of the screen

551
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,321
then there's nothing to see.

552
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:46,767
So in that case the sparks are much, much wider than the barrel.

553
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:53,294
And also, where we couldn't quite follow the reference

554
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:57,715
is that the smoke had to vanish more quickly and be

555
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:58,876
a lot more transparent.

556
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:01,436
Because again, it would just cover the whole screen,

557
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:04,657
and you don't really see your gameplay through it.

558
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:10,709
But then we've tried to stick to the reference

559
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:15,271
as far as flying residues are concerned.

560
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:17,731
So it makes it look very messy.

561
00:36:18,472 --> 00:36:24,133
And also, we used a lot of different sparks texture.

562
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:28,435
So the overall muzzle flash doesn't feel too regular.

563
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:31,056
So you see everything sort of comes around.

564
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:31,116
So.

565
00:36:34,331 --> 00:36:38,333
Okay, it's all very well, but you may be wondering what I'm talking about.

566
00:36:38,593 --> 00:36:43,356
We're going to get to gameplay, but I just thought it would be just an opportunity to

567
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:45,857
talk about and describe the image of Flash a little bit.

568
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,271
So anyway, gameplay-wise, this is what is happening.

569
00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:52,113
You are shooting straight and aiming

570
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:53,333
to the center of the screen.

571
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:58,095
But you are holding your gun on the left-hand side.

572
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:02,137
And even though the effects are attached to the gun,

573
00:37:02,257 --> 00:37:04,678
then you can't really keep the gun's alignment

574
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:07,039
because it would look like you're aiming

575
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:08,139
to the side of the screen.

576
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,762
So we have to change the values and shift them down and left

577
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:16,443
so they are going to appear like they are centered.

578
00:37:18,212 --> 00:37:20,354
And since we're cheating, we cannot just

579
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:23,376
use the gameplay metrics and be accurate,

580
00:37:23,436 --> 00:37:26,338
like you could do on an explosion radius, for instance.

581
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:30,642
So what was done in that case is everything

582
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:36,606
was adjusted manually using an overlay of the damage debug

583
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:40,389
volume and just checking for the accuracy to the effect

584
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:44,132
and making sure it matched the gameplay data.

585
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:48,764
Now, because I'm talking about debug,

586
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:51,365
I just really want to put a quick word

587
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:54,226
about the importance of console commands.

588
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:58,248
We have a lot of them in the Void Engine.

589
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:01,549
And at any time, I can find out exactly what

590
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:03,110
is going on behind the scene.

591
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,791
So to give you a few examples, I can

592
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,572
find the name of every of my particle system.

593
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:12,973
and of the container regardless of the way it was triggered.

594
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:16,954
I know how many instances there are of each of them,

595
00:38:17,414 --> 00:38:20,275
how they are being oriented, how much they cost.

596
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:26,036
If a collision occurs, I know the name of the instigator

597
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:27,516
and the name of the surface.

598
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:30,177
If I'm working on character effects,

599
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:32,958
I can make sure the AI stops reacting

600
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:35,138
so I can check all my attachments

601
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:37,539
and I can make sure that everything

602
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:38,699
is properly triggered.

603
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,323
So basically, if I encounter an issue,

604
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:46,405
I've got the tools to really strip down the scenario

605
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:50,707
and get to the bottom of it and just fix it, basically.

606
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:54,749
But I think this is not necessarily the game for everyone

607
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,411
in every studio and on every engine.

608
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:00,493
And it's a bit of a difficult topic

609
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:01,833
because it's all a matter of.

610
00:39:01,893 --> 00:39:03,935
resources if you don't have those.

611
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:08,877
But I think if you really have some needs, maybe you can try

612
00:39:08,977 --> 00:39:13,340
to get your coders to understand how that help is

613
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,380
really crucial for you.

614
00:39:15,141 --> 00:39:19,983
And if you can't really tug at the hard screens, maybe you

615
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:21,704
can just try being them sometimes.

616
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:23,585
Beer or cake makes the job.

617
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:24,606
It's worth a try.

618
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:36,368
Now we're going to finish this talk with the in-game slow-mo ability that I've touched upon before.

619
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:43,890
The players have the ability to slow down or stop the time in Dishonored 2.

620
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:50,455
And it's a specificity in our game that is a big deal on a number of levels and have

621
00:39:50,495 --> 00:39:53,618
several implications on the way we create our effects.

622
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:55,780
So you see what's happening here.

623
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,741
I'm stopping the time, then shooting.

624
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:05,048
at the guard and just moving a bit so I see what I'm doing

625
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:09,010
and then bringing back the time

626
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,911
and that's when he actually gets shot.

627
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:19,056
So this is a sort of a mine called the Spring Razor

628
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,278
and that is going to chop your enemy into bits.

629
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,400
And this one was made by Thibaut Guichard.

630
00:40:26,347 --> 00:40:28,369
And if I look at it at normal speed,

631
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:31,391
I can't really make much sense of what's going on.

632
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:33,433
It could be, you know, the effects

633
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:37,877
could be made based of blinking rings with a barbed wire

634
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:40,239
texture, and that would probably work.

635
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:48,647
But if you start to use that slow mobility, then you really get to see everything unfolding.

636
00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:52,970
You get to see how the base undulates and how everything grows.

637
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:59,135
So at that point, you don't want to see things popping out.

638
00:40:59,355 --> 00:41:04,779
And it would be looking very cheap if it was all choppy.

639
00:41:04,939 --> 00:41:06,760
So it has to be really smooth.

640
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,637
Now, yeah, I'm afraid a lot of guards

641
00:41:11,757 --> 00:41:14,299
were injured for the shooting of this presentation.

642
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,322
Well, that's their job.

643
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:22,004
So the upgrade for that power is that you can freeze the time.

644
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:24,946
And that means that the effects need

645
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:27,448
to look good when you start moving around them.

646
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:31,031
Because remember, if you pause the game

647
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:36,134
on a camera-facing effect, then everything looks terribly flat.

648
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:41,083
So there are different ways to organize your sprites in 3D.

649
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:43,224
Usually, velocity is being used.

650
00:41:43,944 --> 00:41:45,585
But I'll just take the opportunity

651
00:41:45,645 --> 00:41:51,528
to show you one way that we can do it in the Void engine.

652
00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:54,989
So I can specify some set of vectors

653
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:58,110
according to which my sprites are going to orient.

654
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:02,092
And it's not just some default x, y, z axis.

655
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:06,134
I can really tailor exactly what angle I want.

656
00:42:07,203 --> 00:42:11,265
So if I specify one set of vector,

657
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:12,705
then the second is the camera.

658
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:15,687
And the sprite is going to automatically

659
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,588
rotate to try and face the camera as much as possible.

660
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:24,031
If I set two sets of vector, then it

661
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:27,472
knows exactly where to point, and it remains static in space.

662
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:30,033
And so if I use that method.

663
00:42:31,684 --> 00:42:37,654
And just use a range of minus one to one on every sprite,

664
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:39,357
then I get a star shape in 3D.

665
00:42:40,997 --> 00:42:44,038
It's all very well, but there's potentially a problem with that,

666
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:47,220
because if you're really unlucky, and that can happen,

667
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,541
everything could look sideways, and then there's

668
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:51,722
nothing to see.

669
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:56,083
So to address that, there's a compromise to be made.

670
00:42:56,583 --> 00:43:00,785
And to be on the safe side, we double up our emitters.

671
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,387
So the white ones here are the ones which are static in space.

672
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,375
and what is building your effect.

673
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:14,739
But then you just add the red ones, which are camera facing,

674
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:18,122
and you keep the lowest spawn rate possible on this one

675
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:21,504
because they're just there to make sure that there's always

676
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:26,648
something to see, whichever angle you're looking at it from.

677
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:26,888
So.

678
00:43:28,587 --> 00:43:31,670
You're going to see them face and rotate a bit,

679
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,234
but at least you make sure you always have something to see.

680
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:40,377
Now, the best way of things to not look flat

681
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:42,799
is to not use flat elements.

682
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,644
So for instance, you can use beams and ribbons

683
00:43:47,964 --> 00:43:50,106
as other types of elements.

684
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:54,569
Now let's talk a bit about this ability, which

685
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:57,170
is a really good showcase of those.

686
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:01,452
What happens is that those two characters, they are connected.

687
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,173
What you do to one will happen to the other.

688
00:44:04,473 --> 00:44:08,555
So you can stun them, or burn them, or vaporize them,

689
00:44:08,635 --> 00:44:09,135
or anything.

690
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:11,756
This is going to propagate to the other character.

691
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:16,218
And I think this effect works really well.

692
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:19,119
And I can say so because my colleague, Vincent Rosier,

693
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:19,460
made it.

694
00:44:20,728 --> 00:44:25,772
I think there's something really satisfying about that stringy motion.

695
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:32,877
The line is going to expand and contract as the characters move around.

696
00:44:32,897 --> 00:44:39,361
I think in that respect it is very successful because it exploits the nature of the feature.

697
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:43,069
And then it just makes the meaning crystal clear.

698
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,832
You see the connection between those characters,

699
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:49,555
and even though one may die off screen,

700
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:52,837
then you connect them, you understand what's going on.

701
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,102
So another thing that you can use, obviously, is meshes.

702
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:01,445
Again, this is Vincent Rosier who made this one.

703
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:08,627
What's happening there is that you are summoning a swarm of rats,

704
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:11,308
and they're going to be able to attack your enemies.

705
00:45:11,868 --> 00:45:19,230
So the concentric circles are going to properly fill out the space,

706
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:23,291
because, you know, the mesh is their existing space, its actual volume.

707
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:29,853
And they also do a very good job at hiding the way the rats appear out of nowhere.

708
00:45:30,654 --> 00:45:36,636
And even in slow motion or when you pause and freeze the effect,

709
00:45:36,937 --> 00:45:40,638
everything works really well and it's all well integrated together.

710
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:47,801
And then on top of that, you have a lot of small specks of dust remaining at the end

711
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,003
and they're really scattered through the space.

712
00:45:51,063 --> 00:45:56,866
So as you move through them, you're going to feel them moving past the camera

713
00:45:56,966 --> 00:45:58,806
and it really gives you a sense of space.

714
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:05,465
Now, the last consequence of altering the time

715
00:46:05,945 --> 00:46:08,849
is that we need to add details to our effects.

716
00:46:09,771 --> 00:46:12,674
Because you want the ability to feel rewarding.

717
00:46:12,955 --> 00:46:14,857
So as you slow down the time, you

718
00:46:14,937 --> 00:46:17,561
want to see a bit more happening.

719
00:46:20,977 --> 00:46:25,620
So to sum it up, to make our effects work in that slow-mo mode,

720
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:28,062
first of all, we need to add layers of details.

721
00:46:28,883 --> 00:46:30,965
We need to have a very smooth animation

722
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:32,506
between the different states of the effect,

723
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:34,067
and we need to give them volume.

724
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:38,791
And that can be achieved by using sprites facing the camera

725
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:41,032
but properly distributed through space,

726
00:46:42,053 --> 00:46:45,556
or using sprites which are oriented in 3D space.

727
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:48,619
And finally, of course, you can use elements

728
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:52,122
which are made of actual volumes such as meshes and ribbons.

729
00:46:54,664 --> 00:46:57,867
So we just covered a few examples

730
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:01,050
of how the gameplay can influence

731
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,292
the way we make our effects, the way they look,

732
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:05,313
and the way we actually build them.

733
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:09,497
And what that tells us.

734
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:12,096
This is going to load eventually, yes.

735
00:47:12,736 --> 00:47:16,097
So what that tells us is that adaptation is not just

736
00:47:16,157 --> 00:47:19,119
about changing jobs, because that can happen

737
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:20,799
within a single production.

738
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:24,221
The specificities of certain features

739
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:28,723
might challenge the way that you used to work sometimes.

740
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:32,573
And yeah, we're done here.

741
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:34,374
So now we're going to take a minute

742
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,676
to enjoy a really entertaining play through of Dishonored.

743
00:47:38,716 --> 00:47:41,398
And you'll see what I was saying about the ways

744
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,899
the players are able to combine everything together.

745
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,780
And this one is going to have audio,

746
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,922
because during the rehearsals, our audio guys there

747
00:47:49,962 --> 00:47:53,063
were really disappointed that I had muted all the video.

748
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:56,505
So because they make our effects sound really cool,

749
00:47:56,565 --> 00:47:59,086
then yeah, I had to comply.

750
00:48:22,222 --> 00:48:24,643
That sounded like it.

751
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:44,229
Evolve!

752
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:45,690
Uh!

753
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:49,873
Oh!

754
00:48:50,173 --> 00:48:50,573
Hurry!

755
00:48:51,114 --> 00:48:51,254
Oh!

756
00:48:51,814 --> 00:49:00,700
I'm sorry.

757
00:49:19,534 --> 00:49:25,520
This must be Power's place.

758
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:32,707
The workers stopped digging, and the Duke will see that mine can produce here.

759
00:49:57,713 --> 00:49:57,953
What?

760
00:49:57,973 --> 00:50:18,273
You and I, we'll remember that night.

761
00:50:18,374 --> 00:50:20,175
It's annoying.

762
00:50:20,275 --> 00:50:21,917
Why did you do that?

763
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,790
The mines were a good job still didn't make sure it gave me

764
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,251
To stop this, I'm sorry.

765
00:50:42,772 --> 00:50:44,052
It's quite fascinating, isn't it?

766
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:48,034
Yeah, but I have to pause it because you won't

767
00:50:48,054 --> 00:50:49,055
listen to me otherwise.

768
00:50:50,075 --> 00:50:54,938
So anyway, just to recap, so first of all, we've been

769
00:50:54,978 --> 00:50:59,540
talking about how I had to adapt by transitioning between

770
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,362
combat effects on DMC to weapons effects on Dishonored 2.

771
00:51:04,386 --> 00:51:07,368
And then we've seen some features within Designer 2

772
00:51:07,728 --> 00:51:10,229
and how they sort of shaped and challenged the way

773
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,511
that I've had to create my effects.

774
00:51:12,991 --> 00:51:15,393
And this is all very personal and specific to my case.

775
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:19,435
But I think everyone from there can extrapolate and sort

776
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:21,456
of project their own situation.

777
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:22,337
Because.

778
00:51:23,097 --> 00:51:24,178
This is what games is about.

779
00:51:24,198 --> 00:51:25,960
It's all about adapting and evolving,

780
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,943
because there's always a next something, a next feature,

781
00:51:29,283 --> 00:51:32,106
your next game, your next engine release, your next console.

782
00:51:32,747 --> 00:51:36,991
So every time, you can take the opportunity

783
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:41,055
to stop and step back a bit and try

784
00:51:41,095 --> 00:51:42,496
to put things into perspective.

785
00:51:43,057 --> 00:51:47,519
so that over time you can build upon your previous knowledge.

786
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,062
You've got that existing base and then you can just dig into it

787
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:53,963
and try and grow to the next level.

788
00:51:54,604 --> 00:51:56,385
So as you keep your practice evolving,

789
00:51:56,625 --> 00:52:00,487
then normally every time everything should get a little bit better.

790
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:04,986
And now, if you fancy a transition yourself,

791
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,328
well, Arcane Studios is hiring.

792
00:52:07,468 --> 00:52:10,731
So you've got the email address, and you

793
00:52:10,751 --> 00:52:13,694
can check what positions are open at the moment.

794
00:52:18,943 --> 00:52:22,525
I just quickly want to thank everyone here for coming,

795
00:52:22,845 --> 00:52:25,327
and thank Ninja Theory for allowing

796
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:28,669
me to show all this material, and everyone I've ever

797
00:52:28,689 --> 00:52:31,410
worked on, because it's so important.

798
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,692
It's a team job, and without the rest of the people,

799
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:37,014
you just, you know, you're no one.

800
00:52:37,674 --> 00:52:39,695
So yeah, thanks, everyone.

801
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,380
So now it's going to be time for questions,

802
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,121
and I've got to remind you to please fill out

803
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:54,783
the form after you're done.

804
00:52:56,123 --> 00:52:57,524
So are there any questions?

805
00:53:00,726 --> 00:53:00,927
Well?

806
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:02,888
Oh, yeah.

807
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:07,471
Near the beginning, there was the first person muzzle flash

808
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:10,493
that was like 16 meters in length.

809
00:53:11,053 --> 00:53:14,515
How did you allow the player to, how did you reconcile that

810
00:53:14,575 --> 00:53:16,377
with them being able to see that from the side

811
00:53:17,257 --> 00:53:18,138
if they stopped time?

812
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:22,413
Well, actually, so the question is how.

813
00:53:26,592 --> 00:53:30,813
OK, so it is not actually 16 meters long in the game.

814
00:53:31,013 --> 00:53:34,633
I just made it much bigger just to prove a point there.

815
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:35,774
But it is quite long.

816
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,115
And especially when you stop the time,

817
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:41,875
you can actually see them in the game.

818
00:53:42,295 --> 00:53:45,096
You can see them and they're probably like, I don't know,

819
00:53:45,376 --> 00:53:46,476
three meters long or something.

820
00:53:47,696 --> 00:53:49,217
But that's not really a problem.

821
00:53:49,237 --> 00:53:52,518
Actually, sometimes it's quite satisfying to move through it.

822
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:56,238
And people really accept that and actually enjoy it.

823
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:01,886
So you do see how exaggerated it is as you move around it.

824
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,047
Thank you.

825
00:54:07,032 --> 00:54:09,516
Okay, well, looks like we're done. Thank you very much.
