1
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:08,641
My name is Dave Grossman, I will be your host this morning.

2
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:14,185
This is my trophy wall with which I shamelessly hope

3
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:17,387
to coerce you into trusting me

4
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:20,270
as an authority on the subject matter here.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,792
I've been designing and writing and directing

6
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,656
story games of various types for about 30 years,

7
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:29,897
starting in the upper left there.

8
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,598
This is a laser and sort of point.

9
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:35,582
With the secret of Monkey Island at the sort some day to

10
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,283
the tentacle. Depending on how old you are a bit of an old

11
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:41,603
crowd you may or may not have have grown up with a

12
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:42,944
pajamas Sam.

13
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:47,765
And then there was a there's a large section here that

14
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:49,905
represents like my tenure telltale games.

15
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:51,405
May rest in peace.

16
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:55,726
Where I was directing the design and writing there for about

17
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:58,246
a decade and then down the lower right hand corner.

18
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:01,887
You see some stuff you may not have heard of before represents.

19
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,279
My more recent work, it's their audio games.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,801
Five years ago, I became one of the founders of Earplay,

21
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:10,461
which is a platform for making stories

22
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,982
that you play with your voice.

23
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:15,523
They use voice control and are audio only.

24
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:17,804
We did this first on mobile phones,

25
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,865
but then other platforms started to come along.

26
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:25,366
There were voice assistants, Alexa and Google Assistant,

27
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:28,047
and then more recently, Bose made these glasses frames

28
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,888
that have some interesting hardware in it,

29
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:31,108
and we expanded to support.

30
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:32,804
All of these platforms.

31
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:36,066
And in this talk, I'm going to mostly talk about the voice assistants, but the lessons

32
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:37,407
apply pretty broadly.

33
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,669
We've done quite a few of these things now, actually a lot more than this.

34
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:46,652
The engine handles all kinds of stuff, but they are mostly kind of branchy choice-based

35
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,853
things in sort of a telltale games model.

36
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:53,028
And there's some specific reasons why we like to do it that way I'll get to in a minute.

37
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:57,731
They tend to be kind of big compared to other skills that tell you the weather or whatever

38
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:58,952
that just you kind of in and out.

39
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:02,534
Ours you may play for an hour or two hours, three hours some of them.

40
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:08,418
It's still though not uncommon for them to be designed and written and sometimes implemented

41
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,139
by a single person.

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,243
And so I want to give you a window into what that process looks like from the ground up.

43
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:21,148
Let's talk about what we normally do, how we normally do it, and then what happens when

44
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:22,449
we break our own rules.

45
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:30,231
So this will be kind of a rambling cautionary slash inspirational tale, and hopefully we'll

46
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,391
have some useful nuggets in it for you.

47
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,812
I'm going to talk about the technology a little bit.

48
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:36,372
I'm going to get into language models quite a lot.

49
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:42,494
I'm going to talk about user experience design and touch a little bit on the writing, some

50
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:43,814
tips there for doing stuff.

51
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:48,722
These are kind of the things I think of as the core of narrative design,

52
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:54,203
and I think of a narrative designer as being probably the most appropriate person to do this by themselves

53
00:02:54,263 --> 00:02:56,224
if they were going to do that. So just show of hands,

54
00:02:56,284 --> 00:03:01,805
who in the audience self-identifies as a narrative designer in some way or wants to be?

55
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:03,606
Good, good. You're the right crowd then.

56
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:08,327
And how many have actually tried to do this, tried to make a voice skill or a voice app or anything?

57
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,227
Not many. Okay.

58
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,048
But some. So that's good.

59
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,408
Good on you for giving it a shot.

60
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:18,840
It occurred to me last week that this talk is kind of a travelogue.

61
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:23,563
So let's learn about the country that we'll be visiting, which is the country of voice.

62
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:26,444
It has some peculiar characteristics that other countries don't have.

63
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:30,907
For one thing, your input to one of these stories is intermittent.

64
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:34,268
The story is not listening to the player all the time.

65
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:36,938
It can't, it's not allowed to for legal reasons,

66
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:37,819
privacy reasons.

67
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,939
You as the developer are not permitted

68
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,940
to just open up the microphone and listen all the time.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,981
So turn-taking has to happen.

70
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,742
And it's super important for the audience

71
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:47,383
to know when it is their turn to talk.

72
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:50,704
So for that, we use very explicit prompts.

73
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:53,545
And you could use a sound effect or a bell

74
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:54,265
or something like that,

75
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:56,807
but we like to stay in fantasy with everything if we can.

76
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:59,328
So the way we do it is we just have a character

77
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:02,489
ask the player a direct question at some point in the story.

78
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,490
And then you, the player, are expected to answer that question.

79
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,651
That's how we let you know, okay, it's your turn.

80
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,992
There's a writing corollary to that,

81
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,813
which is that that is the only time that anybody asks anybody

82
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:16,654
a direct question in one of our stories.

83
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:21,496
And having to write a whole couple of hours worth of audio

84
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:24,597
in which the characters do not ask each other direct questions

85
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:26,818
and never speak in rhetorical questions

86
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:30,519
strikes writers as strange and uncomfortable at first.

87
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:33,007
It's not, though, as hard as it sounds.

88
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:33,627
You get used to it.

89
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:38,828
Second characteristic is you must make your decisions

90
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,069
quickly in these stories.

91
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:43,930
Alexa, for example, gives you 10 seconds to talk,

92
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,610
and then it'll shut the microphone off

93
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,071
if you haven't started saying something.

94
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:49,631
It'll repeat the question one time,

95
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:51,452
and then it'll shut the skill down entirely.

96
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:54,233
So you have to be able to make that decision quickly.

97
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:57,674
This is mostly also about not leaving the microphone

98
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,234
open for privacy reasons.

99
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:03,170
So for that, we just make sure that when it is your turn

100
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,533
to make a decision, your options there are clear, simple,

101
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:08,455
and they are few in number,

102
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,898
and we enumerate them for you right then and there.

103
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,660
And so that dictates the nature

104
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,622
of how you would write that prompt.

105
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,925
It's sort of a quick summation of your options

106
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:19,966
at that point in the story.

107
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:24,973
Thing three, voice recognition is really cool,

108
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,973
but it is not magic, amazingly, it's technology.

109
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:31,954
So with someone who is mumbling,

110
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:34,215
or turning away from the microphone,

111
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:35,755
or maybe standing in a kitchen

112
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:37,415
where dinner is actively being prepared,

113
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:38,736
the sound can get kind of muddy.

114
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:41,236
And if you give the voice recognition muddy sound,

115
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,117
it has a much harder time doing its job.

116
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,297
It's easy for it to get confused.

117
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,277
So we try to make it easier

118
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:48,738
on the voice recognition itself by.

119
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:54,678
making its decisions easier, and we make the things that it is listening for also clearly

120
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,400
distinct and few in number.

121
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,544
So we offer the player clear options, but we also offer them specific ways to say what

122
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:05,307
they want, and we carefully manage those phrases, again, part of the writing of these things,

123
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:10,312
so that they do not sound similar to one another, and all of that makes it easier for the voice

124
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:15,236
recognition to do its job under difficult circumstances, which difficult circumstances

125
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,537
are more common than you might think.

126
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:21,796
These prompts tend to get a little awkward,

127
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,938
and they sound stilted, and they stick out.

128
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:26,019
But actually, that's good, because it makes

129
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,621
them work better as prompts.

130
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:29,082
You sort of sit up and take notice

131
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:30,443
because somebody's talking funny at you,

132
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:32,825
and you go, oh, it must be my turn again.

133
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:35,527
So we will actually often go so far

134
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,288
as to capitalize while we're writing

135
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,851
the key phrases in the prompt to get the voice actors to hit

136
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:44,333
them harder and sound even more stilted and authoritative,

137
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:46,035
so that then you're.

138
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,790
Again, you're sort of reminded, hey, it must be my turn.

139
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,351
Realism is not our primary concern here.

140
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,211
It's functionality.

141
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:57,653
So putting all that together, we wind up

142
00:06:57,673 --> 00:07:00,034
with this model where the stories are turn-based,

143
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,234
and they're structured so that we

144
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:07,296
can focus all your options on a single moment at any time.

145
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:09,017
And then those moments are embodied

146
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,618
in these prompt questions of two or three distinct actions

147
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:13,738
that sound quite different from one another.

148
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:16,402
That's the usual model.

149
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:18,022
And these are good rules.

150
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:19,382
However, if we followed them all the time,

151
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:20,323
this talk would be less fun.

152
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:24,663
So last year, Amazon Studios got in touch

153
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,944
and they asked us if we wanted to do a story

154
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:31,905
on Alexa and exclusive next to this new show

155
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:33,345
that they were making, this Jack Ryan show,

156
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:34,425
which sounded kind of cool.

157
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:37,266
So we said, all right, we're in.

158
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:39,346
We live for that stuff.

159
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,107
So we delved a little deeper with them

160
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,027
and the inspiration for what they wanted to do.

161
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:48,845
was this escape room that they had also commissioned as a promotional effort for the show and they

162
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:54,469
had run, they built it and they ran some teams of influencers through it and they did a Twitch

163
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:58,431
stream of that and it was, I watched it, it was pretty fun and everybody had a good time.

164
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:03,455
And one of the peculiar aspects of this escape room was that Alexa was built into it.

165
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:08,278
There was a device in every room and it sort of became part of the puzzles and so on.

166
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:12,982
And their idea was they just had such a good time with the escape room, they wanted to

167
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,203
bring that feeling.

168
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:19,136
to a Jack Ryan story on Alexa that you could then experience in your own home.

169
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:23,897
So what that meant was we were doing an adaptation of something that was already a kind of a

170
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:28,279
loose adaptation of a TV show that we hadn't seen and we hadn't read.

171
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:30,679
That's okay.

172
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,340
That's just what the job's like.

173
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,382
More on difficulties getting to see the show a little later in the talk, but for now, we

174
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:43,044
wanted to make this story feel like an escape room and central to that feeling is this idea

175
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:43,864
of exploration.

176
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:44,244
You want to...

177
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,308
So, instead of asking those very pointed questions, the nice prompts of, uh,

178
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:11,973
Here are your three options.

179
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:14,815
We would ask the much more general question, OK,

180
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:15,736
what do you want to do next?

181
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:17,016
Tell us anything.

182
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:22,019
So we were already getting ourselves into trouble,

183
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,840
we knew at this point.

184
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,862
And the problem was something that we were already

185
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:28,463
aware of from the days when adventure games allowed

186
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:31,985
you to type in your input at the keyboard

187
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,628
using the English language.

188
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:41,005
And the problem is that there's a huge difference between what you can express with your input

189
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:45,028
mechanism, and in both cases here, the English language, capable of expressing just about

190
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:49,311
any thought you can have, and the stuff that's actually addressable by the game, which is

191
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:53,775
some tiny subset of that, because the game is made by human beings and in a finite amount

192
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:54,115
of time.

193
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:55,476
You just can't cover all that space.

194
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,753
So, all this blue space here in the middle is frustration.

195
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,756
The audience gets really frustrated with this stuff because we're not just allowing them,

196
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:08,258
we're actually encouraging them to try things, they're doomed to failure.

197
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,880
Which is not a very friendly thing to do for your audience.

198
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:14,163
Notice this is a problem with voice control in general,

199
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:19,086
this sort of unfettered freedom of speech is the fourth characteristic of the medium.

200
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:23,109
That, by the way, is the Constitution of the United States, freedom of speech, get it?

201
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:30,765
So we've been avoiding this problem up till now because we've been using these clear options with specific phrasing and that

202
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:36,150
clarifies the addressable space moment by moment for the player, one of the reasons why we do it.

203
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:42,396
So we realized that open structure or no, we still needed to clarify a

204
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:45,378
useful range of actions for the player. And these are the ones we picked.

205
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:50,423
They're basically what you would find in an adventure game of the point-and-click variety.

206
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:55,152
And they're solving the same problem that they do in those old adventure games.

207
00:10:55,592 --> 00:11:00,974
So the idea was at any time a player would be able to do any one of these nine things

208
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:06,896
and there would be a list of about 50 targets in the game, people and objects and stuff

209
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:09,217
that you would be able to do these things to.

210
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:20,801
So the ramifications of that bring us to the next step in our awesome travel.

211
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,327
Let's talk about language for a second.

212
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:28,789
So, how many in the room know, when I'm talking about voice recognition,

213
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:30,270
what I mean by the phrase language model?

214
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,731
Anybody encountered that?

215
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,392
Okay, not too many, so we'll explain.

216
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,913
So, this is actually kind of a big focus of the talk,

217
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:39,775
because it's totally unique to voice recognition mediums.

218
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:42,638
And even if you aren't the one putting it together,

219
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:43,478
it will affect your life.

220
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:44,639
It affects everyone's life.

221
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,282
So the idea is there is this voodoo black box that

222
00:11:48,322 --> 00:11:50,484
exists between the player and the story.

223
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:52,226
And when you're playing one of these things,

224
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:55,548
you say something, and then that thing that you have said

225
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:58,071
gets digitized into a waveform.

226
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:01,593
And it gets sent off over the internet to Amazon or Google

227
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,815
or whoever it is that's doing your voice recognition.

228
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,718
And then what you get back from that is two things.

229
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:07,478
You get an utterance.

230
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,723
which is its best guess at the actual words that got said.

231
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:13,123
And then you get what's called an intent,

232
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:14,483
which is the important thing for you.

233
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,344
It's a tokenized meaning.

234
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:20,645
So it's, and you help define this.

235
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:24,945
It's basically in the space that you need it to be in

236
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:27,546
for your particular skill.

237
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,486
And you need it distilled down like this

238
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:30,306
to make your life possible.

239
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:31,407
You don't want to be messing around

240
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,807
with processing the natural language.

241
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:35,347
That's an AI hard problem.

242
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,588
Leave it to the professionals.

243
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:37,668
Don't try and do it.

244
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,611
But you do have to help this black box out a little bit

245
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,391
because it's not magic, it's technology.

246
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:46,992
And what you do is you provide it some sample phrases

247
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,293
and you group them into intents

248
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:53,234
and label them according to your own intent names.

249
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,615
A sort of a rough guide for the black box

250
00:12:58,315 --> 00:13:00,775
for how it's gonna interpret meaning in your story.

251
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,276
So this example is actually is all about

252
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,836
just wanting to know what the temperature is outside.

253
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:09,136
There, I've given it some phrases here

254
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,296
that address different things.

255
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:12,817
There's one that doesn't mention the hot or cold at all.

256
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:13,897
It's just about wearing a coat.

257
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:17,599
Notice that I will get now into a little parser problem

258
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:18,239
of my own here.

259
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,659
There's no way I'm gonna be able to enumerate

260
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,600
every possible way in the English language

261
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,701
that you can say something that indicates an interest

262
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,522
in what the temperature is outside.

263
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:31,343
Fortunately, Alexa.

264
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:34,523
When you send this off to build the language model,

265
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:37,263
we'll happily expand on the examples.

266
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:41,444
That's good. It does it invisibly, which is less good.

267
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:43,264
So you sort of don't know what's going on there.

268
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:46,905
So the good news is it will recognize things

269
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,365
that you didn't think of, which is great.

270
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,146
The bad news is it will recognize things

271
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:52,386
that you didn't think of,

272
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:54,486
and so you'll get some false positives in there,

273
00:13:55,246 --> 00:13:57,387
which is another reason why we try to be very specific

274
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,387
about what our users should say.

275
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:02,497
So coming back to this Jack Ryan thing,

276
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:05,599
now we've got these nine actions and about 50 objects.

277
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,202
You multiply those together, it's about 450 intents.

278
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,824
We tend to have a lot of intents in our skills,

279
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,266
maybe 100 or so, but this is already

280
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:15,687
on the way to crazy town.

281
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:20,210
Fortunately, there is a feature that's supported

282
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,493
by a lot of these things that you can use

283
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,694
to ameliorate that.

284
00:14:25,577 --> 00:14:28,018
Amazon calls it slots, we call it entities internally.

285
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:31,459
The basic idea is that it's gonna allow the machines

286
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,780
to do more of the heavy lifting around all those intents

287
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,560
and then nine times 50.

288
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:39,222
So the way it works is instead of having a separate intent

289
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,723
for examining the drawer and examining the cabinet,

290
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:45,784
examining the padlock and specifying those all individually,

291
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:48,125
you just have one way of saying,

292
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:49,506
okay, I want to examine a thing.

293
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:51,527
So that utterance, that thing will have a.

294
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,942
examine the object, look at the object, and different ways that you might phrase that,

295
00:14:56,823 --> 00:15:01,728
but you leave a placeholder in for the object, and then elsewhere, you define that list of

296
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:06,273
what can go in there, and that's your 50 objects, and each of those can have its own little

297
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:08,555
set of utterances that define it.

298
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:11,939
And then the computer does all the hard work of meshing those together.

299
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,882
And then when you use it, what you get back

300
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:17,705
is both the name of the intent, I want to examine something,

301
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:19,787
and also the target of that intent,

302
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,048
I want to examine the desk.

303
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:25,233
So that takes your 9 times 50 and makes it into 9 plus 50,

304
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:25,893
which is much more.

305
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:33,533
Now, we hadn't used this much, so I built a little test case prototype out of the first

306
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:39,197
scene and I threw some inputs at it that were designed to be as confusing as possible.

307
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:43,259
I had some utterances in there that differed only by one syllable and meant different things.

308
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,462
I swapped words around, intended for it to still recognize that.

309
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:50,724
I used switch as both a verb and an object.

310
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,179
It did really well.

311
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,921
None of that stuff confused it, actually.

312
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:56,542
I was very impressed.

313
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,804
Context helps it to get the right idea from these things.

314
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:01,986
So eventually we would get into trouble

315
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:04,107
with some of the built-in slot types that they have,

316
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:05,989
but that's later in the talk.

317
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:08,611
For now, I'll just give the general advice

318
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,632
that whether or not you're expecting that language model

319
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:13,674
to be problematic, you should test it as early as you can

320
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:14,615
because it will come up.

321
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:17,937
And again, don't forget about real-world situations.

322
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:20,019
If your office is, like, a nice, quiet place...

323
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:22,585
Try confusing the thing some way.

324
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:24,367
Challenge it.

325
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,352
So now that I've got my technical proof of concept,

326
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:34,254
I started thinking about breaking down the actual story

327
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:37,796
in our amazing travelogue paradigm.

328
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,097
I'm going to call it itinerary.

329
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:41,499
Now the source material.

330
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:44,255
It's an escape room, it's more premise than story.

331
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:46,517
And the idea was you were CIA agents

332
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:48,699
and you were in the safe house run by the CIA

333
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:51,781
and for some reason it had these Echo devices all over it.

334
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:53,662
You started in a small room

335
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,644
and then you broke your way into a big room

336
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:56,785
for reasons that were not clear.

337
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:00,188
Then your handler calls you on the phone and says,

338
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,869
you got to find this MacGuffin that looks like this.

339
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,551
So you solve some crazy puzzles.

340
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:06,773
And then you find the MacGuffin

341
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,454
and then your handler immediately tells you,

342
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:09,615
you got to find another one.

343
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:11,676
So you solve some more puzzles.

344
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:14,359
And then a cool thing happens.

345
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,240
Your handler, Foxtrot is her name,

346
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:19,083
shows up in person and she takes the things from you

347
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,984
that you found and then she kidnaps

348
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:23,466
one of the people on the team and takes them away.

349
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:25,548
That's cool.

350
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:28,531
Then everybody gets thrown into a death trap

351
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:31,853
and then they escape and then that's pretty much it.

352
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:33,515
There's no ending to this story.

353
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:36,097
You don't find out what happens to your handler

354
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,698
or the stuff she's stolen or anything.

355
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:44,598
Typical of escape rooms, there's a lot of ludonarrative dissonance in this thing.

356
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:47,719
There are a lot of puzzles that are built using thematically appropriate elements,

357
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:50,661
but which, once you get them into puzzles and think about them,

358
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:53,642
they don't really make much sense in terms of either story or character.

359
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:55,844
This bothers us. We're a story studio.

360
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:57,604
We want to do a little more than that.

361
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,325
So most of that stuff got thrown out.

362
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,588
In an adaptation, you want to keep whatever works and is strong.

363
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:06,229
For us, this betrayal thing was the coolest bit.

364
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,863
So we made that the middle of the story and now it has some buildup and some consequences.

365
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:15,385
We've decided we'd have the team dynamic rise and fall a little bit.

366
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:21,308
There was a test of the kind of cohesiveness of the team after that moment of betrayal.

367
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:26,491
After you discover that there is a mole on your team, there's some sort of infighting,

368
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:30,133
and you're asked to take sides in it. It's all good stuff.

369
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:33,755
And then way down at the end we added you get to try and catch the bad guy,

370
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:35,376
which seemed important somehow.

371
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:39,408
Notice that most of this is now about the team and the people in the team.

372
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:42,010
It's always a good thing for a story is to have people in the middle of it.

373
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:46,553
Back to this idea of itinerary for a second on a trip.

374
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:50,435
You want to go to some different places at your destination.

375
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:53,017
You have different things to see and different things to eat.

376
00:18:53,597 --> 00:18:56,979
You go to Spain, you go to Barcelona, and you go to Granada,

377
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,460
and they're very different from each other, and that's good.

378
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,421
You want some variety.

379
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:04,124
Similarly, in your story, you want a little variety in tone and in tension.

380
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:11,381
So when I get to the next step, which always for me is to do a broad outline of the whole thing, 10,000 feet, just looking down,

381
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:19,644
I decided this time to give each chapter an inspirational tag, just one word about what it should feel like to be in that chapter

382
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:27,487
as a guide for making the pieces different in terms of what was the player activity in there and where the tension comes from.

383
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:32,248
Escape rooms typically use the giant timer on the wall ticking down an hour.

384
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:40,128
As their main tension generator, we kept being pressured on this project to include them literally.

385
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:42,849
People were like, well, okay, sounds great, but where's the timer?

386
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:45,349
We thought we could do a little better than just having a number.

387
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,550
Stories are good at tension, and so are games.

388
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:53,512
So let me get a little bit into the breakdown of the different chapters.

389
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:57,773
The first one had to be both the hook and the tutorial for the experience.

390
00:19:57,973 --> 00:20:01,594
So it needed to be simple, and it needed to be short, and it needed to be fast-paced.

391
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:03,740
And it needed to be exciting.

392
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,741
So we decided to chuck the timer in that scene

393
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:09,961
and replace it with something you can't really

394
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:12,662
use in an actual physical escape room, which is a death trap.

395
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,083
We had a room that was filling up

396
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:15,923
with water and a character who was in that water,

397
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,505
giving you very frequent updates on how she was about to drown.

398
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,485
And you were basically talking to her on the phone

399
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:25,706
and trying to talk her through a puzzle that

400
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,227
was going to get her out.

401
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:29,927
And so the water is getting higher and higher,

402
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:31,288
and time is running out.

403
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:33,731
You can actually fail this scene,

404
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,772
and she will pretend to drown.

405
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:39,395
We want you to worry about the threats that we're making

406
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,696
and take them seriously, both as a player

407
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:43,558
and as a person invested in the story.

408
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:46,600
So it's common for us to put something in at the beginning

409
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,741
that you can fail and kind of have to start over

410
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,003
before you've invested too much time.

411
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,686
We refrain from actual death in this scene.

412
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:56,507
It's a little too early, narratively speaking,

413
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:57,448
to be killing somebody off.

414
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:59,529
So this is actually, it's a training exercise.

415
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,953
And they're all kind of just pretending to do their parts,

416
00:21:02,013 --> 00:21:03,354
but you can fail it.

417
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:05,476
And you have to start over and do the scene over again

418
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:06,436
until you get it right.

419
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:09,138
We also, at this point, introduced

420
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:11,079
the idea of this bad guy, Kessel,

421
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:14,522
who was the architect of the original version of that trap

422
00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:16,023
that you're essentially training on.

423
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:22,808
He's a terrorist guy who, not the guns and bombs authority,

424
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,649
but he's the guy who moves money around

425
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:25,990
for all the other terrorists.

426
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:32,577
Smart guy, you know, likes to challenge himself against you,

427
00:21:32,637 --> 00:21:34,518
the allegedly intelligent CIA agents,

428
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:36,259
by trying to catch you in traps.

429
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,981
And also, he's the kind of person who,

430
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:40,443
when he leaves his Wi-Fi password around on a post-it,

431
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:43,465
he'll do it in code in some way that only makes sense to him

432
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:45,787
and that you will have to sort of puzzle out.

433
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:49,090
This obviously is just a way to ground

434
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,492
all of the crazy escape room kinds of things

435
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:53,694
you were going to do in the story.

436
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:55,675
We wanted them to at least have an excuse

437
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:56,676
for why they were there.

438
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:57,356
And so...

439
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,843
Most of the story takes place essentially at his house,

440
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:02,024
which is a crazy place.

441
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,366
His name, by the way, was very poorly chosen.

442
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:05,487
That'll come later.

443
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:06,228
I'll explain why.

444
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,530
So in the second chapter, you and your team get together

445
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,491
and you go to Berlin.

446
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:12,233
You go to his headquarters.

447
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,475
He has several, but this one has just been discovered

448
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:17,037
by your compatriots.

449
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:17,977
And you're there.

450
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:20,319
You're doing exploration and puzzle solving.

451
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,081
This is the part of the story that feels

452
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,502
the most like an escape room.

453
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,365
There's codes and things like that.

454
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:29,846
You're discovering the secrets of the place.

455
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:32,027
The difference between this, I think,

456
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:33,369
and a regular escape room is that

457
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,890
you're more of a safe cracker

458
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:37,632
and it's all about breaking into things

459
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,093
rather than breaking out of anything.

460
00:22:39,273 --> 00:22:41,795
You're trying to get in under secrets.

461
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,377
It didn't make much sense to put a timer on this scene at all,

462
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:46,819
so instead what we did was we put some traps,

463
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:47,960
booby traps in the room,

464
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,082
and sort of made a lot of noise about those,

465
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:52,644
and we set one off pretty early in the scene

466
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,965
so that you would take that seriously.

467
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:58,481
And then they find out that there's a mole on the team

468
00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:00,503
and get worried about that.

469
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:02,766
And they start sniping at each other.

470
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:06,231
And also at that point, you find another small room,

471
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,555
which is where these people keep all their records.

472
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,878
And so the player activity changes here.

473
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:12,979
It becomes more informational.

474
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,341
looking through files and finding stuff in photographs and combining things, listening

475
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:23,483
to audio recordings, all gathering evidence with this idea that you're going to find out

476
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:29,405
who the mole is and it becomes increasingly likely that it's somebody on your direct team.

477
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:34,267
You find evidence pointing to both of the people who are physically with you in the

478
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:37,748
room and they start getting upset with each other about this and they ask you to take

479
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:40,949
sides and that's where most of the tension comes from in this scene.

480
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:43,897
Again, there's no timer on that scene.

481
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:48,119
Then Foxtrot, the handler, who has been off-site until now,

482
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:50,821
shows up and betrays everybody and knocks them all out.

483
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:54,843
And then you wake up and you're in an actual death trap,

484
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,584
and it has an actual timer, finally.

485
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:58,545
But we attached it to a bomb just

486
00:23:58,585 --> 00:23:59,705
to add a little extra oomph.

487
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:00,726
Again, something you probably don't

488
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:02,167
want to do in a real escape room.

489
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:04,168
But we're not in a real escape room.

490
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:09,846
And what the player does in this scene is a little bit adventure gamey.

491
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,569
You put together a thumbprint kit out of stuff that you find in the room.

492
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:16,872
You go around, you're just trying to find the right thumbprint that'll let you unlock

493
00:24:16,892 --> 00:24:19,594
this phone that's going to let you stop this bomb before it blows you up.

494
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:24,458
Also, one of the team members is missing now, and you're not sure if he's in league with

495
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:25,219
the mole or what.

496
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,140
You don't know why he's gone.

497
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,462
You don't think about that too much right away because there's a bomb ticking down.

498
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:30,543
But as soon as you...

499
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:32,307
the

500
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:33,828
practical and emotional reasons to do that.

501
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:36,610
For one, you're still not really sure if he's on your side or not.

502
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:06,892
But also practically speaking, Foxtrot is now getting away with the things that you spent time finding.

503
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:12,378
And you have to make a call as to whether you want to spend the time to try and get him out of there and take him with you.

504
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:15,060
It's kind of a... either way, it makes sense.

505
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:19,945
The trap turns out to have some twists, so that your original solutions don't quite work.

506
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:22,728
Makes it sort of a trap revisit.

507
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:28,052
and both of these things also they have time limits on them so you can fail them.

508
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:32,634
If you fail the bomb, again, no one is killed by that, but it does destroy all of the evidence

509
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:36,175
that you were hoping to take home, so you'll take it on the chin from your supervisor if

510
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:36,815
you let it go off.

511
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:42,377
And if you let the water trap fill up all the way, then the guy in it does die, and

512
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,278
you will also take it on the chin from your supervisor for that.

513
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,119
He doesn't like it when you fail stuff.

514
00:25:47,984 --> 00:25:53,689
The final chapter is more of a chase and Foxtrot is getting away on an airplane and you find

515
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:56,311
her car and you're kind of sifting through it.

516
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:59,274
The puzzles are informational again, but on a timer this time.

517
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:03,658
And you're just trying to find out where she's going, what flight she's going to be on, what

518
00:26:03,698 --> 00:26:07,401
name she's going to be traveling under so that you can locate her and stop her.

519
00:26:07,962 --> 00:26:12,166
And since there is a limited amount of time before the flight takes off, you can fail

520
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:12,826
this scene too.

521
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:13,967
It doesn't...

522
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,449
Ruin everything, but it does mean that you don't catch her.

523
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:20,372
And this guy gives you a hard time about it.

524
00:26:21,092 --> 00:26:23,074
He does your performance review at the end.

525
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,516
I think there's about nine or 10 different ones

526
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:27,337
that you can get depending on what you have screwed up

527
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:27,898
and what you haven't.

528
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,460
So this is a guy from the show.

529
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,221
It's James Greer.

530
00:26:31,261 --> 00:26:34,483
He's the director of the whole TFAD operation.

531
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:36,265
Speaking of the show, by the way,

532
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:38,827
we haven't seen it yet by this point in the process.

533
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:39,728
We've gone pretty far.

534
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:40,448
Stay tuned.

535
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:44,928
So next step after that outline, we always do,

536
00:26:45,108 --> 00:26:45,928
is a detailed design.

537
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:47,669
And the idea there is we're going

538
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,190
to break it down into what all of the individual interactions

539
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,311
are going to be in the whole piece.

540
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:54,252
And that's normally, for us, is about engineering

541
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:56,993
a lot of these moments of discrete choice.

542
00:26:57,753 --> 00:26:59,334
For this project, we're talking about what

543
00:26:59,374 --> 00:27:01,054
are the objects in the chapter, what

544
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:02,855
happens when you interact with them,

545
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,496
how does that drive the drama in the story,

546
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:08,177
and how does it resolve.

547
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:10,224
It's basically adventure game design,

548
00:27:10,444 --> 00:27:11,805
which I fortunately know a lot about.

549
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,967
I usually work out the dynamics using traditional methods.

550
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,050
And adventure game design is kind of a different talk

551
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,913
entirely, one which I would need another hour

552
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:25,854
or three to cover.

553
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:28,136
So I can't really do it justice here.

554
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:29,957
So instead, let's talk about what happens

555
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:33,759
when you do do adventure game design on an audio platform.

556
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,541
There's one thing in particular that comes up here

557
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:37,622
that doesn't come up elsewhere.

558
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,961
It has to do with memory.

559
00:27:39,981 --> 00:27:45,684
Now normally, in a game when you need to interact with a whole bunch of stuff, you have a handy

560
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:49,646
persistent visual like this to remind you of what all that stuff is.

561
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:52,088
There's a lot of things to remember.

562
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:55,810
But on an audio platform, you've got nothing.

563
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,212
And we run very quickly up against the limits of human short-term memory.

564
00:28:00,252 --> 00:28:00,592
And let's...

565
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:01,953
Don't take my word for it.

566
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:02,394
Let's try it.

567
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:08,458
So imagine you're playing my game now, and you're standing outside the lair of a known terrorist,

568
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:12,121
and you speak a code phrase to get in, and the door opens.

569
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:15,664
You go in and one of the guys on your team starts describing the room to you,

570
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:17,886
and he says, oh, there's a desk here.

571
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,768
It's kind of a cool-looking old antique one.

572
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:22,130
I think probably bought at auction.

573
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:26,615
There's some old rusty old lockers, kind of very industrial,

574
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:27,936
bolted to the wall over there.

575
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,197
They don't really match anything in here.

576
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:31,464
There's a nice looking map on the wall.

577
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,025
It's framed and the frame has hinges.

578
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:34,785
It's very interesting.

579
00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:38,067
Right next to that, there's a cheap poster.

580
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,707
It's a periodic table of the elements.

581
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:42,928
There's also an old CRT monitor.

582
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,689
It's got to be 15 years old at least.

583
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:48,150
And on the floor, there's a rug, which is maybe the most garish

584
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,191
thing you've ever seen in your life.

585
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:51,411
It's all primary colors, clashes with everything.

586
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:53,972
Well, let's start at the beginning, you say.

587
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:54,813
Let's look at that desk.

588
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:58,431
Okay, well, looks like somebody's been doing some work here.

589
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:01,853
He's got a notebook and it's open and there's a paperweight

590
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,074
that's holding it open, a little glass one, kind of nice.

591
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:07,816
There's a bottle of something he may have been drinking here.

592
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:11,538
And also the desk has a drawer and that drawer is currently closed.

593
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,359
Oh, well, we can't have that.

594
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:16,021
You say, let's open the drawer. I want to see everything.

595
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:18,166
So the drawer is stuck.

596
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:20,588
It doesn't appear to be a lock on it of any sort.

597
00:29:20,648 --> 00:29:21,829
It may just be stuck.

598
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:25,072
And one of your team members is carrying a knife,

599
00:29:25,112 --> 00:29:27,614
and she offers to jimmy that drawer open for you.

600
00:29:28,555 --> 00:29:29,836
Yes, please do that, you say.

601
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,277
And then a booby trap goes off.

602
00:29:31,297 --> 00:29:31,797
Kaboom.

603
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:33,078
She's injured.

604
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:36,020
And there's a little sequence where you have to patch her

605
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,561
back up again.

606
00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:38,162
At the end of that sequence, she's

607
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:39,683
like, all right, I'm ready for action.

608
00:29:40,324 --> 00:29:40,664
What next?

609
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:45,819
Possibly you do have a very concrete idea of what you want to do next,

610
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,481
but likely you have also forgotten at least half and possibly three-quarters

611
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,242
of the objects that have been mentioned so far.

612
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:55,245
And that problem only gets worse as you go further into this game,

613
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:57,726
which I said is going to take more than an hour to complete.

614
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,428
Now, normally we don't have this problem

615
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:02,449
because we've been orchestrating the context

616
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:05,291
so that you don't have to remember more than three things ever.

617
00:30:06,192 --> 00:30:09,314
But because this is a broad and exploratory experience,

618
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:11,975
we have to take measures to aid the memory.

619
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,045
Our case here is kind of extreme, but the lesson still applies pretty much everywhere.

620
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:21,666
Memory is a problem in an audio medium because you just don't have those persistent visuals

621
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,407
reminding you of anything at all.

622
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:27,908
So as a general writing note, you should be repeating the important information more often

623
00:30:27,948 --> 00:30:28,868
than you think you should.

624
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:33,689
Again, make it sound a little bit stilted if you have to, because realism is not the

625
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:34,169
goal here.

626
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,989
It's sort of game functionality.

627
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:42,171
In our case, we could implement a simple list of available objects on demand, and we did

628
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:42,571
do that.

629
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:46,829
However, it's a little bit unsatisfying.

630
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:50,111
The list gets long, and it's hard to process

631
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:52,713
while you're listening to it if there are 12 or 13 things.

632
00:30:53,553 --> 00:30:55,115
And it takes you right out of the fantasy

633
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:57,616
to have somebody just listing off the objects in the room.

634
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:00,598
So one of the better and more effective things that we did

635
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,760
was to contextualize that information.

636
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:05,021
We wrote a bunch of status reports.

637
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:07,763
That was just a thing that you could ask a character for.

638
00:31:08,204 --> 00:31:09,384
Give me a status report.

639
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,271
Instead of just listing everything for you, here's all of the context that you have encountered

640
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:17,192
so far, it would sort of take that into account.

641
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:18,912
What have you finished with?

642
00:31:19,052 --> 00:31:20,113
What have you not started?

643
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:22,893
What maybe have you been working on recently?

644
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:28,115
And so it would focus on only the things that would be interesting to you right at this

645
00:31:28,195 --> 00:31:28,475
moment.

646
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:33,116
And this is part of how we're directing the experience that no one can see is by kind

647
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:35,597
of focusing the player attention with these things.

648
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:42,052
You can also do a lot of redirection with the responses to other player actions.

649
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:44,293
It's kind of like doing hints.

650
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,014
When you do hints in an adventure game,

651
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:49,076
if someone interacts with an object and they do the wrong thing,

652
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,937
you sort of hint them towards doing the right thing.

653
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,979
And if they do do the right thing, you sort of hint them to

654
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,600
what's the next interesting thing.

655
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:59,703
All that stuff can be used to hint at drama as well

656
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:02,545
and kind of direct the story experience.

657
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:05,453
These status reports are doubly useful.

658
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,734
Remember that we had this constraint of limited time.

659
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:10,475
You had to answer quickly or the skill was going to drop.

660
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:14,316
Well, it turns out when you're solving puzzles of the escape room variety,

661
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,357
this is sort of inevitable that you're going to have to stop paying attention

662
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:19,998
to the skill for a while and write something down on a piece of paper.

663
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:23,320
Either you will pause it or it will drop out of its own accord,

664
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,461
but either way you're going to have to start it up again.

665
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:29,663
And so we needed a way, when someone was starting the story back up again,

666
00:32:29,723 --> 00:32:31,604
whether it had been one minute or five minutes,

667
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:34,906
or they had gone to work and dinner and come back after 12 hours,

668
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:38,007
a good way to just sort of jump them back into the story

669
00:32:38,027 --> 00:32:40,449
and sort of remind them what they needed to be thinking about.

670
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,109
And these status reports were perfect for that.

671
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,671
So any time you did start the skill from nothing,

672
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,292
if you had a bookmark in the middle of the story,

673
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:48,913
we would throw one of these at you.

674
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:51,508
Super good.

675
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:55,292
So now ordinarily, after I get that detailed design all done,

676
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:58,335
what I like to do is start the implementation

677
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:01,338
and create a skeleton upon which I can then

678
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:02,279
write all the dialogue.

679
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:04,422
I leave the dialogue writing until the very last if I can.

680
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:06,864
However, I don't always get to do that.

681
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,888
And in this case, we had a script approval

682
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:11,309
in the contract, and our partners

683
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:12,450
needed a fair amount of time.

684
00:33:13,487 --> 00:33:14,448
to get that turned around.

685
00:33:14,468 --> 00:33:16,851
There's a whole chain of custody that goes from you

686
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:17,472
to the producer.

687
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:22,259
Takes a while to get to the actual filmmakers or TV people.

688
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,106
So the script got written on paper first.

689
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,387
This probably happens, I'd say, about half the time

690
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:30,727
we wind up having to do this,

691
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:33,688
just the productions being what they are.

692
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:36,868
This script, incidentally, is about 160 pages,

693
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,889
including a bunch of pseudocode in it

694
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:41,430
to explain how the different pieces fit together,

695
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,190
because it's not entirely clear

696
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,211
because this is a non-linear sort of a thing.

697
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:50,272
Also, incidentally,

698
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:52,705
Right there at the end of the script writing process

699
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:55,627
is when I finally got to read some of the scripts from the show

700
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:56,788
and actually see the show.

701
00:33:58,148 --> 00:33:59,309
Time for a little sidebar about

702
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:01,490
studio security in Hollywood,

703
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,991
which is fun and interesting.

704
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:05,313
I want to preface this part by saying that

705
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:08,134
our partners have been fantastic about this stuff.

706
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:10,396
They've always been really helpful and pleasant.

707
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,817
I've had good experiences with them.

708
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:15,059
This project was no exception.

709
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:16,820
Amazon Studios was really good to us,

710
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,481
and I would work with them again in a minute.

711
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:23,117
What you run up against, though, are processes that are not designed for you.

712
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:29,061
The processes for working with anyone outside of the studio are mostly for people who are

713
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:31,243
doing things like making action figures and lunchboxes.

714
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:36,307
And those people don't need the kind of access or feedback or level of detail that you do

715
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:38,868
when you're trying to write a complementary piece of fiction.

716
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:42,999
On top of that, everybody is super worried about leaks,

717
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:44,960
and you cannot blame them for that.

718
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,102
If there's recent history has worn out a few things,

719
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,923
and if your show winds up on the internet

720
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:52,764
before it winds up on your own streaming service,

721
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:53,605
that's really bad.

722
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:56,226
So consequently, as a partner,

723
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:58,027
even one under non-disclosure,

724
00:34:58,508 --> 00:34:59,948
it can be pretty hard to get ahold of a script.

725
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:03,134
Now this Jack Ryan project was actually pretty smooth.

726
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:04,675
They were willing to let me have stuff,

727
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:07,656
but what they didn't trust was the internet and the mail.

728
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:09,396
So they weren't going to send me anything remotely.

729
00:35:09,436 --> 00:35:11,077
I had to go and meet with an actual person,

730
00:35:11,537 --> 00:35:13,137
and she would screen the show for me,

731
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,818
and then she actually handed me a pile of scripts

732
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:17,159
at that time that I could take home and use as reference.

733
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:18,779
The reason that it took this long

734
00:35:18,939 --> 00:35:20,140
is that we were all really busy,

735
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,300
and our offices were 400 miles apart.

736
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,081
I'm not in L.A.

737
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:26,842
So it just took a little while to get things going.

738
00:35:27,102 --> 00:35:27,982
I've definitely had worse.

739
00:35:29,023 --> 00:35:29,263
In fact,

740
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,587
Let me explain about that one time when I had worse.

741
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:34,728
One time I had to fly to Los Angeles,

742
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:38,731
and they took me up to a weirdly deserted floor

743
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:39,992
at the top of a tall building.

744
00:35:40,352 --> 00:35:41,873
And somebody brought me the script.

745
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:44,836
And he took the little pin out of the script

746
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,637
so that I could move pages individually.

747
00:35:47,137 --> 00:35:49,219
And he brought me a notepad for taking notes on

748
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:51,501
and a special red pen for taking notes with.

749
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:53,982
And then I sat there with the script for a couple of hours,

750
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:55,644
and then they came and they took everything away,

751
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:56,825
and they scanned my notes.

752
00:35:57,624 --> 00:36:01,666
They did not just hand me a thumb drive or anything, no, I had to fly back home and then

753
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:06,908
they sent me the notes a few days later inside of a secure app that I had to put on my laptop

754
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:10,370
and I had to go through a vetting process to get a login for that app.

755
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,272
And the notes of course couldn't be exported from that app in any way, you had to view

756
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:16,613
them only in the app, they were encoded.

757
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:21,876
And then there was a second app that I had to install on my phone to do a numerical two-factor

758
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:24,417
authentication every time I entered the password.

759
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:28,649
which was about every 10 minutes unless I kept tapping the window,

760
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:31,209
which of course I didn't because I was trying to work.

761
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:33,650
I just wanted to have the notes up there on the screen next to me.

762
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,630
So it was like having the notes inside of a safe

763
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,691
when the door kept closing on me.

764
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:40,691
That project turned out fine too.

765
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:43,251
It's just a little bit inconvenient.

766
00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:45,152
I just want to let you know what you might run up against.

767
00:36:46,512 --> 00:36:49,032
Anyway, 160 pages of script later,

768
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:50,313
we got it sent off for approvals

769
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:52,993
and now I can finally do the implementation.

770
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:53,593
Yay!

771
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:54,933
I like that part.

772
00:36:55,893 --> 00:36:57,294
Some people do use code for this.

773
00:36:59,075 --> 00:37:01,598
We have a tool that lets you draw little boxes

774
00:37:01,658 --> 00:37:04,740
and put stuff in it and connect them to create the structure.

775
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,483
This isn't it, by the way. This is a Visio drawing.

776
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,866
I was asked not to show an actual screenshot of our tool,

777
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:12,547
some kind of a trade secret or something,

778
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:13,468
so I took that out.

779
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:16,711
But basically, it looks kind of like this,

780
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:19,753
and it lets you make little boxes

781
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:21,915
that have the dialogue for each piece,

782
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:23,476
and your audio is gonna get plopped on there.

783
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:25,967
And then there are different kinds of transitions that connect them.

784
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:30,869
Some of them are direct and some of them are like you're checking conditionally some things

785
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:35,691
that may have been done previously in the skill or you can check the date even or something

786
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:40,152
like that and just go to one of the different set of destinations based on that.

787
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:45,074
And then sometimes you can make it stop and listen for some input from the player and

788
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:46,875
go different places based on that.

789
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,261
So it's good to get a working version up as soon as you can.

790
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,343
Like I said, I like to do it even before I write the dialogue if possible.

791
00:37:53,363 --> 00:37:56,644
And the reason for that is that you want to test this stuff.

792
00:37:56,664 --> 00:37:59,206
You want to get it in front of some people who you don't know

793
00:37:59,306 --> 00:38:02,247
and who don't know your skill and who don't know what it's supposed to be.

794
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,590
And that way you can test all your assumptions and fix some problems.

795
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,932
The more complicated your piece is, the more important this is.

796
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:15,374
You start with text-to-speech voice or you can even do,

797
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:16,495
sometimes we'll do a scratch.

798
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:17,463
version.

799
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:19,585
Just me sitting at the desk speaking into a microphone.

800
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:24,631
Before you spend the money to record actual actors, because that is by far the most expensive

801
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:26,893
thing that you will do in the whole process.

802
00:38:27,193 --> 00:38:28,715
You want to fix stuff before then.

803
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:32,819
So speaking of fixing problems, let's talk about some stuff that came up.

804
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:36,002
Because it's always fun to hear about other people's misfortunes, isn't it?

805
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:42,155
This is the first full test of the language model, and there's always some things that

806
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:42,775
come up with that.

807
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:48,376
We just try to be careful with the writing, but it's sort of not possible to avoid everything.

808
00:38:50,117 --> 00:38:54,598
Things like door and drawer, like we've got two objects in our list that sound very much

809
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:55,978
like each other, easy to confuse.

810
00:38:56,358 --> 00:39:00,479
This tends to work out, though, okay, because the door and the drawer are in different parts

811
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:00,979
of the story.

812
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:02,260
There aren't any times when...

813
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:05,349
Both of them are both available and interesting.

814
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:07,590
So we can combine them essentially and assume

815
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,512
that the player is referring to whichever one of them

816
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:11,353
matters right now.

817
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,374
There's two ways to do that.

818
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,456
We can either do it on that structure that I just showed

819
00:39:14,496 --> 00:39:17,438
you, and we have an input for door and an input for drawer,

820
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,140
and they both point to the same thing.

821
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,081
Or you can literally combine them

822
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,462
as part of the language model.

823
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:23,863
Just make them synonyms of each other,

824
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:26,786
and you'll just get one token back that's door drawer

825
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:27,787
or something like that.

826
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:30,309
We had a few other things like that in the skill.

827
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,732
Note in the notebook, the table in the periodic table.

828
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,393
Confusable under some circumstances.

829
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,174
Again, they were in completely different chapters,

830
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:42,215
so we just combined them.

831
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:44,436
We did have to change a padlock code.

832
00:39:44,956 --> 00:39:47,437
We learned by experience that eight is perhaps

833
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:52,038
the hardest number to detect of all of the numbers.

834
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:53,239
There's not much there with an eight.

835
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:54,099
It's eight, eight.

836
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:55,980
It's just like the short guttural bark.

837
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,620
It's like a tiny, tiny amount of sound.

838
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,302
So, it's hard to compare that to anything else that might be a tiny, tiny amount of

839
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:01,582
sound.

840
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:06,004
So, we changed it to seven, and this was a puzzle that was actually based on that periodic

841
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:06,384
table.

842
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:12,247
So, we were actually exchanging oxygen for nitrogen, which upon research didn't make

843
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:13,348
no sense at all.

844
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:13,808
It was fine.

845
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:16,169
Okay.

846
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:16,949
Remember this guy?

847
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:19,150
I said his name was a bad choice.

848
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:22,932
Anybody want to guess why, given what we've been talking about?

849
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:26,854
Yeah.

850
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:32,339
So there's a built-in required intent on Alexa,

851
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,081
which by convention, ends the skill

852
00:40:35,361 --> 00:40:37,602
if there isn't anything hanging around to be canceled,

853
00:40:37,622 --> 00:40:39,143
which there never is in our story.

854
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,704
And it's what we call a universal intent,

855
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:44,366
which means it's valid at any point in the skill.

856
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:48,371
So we can't do what we did with the door and the drawer and make some kind of positional

857
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:50,132
decision about which one of those it is.

858
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:54,175
It's just going to get confused and it's going to send a cancel intent and we're required

859
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:55,716
at that point to shut the skill down.

860
00:40:56,137 --> 00:41:00,080
So this guy has, thank goodness we tested that before we went and recorded anybody expensive

861
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,860
saying his name.

862
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,622
He has a completely different name in the skill now.

863
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:05,584
Never name anyone Alexa either in case you're wondering.

864
00:41:06,785 --> 00:41:07,525
Not that we did that.

865
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:10,997
There are some other built-in intents.

866
00:41:11,277 --> 00:41:13,999
Stop is one of them, and that obviously does stop the skill.

867
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,922
We already knew never to include stop as a player choice.

868
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:19,383
It's just one of those things you avoid.

869
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:21,605
It comes up a lot, actually, in a story,

870
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:24,667
stopping something to be one of your options.

871
00:41:24,687 --> 00:41:25,848
And we just avoid that if we can.

872
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:32,096
The list of phrases that are listed, that are listened for, for these built-in intents

873
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:33,337
is not public.

874
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:37,138
You don't know what's in it, but I can tell you now from personal experience that one

875
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:40,500
of the synonyms for stop is that, turn off.

876
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,882
So unfortunately we had more than one puzzle that revolved around turning something off,

877
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:48,483
so we couldn't really engineer that out of the story at this point.

878
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:50,444
Fortunately we got lucky.

879
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:54,786
It doesn't really cause trouble too often, because if there's context for it, if you're

880
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:55,887
turning off something.

881
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,152
The language model is smart enough to pick up on that,

882
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:01,774
and it'll send us a turn off the thing intent instead

883
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:04,496
of the turn off the skill intent, and we don't stop.

884
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,399
Where the trouble happens is if somebody

885
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:09,561
is mumbling or turning away from the microphone

886
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:12,343
at exactly the wrong moment, that

887
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:13,944
can take part of the speech and make

888
00:42:13,984 --> 00:42:17,287
it sound muddy enough to be misinterpreted

889
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:18,148
as background noise.

890
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:20,370
And then you lose it, and you just get the turn off.

891
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,451
And then it does ask you to turn the skill off,

892
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:25,574
and you have to do it, or you will not pass certification.

893
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,891
Exit is another built-in thing.

894
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:30,492
This is like a hard reset.

895
00:42:30,692 --> 00:42:31,792
You can't even be nice about it.

896
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:34,134
With a stop, we get to send a little message that says,

897
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:35,475
thanks for playing with Exit.

898
00:42:35,515 --> 00:42:37,136
It just cuts it off instantly.

899
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:39,777
Exit also has some hidden synonyms,

900
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:42,319
among which we discovered.

901
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:43,783
was closed.

902
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:45,344
Now, what are the odds?

903
00:42:45,785 --> 00:42:49,208
Out of nine actions, we'd pick two that are hidden synonyms for,

904
00:42:49,288 --> 00:42:50,729
please stop the skill now.

905
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,172
Here again, because the players are providing some context about

906
00:42:55,252 --> 00:42:57,814
what to close, it usually doesn't get confused.

907
00:42:57,874 --> 00:43:01,157
But had I known in advance about turn off and close,

908
00:43:01,197 --> 00:43:03,018
I would have tried to just design the thing around them.

909
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:05,160
And I would advise you to do that, too.

910
00:43:06,721 --> 00:43:07,862
One more thing about the language model.

911
00:43:08,282 --> 00:43:10,384
I'm certainly talking about the language model a lot, aren't I?

912
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:17,601
Amazon has some great pre-made slop types for recognizing things like numbers and the names of cities and the names of countries.

913
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:21,384
Things where there are a lot of elements and potentially a lot of ways to say them.

914
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:25,727
If you think about the numbers, you know, 1017 isn't the only way you say that.

915
00:43:25,747 --> 00:43:30,711
You might say 1017, you might say 1017, especially if you're entering a code on a keypad.

916
00:43:30,752 --> 00:43:32,433
And every number has that same problem.

917
00:43:32,473 --> 00:43:39,018
So rather than actually build that thing yourself and list out all of those potential ways to say those things, it's good to have something.

918
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:41,342
provided by Amazon that you can just use.

919
00:43:41,362 --> 00:43:43,302
And I got excited about the possibilities of these

920
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:47,004
because they're all kind of good for code-based sort of puzzles.

921
00:43:48,204 --> 00:43:50,625
And I used four or five of them in the skill.

922
00:43:51,686 --> 00:43:55,307
Well, one day we discovered that no had stopped working

923
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:55,987
for some reason.

924
00:43:56,007 --> 00:43:58,468
You couldn't answer no to any question in the skill,

925
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:01,790
including are you sure you want to start over,

926
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,031
which is a good thing to be able to answer no to.

927
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:12,034
revealed that no, it was actually the word was getting returned correctly, but it was being flagged as a country.

928
00:44:13,622 --> 00:44:14,002
Go figure.

929
00:44:14,563 --> 00:44:16,024
Country is a big intent.

930
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:16,804
There's a lot in it.

931
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:20,046
And so it would capture a lot of extraneous things

932
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:22,187
that weren't listed somewhere else in the model.

933
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:24,969
So if the player just said banana for some reason,

934
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:27,150
it would say, well, that sounds a little

935
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,611
like some of the countries in my model.

936
00:44:28,651 --> 00:44:30,332
So I'm going to flag that as country.

937
00:44:30,392 --> 00:44:33,914
It tries to put something into one of your boxes

938
00:44:34,415 --> 00:44:35,155
as much as it can.

939
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:39,012
That was one of the bigger boxes that we had, so a lot of stuff went into it.

940
00:44:39,412 --> 00:44:43,874
This was the only time, though, that something that was literally specified as part of another

941
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:47,695
intent got trapped by that somehow, and we cannot explain this.

942
00:44:48,056 --> 00:44:49,156
We have no idea why that happened.

943
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:51,797
We don't know what's in the built-in intents.

944
00:44:51,937 --> 00:44:56,059
That's not public information, and again, we don't really know what the language model

945
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,640
does with the data that we give it up front.

946
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,740
It's voodoo.

947
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,062
It does not explain itself, and that's why you need to test it, test it, test it, and

948
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:04,882
then test it some more.

949
00:45:06,112 --> 00:45:07,674
As it turns out, there are not so many countries.

950
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:10,656
So we just took that built-in intent out and made our own,

951
00:45:11,216 --> 00:45:12,037
and everything was fine.

952
00:45:13,558 --> 00:45:15,079
Now, here's probably our biggest problem.

953
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:18,902
It has nothing to do with the language model.

954
00:45:18,922 --> 00:45:19,362
It was all us.

955
00:45:20,863 --> 00:45:22,484
Once we got this thing in front of real people,

956
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:25,326
we realized we had not been nearly clear enough

957
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:27,788
about this list of actions and the fact

958
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:30,250
that that was all the useful things you could do.

959
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,432
And people were being plagued by the parser problem, which

960
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:33,192
I mentioned earlier.

961
00:45:34,177 --> 00:45:35,417
They were trying to do all kinds of stuff.

962
00:45:35,437 --> 00:45:37,538
They were trying to chisel things and climb things

963
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:38,838
and make a rope with their clothes,

964
00:45:38,878 --> 00:45:40,018
and they were getting frustrated,

965
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:42,979
and they were quitting the skill and sending back bad reviews

966
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,960
from the test bed.

967
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,340
Fortunately, this was not live players.

968
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,281
This was test players.

969
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:51,722
So in retrospect, our tutorial was not at all well-designed

970
00:45:51,762 --> 00:45:53,882
in this one respect of establishing

971
00:45:53,923 --> 00:45:55,683
that addressable space for the player.

972
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:59,444
So we added some extra guidance from Alexa here,

973
00:45:59,544 --> 00:46:01,225
put some more comments from her in there.

974
00:46:01,618 --> 00:46:04,439
including a lengthy, lengthy monologue that comes up front

975
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:07,860
before the story even starts that really just hits you over the head with like,

976
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,221
I'm going to give you this list of things

977
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:12,622
and that's what's useful and nothing else, so stick with that.

978
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:15,983
The advice here is just be as heavy-handed as you can

979
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,964
about describing that addressable space.

980
00:46:19,165 --> 00:46:20,485
It's not possible to overdo that

981
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:22,986
and it's super important to get that in the player's mind.

982
00:46:24,947 --> 00:46:27,128
We also, we discovered as we always do...

983
00:46:27,148 --> 00:46:30,469
I shouldn't point my head directly at this mic, I don't think.

984
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,638
We discovered as we always do that a couple of the puzzles were too hard.

985
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:38,899
We just expect that. We just don't know which ones it's going to be, honestly,

986
00:46:38,919 --> 00:46:43,160
until we get it in front of people. And mostly what we do for that is we just wrote more hints.

987
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,680
The hints in this game were in fantasy.

988
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,761
You would just call headquarters and they would sort of contextually try and give you some advice on

989
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:54,402
whatever you seem to be working on. So they're actually kind of fun to hear.

990
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:56,562
Now eventually...

991
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,591
You have to stop fixing stuff because your recording date

992
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:01,852
comes up on the calendar.

993
00:47:01,912 --> 00:47:05,654
It's some minimal number of days before the date you actually

994
00:47:05,674 --> 00:47:06,174
have to ship.

995
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,615
You have pushed it as late as possible.

996
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:11,196
You've pushed it a couple of days past that, but eventually

997
00:47:11,216 --> 00:47:11,957
it comes up.

998
00:47:12,677 --> 00:47:13,277
So you've got to do it.

999
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:14,758
And you may not be doing recording.

1000
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,219
You may be making a skill where you want to do everything

1001
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:18,000
with text to speech.

1002
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,987
And you can do that, some people do do that, and it's cheaper and it's easier, and you

1003
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:26,010
can fix stuff right up to the last minute without getting anybody in the studio.

1004
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,453
But we feel that good drama and good story need good actors.

1005
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:32,094
It's just kind of a philosophy of ours.

1006
00:47:32,595 --> 00:47:37,678
So that's Kat Cressida, who is a good actor, plays Tango in the story.

1007
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:44,783
Now audio production is kind of a known quantity that you should be on another track to really

1008
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:45,144
hear about.

1009
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:46,385
So I'm not going to get into it too much.

1010
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:49,927
We'll say this about the writing for it.

1011
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:54,190
This is a non-linear kind of experience.

1012
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,871
Like I said, it's broad and exploratory

1013
00:47:55,911 --> 00:47:57,231
and you're recording these chapters

1014
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:58,752
full of audio for things.

1015
00:47:59,392 --> 00:48:03,155
And so you need to be aware of the potential differences

1016
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:06,136
in tension and tone between the different lines

1017
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,197
because they may be playing next to each other

1018
00:48:08,257 --> 00:48:09,398
really crazily out of order.

1019
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:11,699
So it's good to think about that a lot,

1020
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,441
kind of compress everything into a smaller.

1021
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:21,732
range of tone and tension within a scene and just kind of go for an overall tone and annotate them like crazy.

1022
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:27,057
tension level 2, and this is tension level 4, and this is tension level 6.

1023
00:48:27,518 --> 00:48:30,901
So that way you can have, like for example in the scene where the water is filling up

1024
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:36,246
the room, a real rise in what you're getting back from the character who's in that trap

1025
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:43,592
about how dire things are, and yet still have it mesh with the responses to your puzzle

1026
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,135
actions that may be interleaved in there anywhere.

1027
00:48:48,563 --> 00:48:53,665
Some other stuff you might want to know about as a writer, on Alexa specifically you have

1028
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,626
a time limit between your player interactions.

1029
00:48:56,646 --> 00:48:58,987
You're allowed four minutes of audio in between.

1030
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:03,448
Now four minutes is a long time, I'll tell you, that is an eternity.

1031
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:07,370
Writers in the room, you really have to keep the pace up for interactive audio.

1032
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:11,651
If you go much over a minute between the player actions in one of these things, it's even

1033
00:49:11,691 --> 00:49:13,992
more important than something where you have a visual.

1034
00:49:14,012 --> 00:49:15,513
If you go more than a minute.

1035
00:49:15,983 --> 00:49:18,744
That better be a deliberately slow scene.

1036
00:49:19,405 --> 00:49:20,525
And if you ever get to four minutes,

1037
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,347
I'm coming over to your house and smacking you on the head

1038
00:49:22,387 --> 00:49:23,627
because it means you've forgotten

1039
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:26,309
that the player is the most important character

1040
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:27,389
in your piece.

1041
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,330
Just ignored them.

1042
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:32,832
One of the limitations specific to Alexa

1043
00:49:32,892 --> 00:49:34,653
is you only get five audio files.

1044
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:36,695
So if you're doing something complicated

1045
00:49:36,715 --> 00:49:38,416
and you thought, okay, I'm going to be clever

1046
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:41,397
and this character who may or may not be in this scene,

1047
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:43,318
I'm just going to record their lines separately

1048
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:44,559
and have them in separate files.

1049
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:47,572
And drop them in, in the places where they would go.

1050
00:49:47,612 --> 00:49:49,755
Well you're going to get to five different files pretty quickly.

1051
00:49:50,215 --> 00:49:51,777
And then it's just not going to work after that.

1052
00:49:53,098 --> 00:49:55,401
It's very restricted if you're doing anything complex.

1053
00:49:55,822 --> 00:50:00,227
Also, gapless playback is not guaranteed on most of these platforms.

1054
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:01,408
And so, uh...

1055
00:50:03,439 --> 00:50:05,960
Again, if you've got something going on in the background,

1056
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,121
you're seen as in a diner, and you want noise in there,

1057
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:10,541
plates clinking, and stuff like that,

1058
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:13,662
you won't want to hear these weird silences

1059
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:14,302
in the middle of that.

1060
00:50:14,362 --> 00:50:15,923
So what you're going to wind up having to do

1061
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:19,604
is, instead of piecing it out and playing

1062
00:50:19,664 --> 00:50:21,164
several different files back to back,

1063
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,404
you have to make one big one, and you

1064
00:50:22,424 --> 00:50:23,945
have to make a whole bunch of different versions of it

1065
00:50:24,405 --> 00:50:27,686
to take care of what are all the conditions that

1066
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:30,447
might be possible going into this particular moment.

1067
00:50:31,784 --> 00:50:38,588
I try to limit that to 32 versions just to keep myself sane and to keep my sound designer

1068
00:50:38,628 --> 00:50:41,069
from coming to my house and doing mean things to me.

1069
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:47,952
Now that your audio is done, you kind of plop it into the structure.

1070
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,411
And then you're kind of ready to go once that piece is done.

1071
00:50:52,972 --> 00:50:54,732
There's one last little formality you have to go through.

1072
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:56,433
There's a certification process.

1073
00:50:57,213 --> 00:50:59,014
Amazon's got to sign off before you can go live.

1074
00:50:59,034 --> 00:50:59,994
It's like going through customs.

1075
00:51:00,614 --> 00:51:02,475
And a lot of the things that they will flag for you

1076
00:51:02,635 --> 00:51:03,815
are functional things.

1077
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:05,936
The engineers will worry about those.

1078
00:51:08,257 --> 00:51:08,957
But there are also some...

1079
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:12,985
Content policy guidelines that you should just be aware of.

1080
00:51:13,105 --> 00:51:14,947
Sex and violence, that's a typical thing.

1081
00:51:15,007 --> 00:51:16,548
I mean, every platform has that, right, don't they?

1082
00:51:16,989 --> 00:51:20,291
Violence, by the way, includes unsettling content, unquote.

1083
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:23,234
There was a demo that we made for a ghost story

1084
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:25,276
a couple of years ago that we think was perhaps

1085
00:51:25,756 --> 00:51:28,298
the first skill to be rejected on that basis.

1086
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:30,560
It was just a little bit too graphically

1087
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,582
grisly and descriptive.

1088
00:51:33,242 --> 00:51:34,123
The ghost story was fine.

1089
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:36,065
It was just the demo that they wouldn't let on there.

1090
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:37,789
So watch out.

1091
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:39,250
You're also not allowed to run ads,

1092
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,192
and you're not allowed to recommend other people's skills.

1093
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:44,113
That just means Amazon doesn't want

1094
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:47,774
you getting in the way of their space of being a store.

1095
00:51:47,955 --> 00:51:49,555
You're not allowed to be a store there.

1096
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:51,937
They do that, which is reasonable of them.

1097
00:51:52,597 --> 00:51:54,858
Hate speech is explicitly prohibited.

1098
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:55,618
That was Twitter.

1099
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:56,419
Please take notice.

1100
00:51:56,499 --> 00:51:58,120
I was glad to see that in there.

1101
00:51:59,380 --> 00:51:59,981
There are lots more.

1102
00:52:00,301 --> 00:52:02,802
Maybe just look them up before you do anything questionable.

1103
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,900
Now, Jack Ryan only failed certification a couple of times,

1104
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,761
and it was largely on these technical grounds.

1105
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:11,061
And they were really fast about it.

1106
00:52:11,101 --> 00:52:16,162
They got back to us usually within a day,

1107
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:18,542
and then we would fix stuff by nightfall

1108
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:19,383
and kind of send it back.

1109
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:22,083
And the whole process took, I think, less than a week,

1110
00:52:22,403 --> 00:52:23,203
and then we went live.

1111
00:52:24,383 --> 00:52:28,164
Fortunately, in time for the launch of the show,

1112
00:52:28,664 --> 00:52:29,224
I'm happy to say.

1113
00:52:31,475 --> 00:52:33,956
Now we can do dynamic content in our system,

1114
00:52:33,996 --> 00:52:36,837
so we continue to monitor and tweak things,

1115
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:38,458
even after launch.

1116
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:39,579
But basically, that was it.

1117
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:42,040
We have arrived at our destination.

1118
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:47,742
Now, you are going to get momentarily an email.

1119
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:50,043
I'm going to just remind you to fill out

1120
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,764
the evaluations for this talk.

1121
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:56,246
The recommended excellent rating is highlighted for you.

1122
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:57,927
If you ever want to hear me speak again,

1123
00:52:57,947 --> 00:52:59,008
go ahead and give me that.

1124
00:52:59,855 --> 00:53:02,856
And we can move on to, I think we've got a few minutes for questions.

1125
00:53:03,356 --> 00:53:03,676
That's good.

1126
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:05,516
Thank you.

1127
00:53:05,997 --> 00:53:07,217
Thank you.

1128
00:53:07,257 --> 00:53:09,117
Another microphone somewhere?

1129
00:53:12,618 --> 00:53:14,858
I don't have a way to do that.

1130
00:53:14,978 --> 00:53:18,539
That would have been cool, but it is out in public and it is free.

1131
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:20,280
You can just ask Amazon.

1132
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,340
It's called Jack Ryan November Morning.

1133
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,961
And if you just say Open Jack Ryan to Alexa, then she'll open it up for you.

1134
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:35,914
I just wanted to thank you again for the talk, but I wanted to ask, do you use Alexa, like

1135
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:38,496
the voice to text, or text to voice?

1136
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:43,780
Do you use Alexa's voice sometimes, and what are your design considerations when you're

1137
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,501
choosing voice acting versus Alexa?

1138
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,282
Uh, we generally treat Alexa as sort of the host of an experience,

1139
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:55,003
which she's always outside the fantasy just kind of handling

1140
00:53:55,043 --> 00:53:57,944
a little bit of maybe tutorial stuff,

1141
00:53:58,904 --> 00:54:01,445
kind of getting you ready or any kind of help messaging

1142
00:54:01,465 --> 00:54:03,646
that you wanna ask for in the middle of the skill

1143
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:06,607
And then, everything else we try to keep in fantasy

1144
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:09,628
which doesn't include Alexa and even though, in this thing

1145
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:17,234
The escape room, the original inspirational material included Alexa as part of the story.

1146
00:54:17,874 --> 00:54:22,057
It rapidly became clear that we weren't actually going to be able to do that for various reasons.

1147
00:54:22,377 --> 00:54:28,402
Some were functional, because we can't, from within our skill, access any of Alexa's other abilities.

1148
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,404
which is the whole reason that she was in those rooms, was to add things for you and

1149
00:54:32,424 --> 00:54:35,248
stuff like that, so we would have had to recreate all of that if we didn't want to.

1150
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:42,297
And the other is that Amazon is understandably a little bit protective about what words you

1151
00:54:42,317 --> 00:54:45,882
put into Alexa's mouth, and if you make her a character in a story, you've got to portray

1152
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:47,003
her in a very particular way.

1153
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:52,027
And is there any reason you wouldn't just voice act everything that Alexa had done?

1154
00:54:53,148 --> 00:54:55,548
Like beginning, tutorial, middle parts, right?

1155
00:54:55,828 --> 00:54:59,509
Well, I guess, why would you use her versus everything?

1156
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:03,230
Oh, oh, oh, as opposed to having a human sort of be the host.

1157
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,770
Sometimes we do have a human host, and usually it's me, actually.

1158
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:11,331
We have a few things where I come on and give you a few pointers.

1159
00:55:12,191 --> 00:55:14,612
The tricky bit about that is actually just updating stuff.

1160
00:55:14,632 --> 00:55:16,292
Like I said, we can update live after we...

1161
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:20,740
After we're already out, and if you decide, oh, we need to change this messaging, it's

1162
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,063
easier to do it with text-to-speech than sending somebody into a studio.

1163
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:26,786
Now, if it's me, that's not very expensive.

1164
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:27,726
I'll just go and do it for free.

1165
00:55:27,767 --> 00:55:28,147
It's fine.

1166
00:55:28,207 --> 00:55:31,210
But if it's anybody else, then it's trouble.

1167
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:35,029
Hi.

1168
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:36,270
Go ahead, we've got another one.

1169
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,271
Yes.

1170
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:37,852
Great talk.

1171
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:38,892
A two part question.

1172
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:43,016
Your 50 objects, was that for each chapter

1173
00:55:43,116 --> 00:55:44,277
or the whole story?

1174
00:55:44,617 --> 00:55:47,900
And in hindsight, was that too many objects, just enough,

1175
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,801
or not enough?

1176
00:55:51,342 --> 00:55:51,683
OK.

1177
00:55:51,863 --> 00:55:55,606
So the 50 objects was for the whole story.

1178
00:55:55,646 --> 00:55:57,107
And actually, it's not even all objects.

1179
00:55:57,668 --> 00:55:59,609
About six or eight of those things are people.

1180
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,971
And you use them in different contexts.

1181
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:02,451
There's one.

1182
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,277
One of those actions was contact somebody,

1183
00:56:05,397 --> 00:56:06,958
so you're allowed to kind of call headquarters

1184
00:56:07,018 --> 00:56:11,600
or try and call your boss or various other people.

1185
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,361
Yeah, that was actually plenty.

1186
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,041
That was plenty of stuff to do,

1187
00:56:16,762 --> 00:56:18,662
kind of more than an hour worth of material.

1188
00:56:19,062 --> 00:56:22,984
And that second chapter actually feels very big,

1189
00:56:23,164 --> 00:56:24,184
even with the amount of stuff.

1190
00:56:24,204 --> 00:56:27,385
There's probably only about 15 or so things in there.

1191
00:56:28,446 --> 00:56:30,106
Yeah, it's pretty, that was plenty.

1192
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,027
I would hesitate to add any more than that.

1193
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:40,743
Uh, Earplay's done a lot of choice-y stuff, and now there's this sort of parser-y text adventure.

1194
00:56:41,283 --> 00:56:42,144
Uh, do y'all feel like,

1195
00:56:42,904 --> 00:56:47,006
Oh yeah, now we've discovered, let's do lots of parser-y text adventures from now on,

1196
00:56:47,026 --> 00:56:49,467
or do you feel like, oh, man, that was a fun experiment,

1197
00:56:49,527 --> 00:56:51,988
now we're gonna go back and do choice-y stuff for the rest of time?

1198
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:54,949
Oh, okay, so he's asking...

1199
00:56:56,462 --> 00:56:59,724
Is this now, having done this, is this going to change our paradigm and now we're going

1200
00:56:59,744 --> 00:57:04,627
to do this all the time or are we going to go back and just do the kind of momentary

1201
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:05,727
choice based stuff?

1202
00:57:06,328 --> 00:57:08,269
The answer is neither of those is the case.

1203
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:14,852
This was, you know, it highlighted some problems for us but we figured out how to deal with

1204
00:57:14,872 --> 00:57:18,554
them and we certainly could do it again and I think given the right situation we will.

1205
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:21,955
It's a very different feel from some of our other stories,

1206
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:24,816
and so those are two models that I would use

1207
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:26,357
in completely different situations.

1208
00:57:27,137 --> 00:57:29,778
And I think we will not limit ourselves to those two

1209
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:31,179
under any circumstances.

1210
00:57:31,379 --> 00:57:32,560
One of the cool parts of my job

1211
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,841
is I get to find new ways to use technology,

1212
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:39,262
which is I'm looking forward to doing more weird stuff this year.

1213
00:57:39,282 --> 00:57:40,663
Thanks.

1214
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,020
Thanks for the talk.

1215
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,085
I was wondering, having worked on both visual games

1216
00:57:47,445 --> 00:57:50,348
and audio games, what you prefer about working in audio.

1217
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,693
Ooh, what do I prefer about working in audio over visual?

1218
00:57:57,035 --> 00:58:02,620
Mostly, I like the sort of inexpensive, comparatively,

1219
00:58:03,682 --> 00:58:06,064
kind of garage operation feel.

1220
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:07,873
I like to work small.

1221
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:13,739
That lets me experiment more, take more risks, and just generally have more control over

1222
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:14,100
things.

1223
00:58:15,781 --> 00:58:19,565
I can change a lot of stuff up until almost the last minute.

1224
00:58:19,605 --> 00:58:22,448
We're doing voice recording, but that comes pretty late in the process.

1225
00:58:23,089 --> 00:58:26,992
I've always liked that from the beginning of some of those earliest graphic adventures

1226
00:58:27,032 --> 00:58:27,693
that I worked on.

1227
00:58:27,773 --> 00:58:30,516
One of the reasons I liked them was the art was so simple.

1228
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:35,618
That we were basically doing puppet theater, and we could just see what we could make out

1229
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:39,602
of that without spending too much money trying to draw everything to match the speech and

1230
00:58:40,623 --> 00:58:41,284
stuff like that.

1231
00:58:41,304 --> 00:58:41,504
Thank you.

1232
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:42,385
Hi, again, thank you for the talk.

1233
00:58:42,425 --> 00:58:42,785
Oh, sorry.

1234
00:58:42,805 --> 00:58:42,966
Yes.

1235
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:43,206
I'm sorry.

1236
00:58:43,226 --> 00:58:43,426
I'm sorry.

1237
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:43,987
I'm sorry.

1238
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:44,347
I'm sorry.

1239
00:58:45,969 --> 00:58:46,269
I'm sorry.

1240
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:46,549
I'm sorry.

1241
00:58:46,569 --> 00:58:46,789
I'm sorry.

1242
00:58:46,809 --> 00:58:47,170
I'm sorry.

1243
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:47,450
I'm sorry.

1244
00:58:47,951 --> 00:58:48,271
I'm sorry.

1245
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:48,711
I'm sorry.

1246
00:58:49,384 --> 00:58:53,905
Hi, obviously you are a pioneer in this field and you've done a lot of great work.

1247
00:58:54,825 --> 00:58:56,986
And you've got a lot invested in earplay.

1248
00:58:57,606 --> 00:59:01,988
What do you see as the future, what do you see as the marketplace

1249
00:59:03,588 --> 00:59:09,890
in terms of the growth of the marketplace for these sort of audio games?

1250
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:13,471
And what do you see as sort of the future of this growing?

1251
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:18,493
What kind of technology and aspects do you see coming next on the horizon?

1252
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:20,673
Marketplace and future.

1253
00:59:21,113 --> 00:59:22,674
Okay, so that's a pretty broad question.

1254
00:59:22,814 --> 00:59:28,015
Sort of, what do I see in the future in terms of both marketplace and technology?

1255
00:59:29,295 --> 00:59:31,736
How much time we got? About a minute.

1256
00:59:32,696 --> 00:59:38,218
Okay, so I think quickly, I think the marketplace is still kind of nascent.

1257
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:40,038
There are ways to make money in it, several of them.

1258
00:59:41,538 --> 00:59:43,479
Nobody's sort of had a breakout like,

1259
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:46,820
this company made a billion dollars doing X, Y, or Z.

1260
00:59:47,547 --> 00:59:47,647
on

1261
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,708
on the platform and there's monetization is built into it now, so there's just kind of

1262
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:27,498
I think that's right where we're at now, and I think that'll happen in the next five minutes.

1263
01:00:27,978 --> 01:00:34,541
Okay, and just Google, the Amazon versus the Google, which one do you prefer using, which platform?

1264
01:00:35,261 --> 01:00:37,422
Oh, I try to be agnostic about that.

1265
01:00:37,522 --> 01:00:37,862
Okay.

1266
01:00:38,242 --> 01:00:40,323
We'd like to publish on both if we can.

1267
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:45,624
Usually it's more of a business decision as to, you know, they like exclusivity one or the other.

1268
01:00:46,762 --> 01:00:52,807
Yeah, we can go iOS and Google and Amazon and Bose glasses frames if we want to.

1269
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,409
That's my preferred thing.

1270
01:00:55,429 --> 01:00:56,811
So that's your future tech then?

1271
01:00:56,911 --> 01:00:57,912
Yeah.

1272
01:00:58,052 --> 01:00:59,533
So we're at an hour.

1273
01:00:59,633 --> 01:01:01,955
I think we have to go to an overflow room.

1274
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:04,277
Is that accurate about that?

1275
01:01:04,297 --> 01:01:05,998
Yeah?

1276
01:01:06,058 --> 01:01:06,599
Okay.

1277
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:07,840
All right.

1278
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,002
We'll be out and across the hall in a second.

1279
01:01:10,022 --> 01:01:10,362
Thanks very much.

1280
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:10,502
Thanks.

1281
01:01:10,522 --> 01:01:10,642
Thanks.

1282
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:11,443
Thanks.

1283
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:11,623
Thanks.

1284
01:01:11,643 --> 01:01:11,783
Thanks.

1285
01:01:11,803 --> 01:01:11,963
Thanks.
