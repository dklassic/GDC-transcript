1
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,760
Hello, good morning.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,061
Thank you all for coming.

3
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:12,482
I know it's quite early.

4
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:13,543
So my name is Ilkka.

5
00:00:13,543 --> 00:00:16,184
I'm from a company called Supercell.

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:18,885
And I will talk today about the way

7
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:24,108
that we are organized, which we call the cell structure.

8
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:28,510
But before I begin, I want to emphasize that I'm not here

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,612
today to tell you or trying to convince you that this would

10
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:35,293
somehow be the right culture or the best culture.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:48,123
Obviously it has worked out very well for us, but I believe, I'm a firm believer that every company should have their own unique culture, which is like, of course, designed that company in mind.

12
00:00:48,123 --> 00:01:02,268
So instead my goal today and my sort of hope is that at least some of you guys would walk away from this room with maybe one or two new ideas how you can make your organization better and the culture better.

13
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:08,387
So I wanted to begin with a story about one of our games.

14
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:14,771
So I think it was almost exactly six years ago.

15
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:15,952
I remember it quite well.

16
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:21,115
We were in this meeting room with most of the Supercellians

17
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:22,056
at the time.

18
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:25,338
And we were talking about new game ideas.

19
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:28,400
So at that time, we had plans to release a couple of games

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,320
that year.

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,342
But we had no idea whether those games would be successful.

22
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:35,804
And at that point, none of our games had been successful.

23
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:39,026
So we felt that it would be good to have some game ideas

24
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:40,367
in our back pocket.

25
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:44,149
And one of the ideas that was presented,

26
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:47,991
there was a guy called Jon who presented his prototype, which

27
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:49,172
he called the Summoner.

28
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:54,955
And that game essentially was a real-time PVP game.

29
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:57,776
And I remember people really liking the prototype,

30
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:59,477
but then lots of concerns there.

31
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:07,837
expressed as well and I remember myself for example saying that you know I just love what you've done here, but but I just don't believe real-time

32
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:12,519
PvP games would work on mobile. I wish it was asynchronous or something along those lines then

33
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:18,782
and and so this is like six years ago, and I remember that like a

34
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:23,164
When if you fast forward a couple of months from that moment then actually we did get very lucky

35
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:27,507
but that our games Hayden and clash of clans actually became relatively successful and

36
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:30,964
and we had all of our developers tied to those two games

37
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:36,666
so then we actually didn't have time to pursue any of the ideas that were presented in that meeting.

38
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,947
But then a couple of years went by

39
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:43,689
and two other Supercell people, Niko and Vesa,

40
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:49,311
they needed a game idea and they sort of remembered this Summoner prototype that was presented at that time

41
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:52,492
and they sort of picked that up and they were inspired about it

42
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:56,213
and they created their own version of it and it still was a...

43
00:02:56,857 --> 00:03:00,538
real-time PvP game on mobile.

44
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:03,539
And again, the sort of the same skepticism

45
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,120
was around the game.

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,922
But despite that, they kind of pushed further.

47
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:12,422
And I even remember this moment with those two

48
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:15,123
that we had a meeting and they came to me and said

49
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:17,524
that they feel like killing the game.

50
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:19,345
And I asked, like, so why is that?

51
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:22,586
And they said, well, it doesn't seem that that many people believe in it.

52
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:24,666
But then I asked, do you guys believe in it?

53
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,287
And they said, yes.

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,552
and then encouraged them to continue and thankfully then they did.

55
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:36,535
And then slowly but surely a group of enthusiasts started to form around this game.

56
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:41,477
But at some point the project ran into some difficulties

57
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:45,519
and then Niko decided that maybe somebody else should lead this project

58
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,322
and then there was this guy Lassi who was super super excited about what had been done.

59
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:56,214
the only issue was that he believed that the game should actually be like reworked completely

60
00:03:56,214 --> 00:04:00,377
and maybe they should go back to square one and build it one more time

61
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:06,700
and on top of that the team had the idea that instead of the IP that had been planned for this game

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,742
code name Scroll, they should actually use the Clash of Clans IP

63
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:16,346
and you can just imagine like the amount of resistance from the people who had been originally involved

64
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:19,047
with that game and of course Clash of Clans at that time

65
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:23,046
was our most valuable IP, so it was a big call.

66
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:25,726
But, you know, Lassi and the team didn't really care about the resistance,

67
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:29,087
they just went on and decided to do exactly that.

68
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:32,008
And what's interesting to me is that

69
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,288
even still a few months before the beta,

70
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:37,609
there was quite a lot of people who thought that, you know,

71
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:41,590
just doing this pure real-time PvP game,

72
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,631
it's going to be like a really difficult thing to pull off on mobile.

73
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:45,251
But again...

74
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:49,030
and the team, they didn't care, and they just powered through

75
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,130
and released it on Vita.

76
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,172
And then that game is Clash Royale.

77
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:58,133
And obviously, it was pretty successful from the launch.

78
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,354
But then the story continues.

79
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:03,495
So fast forward again, maybe three, four months

80
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:04,576
from the launch.

81
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:08,397
And we actually start to face some issues with the community.

82
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:10,558
So they were not happy with how the game worked.

83
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:11,878
We had an issue.

84
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:19,170
but it was known as a trophy threshold, so it had to do with the progress of the players in the game.

85
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,632
Players weren't happy with that, and for a good reason, it wasn't a good experience

86
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:25,214
once you get to a certain point in the game.

87
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:28,816
And then what really pissed our players off was this thing

88
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:32,599
known as emotes in the game. So what you can do in the game is that

89
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,121
you can send emotes to your opponents

90
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:38,363
and lots of players were sort of using that to...

91
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:43,208
to basically irritate the losing player and that really drove some of the players completely mad.

92
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:47,070
And those complaints had been there from the very beginning

93
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,911
but the team, the original team always thought that, you know,

94
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:55,513
like this is part of the game, this is the soul of the game, it's a PvP game

95
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:58,394
so we are not going to change it.

96
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:02,775
But then Lassi wanted to do some other things and then a guy called Jonathan came

97
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:05,236
and he started to lead the team and there were some other changes.

98
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:14,856
Despite the fact that all the original creators thought that these emotes are an essential part of the game,

99
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:20,077
they decided to make a call to enable the players to mute these emotes.

100
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:24,958
And that, of course, like many of the original team members thought, was absolutely wrong.

101
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,579
But yet, they did it.

102
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:32,880
And because of that, and most of all because of some of the other changes that they had made to the progression of the game,

103
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,121
again, started to grow quite quickly.

104
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,806
next six months and it is still at a very good place today.

105
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:46,850
So I think this story as a whole is a really great example of how our organization works,

106
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,390
both in good and bad.

107
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,552
And it's a good example of our culture.

108
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:55,273
But I don't think it's a good example of our culture, I'm not telling it because the game

109
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:57,294
eventually was successful.

110
00:06:57,294 --> 00:07:02,637
I'm telling it that, you know, this game came together despite...

111
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:07,857
the fact that lots of people in the organization disagreed what was about to be done.

112
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:12,758
Like starting from the CEO, many of the founders and many other

113
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:14,879
sort of people in the organization.

114
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,740
But yet somehow the game progressed and it was released and was...

115
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,900
We were lucky in a way that it was successful.

116
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,002
So today I will talk about this culture and really like

117
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:28,222
trying to tell you guys what...

118
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,101
We have found out what works well and then also what hasn't worked and what the challenges have been

119
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:36,563
and more than anything what we have learned throughout these years.

120
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:40,744
But before I actually get into the actual culture and how it works,

121
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:45,886
I want to tell a bit about what actually led to the creation of it.

122
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:48,887
So first of all, a bit about my background.

123
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:51,488
So unfortunately I'm not a game developer.

124
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:56,070
I haven't developed any of our games and none of them have been my ideas.

125
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,091
So I can't take any credit for the games.

126
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:03,044
And even if I have always loved games and I've been a big gamer,

127
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:06,686
I actually ended up being part of the game industry just by an accident.

128
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,028
So, and it's funny to think this, but originally, actually,

129
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:13,189
like for whatever reason, I wanted to be, when I went to the university,

130
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:16,831
I wanted to be an investment banker or management consultant.

131
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,552
And until today, I don't know why.

132
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:22,013
I'm sure I'm very happy it didn't happen eventually.

133
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:24,835
And the reason why it didn't happen is that I got really excited

134
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:27,096
about entrepreneurship at some point.

135
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:32,568
And then I was lucky enough that I bumped into this group of people and they wanted to found their own game company.

136
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:38,173
And it just happened to be a game company. It could have been any other company like from my point of view.

137
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:42,156
But these guys wanted to do games and they were all game developers.

138
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:46,020
But none of them were like interested in doing any kind of a...

139
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,204
Or handling any of the commercial or the business side of running a business.

140
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,752
And they couldn't afford to pay any salaries.

141
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:56,914
And I'm sure they didn't have any other applicants

142
00:08:56,914 --> 00:08:58,396
for myself for the job.

143
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:00,599
So then I finally got the job and became

144
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:02,000
the CEO of the company.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,542
And that company was called Sumea.

146
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,364
And this is like year 2000.

147
00:09:05,364 --> 00:09:08,468
And funnily enough, we were actually doing,

148
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:10,931
or our plan was to do mobile games already at that time.

149
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:18,766
Eventually the company did okay and it actually was sold to a company called Digital Chocolate

150
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:24,131
which is actually from here, was from here based in San Mateo and my job was to run the

151
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,873
European operations of the company.

152
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:31,658
And you know, those times were quite different so the ones of you who are used to, or all

153
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:36,001
of us who are used to like dealing with the app stores, I mean this was a very different

154
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:38,423
time because the distribution was through like carriers.

155
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:42,305
and you had to do like these separate distribution deals with every single one of them

156
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:46,787
and it was quite interesting. I actually found this

157
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:50,688
photo from those times. As you can see, it's a very serious business

158
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:55,329
with a jacket and everything and just look at that phone like on my lap like

159
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:59,691
but the funniest thing about those days is that you were basically selling games to people

160
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:03,752
who didn't really care about games. Most of them they didn't. They didn't play the games

161
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:06,293
and it was just, you know, traditional sales work.

162
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:10,834
I can't say that I would miss those days too much.

163
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:15,736
But then after that, my job was to actually run the global studios organization

164
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:22,639
of Digital Chocolate and we had three studios and I guess around 200 people all together in those studios.

165
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:28,702
And so I come from, as I told you guys, I come from this quite analytical background.

166
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:36,346
Like I said, for some reason my dream job was to be something like management consultant.

167
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:36,626
And so...

168
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:42,412
originally took a very kind of, what I thought was a very analytical and thoughtful

169
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:44,414
approach to design the organization.

170
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:49,098
And by the way, since I've sort of created this organization myself,

171
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:53,101
I believe that I also have a right to kind of criticize it.

172
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,804
And you know, all of the funny things and mistakes that I'm going to talk about

173
00:10:56,804 --> 00:11:00,427
and the flaws, I mean, those are all like my mistakes.

174
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:05,991
And the other thing is that even if some of this stuff will sound quite funny,

175
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,692
I mean keep in mind that everything was done like with the best intentions.

176
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:15,693
So already at that time our goal was to just simply to create the best games.

177
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:22,595
But anyway so my approach was that I wanted the company to be very well organized.

178
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:28,356
So like everybody belonged to their kind of own unit or box and everybody reported to somebody

179
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:32,097
and we had this like very well thought out matrix organization.

180
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:35,700
And we had process for every single thing you can imagine,

181
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,563
from creating new games to many other things.

182
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:42,607
And everything sort of looked really great on paper.

183
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:46,911
And most importantly, what the light bulb there indicates

184
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:48,572
is that who has the product vision,

185
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:52,416
like who ultimately decides what type of games the company does.

186
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,618
And the product vision was very much at the top.

187
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:57,581
So it was myself, it was the three head of the studios.

188
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:03,030
and some product managers and our small group essentially controlled what the company was doing.

189
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:09,633
And then like, what made it probably even worse is that then the organization grew

190
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:13,194
so we hired all these people and we opened these new studios.

191
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:18,756
Our approach to manage that growth was actually to like even further increase the control

192
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:22,938
so we added layers of management and we added the amount of...

193
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:26,620
added new processes to the company because we wanted to control it.

194
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:37,203
And I've thought a lot in the recent years, like, what sort of draw all of those things.

195
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:41,986
And it really was like this feeling that I guess ultimately I had to have that.

196
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:45,307
I wanted to feel like that I am in control of our destiny.

197
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:50,570
And having everything, all of these written plans and org charts and everything and process,

198
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,131
it kind of made me feel...

199
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:55,940
like that we would somehow be in control of our destiny.

200
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,442
That's probably the best explanation that I've come up with.

201
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:04,024
And we exercise this control through a couple of processes.

202
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,285
And I'm going to give you an example of two.

203
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:12,289
The first example is, which I think is relatively widely used

204
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,450
in the games industry, one form or another,

205
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,431
is this kind of green light process.

206
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:19,213
We call it the YDChalk, meaning that

207
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,494
why should Digital Chocolate build this product?

208
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:25,997
Essentially, it's a mini business plan for every game.

209
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,398
So basically starting with things

210
00:13:27,398 --> 00:13:29,159
like what's the market opportunity like,

211
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,222
what's the size of opportunity, what does the competition look

212
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:37,064
like, how are our games different and or better,

213
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:41,567
what's the cost budget, what are the risks, so forth, so forth.

214
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,608
And from every single new game, this type of document,

215
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:47,670
probably like 10 pages, was required.

216
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:55,863
And to make it worse I had this idea which I thought was a good idea but resulted to be a very bad idea.

217
00:13:55,863 --> 00:14:07,146
So my goal was that I wanted to make everybody in the company feel, all the departments feel that they are sort of a part of the process and they can create this sense of ownership.

218
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:16,429
So I required the game developers actually talk to heads of each and every department and sort of to get their sign-off or support for this new game idea.

219
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:17,990
So these people would talk to me.

220
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:22,370
head of the finance, head of the marketing, head of sales, head of operations

221
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,634
to kind of get their approval and you can sort of guess what it leads to.

222
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:30,457
Like in these meetings that they had about the Greenlight decisions

223
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:35,322
like there was no real discussion because the real discussion had been like before the meeting

224
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:37,543
and it was like super political process where

225
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:42,548
like the developers would do anything they could possibly can to get an approval from certain people.

226
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:47,884
And then, like, if there was no approval from a person,

227
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:51,345
then that game wouldn't, the idea wouldn't even appear in this meeting.

228
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:56,226
So the value of the meeting was close to zero.

229
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:59,327
And also, like, some other problems that it had was that, you know,

230
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,668
like, if you think about it, like, I mean, nobody has a crystal ball.

231
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,829
It's really hard to predict which games will be successful.

232
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:07,810
So then you could make the argument that, you know,

233
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,290
why would this group of people have that crystal ball,

234
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,251
and why should they be making the decisions?

235
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:19,255
And one could argue that who really knows the games and the players best, it's probably the game developers themselves.

236
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:25,360
Also, like this process, it's really favored sort of what I would call incremental innovation.

237
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,944
Like very, kind of products that are a little better than the existing ones.

238
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:34,728
And the reason is that for you to make a case like what type of product to build,

239
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:40,713
the easiest way to build your financial estimate was to look at what already exists in the market and say that okay,

240
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,148
we are better because of these games because X, Y and Z and therefore

241
00:15:45,148 --> 00:15:47,249
the revenue estimate it's like a

242
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:50,951
you're gonna capture X percentage share of this market or something like that

243
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:56,374
and that was sort of an easiest way to sell this stuff to people who didn't come from games background so

244
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:59,456
for example a guy with a financial background, I mean that's the language

245
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:00,977
that that person understands

246
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:01,497
but what

247
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:07,660
the problem is that this type of process doesn't favor the truly innovative ideas

248
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,201
like if you really wanna build

249
00:16:09,597 --> 00:16:12,840
something from scratch, you want to build something that doesn't exist yet.

250
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,342
You can't build a case like that around it.

251
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:19,145
And surprise, surprise, we really didn't have many of those type of games, like,

252
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,247
coming through the process.

253
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:27,272
And then the last sort of problem with the process was that just, you know,

254
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:29,574
it required lots of time from the developers.

255
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:32,997
So instead of them, like, writing prototypes and, you know,

256
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:35,238
building actual games very well, building pitches,

257
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:37,500
which, of course, isn't a very good use of time.

258
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:41,168
they could use that time to the products themselves instead.

259
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,189
So that would be one example of the process.

260
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:51,352
Another example is like at some point we introduced this like monthly review processes

261
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:57,155
and they were essentially like status reports from a game teams to the upper management

262
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:58,676
like what's going on.

263
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:01,477
And the purpose was like that we wanted to feel in control about

264
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:05,699
and make sure that these games are actually progressing as we had agreed and you know

265
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:09,467
still shooting towards a vision that we had agreed.

266
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:12,890
And what really made these meetings bad

267
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,752
was that they were also essentially go, no-go decision

268
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:15,972
points.

269
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:18,093
So they also were green light meetings as well,

270
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:23,477
meaning that it could be that your game gets discontinued

271
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:24,778
in this meeting.

272
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,259
And of course, you can imagine what happens.

273
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:29,341
Of course, the game teams would come to this meeting

274
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,102
very well prepared.

275
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:32,423
They had done all of this work the prior week

276
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:33,424
to prepare for the meeting.

277
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,502
they had created a lot of materials just for the purposes of this meeting.

278
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:40,583
And after the meeting, had the game continued,

279
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,604
they would just throw away all of that stuff and continue where they left off.

280
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,865
And at some point I think I figured out that

281
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:49,107
some teams, they literally used one week of every single month

282
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:50,987
just for the purposes of this meeting.

283
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,348
Of course, that doesn't make any sense.

284
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:57,350
Also, you can imagine the amount of frustration that these developers had

285
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,072
when they had to explain game stuff and game development stuff

286
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:02,992
to people who like...

287
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,056
weren't game developers at all.

288
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:07,896
Again, it was my fault.

289
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:11,678
I was the one who invited these finance and marketing and sales guys

290
00:18:11,678 --> 00:18:13,478
to the meeting.

291
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:16,479
It's definitely not their fault, but of course they had questions

292
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,680
and it wasn't very productive.

293
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,960
And the last thing about this meeting that, again,

294
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,662
you can imagine it's a large group of people

295
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:26,943
and very easily leads to this kind of design-by-committee type of thinking.

296
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,184
So the ideas that would go through are the ideas that

297
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:32,004
doesn't get anybody irritated,

298
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:33,165
but then the overhand, you know...

299
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,032
aren't really that great or innovative either.

300
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,853
Because like most of the big innovative ideas, they are

301
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,373
things like, for example, Clash Royale that did something new

302
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:45,374
but then you don't really understand it before it's out there.

303
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,595
And there were other... and I could have like

304
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,977
picked some other pros as well, but these are probably the top two ones

305
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:55,737
on my list, which really didn't work out.

306
00:18:57,092 --> 00:19:03,374
And the really, really interesting thing about all of this is, and all of these processes, as I said, they're put together with best intentions.

307
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:10,636
But the thing is that despite all of this, I mean, believe it or not, but we were actually able to put out some really great games.

308
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:19,659
So, uh, ones of you who were part of the mobile games industry back in those days might remember a game called Tower Blocks, which was a really big hit for us.

309
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,380
Later on, then Facebook just started their gaming platform.

310
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,868
We released a game called Millionaire City,

311
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:28,651
that got a huge amount of users, and there were others as well.

312
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:30,752
And at some point, I started to think,

313
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,215
what really is the common nominator

314
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,836
behind all of these games?

315
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:39,058
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized

316
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,441
that actually, first of all, all of these games,

317
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:46,124
they had a really great team behind them.

318
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:46,504
Then two.

319
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,727
they were released exactly at the right time.

320
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:55,951
So we got the timing right, which of course has mostly to do with luck.

321
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:59,814
But then thirdly, it also seemed to me that what explained the success

322
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:03,137
is that the less the management, like myself and some others,

323
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:06,279
the less the management had to do with the game,

324
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,901
the better were the chances of success.

325
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:12,344
And somehow these games, these hit games, they just happened.

326
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,585
Like, almost like accidents.

327
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:23,971
And I once actually joked to somebody that we were able to put out these hit games despite all of these processes that we had in place.

328
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:30,596
And that of course tells you something like how great these teams and the people there at the company.

329
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:36,000
And then I sort of finally got it and it's really embarrassing to almost talk about it because it took so so many years.

330
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,464
But I finally got that these processes, no matter how well thought out they are, they just do not...

331
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:44,607
translate into great games.

332
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:49,552
And then the thought process continued and I started to think that

333
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:54,758
if the success truly is only about the team and the timing

334
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:57,721
and the timing you can't really control because that's about luck

335
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,823
but what you can control is actually the team.

336
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:05,429
And if it really is about getting the best possible team together

337
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:10,435
And you know having an environment that really like doesn't slow these teams down

338
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,036
So there's like none of this management stuff like that

339
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:20,499
But it creates friction for the team if it's all about the team like what if what would happen if you would sort of build?

340
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:21,739
like a new type of company

341
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:27,421
But would only be about people and these teams and and having an environment there is no friction

342
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:30,643
And and what if actually like what what if we?

343
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:39,507
The people who would be sort of the superstars of the organization would be the game teams themselves and not sort of the founders or the management.

344
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:43,789
What would happen if it was actually the teams who owned the product vision.

345
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:51,272
And then at some point we had this idea that what would happen if we actually turned this organization chart upside down.

346
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:56,194
And actually like it would be the game teams themselves who kind of owned their game.

347
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:58,635
And that's what the light bulb again there indicates.

348
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:03,650
And then we kind of took this idea even further and thought that

349
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,410
we could actually think these teams as

350
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,651
as they're kind of almost like their own independent companies

351
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:11,651
inside the greater company.

352
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:16,052
And then at some point somebody suggested that since this is such a radical idea

353
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:19,132
I mean let's not call them teams, let's call them cells.

354
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:21,333
And then somebody asked that okay

355
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,013
like if that's the case like what is this whole thing called

356
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:26,094
and then somebody came up with the word supercell

357
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,514
and that's where the name of the company comes from.

358
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:34,088
But really the idea here is that there is no central process.

359
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:38,129
I mean, every team can be different.

360
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:42,510
And that enables us to hire from much broader base of people

361
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:48,711
because you don't have to be just one type of person to get hired.

362
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:51,371
And every team can have their own ways of working.

363
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,672
And we wanted to see that as a source of strength

364
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,593
rather than a source of weakness.

365
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,882
Well, at some point somebody asked that, OK, but

366
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,404
if it's all about the teams, like, what do you do then?

367
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:08,547
Like, what is the role of management in this type of case?

368
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:12,690
And we thought about it a lot and really

369
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,514
the answer seems to be that it's our job to put together the best possible teams

370
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:23,618
and it's our job to make sure that these teams have the best possible environment to work in.

371
00:23:23,618 --> 00:23:28,862
And by best possible environment I don't mean a fancy office, for example.

372
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:33,160
I mean, I mean an environment where these teams can have the biggest possible impact

373
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,281
and there's no friction in the organization.

374
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:42,285
Also one of the things that we got excited about was this idea that if these teams make the decisions

375
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:45,926
it probably will increase the speed of execution

376
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:49,328
but also, because they don't need approvals

377
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:53,570
but it will also increase the quality of the decisions

378
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,051
because then the decisions get to be made.

379
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,781
as close to the player as possible.

380
00:23:57,781 --> 00:24:00,662
Because it's obviously these guys who know the games best

381
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:03,043
and they probably also know their users or the players the best

382
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:06,545
so it just makes sense.

383
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:12,307
And these days I think that our organization, it works the best

384
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:16,109
when I make as few decisions as possible.

385
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:20,831
And we've sort of made it a goal that most of the decisions,

386
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:23,553
if not all of them, they should be made at the team level,

387
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:25,293
not at the management level.

388
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:29,966
And to describe that goal, I even like start to say to other people

389
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:33,148
that my goal is to be actually the least powerful CEO

390
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:37,171
and meaning that the less decisions I make, the better the organization works.

391
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:42,654
And sometimes this leads to some really interesting situations.

392
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:47,898
For example, when we work with some outside companies,

393
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:52,181
like for example with partners, platform partners for example,

394
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:56,135
it always takes them a while to realize that at Supercell

395
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:58,736
the most important meanings you can possibly have

396
00:24:58,736 --> 00:25:00,597
they are with the game teams.

397
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:03,059
So for example, if they're meaning with me

398
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,640
in most cases it's a waste of their time

399
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,301
because at the end of the day it's not me

400
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:08,342
who's making these decisions.

401
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,503
And they usually don't believe it the first

402
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:12,684
or even the second time we tell that to them

403
00:25:12,684 --> 00:25:14,865
but maybe after third or fourth time

404
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:17,007
and then they start to see how we work

405
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:20,068
suddenly they sort of get it.

406
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,764
Or there are things like...

407
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:28,947
Recently, when it was the International Day of the Girl,

408
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:33,090
I participated in this initiative called Girl's Takeover.

409
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:39,475
So the idea is that this, say, a teenage-age girl comes and takes over the job of the CEO

410
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:42,117
and makes all the decisions for one day.

411
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:46,940
And they asked me to participate, and because I thought it was a very important initiative,

412
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,922
of course I wanted to participate.

413
00:25:49,325 --> 00:25:55,650
kind of a pre-warned them, all these girls, Sonja, that I'm happy to support you and we will do this,

414
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,773
but I just want to warn you that you might be actually quite disappointed,

415
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:03,396
because the fact is that I make very few decisions in this company.

416
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:10,020
But, you know, she took the chance anyway, and I think she did the right thing by touring the studio

417
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,644
and talking to the game teams, which is, like, always the most interesting part of my day.

418
00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:17,666
But, you know, it is just interesting, like, how this type of...

419
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:24,455
way of organizing it, it changes how you also deal with some of the external parties.

420
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:32,279
One other idea that's very close to our culture is this idea of the power of a small team.

421
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:39,063
So at the previous company we had seen in our own eyes that how powerful this very small group of

422
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:45,886
people can be if they are just the right people and work well together. It almost seemed that

423
00:26:47,027 --> 00:26:51,768
And it's counterintuitive, but the scarcity of resources, meaning the number of people,

424
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:59,289
it sort of, it leads to better prioritization, better focus, and then that in turn leads

425
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,410
to better quality.

426
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,031
And, you know, we saw it at the previous company time after time, and also we've seen it at

427
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:05,611
Supercell.

428
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:09,792
So quite often when things aren't working out for us, one of the de facto solutions

429
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,112
that we have is let's make the team a bit smaller.

430
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:17,619
and you know, let's try to put together the smallest possible team.

431
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:25,922
So it probably isn't a surprise that at Supercell we don't have any kind of green light process

432
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:30,844
but then the question is that gets often asked, how do you guys decide what games to build?

433
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:34,906
How do you sort of, quote, control it?

434
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:38,227
And actually like, the only thing that we sort of control

435
00:27:38,227 --> 00:27:40,848
is the team and the team's composition and

436
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,939
and of course I have to be able to trust the lead of the team.

437
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:47,681
But after that, it's up to the team to develop the games they want

438
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:50,842
as long as they develop the games in the framework that we've agreed on.

439
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:54,863
I mean, our dream is to create these games that people will play for years

440
00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:57,464
and that are targeted for a widest possible audience.

441
00:27:57,464 --> 00:28:01,105
But that really is the framework, and within that framework

442
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:04,987
the team is free to do what they want and build the game that they want.

443
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:06,727
Also, we are known for...

444
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,773
for like killing a lot of our games.

445
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,174
So how do we do that then?

446
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:14,496
Well at Supercell I would say that two

447
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:16,517
entities have like

448
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:17,198
control. So one

449
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:20,460
is the game development team itself and then

450
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,141
the other one is players.

451
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:23,963
So and the team is in control

452
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:26,084
in full control during the

453
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,986
development phase. So when we still don't have any

454
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:29,767
hard data or

455
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:32,168
metrics it's the team and only the

456
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,189
team who can decide.

457
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,251
whether the game will continue or not continue and be killed.

458
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:44,414
But then, like when the game goes from the development phase to a soft launch phase or the beta phase

459
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:48,455
and we start to actually get some metrics on the players,

460
00:28:48,455 --> 00:28:53,977
then the control shifts in a way from the team to the players

461
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:55,818
because then it really is up to the players

462
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,318
and of course we will be observing the metrics

463
00:28:58,318 --> 00:28:59,719
and if they are good enough we will...

464
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:02,076
uh, launch the game globally.

465
00:29:02,076 --> 00:29:02,876
And what's good enough?

466
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:06,399
Well, that's something that we always decide before the game goes to beta

467
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,001
and we tell the metrics to everybody in the company

468
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:11,642
just to make sure that we are honest to ourselves.

469
00:29:11,642 --> 00:29:15,085
And after that it's actually quite simple.

470
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:18,567
Like if the game reaches the metric goals, we will release it to global

471
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:20,268
and if it doesn't, we'll kill it and we'll do something else.

472
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:21,949
Um, the...

473
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:25,592
This model has a couple of, couple of like

474
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,713
challenges that are important to understand.

475
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:30,474
The first challenge is an interesting one.

476
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:33,777
The thing is that lots of people do not believe that this is true.

477
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:38,822
Not even after they've joined, at least for the first month or so.

478
00:29:38,822 --> 00:29:42,466
Many people outside the company believe that this is some kind of a PR trick,

479
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:45,789
so people like me would come to conferences like this

480
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:50,153
in the hope to talk about it and then attract talent to the company.

481
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,222
And it's just a PR thing, it doesn't really, isn't true.

482
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:58,405
But that's obviously not the case and it wouldn't make any sense

483
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:03,108
because people discover it very quickly when they would join us.

484
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:06,290
And it has happened to me like so often that, you know, somebody comes in...

485
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:09,302
is with Vassil for a couple of weeks

486
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:11,583
when I meet with somebody at the coffee machine

487
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:12,743
and that person goes,

488
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:14,524
hey Jelke, I have to convince you something

489
00:30:14,524 --> 00:30:16,305
that I actually didn't believe

490
00:30:16,305 --> 00:30:18,966
like this independence thing

491
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:20,967
when I joined, but now I've realized

492
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:22,227
that it actually is true.

493
00:30:22,227 --> 00:30:25,809
The other thing that is a challenge for us

494
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,549
like outside looking in

495
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:30,770
there's this misconception about the model.

496
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,871
Lots of people think that...

497
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:39,731
Supercell is somehow this small happy family where anybody can do whatever they want and not care about the results.

498
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:43,073
And that really isn't true at all actually.

499
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:50,477
I mean what actually keeps this whole thing together and acts as a glue is our very high quality bar.

500
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:55,700
So as I just said, you know, our goal is to create these games that people will play for years and years and years.

501
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,001
And that's a very high bar as you guys know.

502
00:30:58,586 --> 00:31:02,967
And then if you combine that with a completely transparent information sharing,

503
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:06,908
so every single team knows exactly how all the other teams are doing,

504
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:10,870
just because we share all the metrics to everybody in the company,

505
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:16,491
and also these teams have to give updates to the rest of the company quite regularly.

506
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:19,312
So it's very apparent how the other teams are doing.

507
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:23,033
So the combination of the high quality bar, and that is very transparent,

508
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:25,654
makes it sort of a high performance organization,

509
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:27,255
where people really want to like always...

510
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,087
get to the bar and even higher.

511
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:35,150
And you know, like I said, whatever doesn't meet the bar, it actually gets killed,

512
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,352
which of course is always a hard, hard decision.

513
00:31:38,352 --> 00:31:42,915
And you know, in our organization, the fun part to talk about is always the independence.

514
00:31:42,915 --> 00:31:45,856
I mean, of course everybody wants to be a part of an independent team,

515
00:31:45,856 --> 00:31:47,537
a small team that can do what they want.

516
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:51,820
The harder part is to talk about the other side of the same coin,

517
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,521
which is responsibility.

518
00:31:53,521 --> 00:31:56,743
And the way we think about it, that every single member of that team

519
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:01,252
they are responsible towards each other and to all the other super salients

520
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,395
and that's a very big responsibility

521
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:09,080
and it also means that in our culture we don't think that

522
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,563
the responsibility lies with the management

523
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:17,107
I mean if there's a problem we expect the teams themselves to do something about it

524
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:19,289
and not the management to interfere

525
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:26,498
And you know that actually results in a lot of like killing decisions.

526
00:32:26,498 --> 00:32:31,319
So like, I mean, I believe it's actually easier for people to kill their work

527
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,561
if it's not working out, then they can, when they're in full control of that

528
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:38,662
by themselves and the decision is theirs.

529
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:43,304
So, for example, a guy called Jonathan,

530
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:46,705
I think he was here speaking like two years ago about a game called Smash Land,

531
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:50,067
which he was the lead of, a game that we dearly loved and

532
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,749
and he was telling the story here in the same conference

533
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:58,271
about how he, in a typical Finnish way,

534
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:00,132
even if Jonathan comes from New Zealand,

535
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:03,074
I think they had met in a sauna with a team,

536
00:33:03,074 --> 00:33:05,315
and then they had, and the game was in Bida,

537
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,716
and it was almost reaching the Bida metrics,

538
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:10,238
but just almost, not quite.

539
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,559
And they had had this show of hands that, okay,

540
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,140
like how many of the people in the sauna

541
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,682
believe that this is the best game they will ever do?

542
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:21,314
And I think there was very little hunch.

543
00:33:21,314 --> 00:33:24,316
And then they decided in that evening to kill the game.

544
00:33:24,316 --> 00:33:27,958
And then I think Jonathan sent this email to everybody in the company informing.

545
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:31,060
And I remember that very well because I happened to be traveling here

546
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,881
and I was checking my emails in the morning and I said,

547
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:36,684
OK, they actually decided to kill this game.

548
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:39,265
And I felt really sad about it because,

549
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:40,526
one, I love the game myself.

550
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:42,988
I played it a lot and whenever I went home, I...

551
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:46,008
I played it a lot with my kids and said,

552
00:33:46,008 --> 00:33:50,550
OK, I'm going to explain this to my kids.

553
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,071
Two, I felt really sad for the guys and for the team.

554
00:33:53,071 --> 00:33:56,992
I know they had worked super, super hard for that game.

555
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,352
And then they had to kill it.

556
00:33:58,352 --> 00:34:00,313
But then I also felt very proud.

557
00:34:00,313 --> 00:34:02,013
Like, I mean, just think about it.

558
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:04,794
It's amazing that these people have poured their heart

559
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,575
and soul to this game that everybody in the company loves.

560
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:09,916
And it's very close to these metrics.

561
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:12,517
And yet they think that they can do better, and they kill it.

562
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,777
So I just felt proud about that.

563
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:18,375
Those guys and the team at that time.

564
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:20,656
And you know, we do kill a lot of games and we are known for that.

565
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:23,118
So, be it in our game number three and four,

566
00:34:23,118 --> 00:34:24,900
so be it in Boom Beach and Clash Royale,

567
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,343
I believe we had developed ten games to relatively advanced state

568
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:31,365
and out of those ten we killed nine.

569
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:35,288
And the one that we didn't kill was Clash Royale.

570
00:34:35,288 --> 00:34:39,090
And of course, like, killing games is definitely not fun and failing is not fun.

571
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,312
But still, like, we...

572
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:44,722
we've actually tried to take some inspiration from Pixar.

573
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:48,044
They often say that failure is an essential

574
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,627
and inevitable part of the creative process.

575
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:52,388
So, i.e., like without failure,

576
00:34:52,388 --> 00:34:54,670
there wouldn't be any hit games either.

577
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,071
And, you know, if you're not failing,

578
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:57,572
it just means that you're not,

579
00:34:57,572 --> 00:34:58,894
your bar isn't high enough

580
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:00,535
and you're not taking enough risk.

581
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:02,657
And that's how we try to think about it.

582
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:04,038
It doesn't make failing any easier,

583
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:05,559
but, you know, that's the kind of,

584
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:08,362
our way of thought about it.

585
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:19,206
Okay, I want to close by talking about some of the learnings that we had over the years

586
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:20,207
and some of the challenges.

587
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:26,731
So this will sound self-evident, but I still need to say it.

588
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:33,015
I mean, this model is exactly as good or as bad as the teams are.

589
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:36,157
It really is all about the teams.

590
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:39,519
And from this perspective, it's actually interesting.

591
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:44,095
Originally when we founded the company we didn't say that the best teams make the best games.

592
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:47,597
We say that the best people make the best games.

593
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:51,700
And it took us many years to actually realize that actually it's not about the people.

594
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,361
It really is about the teams.

595
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:58,024
And you know putting together great teams is super hard.

596
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:02,527
And to sort of use a sports analogy, what we realized over the years is that

597
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:07,090
the best team is not necessarily the one with the best individual players

598
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,652
but the team that plays best together.

599
00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:14,386
And putting together such a team, it's not easy.

600
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:15,867
And I don't know if there's even...

601
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:18,790
Lots of people have tried to put some science around it.

602
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,692
But still, at least in our experience,

603
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:22,714
the only way to really know how a team is working

604
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,255
is just to put together the team

605
00:36:24,255 --> 00:36:25,997
and see how they work together.

606
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:28,980
The other challenge is that, you know,

607
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,362
I talk a lot about how we love

608
00:36:31,362 --> 00:36:33,083
the kind of small size of the teams.

609
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,941
And yes, there's a lot of great things about it.

610
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:37,142
Then you have a small team.

611
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:40,003
You don't really need any layers of hierarchy in the team.

612
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:41,083
You don't need process.

613
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,484
You know, everything can be planned on a whiteboard.

614
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:45,946
You need very little meetings, because everybody

615
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:46,946
can hear each other out.

616
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:48,827
They're working in the same room.

617
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:53,008
The size of our new games teams are like two to seven people.

618
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:54,909
Live games, maybe 10 to 17 people,

619
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:58,331
to give you guys an idea of how small these teams are.

620
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:00,212
And as I said, we believe that all of this

621
00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:01,672
actually leads to better quality.

622
00:37:01,672 --> 00:37:03,173
And it's way more fun.

623
00:37:03,677 --> 00:37:04,817
to work in a smaller team.

624
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:06,439
But it also creates challenges.

625
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:10,481
One really interesting challenge that we actually didn't realize

626
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:13,984
early on is that it's actually like, for some people,

627
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,706
it can create a relatively stressful environment.

628
00:37:16,706 --> 00:37:20,528
So the combination of having a very high quality bar,

629
00:37:20,528 --> 00:37:23,730
and then this idea that there's like, no, it's only about you.

630
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,811
Because there are no pros.

631
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:27,773
It really is only about you and the team, of course.

632
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:30,175
And then that combined with the small team size.

633
00:37:30,175 --> 00:37:32,536
So everybody basically is designing the game,

634
00:37:32,982 --> 00:37:35,723
There are very little specialization in the team.

635
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:38,744
So that combination can become stressful.

636
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:42,786
And we've actually done quite a lot of work

637
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:44,207
to make that stress go away.

638
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:45,307
But that's a hard thing to do.

639
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:51,269
And then the other thing that is a challenge for us,

640
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,131
and I don't think we have been very good at solving this

641
00:37:54,131 --> 00:37:57,092
so far, is how do we create content fast enough

642
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:59,913
for our players, given the small size of the team?

643
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:08,315
Another double-edged sword is this idea that you have very little visible structure.

644
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:10,856
And again, there's tons of things that we love about it.

645
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:19,339
But the challenge that comes is that it may seem chaotic, especially early on.

646
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:25,521
And we have learned quite a lot of lessons, for example, about onboarding.

647
00:38:25,521 --> 00:38:28,202
Like, many years back, say four years back, it...

648
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:32,532
was probably like really difficult to join Supercell because you would just come in and

649
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:36,253
somebody might in the best case show where there's your seat and give you the laptop

650
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:40,794
and but then you know when you're on your own and and but then finally we realized that

651
00:38:40,794 --> 00:38:45,896
we really have to invest in this and now we are like way way way better at that but you

652
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:52,998
know like in certain places you have to have structure and it's especially important for

653
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:53,818
the new people.

654
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,602
Sometimes people ask, I mean we still don't have any HR

655
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,864
So we do have recruiting and of course we have office people and admin people

656
00:39:01,864 --> 00:39:04,506
But we don't have like HR people

657
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:08,468
And people ask that if people and the teams are so important to Supercell

658
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:12,290
Like why on earth don't you have HR person

659
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,492
Or somebody who's responsible for HR

660
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:19,695
And my response always is that well that is exactly because people are so important to us

661
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:22,797
So I don't believe that you can somehow outsource HR

662
00:39:23,145 --> 00:39:24,086
to a third person.

663
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:26,327
I mean, if there are any kind of HR issues,

664
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:29,149
we want them to be dealt with between the lead

665
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:30,390
and that person themselves.

666
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,993
We don't want to have a third people involved there.

667
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:38,675
But it creates some challenges at times.

668
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:43,058
Also, as I'm sure you've already figured out,

669
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:45,860
it's almost impossible to reach consensus

670
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,581
in a culture like ours.

671
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:53,439
And many of our games, I would say most of our games, we have like four games,

672
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:59,243
have faced strong, I would call it almost like internal opposition,

673
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:04,286
or people who have just disagreed about the direction of the game

674
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:08,329
and have thought that we shouldn't even be building this game in the first place.

675
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:12,071
And just talk about Clash Royale and all the twists and turns.

676
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:16,374
The other example could be a game called Boom Beach, which was our game number three.

677
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:18,335
I still remember this meeting there.

678
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:24,656
myself and all the game leads, so every leader of a game team sat, including the lead of Boom Beach

679
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:31,340
and we had a very heated discussion about Boom Beach and people were not happy about it at the time

680
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:37,583
and then we again had a show of hands, how many people believe that this game should be killed

681
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:44,286
and every single person in that room, with the exception of a Boom Beach lead, wanted to kill that game

682
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:46,928
and then we had this really interesting discussion that okay

683
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:49,997
Like, all of us, except you,

684
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:53,318
like all of us, we want to kill this game and we don't believe in it.

685
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,459
But then again, like if we now kill it,

686
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:57,300
like at the same time, not only do we kill the game,

687
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,240
but we will also kill the culture.

688
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,261
Because I mean, after that, you know, we couldn't say

689
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:05,122
that Supercell is all about these small and independent teams

690
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,023
who like are our responsibility.

691
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:09,844
And if we make the decision to kill this game,

692
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:13,432
all of a sudden the responsibility is not with the team anymore

693
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:19,734
it shifts to us, because then it would have been us who make the call

694
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:23,835
and then we decided that out of these two options

695
00:41:23,835 --> 00:41:26,896
we are here for the long term and culture is so important

696
00:41:26,896 --> 00:41:29,297
so you guys should just do the game

697
00:41:29,297 --> 00:41:34,779
and again thankfully they did and it's been a big hit for us

698
00:41:34,779 --> 00:41:36,660
so we've tried to like...

699
00:41:37,147 --> 00:41:42,350
And we borrowed this from Jeff Bezos from Amazon, this phrase that disagree and commit.

700
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,634
But, you know, like we tried to like enforce this idea that even if you disagree,

701
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:50,657
you can still sort of stand behind the decision.

702
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:56,021
And, you know, and the reason why you can stand behind the decision is that you trust the team

703
00:41:56,021 --> 00:41:58,022
who has made that decision, even if you disagree.

704
00:41:59,094 --> 00:42:02,797
So that's how we can think about it these days.

705
00:42:02,797 --> 00:42:06,179
But still we have these heated discussions,

706
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:10,163
and I think they're a really good and essential part of the culture.

707
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:12,064
The last learning is this one.

708
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:16,568
It really is interesting, but this traditional approach,

709
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:19,430
and by traditional approach, I...

710
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:23,919
I'm talking about stuff like top, desire to do like top-down management,

711
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:26,760
desire to control stuff like from outside the team,

712
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,461
desire to create rules and processes

713
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:32,442
and all the stuff that I just talked about.

714
00:42:32,442 --> 00:42:34,182
It's almost like gravity.

715
00:42:34,182 --> 00:42:36,443
Like, you know, it sort of, it pulls you

716
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:40,444
like all the time like towards it and you have to like

717
00:42:40,444 --> 00:42:44,365
almost fight back like every single day that it doesn't happen.

718
00:42:44,365 --> 00:42:48,986
And it happens in all kinds of situations.

719
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:59,972
And the interesting thing is that fighting this, it gets harder and harder the more successful you are.

720
00:42:59,972 --> 00:43:07,976
And for example in our case, the more successful we've become, because we've obviously been ridiculously lucky with our four games,

721
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:13,278
but the more successful these games have become, there's always some kind of pressure.

722
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:17,798
and natural kind of instinct to do even more stuff and grow the team sizes

723
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:21,859
and there are all kinds of opportunities that you say no, need to say no to

724
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:27,280
and we have to really like push ourselves to be always like saying no to all kinds of things

725
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,940
so that we could stay laser focused on the games.

726
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:36,381
Also, what's even harder is that, you know, it's easy to talk about this stuff when things are going well

727
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:41,122
but when things aren't going well, it's way harder.

728
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:49,870
Because there's this thing that comes to you, that this kind of pressure to get the control back from the teams and give it to some other people.

729
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:53,811
There will be people who will say that, okay, we'll come and we'll fix this for you.

730
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:59,432
And you know, lots of opinionated people, as I guess most of the great game developers are.

731
00:43:59,432 --> 00:44:02,153
So there's really strong opinions.

732
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:08,955
And we really have to fight strongly against this idea that, for example, there are some...

733
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:11,760
some really, really great people in the organization

734
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,021
who have done great, great work, hit games before.

735
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,022
And if they feel strongly about the game,

736
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:19,703
that they are not part of who gets to decide.

737
00:44:19,703 --> 00:44:22,904
And we've always taken the side of the team.

738
00:44:22,904 --> 00:44:25,745
And we've tried to resist the temptation

739
00:44:25,745 --> 00:44:28,566
to give control to some people outside the team.

740
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:32,568
But it's a discussion that we have surprisingly often.

741
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:34,469
And as I said, it gets even harder

742
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:36,029
when things aren't going that well.

743
00:44:36,029 --> 00:44:38,630
Also, you really have to like...

744
00:44:40,022 --> 00:44:43,363
be strong in this situation where the rest of the organization

745
00:44:43,363 --> 00:44:45,824
like completely disagrees with the team

746
00:44:45,824 --> 00:44:48,924
and then somehow you have to create an environment where

747
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:50,965
first of all, like

748
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:54,246
we believe that ideas get much better when they're challenged

749
00:44:54,246 --> 00:44:56,046
so on one hand you really want to

750
00:44:56,046 --> 00:45:00,088
facilitate that type of really honest, even brutally honest feedback

751
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:02,588
but at the same time you have to be very clear

752
00:45:02,588 --> 00:45:05,809
that nobody, like nobody outside the team

753
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:07,430
has any authority over the game

754
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,030
it really is the team's decision

755
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:11,218
like whether you like it or not.

756
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:12,999
And you know, it's interesting like

757
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:15,661
this is the same case

758
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:17,622
with almost all of our games

759
00:45:17,622 --> 00:45:19,763
and even Brawl Stars which is currently in Vita

760
00:45:19,763 --> 00:45:21,864
it's the latest example so lots of people

761
00:45:21,864 --> 00:45:23,805
at Supercell thought

762
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,386
didn't like the controls, they didn't like the art style

763
00:45:26,386 --> 00:45:28,067
they maybe even didn't like the game genre

764
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:29,588
they don't believe that this type of like

765
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:32,269
twitchy action game even belongs to mobile

766
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:34,591
but yet, you know, the team

767
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,151
like really really

768
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:37,552
believes

769
00:45:37,993 --> 00:45:44,295
believes in the game and of course it's in our culture to give them the possibility

770
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:49,076
to create the game, put it out and work with the players to make it a success.

771
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:53,778
And we really tried to create this environment where

772
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:57,559
you don't ever need to create the proposal about anything.

773
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:59,560
I mean, you can just do it.

774
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,381
And we just think that in our culture nobody

775
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:06,762
hopefully creates any kind of internal proposals about anything.

776
00:46:07,271 --> 00:46:09,873
The minute somebody proposes to do a proposal

777
00:46:09,873 --> 00:46:11,213
I say no, no, I don't need to see it

778
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:15,056
I mean here's my feedback and you just do it and prove that it works

779
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:18,378
And you know, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't

780
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:21,320
And if it doesn't, that's fine

781
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,460
And then like

782
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,122
The last thing I want to say about this is that

783
00:46:25,122 --> 00:46:27,223
It also gets harder in case of mistakes

784
00:46:27,223 --> 00:46:29,625
So say that there's a big failure or we do a big mistake

785
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:30,846
And you know, we do many failures

786
00:46:30,846 --> 00:46:33,227
We do failures, we fail all the time

787
00:46:34,237 --> 00:46:39,041
And that I think, as I said, it's an essential part of the creative process.

788
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:45,266
But then the natural human instinct in case of failures and mistakes is to

789
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:49,029
but okay, let's not do this again, let's create this rule

790
00:46:49,029 --> 00:46:52,813
or process that will prevent this from happening again.

791
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:56,556
And we always have to remind ourselves that

792
00:46:56,556 --> 00:46:59,198
hey, people, let's remember the foundation of a company.

793
00:46:59,198 --> 00:47:00,039
Instead of rules...

794
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:05,551
we believe in trusting the people and their common sense.

795
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:07,812
And you know, like, the more we grow, actually,

796
00:47:07,812 --> 00:47:10,673
the less rules we should have as a company.

797
00:47:10,673 --> 00:47:14,835
But again, there's like this temptation always

798
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:15,256
to take that path.

799
00:47:15,256 --> 00:47:17,457
So I want to close by saying two things, really.

800
00:47:17,457 --> 00:47:24,200
The first one is that I want to emphasize

801
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,602
that despite everything that I just said, I mean,

802
00:47:29,145 --> 00:47:32,006
Culture has not created our four hit games.

803
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:36,527
I mean, all the credit, it really does belong to the teams

804
00:47:36,527 --> 00:47:41,228
behind these games, and culture has been an enabler at most.

805
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:43,029
And it really is all about the teams.

806
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:46,610
And for example, the story about Clash Royale

807
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,691
that I just told you, I mean, that would not have happened

808
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:52,811
without those people, those amazing people

809
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:55,892
who were part of that journey and contributed to the game.

810
00:47:55,892 --> 00:47:56,232
And again,

811
00:47:56,618 --> 00:48:02,780
the role of the culture is just to enable these people and enable these teams to do exactly that.

812
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:08,702
And then of course there's always that element of luck that is related to timing that's in the play.

813
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:10,202
The other thing I wanted to say is that

814
00:48:10,202 --> 00:48:17,485
how I personally have started to think about culture is that it's almost like

815
00:48:17,485 --> 00:48:20,886
how I'd like to think about our games.

816
00:48:21,597 --> 00:48:25,821
I believe that our games should be getting better like every single month.

817
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:31,146
And as I said, our dream is that people will play our games after years, if not after decades.

818
00:48:31,146 --> 00:48:33,848
And in a way, our games are never complete.

819
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:39,654
And in a very same way, I believe that culture is never complete either.

820
00:48:39,654 --> 00:48:45,059
Like it can always evolve and it can and it should get better.

821
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,600
And I think we are a good example.

822
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,142
So our culture has evolved.

823
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:56,423
on many different respects and I do believe it is getting better and can and it has to get better over the years.

824
00:48:56,423 --> 00:49:03,191
Okay, that was it. As I said in the beginning I hope you got some new ideas.

825
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:06,235
At least some of you got some new ideas out of this talk.

826
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:06,796
Thank you very much.

827
00:49:17,783 --> 00:49:22,808
I think we have time for a few questions.

828
00:49:22,808 --> 00:49:23,889
Hello.

829
00:49:23,889 --> 00:49:26,251
Please.

830
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:26,592
Hi.

831
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:27,112
Hi again, Ilka.

832
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:33,838
I had the privilege of working with Ilka at Digital Chocolate.

833
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,642
He indeed gave his best to make it a good place.

834
00:49:39,307 --> 00:49:45,714
I think at Supercell you have innovated team structures in a different way compared to

835
00:49:45,714 --> 00:49:48,897
how we were operating at Digital Chocolate and you have seen excellent results.

836
00:49:48,897 --> 00:49:50,118
Congratulations on that.

837
00:49:50,118 --> 00:49:56,546
So my question is, at Digital Chocolate while you were making dozens of games, at Supercell

838
00:49:56,546 --> 00:49:58,307
you made very few of them.

839
00:49:58,307 --> 00:50:00,270
So why was the shift from many to few?

840
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:10,320
Well, I think like the thing that I've learned a very hard way over the years and I think many people like who've been part of these companies is the importance of focus.

841
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:18,023
I mean, games is such a competitive industry with so many smart people, so many smart companies that and you know, we are a small company.

842
00:50:18,023 --> 00:50:25,206
So you can only do a very small, small amount of things if you want to do them at the best of your ability.

843
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:29,328
So just believe that it's about focus and, you know, focus and quality.

844
00:50:29,328 --> 00:50:30,388
They just go hand in hand.

845
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:32,327
Thank you.

846
00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:32,527
Thanks.

847
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:36,869
Hi.

848
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:40,830
Yes, so you talked a lot about the structure

849
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:44,611
in terms of the game designers and the developers.

850
00:50:44,611 --> 00:50:47,452
What about the ancillary people that you might have?

851
00:50:47,452 --> 00:50:50,913
Let's say the marketing teams or the technical infrastructure

852
00:50:50,913 --> 00:50:53,533
teams, the IT and stuff.

853
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:57,195
So is that shared among the teams,

854
00:50:57,195 --> 00:50:59,895
or is that also each team kind of has to deal with that?

855
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:05,506
That's a great question and that's exactly an area where I think our culture has evolved quite a bit.

856
00:51:05,506 --> 00:51:11,327
So obviously like when we started there was six of us and five of the six were game developers

857
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:14,568
and again I was the only one who wasn't.

858
00:51:14,568 --> 00:51:19,449
And you know like the whole idea started from like thinking about game developers only

859
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:24,430
but then like when the model like started to work out pretty well like then we thought that

860
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:27,571
why wouldn't we take this idea and apply it to some other teams as well.

861
00:51:27,571 --> 00:51:29,331
But it really depends like on the...

862
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:35,774
area of business how it works well it's like and it is important for us still that the game teams

863
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:40,657
are at the at the center of the company and they sort of like set the pace for the company

864
00:51:40,657 --> 00:51:45,681
because we want the company to be kind of led by the creative people but then like for example in

865
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:52,387
the case of marketing like i would say that that our marketing teams they operate very independently

866
00:51:52,387 --> 00:51:55,790
of course and they're still trying to figure out like what's the best way for this team

867
00:51:56,314 --> 00:52:00,657
to be independent enough but yet of course you need to link them somehow with the game teams

868
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:08,322
because the marketing needs to kind of communicate the vision of the game to the players so that it's

869
00:52:08,322 --> 00:52:13,246
actually in line with what the game is about. So how do you kind of combine these two things and

870
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:18,049
we've done all kinds of different experiments and I think we're still learning. But I would say that

871
00:52:18,049 --> 00:52:25,114
the goal always at Supercell is that we'd like to all of these teams to fall into this idea of like

872
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:31,516
independence and responsibility, but there are like differences how these teams have

873
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:34,777
implemented it depending on which areas of a business way they are.

874
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:40,440
Okay, thank you. I'm curious about the transition of the old structure to the new structure

875
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,602
and I guess the shift in mindset needed by everyone but especially in managers.

876
00:52:46,602 --> 00:52:50,124
So how did you deal with that and what did you do when

877
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:54,966
people in management positions didn't want to lose control?

878
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:03,015
Well, of course this is a different company, of course some of the same people,

879
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:08,881
but I think it's a combination of just having more experience.

880
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:11,803
The interesting thing is that I've actually spent,

881
00:53:11,803 --> 00:53:14,606
I've still spent most of my career in the previous company,

882
00:53:14,606 --> 00:53:18,889
so Sumen Digital Chocolate Combined was ten years of my life,

883
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:22,753
and now Supercell I think we're getting closer to eight years now.

884
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:29,276
So I've been at less time at Supercell, but you know, like I believe that those years

885
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:37,782
have taught us so much how to do things and then maybe also like how not to do some things.

886
00:53:37,782 --> 00:53:43,807
But you're right, like the mental shift that has to happen is that you have to like let

887
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:43,967
go.

888
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:50,132
You have to be like, you have to like completely trust these people and these teams.

889
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:51,093
That's how I say it.

890
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:51,393
It's an.

891
00:53:51,806 --> 00:53:56,169
easy thing to talk about when things are going well and it's way harder when things aren't

892
00:53:56,169 --> 00:54:00,452
going that well. But you know, I think there's like enough of a critical mass of people at

893
00:54:00,452 --> 00:54:05,756
Supercell and definitely not just the management. We have a very small management team and we

894
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:08,818
don't even call it that way. But there's so many...

895
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:14,368
super salient at the company who like seen how this model can work and I think we

896
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:19,311
all the super salients do a great job of keeping each other like honest about it so if

897
00:54:19,311 --> 00:54:24,234
and we often say that that if you see something at supercell that it's not in line with our

898
00:54:24,234 --> 00:54:31,279
values and culture it's your responsibility to speak up and I trust me like people do speak up

899
00:54:31,279 --> 00:54:35,862
if they see that something is wrong. Thank you. Yeah, hi.

900
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,792
being the least powerful CEO, that is your aim,

901
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:42,513
so what forms your day?

902
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:45,034
What is your day-to-day schedule?

903
00:54:45,034 --> 00:54:48,295
What is your vision? What do you wish to do?

904
00:54:48,295 --> 00:54:50,596
So what is it that I actually do?

905
00:54:50,596 --> 00:54:55,558
That's funny, I actually was asked that question not long ago.

906
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,579
And I really had to think about it.

907
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:00,000
So what is it that I do?

908
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,303
So I try to spend most of my time in the people-related things.

909
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:12,186
I still interview every single new employee that comes to the company, no matter what

910
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:14,467
is the position.

911
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:20,870
So I spend time with recruitment, I do spend time with all the team leads.

912
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:26,053
And then, of course, everything that is somehow related to culture, at some point it will

913
00:55:26,053 --> 00:55:29,055
end up on my desk, even though I firmly believe that, you know...

914
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:34,460
But it's not, it obviously isn't not my culture and it's not my responsibility,

915
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,920
it's everybody's culture and everybody is responsible for it.

916
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,781
But I, I, it's my job to sort of somehow like summarize it for everybody and

917
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:43,982
figure out what the culture is and, and kind of keep on like telling,

918
00:55:43,982 --> 00:55:48,303
telling that message. And then there's like lots of like, not like very sort of

919
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,084
just boring administrative stuff. So like, for example,

920
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:55,265
like everything that is related to like everybody in the company, like stuff like.

921
00:55:55,703 --> 00:55:59,226
you know compensations and all these things I mean thank God we don't do any

922
00:55:59,226 --> 00:56:01,308
annual performance reviews or anything like

923
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:04,170
that you know those used to take too much of our time

924
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:08,133
like in the previous company added like no value whatsoever but so we don't do

925
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:09,034
that type of stuff

926
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:12,777
but you know like there are certain things like for example the compensation

927
00:56:12,777 --> 00:56:14,359
review which is

928
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:18,122
you know very much like on my desk and which I think is important of course I

929
00:56:18,122 --> 00:56:19,443
feel it's very important to

930
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:22,945
make sure that people are compensated fairly. It's a combination of

931
00:56:22,945 --> 00:56:24,206
those type of things. Thank you.

932
00:56:26,273 --> 00:56:29,515
Hi, Elka. Thank you for sharing the insight.

933
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:33,817
Actually, I've been working with a very big Chinese game developer.

934
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:38,560
And so this is more like a question, let's say, from our president.

935
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,662
So let's say we have a super independent, super elite team

936
00:56:42,662 --> 00:56:46,204
who can make all the decision and execution.

937
00:56:46,204 --> 00:56:50,906
And there is a way, like say, if we can do it here, we can do it anywhere.

938
00:56:50,906 --> 00:56:53,508
So what do you think would be, you know...

939
00:56:53,770 --> 00:57:00,554
the potential risk that the team might go like really independent, like over independent

940
00:57:00,554 --> 00:57:01,494
somehow.

941
00:57:01,494 --> 00:57:08,097
How I can convince our president to give us the power, you know, like being a sell.

942
00:57:08,097 --> 00:57:10,038
That's a great question.

943
00:57:10,038 --> 00:57:15,080
I mean, then it's a long time ago when we actually had to raise money and had to be

944
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,601
dealing with venture capitalists.

945
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:18,722
That actually was always the question.

946
00:57:19,217 --> 00:57:23,318
doing that, like, why don't these guys just leave and set up their own companies?

947
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:28,821
And I told them that if they do that, I mean, if they feel like that, you know, that's the

948
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:32,803
best place for them to develop the best games. That is exactly what they should do.

949
00:57:32,803 --> 00:57:38,705
And you know, the way I think about it is that it's just like we need to make sure that Supercell

950
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:44,988
is the best place for these people and for these teams to create the best games. And as long as we...

951
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:52,171
As long as we are successful in that, then everything else will take care of themselves.

952
00:57:52,171 --> 00:57:58,776
And if you're not successful, then obviously these people will leave if the environment isn't great enough.

953
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:01,338
But we do talk about this quite a bit.

954
00:58:01,338 --> 00:58:04,741
And really, ideally, I'd like to think...

955
00:58:04,741 --> 00:58:08,884
The way I think about the supercell structure,

956
00:58:08,884 --> 00:58:13,107
but ideally it would combine the best of two worlds.

957
00:58:13,107 --> 00:58:15,129
So you can work in a very small...

958
00:58:15,748 --> 00:58:20,551
independent almost like startup within a startup and you can do your own thing

959
00:58:20,551 --> 00:58:23,794
but then of course you get sort of a job security and and some of the other

960
00:58:23,794 --> 00:58:28,097
benefits that are part of being a bigger company and and and you can you just

961
00:58:28,097 --> 00:58:33,080
have more resources I mean we can do the reason why I believe it's more fun to

962
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,383
work at Supercell today than it was say six years ago is that today we can just

963
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:41,466
you know do much bigger things just you know because of the resources that we

964
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:44,528
have available for us and we can run after much bigger dreams and

965
00:58:44,673 --> 00:58:45,873
That's exciting for me.

966
00:58:45,873 --> 00:58:46,934
Thank you.

967
00:58:46,934 --> 00:58:50,436
Maybe we have time for one more.

968
00:58:50,436 --> 00:58:51,496
Yay, can I ask?

969
00:58:51,496 --> 00:58:54,978
So teams, very important, obviously.

970
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:57,919
Could you talk about how you form them?

971
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,760
How they change over time?

972
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,221
Do they change once a game goes live?

973
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:04,502
Like, how you manage the composition of them?

974
00:59:05,704 --> 00:59:12,508
So it's really a group effort. So what we do is that, and a big part of my job is that I meet,

975
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:21,554
and let's limit the discussion to this game team. So I meet with the game leads, these are the people who lead the game teams, every single week.

976
00:59:21,554 --> 00:59:23,835
And that's actually the only regular meeting that we have, by the way.

977
00:59:23,835 --> 00:59:26,497
But we have this one hour meeting, and we just meet.

978
00:59:27,336 --> 00:59:30,938
Usually like without any agenda and we just talk about the teams most of the time.

979
00:59:30,938 --> 00:59:33,159
We don't make any decisions regarding the games.

980
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:35,120
We never talk about like...

981
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:40,143
I mean of course if somebody needs some advice they might raise up a question in that meeting.

982
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:45,286
But most of the time we talk about the teams and you know like maybe a team needs help in a certain area

983
00:59:45,286 --> 00:59:49,669
and can somebody like move from this team to that team and you know those type of things.

984
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:53,511
And I wish there was like more science or a process to it.

985
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:55,913
I mean because that's the hardest part of our job is to...

986
00:59:56,390 --> 01:00:02,734

01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:07,678
whether a team is working is just to put it together and see how it works out and

988
01:00:07,678 --> 01:00:09,919
then if it doesn't then you can make changes. Cool, thanks. Okay, thank you again.
