00:00:00,524 --> 00:00:07,889
Hi, I am Tim Aituner, Assistant Professor in Kinesiology at California State University, San Marcos.

2
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:11,271
Before that, I was a professional dancer.

3
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:16,774
Well, I meant to say I was a neuroscientist who also danced professionally.

4
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:23,818
Both my research and extracurricular interest in human movement brought me to the kinesiology field.

5
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,160
Here, in the Mixer Lab.

6
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:32,246
We develop serious games and explore the effects of virtual environments on human movement.

7
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:38,970
At BRDC, I will be talking to you about a serious game called The Reaching Task.

8
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:45,875
We developed this game for both AR and VR environments to investigate which platform

9
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:49,418
would be more appropriate for rehabilitation uses of the game.

10
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,942
In this session, not only we will answer this question, but we will also discuss the challenges

11
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:56,423
we face.

12
00:00:56,902 --> 00:01:02,774
in developing the same game with similar motor and cognitive demands for both platforms.

13
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:05,680
Hope to see you at GDC in March 2020.
