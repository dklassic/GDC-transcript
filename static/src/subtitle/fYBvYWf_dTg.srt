1
00:00:04,617 --> 00:00:05,958
Hello, hello, hello.

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:08,840
Wow, people turned up, that's cool.

3
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,602
Put my Mountain Dew down there.

4
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:12,723
Nice and indie.

5
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:14,384
Hello, I'm Mike.

6
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:16,326
I'm a game developer.

7
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:18,467
I made Thomas Was Alone.

8
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:20,149
People in the room know what Thomas Was Alone is?

9
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:21,570
Yeah, hands up.

10
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:31,209
In England, you'd get more of a groan at the self-promotion than an applause, but let's go with it.

11
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:36,132
Those of you who want to hear about Polish game development, my friends, you've walked into the wrong room.

12
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:39,975
This is about Polish.

13
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:44,299
Something we don't talk about a great deal as indie game developments.

14
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,961
Indie game developments? Indie game developers.

15
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:52,485
I've got a sweet because my throat is killed by telling Glitchmob very loudly last night how much I enjoyed their music.

16
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:55,748
Screaming seemed like a good idea at the time.

17
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:58,317
A lot of indies don't really talk about

18
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:03,002
what polish is, because it's not the part of the conversation

19
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,524
that we necessarily think is cool.

20
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:07,268
We do a lot of game jams and a lot of ideas

21
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:09,130
and a lot of cool inspirational stuff,

22
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,853
which is massively important and massively lovely.

23
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:16,699
However, I think there's other stuff that we can talk about.

24
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:20,378
This is a question. Should indies polish?

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,066
Indies, obviously we have a cool opportunity to do whatever we want.

26
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:31,070
To push aesthetics to do different, weird, cool, whatever stuff.

27
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:35,746
We usually associate polish with kind of AAA stuff,

28
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:38,348
or more corporation kind of developed stuff.

29
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:42,971
And therefore when you mention polish in rooms full of indie game developers,

30
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:47,314
sometimes you can get either, well, at best a bored look, at worst anger.

31
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:54,515
So polish. The purpose of polish is to make a game more approachable, obviously,

32
00:01:54,856 --> 00:02:00,040
and make it immediately pleasing on an aesthetic level or even on an interactive level.

33
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:07,226
It's the thing that makes games fun, which is a word with lots of connotations. There are lots

34
00:02:07,246 --> 00:02:11,049
of reasons to make games. Fun is not the only reason. Well, it's a pretty good one.

35
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:15,533
So there's lots of arguments, I think, for doing indie polish.

36
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:18,213
There's obviously, there's the capitalist argument.

37
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:20,254
I need to pay my rent.

38
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,515
My staff, my team members, my colleagues, my friends,

39
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:24,776
they also need to pay their rent.

40
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:27,697
To pay rent currently we need money.

41
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:30,418
In order to make money we need to sell our games

42
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:32,980
to enough people to cover all those bills.

43
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,535
Therefore, we need enough people to like the game, play the game, talk about the game,

44
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:44,180
show the game to their friends on YouTube, enjoy trailers, all these kinds of things.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,483
There is a good, very obvious argument for polishing a game if you want it to make money.

46
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:50,979
There's also the design argument.

47
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,883
We've seen kind of playtesting and polish in general go in and out of fashion,

48
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:59,404
generally depending on how much Valve are talking about it,

49
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:00,825
which is fine.

50
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:02,526
But playtesting's awesome.

51
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:05,688
Playtesting's a great way of finding out where things go wrong,

52
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:06,969
where things don't go wrong,

53
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,312
and making sure that the experience that you're creating is the one you want to create.

54
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:14,831
I don't think we should use playtesting to find out what a game is.

55
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,573
It's useful sometimes if you're not sure what the focus should be,

56
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,095
to put it in front of players and let them tell you.

57
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:26,078
But generally I'm more of the slightly arrogant auteur type,

58
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:29,400
that I have a vision and I have an objective with my games.

59
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,742
And playtesting's really useful to find out how badly I'm achieving that.

60
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:36,344
It's good at pointing me in the right direction

61
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,645
of achieving what my goals are as a creator.

62
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:41,888
Usually I'm miles and miles off.

63
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:42,988
We've had this with volume.

64
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,530
I've been demoing that to press for a year and a half now,

65
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,672
and it's only just at a point where people seem to be getting it

66
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,412
and getting what I'm trying to do with it.

67
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:52,414
That's not their fault.

68
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:55,535
But we've solved it because we've had that feedback over a year and a half.

69
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,765
There's also, of course, the ego argument, which we're not allowed to admit to, but obviously,

70
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:06,751
if you make accessible, polished, clean games, people will think you're awesome.

71
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:09,794
And they will fist bump you at events and things like that.

72
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:12,436
And we all pretend we don't care about that, but it is quite nice.

73
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:14,498
So there's lots of arguments for it.

74
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:20,849
Of course you don't have to. Obviously, Indy has an enormous capacity to be punk,

75
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,812
to be different, to fight, to not be the way that anyone wants it to be.

76
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:28,754
We can create stuff that is not designed to appeal to anyone but ourselves.

77
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:32,936
We can do that. That's an absolutely objective that's fair.

78
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:36,978
It's cool, it's fine, and it's actually where a lot of the more interesting stuff

79
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:38,319
in the Indy space is being done.

80
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:41,601
The stuff that is genuinely pushing the medium forward.

81
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,922
is often the stuff that is riskiest.

82
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:46,624
And if those people had subscribed to polish

83
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:47,745
to the degree that I do,

84
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,966
or to the degree that designers like me do,

85
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,448
maybe they would not have achieved

86
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:55,170
the enormously impressive work that they did.

87
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:58,292
It's more prone to failure, obviously,

88
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:59,273
because it is riskier,

89
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,255
but when it succeeds, you can create new genres,

90
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:03,936
new ideas, new everything.

91
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:08,404
However, and it's very important that as creators,

92
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,065
we never make the mistake of thinking

93
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:11,786
that punk work is without intent.

94
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,508
The person who sits down and makes a game

95
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,449
that breaks the rules, that does something different,

96
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,850
if they're just doing it because they didn't bother

97
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,431
to check what the rules were

98
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:23,793
or to see how players reacted to what they were doing

99
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:27,235
and just went for it anyway, then they're not punks.

100
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:28,856
They're people who haven't invested the time

101
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:29,837
and effort in their design.

102
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,719
Punk intentionally produced is fantastic.

103
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:39,216
Punk, which is an excuse for not really thinking through what it is you're trying to do,

104
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:41,037
is less exciting.

105
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:45,078
And I'd also even argue that punk is in itself an aesthetic polish.

106
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:46,698
We are making a choice.

107
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,438
We're making a choice to do something.

108
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:53,119
We're testing the water, be it through playtesting, through releasing screenshots,

109
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,620
through making videos, whatever,

110
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,360
and we're seeing if it has the result for players that we want.

111
00:05:58,517 --> 00:06:00,418
It doesn't matter if that's, you know,

112
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:02,680
aiming for a mainstream audience

113
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,361
who like free-to-play farming games,

114
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:07,604
or if it's making something for ten people

115
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:09,145
who you think are cool.

116
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:10,106
It's the same idea.

117
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:11,707
So I'd argue that actually,

118
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:13,968
the should we, shouldn't we debate

119
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,149
is a bit off the mark.

120
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:15,850
I don't think,

121
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,132
I think we're all talking about the same thing,

122
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:19,413
basically just we have different goals.

123
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,176
So, it's GDC, so obviously I have to give you

124
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:25,197
a list of things you have to do.

125
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:25,257
So,

126
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:30,400
Animating squares. So this is what I'm known for. I'm the rectangle guy.

127
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,484
That's okay. There's worse kinds of guy you could be.

128
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,266
But it's fine.

129
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:40,890
So why? Why was Thomas was alone rectangles? Well, the very obvious answer,

130
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,774
which is guessed by the average 14-year-old on YouTube absolutely accurately,

131
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:45,675
is I can't draw.

132
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,661
I could, I'm sure. I'm not a massive believer in innate talent.

133
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,222
I'm sure if I put in the energy and effort that every artist who's good has done,

134
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:56,942
I could probably reach some level of mediocrity,

135
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:59,963
but I've not invested that time, I've not invested that energy,

136
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:01,603
so therefore I'm not an artist.

137
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:05,824
But what I am is I'm a reasonably half-decent graphic designer

138
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:09,085
who worked for years producing pitch documentation for AAA games.

139
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:12,946
That means I'm very good at putting a gun on a page

140
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:15,086
so it looks really nice next to a cool typeface.

141
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:20,890
I can't make the image of the gun, but I can make sure the gun kind of fits well compositionally,

142
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,074
and I can make the colors work so that it looks more brutal and impressive and AAA.

143
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:29,279
These are things I can do, and those are the things I focused on when Thomas was alone.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,182
They're squares because squares are what I can do.

145
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:36,707
Now, initially that might sound like I wasn't pushing myself.

146
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,929
But I was pushing myself. I'd never made a game on my own before.

147
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,652
I was definitely trying to do storytelling stuff I'd never done before.

148
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:45,674
I was trying to do various different things.

149
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:49,037
I was making a game on my own time around a full-time day job.

150
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:50,579
I was pushing myself plenty.

151
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:54,923
So I chose an area that made sense, that actually I can be the rectangle game.

152
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:57,565
And it struck me as weird at the time that more people hadn't done it.

153
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,247
And it strikes me as even more weird now.

154
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:03,686
that no one else has. Now, this slide actually became out of date

155
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:06,688
about two days ago when there was a game announced on Greedlight,

156
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,349
which is some aesthetic similarities to Thomas Was Alone,

157
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,071
which I'm not going to talk about.

158
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:16,574
But yeah, it was a way, it was a way of getting the thing done.

159
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:21,037
Now, this is where polish comes in, is if I'd just done a game without rectangles,

160
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:23,819
I think people would rightly have reacted to it kind of negatively.

161
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,100
They would have, they would have seen it as lazy.

162
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:30,760
But so what I did was I decided to do, you know, good animation.

163
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,263
Now the first page of any animation textbook you can pick up

164
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:36,064
is about squash and stretch.

165
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:38,886
It's about this idea that objects retain their mass,

166
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:42,309
but as they move around, if they impact things, they squish a bit.

167
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,911
Usually when they move away from something,

168
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:46,152
there's a moment of elongation,

169
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,734
although it's not as strong as most animation textbooks show.

170
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,377
We just elongate it more to sell it,

171
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:52,878
to make it look more impressive.

172
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,541
So I read the first two pages of every animation textbook I could find.

173
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,048
Um, just, just because, you know, I'm an overachiever.

174
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:05,813
Um, so I, I, I did squash and stretch those rectangles.

175
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,996
Now, what's cool about the second page of any animation textbook

176
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:11,799
is it tells you that eyes are really easy to trick.

177
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,862
Um, I've never been called up for this by anyone

178
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,544
before I pointed it out, but Thomas was Alone

179
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:17,785
doesn't actually have squash and stretch.

180
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:18,385
It has stretch.

181
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,628
Uh, the characters, when they impact, when they land.

182
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:24,087
You never actually see the impact squish the character.

183
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,908
The reason, because from a gameplay point of view,

184
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:27,968
it messed up the kind of the footprint of the character

185
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:28,869
and made it awful.

186
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,550
When you're jumping, the footprint doesn't matter

187
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,690
because you're moving vertically.

188
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,050
So it's fine.

189
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:34,851
So I got away with that.

190
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:36,792
And that's going to be a big theme of this,

191
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:38,112
is things we can get away with.

192
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:40,313
The human eye is very easy to trick,

193
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:41,614
and you can actually usually,

194
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:43,475
through a little sleight of hand,

195
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,896
achieve massive benefits from smaller beginnings.

196
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:54,063
Speaking of big benefits, this is my voice actor from Thomas Was Alone, Danny Wallace,

197
00:09:54,804 --> 00:10:00,549
who is actually legally a king of a small country that he set up in the UK in his flat

198
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:06,353
as part of a hilarious TV show. And it's true, he actually does, well I think actually he moved

199
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:10,817
out of that flat. I've not followed up with him what happened to that, but that's fine.

200
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:14,133
He's a voice actor. He's a very good voice actor.

201
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,293
He does a lot of TV in the UK.

202
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:17,774
He's very cool.

203
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:21,735
To Americans, he's usually more known as, well,

204
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,535
some people think he's Wheatley from Portal, which he isn't.

205
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:26,476
He really isn't.

206
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:31,317
But he's Sean Hastings in the Assassin's Creed series,

207
00:10:31,337 --> 00:10:32,617
so that's where a lot of people know him from.

208
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:35,158
And they do a reasonably good approximation of his face

209
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,438
in that game as well, so people tend to recognize him from that.

210
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,092
Now, voiceover was interesting.

211
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,592
Voiceover's something that came to me

212
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,053
very late in the day when Thomas was alone,

213
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:44,694
and again, it's something that I'm very surprised

214
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,335
more indies don't take advantage of.

215
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,876
Three years ago, it wasn't being done by many games,

216
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:51,277
and to be honest, it's still not being done.

217
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:52,057
We see a few.

218
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:54,799
There's a Wil Wheaton-voiced tactical shooter

219
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:55,639
that looks really cool.

220
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,920
There's a few things.

221
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,801
But voiceover isn't often used,

222
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,241
and I think the reason for that

223
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,723
is that people think it's expensive.

224
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:04,844
People think that voice acting's expensive.

225
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:05,624
They look at, you know,

226
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,331
actors, movie stars, and you hear how much so-and-so gets paid for a movie.

227
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,652
They don't really think about actually how much it costs to get a very talented person

228
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:18,193
into a room for an afternoon to record some voiceover for you.

229
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:23,735
I'm not going to talk about actors' rates on stage in front of a GDC audience, but it's

230
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,535
lower than you think, and it's fair.

231
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:29,436
Frankly, it's fair for what they're bringing to the game.

232
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:35,318
If you compare it to the budget for an animator, or the budget for an artist or a coder...

233
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,212
It's an easy trade to make. You can actually look at it and go,

234
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:41,795
you know what, I am getting that amount of value from the actor.

235
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:42,997
It's also scalable.

236
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,622
More so, actually, than artists or animators

237
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:49,546
is the difference in wages, because obviously you have,

238
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:53,371
you know, a jobbing voice actor, like, who's not famous.

239
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:59,536
will do X amount, right up to, you know, if you want to get a Hollywood movie star in

240
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,238
your game, obviously the price goes up.

241
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,645
And it's variable because actors are often used to taking roles that they want at a lower

242
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:06,885
pay.

243
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:08,588
So there's a few ways around it.

244
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:12,683
And a good voice actor who understands the medium can really elevate a game.

245
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:17,504
Danny Wallace actually used to be a video game critic many years ago.

246
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:21,845
So he got the game. He played the game a lot before he voiced it.

247
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,926
He had the soundtrack playing to him in the booth,

248
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:26,687
so he could kind of judge where his voice would sit with it.

249
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,548
He took it very seriously and, you know,

250
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:31,548
created an after-winning performance as a result of that.

251
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:33,455
I just had to slip that in.

252
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:35,296
I apologize.

253
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:36,937
Also, I had to make a joke about it,

254
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,217
because I needed to inhale some air.

255
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:39,718
And I hoped you'd laugh, and you did,

256
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,579
which helped me there.

257
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:41,499
So thank you.

258
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,861
But I didn't inhale enough, so I made another joke.

259
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:45,942
So, anyway, it was fine.

260
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,464
And then I, no, this, this too,

261
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:50,784
we're busy. We've got stuff to do.

262
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,525
So it's possible, is my point.

263
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:53,726
And it scales as the budget does.

264
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,488
So as you find yourself hopefully making

265
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:58,749
subsequent games with maybe a little bit more cash,

266
00:12:59,129 --> 00:12:59,830
you can scale that up.

267
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,110
So Danny did Thomas Was Alone.

268
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,633
He's back in volume, but now we have Charlie MacDonald in it,

269
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:07,475
and Andy Serkis doing the villain, and he's awesome,

270
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,776
and I can't wait to share that stuff.

271
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:12,699
It's possible to scale that up, but you can start very cheap

272
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:16,642
with voiceover, and it immediately makes your game feel much more polished.

273
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,223
Color, or color.

274
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:24,844
Yeah, I don't feel good about this slide.

275
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,387
It's an overlooked issue.

276
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,169
Color theory is old.

277
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,472
There's lots of color theory out there.

278
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:32,654
It's reasonably accessible.

279
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:33,475
You walk into any bookshop,

280
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:35,837
there's gonna be five books targeted at A-level students,

281
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,539
sorry, college students.

282
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:44,053
about it. You can learn in an afternoon the very basics of, you know, secondary tertiary color palettes

283
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:49,335
and, you know, how to actually think about color. And yet none of us do. We look at, we either work

284
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:53,797
with the color palettes that come by default in the software we use. We leave the shadows in Unity

285
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:59,199
to black while they should be blue. If the scene is outdoors, shadows are not black, as my art

286
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:04,162
director tells me on a daily basis. We don't think about this stuff, but it's actually, again, very

287
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:05,462
easy to do. Thomas was alone.

288
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:09,045
I'm not going to claim a level of skill at this.

289
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,728
I had the guy who's now my art director on volume

290
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:14,731
created a palette for it that was cool and consistent

291
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:15,952
and worked across the game.

292
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:17,934
And it made the game look great.

293
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:21,017
Thomas Was Alone has, I believe, 24 colors in it.

294
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:21,478
That's it.

295
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:23,419
That's all we use in Thomas Was Alone.

296
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,942
It's a game that everyone thinks we go through the whole palette.

297
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:26,543
But we actually use 24 colors.

298
00:14:27,724 --> 00:14:29,725
What that does is that means every color in the game

299
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:31,786
sits well with every other color in the game.

300
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,486
Really straightforward stuff that,

301
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:35,567
at Indie Budget, we often don't think about doing.

302
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:38,009
Volume's the same. Volume is, again, 24 colors.

303
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,170
I think we're using the same palette or something very similar.

304
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,611
What's great about doing that is every screenshot

305
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:44,372
looks good when next to every other screenshot

306
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,232
when you're on the Steam shop or whatever.

307
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:48,914
Everything ties together. It looks consistent.

308
00:14:49,494 --> 00:14:52,796
I believe I worked for Nickelodeon at one point on a project.

309
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:55,817
I think every Nickelodeon cartoon is 16 colors total.

310
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:01,958
Which means they can take any character from any Nickelodeon cartoon and put them next to any other character from any other Nickelodeon cartoon, and it all works.

311
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,060
This is stuff that was invented 50 to 100 years ago.

312
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:11,204
Well, it was invented thousands of years ago, but we wrote it down in pretentious textbooks about 50 years ago.

313
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:15,246
We should use that, is my point. It's useful.

314
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:18,192
And you can, you know, there's lots of cheats.

315
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:20,373
You don't have to have a best mate who's good at color theory.

316
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:23,755
You can use things like Adobe Cooler as a good shortcut.

317
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:26,496
I think that's actually where Thomas Was Alone's main characters

318
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:30,038
were just me using a default palette on Cooler when we started.

319
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:30,938
Real games.

320
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:33,320
And what that even means.

321
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,881
We're not doing that conversation, don't worry.

322
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,203
We're not doing the whole what makes a game a real game thing.

323
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,563
We're not talking about that debate.

324
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,564
We're talking about the much more

325
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:49,984
Well, simultaneously more interesting and less interesting debate, which is the average player, how they view a game when they open it up.

326
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:58,331
Whether a game is real or not. Whether it's a professional game. Whether it's something that they can assume is a good game off the bat.

327
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:03,736
That first impression. It's nothing to do with photorealism. It's nothing to do with walking simulators.

328
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:07,095
Polish does this.

329
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:09,816
And there's lots of little bits of Polish that we can do.

330
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,557
They take time, they take a little bit of money,

331
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,698
but they create a much better first impression.

332
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:17,079
I made a list asking a few YouTuber friends,

333
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,460
and I got the usual, you know, field of view,

334
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,441
in-game control rebinding,

335
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:24,042
in-game settings for graphics, effects, windows,

336
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:26,583
full screen UI scaling on desktop,

337
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:28,043
mouse control on menus,

338
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:31,865
raw mouse input versus averaged input,

339
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,826
splash screens, tutorial information, credits.

340
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:39,215
Stuff like that is really good at making things look right.

341
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:43,018
Because, you know, as with this slightly creepy image I found on the Internet,

342
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,059
the second you remove one thing...

343
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:48,730
It just doesn't quite feel like a real game to the person playing,

344
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,591
and you kind of can lose them at the menu screen.

345
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,313
Or at least you can put them in a bad position early on.

346
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:56,774
Anyone who's released a game commercially knows this

347
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,836
because you will have an inbox full of emails

348
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:01,057
about the one thing you forgot to put in your game.

349
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:02,598
With me, it was there was no mouse control

350
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:04,459
in Thomas Was Alone's menu on the desktop.

351
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:05,960
I still get an email every day.

352
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:09,622
I'm not fixing it, though, because I'm an artist.

353
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:19,699
So, the next step really is know what not to polish.

354
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,922
This is, I think, if you take nothing else

355
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:27,407
away from this talk, this is the big one for me.

356
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,469
This is the really, really important one.

357
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,232
The easiest way to polish something

358
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,853
is not to make something unpolished.

359
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,118
It's something that we're all, as game developers, prone to do.

360
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:39,518
Feature creep is real.

361
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:42,380
It's the reason you're not playing volume in 2014.

362
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,962
It's everywhere in the industry.

363
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:46,443
It's fine.

364
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:47,804
It's good.

365
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:49,245
It's where good stuff comes from.

366
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:53,808
But also, with good planning, we can avoid some of the pitfalls.

367
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:56,670
We can actually polish the game by doing less work.

368
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,933
Which, when you're putting the energy and effort that you should be putting into color

369
00:18:00,953 --> 00:18:03,895
palettes, getting animation working with the skills you have.

370
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,904
getting all the menu settings working right.

371
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,147
Not having other jobs to do is a big help.

372
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:14,051
So, I do this all the time.

373
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:16,413
I work around the limitations of the team.

374
00:18:16,673 --> 00:18:18,995
I tend to try and choose two or three skills

375
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:22,158
or things I want to push forward for us on a project

376
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:24,961
because otherwise I'm just making boring things.

377
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:26,943
For myself, I mean, not for the audience.

378
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:28,464
Hopefully I'm never making boring things for the audience.

379
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:34,080
But once I've chosen those things, I'm not going to make risks in other areas.

380
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,863
So, for example, Volume is a game, it's a passion project for me.

381
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:42,985
It's a stealth game kind of owed to the stuff I loved as a kid,

382
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:46,967
which is a story Indies have been telling journalists for a good 20 years now.

383
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,968
It's that, but it is that really.

384
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,430
It's that 15-year-old game I've always wanted to make.

385
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:57,471
I knew I wanted to do quite complex server stuff

386
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:58,952
so we could have user-editable levels.

387
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:00,472
I knew I wanted to be bigger.

388
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,774
I knew I wanted to be more complex

389
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:04,074
from a puzzle point of view

390
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:05,355
and from a mechanic point of view.

391
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,917
I knew I wanted to be less linear than Thomas was alone was.

392
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:10,158
I had a laundry list of lots of things I wanted to do.

393
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:13,100
But I also knew some areas I could stop.

394
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,801
One great thing that I'm incredibly happy with

395
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,062
is we realized very early on

396
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:19,863
how much storytelling we wanted to do in the game.

397
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,447
We wanted, so Thomas was learning to do like a narration,

398
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:24,648
but we wanted to have dialogue,

399
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:27,269
we wanted characters talking to each other in this space.

400
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,071
The problem that presented was lip sync.

401
00:19:33,461 --> 00:19:37,062
I don't know the exact number off the top of my head, but about two hours worth of spoken dialogue in the game.

402
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:43,663
To lip-sync all of that up for each character would present both a technical challenge in terms of rigging up that stuff for the first time,

403
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,984
but also a population challenge, and also lip-sync.

404
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:49,624
It's one of those things that you can't half-do.

405
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,865
You know, if you make it, if it's just a flapping jaw, it doesn't work.

406
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,365
If it's, you know, if it's GTA, it costs a lot of money.

407
00:19:56,385 --> 00:19:59,746
So it was a big scary thing when we were looking at the project at the start.

408
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:03,187
We put a mask on the main character.

409
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:05,214
And that worked.

410
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,917
And that really significantly improved the facial animation we found.

411
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,300
And that worked.

412
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,424
And then other characters became disembodied voices because they were AIs.

413
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,226
We had, yeah, characters with masks.

414
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:22,788
We have one character in the game who's lip-synced.

415
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:24,249
He's on screen for two minutes.

416
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:28,953
So that's quite a good reduction on the lip-sync costs.

417
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:30,614
And what it meant was our animators...

418
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:33,996
and our rigors and all these other kind of professions that would have been

419
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:37,459
hit by that could go and do other things and polish up what we had better.

420
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:41,341
I mean in the end we, through development, we've been pulling the camera angle

421
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:42,462
further and further back.

422
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,645
So really we did, if we'd done lip sync at the start,

423
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:50,307
we'd basically have about three pixels shimmering here

424
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:54,470
for quite a lot of money. Likewise the environment of the game, we knew we wanted to

425
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,491
make something that looked

426
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:58,503
A big visual jump up from Thomas was alone.

427
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:03,146
We wanted something that a more mainstream audience could look at and go, yes, I get

428
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:03,407
this.

429
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:07,369
This is not photorealistic, but it looks like a modern game.

430
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,052
But also we knew the budget that would be associated with that kind of choice.

431
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:17,016
So we came up with a story about a character, one character who's a quote-unquote real character

432
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:19,058
in a big room, a big warehouse.

433
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:21,510
simulating crimes over and over.

434
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,151
Now, what we did was we spent all of our money

435
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:26,293
on the character and the cool environment,

436
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:30,336
but then the rooms you're robbing,

437
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,018
the simulated environments were all very low-poly artwork.

438
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:37,281
We actually hired a PS1 environment artist

439
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:38,882
who's now a teacher in Wales.

440
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:41,183
We were his hobby project.

441
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:44,486
Every Saturday, he'd basically lock himself away

442
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:45,687
in his office and he'd fiddle

443
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:47,448
and make PlayStation 1 art again

444
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:48,308
because it was something he...

445
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:51,338
he always loved and he wanted to get back to it.

446
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:53,799
And it was great because we could basically pay

447
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:56,281
for all his family's holidays for a couple of years

448
00:21:57,142 --> 00:21:59,383
and we got a very efficient person

449
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:00,504
who knew exactly what they were doing

450
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:01,765
because this is how it used to be done.

451
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:04,647
Using skills that a lot of people are having to relearn

452
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:06,709
to get that kind of polygon aesthetic nowadays.

453
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:08,190
So that was cool.

454
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:11,953
My point is choices worked in this case.

455
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:16,016
Choices allowed us to polish the game through a mission

456
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,197
and also through what we chose to put our focus on.

457
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:21,306
So that's all of it, really.

458
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:25,028
The summary is I think polish is important.

459
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:27,410
I think it's crucial to game development.

460
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,931
Whether or not you're going for a punk aesthetic,

461
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:33,774
because I'm absolutely certain every successful punk in history

462
00:22:34,174 --> 00:22:36,155
has been intentional in their practice.

463
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:38,336
They have tried to do the thing they wanted to do,

464
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:40,658
and they have used every tool at their disposal to do it.

465
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:45,712
I think it's cool. I'm going to ask you all, if you want to ask any questions,

466
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:49,716
to go up to the microphones, and we will get started.

467
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:50,837
I think that's how we do things.

468
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:53,480
So if you want to run up to the microphone, please do.

469
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,562
And we can get started.

470
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:58,145
And thank you all for coming. This is my first GDC talk.

471
00:22:58,245 --> 00:22:59,126
I hope it was useful.

472
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:10,152
Awesome, I'm going to try and get through as many as I can.

473
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:10,693
Yes, sir?

474
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:12,554
OK, hello.

475
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:14,496
So we're also working on a game right now.

476
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:16,858
And like everyone else, we want polish,

477
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,299
but we don't have so much time.

478
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,861
So I was wondering what your process is.

479
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:23,323
Do you make a first pass of everything

480
00:23:23,523 --> 00:23:24,564
and then go back and polish?

481
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:27,906
Or do you try to get a certain level on certain things

482
00:23:27,926 --> 00:23:29,287
and then just cut in the end?

483
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,288
Or what is your process?

484
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:38,676
So my process is that I make something and I leave it until I get so sick of how awful it looks that I fix it.

485
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:47,084
I'm not sure that's very good advice though, because that leads to, yes, volume coming 2015.

486
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:48,825
So I don't know what the answer is.

487
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:54,731
I think I'm a big believer that we need to take things to a certain point to know whether they're fun.

488
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:59,915
I mean, I don't believe that you can prototype a game very quickly and know whether that's

489
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,176
going to work because it's an audio-visual medium.

490
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:06,599
Things aren't as fun as they're going to be until they have, you know, audio attached

491
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:09,121
to them and the right animation and the right feel.

492
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,584
I like my approach of iterating, so I throw something in, I fiddle with it when I'm unhappy with it,

493
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:21,548
I'm also throwing new things in, and eventually stuff seems to kind of fall into place,

494
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:24,851
and you realize, yeah, I think there's about nine user gadgets in this game,

495
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:28,413
and there's about 20 environmental interactions, and yeah, that feels about right.

496
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,155
Oh, actually, that one's horrible, get rid of that.

497
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,958
But now we need something to do that, so I'm a bit more...

498
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,373
I'm hoping that that will improve over time, but I've been working in games for eight years

499
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:42,114
now and it hasn't, so I might have to deal with that.

500
00:24:42,174 --> 00:24:45,316
But there is no right answer, is basically the answer to the question.

501
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:46,577
I can only tell you my solution.

502
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:47,478
Thanks.

503
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:48,558
No worries.

504
00:24:48,578 --> 00:24:48,919
Yes, sir?

505
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:49,319
Hi.

506
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:54,022
I was just wondering, how do you approach creating a library of sounds for your game?

507
00:24:54,782 --> 00:24:58,284
Because when I've been working on games, I find if I'm trying to source sounds from the

508
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:02,607
internet, it's incredibly hard to find the one that fits the game just right.

509
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:05,679
No, it is, especially if you're looking at free libraries

510
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:06,380
and things like that.

511
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:10,843
So, Thomas Was Alone was a zero budget game.

512
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:14,326
So I used, is it CFX, this is a room of indies,

513
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:15,687
it's CFXR, right?

514
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,610
That's that one, SFXR.

515
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,391
Actually, no, I think it's CFXR, the one I use,

516
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:21,372
because it's on the Mac.

517
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:22,833
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

518
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,596
Okay, they know I'm wrong.

519
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:32,078
So, yes, I used that, which just made some bleeps and bloops,

520
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,238
which was right for Thomas was alone.

521
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,400
It really annoys my musician, my composer,

522
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,181
when he gets complimented on those sound effects

523
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:38,961
because he hates them.

524
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:42,343
So please, if you ever see him, just say,

525
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:43,844
I loved your sound work in Thomas was alone.

526
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:47,025
It was me in an afternoon on a Sunday sometime.

527
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:50,967
With volume, I hired a sound engineer.

528
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:52,188
Now, what's good about that

529
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:54,129
is if you're working with a freelancer,

530
00:25:55,364 --> 00:26:01,348
Usually they will have licenses to massive libraries, so they will have bought kind of access to one of the big sound libraries

531
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:06,351
and they will have access immediately to

532
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:07,391
1,000 footsteps

533
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:12,094
Much better than any free resource you're going to find online or any kind of Google thing

534
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,275
So if you have the budget for a sound engineer

535
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:20,939
They're probably going to be cheaper to get them to use their access to a sound library and create the thing that's right for you

536
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:28,340
But if you haven't got that budget, I would, this is where I would say this is one of the Kermit the Frog moments.

537
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:37,466
You go maybe in the left angle and you go, well, is there another way of doing sound design on this game that uses found audio or abstract audio or...

538
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:38,888
something else.

539
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:43,129
There's not very good library access for us.

540
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:44,769
I would actually look, though, if you can,

541
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:47,250
at getting library access to those professional libraries,

542
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,090
because it might, again, be cheaper than you'd imagine,

543
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,731
and we'll just give you everything you need

544
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,471
almost instantly.

545
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:54,051
Hope that's useful.

546
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:54,812
Cheers.

547
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:55,372
Hello.

548
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:55,892
Hi.

549
00:26:56,372 --> 00:26:58,032
Can you talk about polish in the writing?

550
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:00,433
The writing in the narration is really crisp and beautiful

551
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,313
and kind of what your polish process was there.

552
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:04,474
And then anything you did with your composer

553
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:05,794
that you would consider polish?

554
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:08,784
I play the score in my car while I drive.

555
00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:09,944
Like, how do you get it to that?

556
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:10,764
Well, that's very kind.

557
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:13,465
So, I'll answer the music one first,

558
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:14,745
because that's easy.

559
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:15,806
My composer's a genius.

560
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,047
That's the answer.

561
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,867
I honestly, the process I have with the composer

562
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:23,308
is we start a project.

563
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:26,889
I send him kind of a Spotify playlist of,

564
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:29,230
hey, here's 10 tracks I think are about right for the game.

565
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,250
Can you do something along those lines, please?

566
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,851
He then ignores that email.

567
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:38,825
He gets to the bottom of what I don't know that I want, but actually I want.

568
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:42,970
And then he produces over the course of a year or two the music I need for the game.

569
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:44,873
And very rarely I give feedback.

570
00:27:45,594 --> 00:27:49,178
Sometimes if something feels like it jars with gameplay, I'll say something.

571
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:50,339
But on the whole...

572
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,788
Yeah, sorry, it's a really bad advice because...

573
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:56,150
Hire David J. Houston, would be my tip.

574
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,513
But don't for a while, because he's got quite a few bits more to do on volume.

575
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:02,977
The other part, the writing, that's just iteration.

576
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:05,679
And writing is very iterative, if you do it right.

577
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,283
I think Thomas Was Alone's script was about 30 redrafts.

578
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:12,766
That's quite light, actually, on a volume we went through.

579
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,731
I don't want to think about how many redrafts Volume had.

580
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:17,692
And actually I brought in a story consultant,

581
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:18,612
Mattie Bryce.

582
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:20,613
That's my second name drop of her on stage.

583
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:21,714
She's brilliant. Hire her.

584
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,595
She came in for a few days and kind of

585
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:26,656
went, well, maybe this bit's not working,

586
00:28:26,756 --> 00:28:27,776
or maybe you should dodge that.

587
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:28,776
That kind of thing.

588
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,962
So it's really just iteration.

589
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,144
It's just you start, you just write the awful hack version

590
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:35,904
of the script, and then you go through and go,

591
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:37,865
yeah, it makes, why is he doing that?

592
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,506
You know when you watch a movie, and you're like,

593
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41,987
I don't understand why that character's behavior has changed?

594
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:45,209
You do that to your own work for about 40 times,

595
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,150
and you'll introduce problems, you'll fix it.

596
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,670
It's honestly like bug fixing,

597
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:52,912
only you get slightly more praise for it than bug fixing,

598
00:28:52,952 --> 00:28:53,452
which is nice.

599
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:55,853
But yes, that's it basically.

600
00:28:56,785 --> 00:29:00,030
Cheers. I've been doing this whole talk, and I've just realized this isn't my mic. This is my mic.

601
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,058
I could be over here.

602
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:13,257
Yes, you mentioned the voiceover as being a big part of the polish and I agree and for our project we plan to do

603
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:17,961
Things of that nature. We're wondering about localization and being an indie game

604
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:22,084
You might not have to think about translating your voice over to many languages

605
00:29:22,424 --> 00:29:27,427
But I was wondering if it affected the reach of your product or if you had to do anything after the fact to make sure

606
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:31,390
That your game was still understandable to other audiences that speak different languages

607
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,673
That's incredibly, I'm really liking the movement.

608
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,734
That's incredibly, that's actually,

609
00:29:36,914 --> 00:29:38,455
it actually feels weird now I'm calling attention to it.

610
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:41,778
That's, it's incredibly true of actually conversations

611
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:42,759
we're having now with volume,

612
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,140
and whether we're gonna do voiceover localization.

613
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:46,582
When Thomas was alone, I was a bit of a,

614
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:48,263
a bit of an asshole really.

615
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:50,104
I basically went, no, it's Danny Wallace,

616
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,425
or it's not at all, and Danny Wallace

617
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:52,686
doesn't speak all those languages.

618
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:54,167
So we went, well, then we're not doing

619
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:55,148
voiceover localization.

620
00:29:55,408 --> 00:29:56,949
And we did, you know, the standard e-figs.

621
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,052
Sorry, English, French, Italian, Spanish, German,

622
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:00,612
everywhere.

623
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,413
But, you know, it was only text.

624
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:07,495
With volume, we're taking a couple approaches.

625
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:09,057
We're thinking about voiceover,

626
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:11,138
and we're currently looking at some of the pricing on that.

627
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:12,099
It's quite expensive.

628
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:13,701
We're not going to do it at launch, though.

629
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:15,422
I would suggest voiceover is something

630
00:30:15,462 --> 00:30:16,923
you can actually do as updates later.

631
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:18,885
And from a PR point of view,

632
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:20,066
there's probably a good argument

633
00:30:20,426 --> 00:30:22,068
for launching the game, making a lot of noise,

634
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:25,731
and then as you do each VO kind of update...

635
00:30:26,384 --> 00:30:28,586
You can then target the press in each of those countries and go,

636
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:31,028
and now it's in whatever, you know.

637
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:33,270
Insert the name of the language there.

638
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,494
So do you suggest, say if our native language is going to be English for the game,

639
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:39,476
should we ship the game with no voiceover at all?

640
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:42,983
No, I would ship it with English voiceover.

641
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:45,944
Because actually, and it's embarrassing as an English speaker,

642
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:50,226
other countries are far better at putting up with our crap than we would be.

643
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:53,168
They are fine with English voiceover,

644
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:55,449
to the extent that actually I find it embarrassing

645
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:59,271
that I'm not okay with, you know, with subtitles in games

646
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,991
when it's spoken in a different language.

647
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:02,325
But they are.

648
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,488
The other thing we're doing with volume is user-editable language.

649
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:06,769
So you're going to be...

650
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:09,952
So on console it's different, but on PC players will be able to

651
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:12,414
literally open up the text file for the subtitles

652
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:14,636
and make their own fan subtitles.

653
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:15,437
That's amazing.

654
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:18,500
Which is going to be great for the people who take us seriously,

655
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,283
but the Klingon version is going to be awesome.

656
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:23,465
I'm getting a gesture, I don't know what it means.

657
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:25,627
Does that mean stop, or does that mean one more question?

658
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:27,168
One more question.

659
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:28,660
You're the lucky guy.

660
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:29,802
Oh, awesome.

661
00:31:29,882 --> 00:31:35,691
So just more on voiceover, did you do pickups for Thomas Was Alone and what was your process

662
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:39,297
for doing essentially retakes of pickups?

663
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:42,768
Pickups. So Thomas was alone, we had no budget.

664
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:46,790
Like we literally did a crowdfund, and we got enough money to basically,

665
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,391
because VO Studio, if you do it right, costs quite a bit of money as well.

666
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:50,832
And I would recommend that people do.

667
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:55,394
You can tell when something's recorded, even if it's that nice mic that's in all of the

668
00:31:55,714 --> 00:32:00,177
podcasting videos, even then you can tell the difference between that and a professional studio.

669
00:32:00,897 --> 00:32:03,818
So we basically got enough money for a professional studio and four hours.

670
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:08,820
Three hours of Danny's time so we had no pickups on that game at all

671
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,300
That was just simply not an option

672
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,861
Luckily Danny's really good

673
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:16,642
And did a good job, but even then like those you know things

674
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:21,803
I listen back to Thomas was alone and just a couple of reads that I would tweak and change with volume

675
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:26,044
We decided not to do pickups. What I did instead was I did rehearsals

676
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:30,345
So we got Danny and Charlie we rented out a drama studio

677
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:38,285
Like, I say drama, we owned our small office in London for the day and then we had these

678
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:43,050
two going through, repeating over and over again, going through, having big conversations

679
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,373
about what the arcs of the characters were, getting their performances right between us.

680
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,636
And Danny was awesome because Charlie hadn't acted in a game before.

681
00:32:50,237 --> 00:32:53,139
So he was kind of nervous and Danny kind of helped him kind of work things out

682
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:58,082
Which was amazing of him and way beyond kind of what we were paying him for frankly, which is great

683
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:01,185
Andy circus is Andy circus

684
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:06,949
So he just kind of came in with a three-hour slot recorded all those lines in two hours

685
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,991
It was amazing and then he left so that was an easier process

686
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:15,715
But yeah, so we don't do pickups now. I think actually honestly

687
00:33:16,582 --> 00:33:19,484
That's a gap in our process and that's something I'd like to address with future games.

688
00:33:19,824 --> 00:33:25,086
Because I think it's something that, again, for the cost of actually doing it, it would be worth it.

689
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:28,348
So don't take my advice. Do pickups. Not like me.

690
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:32,049
And I think that's all we have time for. Thank you so much. You've been an amazing audience. Cheers.

691
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,430
And I still think this is the mic.
