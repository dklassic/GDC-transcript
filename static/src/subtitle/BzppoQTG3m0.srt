00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:12,169
Hi. Hey. So my name is Ryan Stevenson and I'm Art Director at the game studio Rare.

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,151
And today I'm going to be talking to you about the art of adventure on Sea of Thieves.

3
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:20,174
I'm going to be covering some of the visual pillars that we made during the making of the

4
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:25,316
project. Also showing you some of the early work around creating the visuals and some things that

5
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:31,179
have never been seen before. So to begin with, who in the room has actually played Sea of Thieves?

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,721
Ah! Say an ah!

7
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:35,834
Nice, very pirate-y.

8
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:39,397
So, well, release day was actually yesterday.

9
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:40,498
Brilliant.

10
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:41,699
Thank you.

11
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:51,127
So to begin with, I thought as a reminder to everyone, is to start with the launch gameplay

12
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:51,507
trailer.

13
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,081
Yay, yes sir.

14
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:10,261
Woo!

15
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:10,381
Woo!

16
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:10,461
Woo!

17
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:10,781
Woo!

18
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:16,425
Woo!

19
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:16,505
Woo!

20
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:16,865
Woo!

21
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:19,967
So, to talk about the art journey of Sea of Thieves,

22
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:22,028
I need to tell you a little bit about the studio first,

23
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:25,190
and also about how we came to make this pirate adventure game.

24
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,812
So, I joined the studio 17 years ago,

25
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:29,413
but that's nothing compared to Rare,

26
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:31,355
who's been around for over 30 years now.

27
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:33,436
And we have a rich history of games

28
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:35,257
with a wide range of themes,

29
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:38,019
so hopefully you're familiar with some of these games.

30
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:44,626
and as you can see that there's a wide variety of different genres and there's also different themes within it.

31
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:50,609
As you can see we like to experiment and I think it also speaks to the fact we like to change what we work on

32
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,610
and how we work at key moments throughout, through the years.

33
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:59,653
And one of those interesting moments came in 2014 when we were just finishing

34
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,634
the Kinect Sports Rivals series of sports games.

35
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:05,796
and we realized that the following year, 2015,

36
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:08,959
was actually going to be the 30th anniversary of Rare.

37
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,461
So we worked on Rare Replay,

38
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,102
which was a collection of games,

39
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,524
of 30 games from 30 years,

40
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:18,926
and those games really speak to the history of the studio

41
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:22,089
and the character and the charm of the studio, I think.

42
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:26,547
So we had this eye on the past, but at the same time as looking at the past,

43
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:30,291
we wanted to think of what the future was going to hold for Rare.

44
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:33,594
So a small group of us came together to define that future,

45
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:36,677
to try and think out what was going to be our next game.

46
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:39,419
And Project Athena was born.

47
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:42,586
Well, kind of.

48
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:44,808
So when we first started Project Athena,

49
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:47,210
we had no preconceived ideas what it could be.

50
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,393
It could be anything from a racing game to an RPG.

51
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:53,575
But what we did have was a design vision.

52
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:59,140
And that design vision was for a group-shaped narrative.

53
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,465
So a group-shaped narrative to us is a game

54
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:05,307
in where the experience of the player changes

55
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:06,888
depending on who they meet within the world

56
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:09,030
and the interaction between those players.

57
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,352
A game where natural conversation was going to be key

58
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:16,075
and also that would cause a wider range of emotions

59
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:16,936
as they played the game.

60
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:21,800
And also, so we did all that,

61
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,262
but we still didn't know what the game was gonna be.

62
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:25,763
So we did have a divine vision,

63
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:27,985
but we still didn't know what to do.

64
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:30,978
So to solve this, we actually created a whole bunch of one

65
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:33,219
sheets that went upon the walls around the studio.

66
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,001
And these one sheets were one page design documents.

67
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,183
And this is the one that we produced for Sea of Thieves.

68
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:39,944
We had hundreds of these upon the walls.

69
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:43,046
But it wasn't until this one went up that we realized that

70
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,087
we'd found our muse.

71
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:47,489
The idea of a group of players working together and

72
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:51,231
communicating to sail a ship and meeting other crews within

73
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:54,513
the world was just perfect for a shared world narrative.

74
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:56,935
We also realized that there was a world where

75
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:01,360
The players would be able to understand the tools and the world quite simply.

76
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,764
So, what do you do with a compass or what do you do with a treasure map?

77
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:10,831
It's pretty obvious and it plays into all those genres and films that you've seen over the years.

78
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:14,415
And there's one other thing that we really liked about this idea.

79
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:17,969
And that's the game series, and that's rare.

80
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,249
So we're actually in the middle of England, nestled

81
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,670
about as far away from water as you possibly can.

82
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:24,891
And the thing we really liked about this idea

83
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:27,412
is that it's no secret, even though we're

84
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:31,214
about as far away from sea as you can get, we love pirates.

85
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,735
We've managed to crowbar pirates into most titles

86
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:34,755
that we've made over the years.

87
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:37,296
My particular favorite is the fact

88
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:39,857
that we've got a zombie pirate in Grabbed by the Ghoulies.

89
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:41,057
That's a haunted house game.

90
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,478
There is no reason why pirates should exist in it,

91
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:44,999
but we still crowbarred it in.

92
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:47,624
So yeah, so that's the reason why.

93
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:49,384
And we just loved them.

94
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:52,305
So we had a vision and we had a theme that we wanted to go after.

95
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:55,105
So the project could really begin.

96
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,966
So at the start we separated it into two different streams.

97
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:02,327
One was going to be creating a lo-fi gameplay prototype.

98
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:06,587
This prototype actually was this rich experience

99
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:11,128
that would feature all of the features that you actually see within the game that you've been playing today.

100
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,791
And that actually stayed with us for a long period during the dev.

101
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:18,873
And the other stream that we created was the visual development stream, so my area.

102
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:27,279
And whenever I like to start a project, I like to start it by defining some art goals

103
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:27,879
and challenges.

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,583
So right at the start, we realized we had two main goals that we wanted to go after

105
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:34,504
with Sea of Thieves.

106
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:37,586
Goal number one was to create a modern rare game.

107
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,528
So we wanted to create a game that spoke to the magic

108
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,530
and charm of the studio, the playful nature

109
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,011
of where we make games.

110
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,973
And also, we wanted something that would redefine visually

111
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,135
what AAA meant to us as a studio.

112
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,737
So a rather lofty ambition.

113
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:56,978
And also from a gameplay point of view, we knew that Sea of Thieves would be a game

114
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,799
where there's going to be a lot of humor.

115
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,863
We wanted to capture that old, rare kind of humor within it as well.

116
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,965
So, and the visuals needed to match the tone.

117
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,460
The second goal, which was really important,

118
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:10,781
was to create a timeless visual art style.

119
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:14,343
So the idea was a timeless visual art style

120
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:17,384
would avoid being outdated by advances in technology,

121
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:20,566
and it would scale quite nicely over different platforms.

122
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:23,467
We're going to be making a game that would be on PC and Xbox.

123
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:26,789
So it would be low spec as well as high spec PC.

124
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:27,929
This approach is actually something

125
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,491
I've used before in the past for Viva Piñata.

126
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:33,212
And if you look at the screenshot,

127
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:34,472
I think it's aged really well.

128
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:35,173
This was taken in 2007.

129
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:41,234
So, and I think it's part of the fact that there's a strong visual stylization to it

130
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,395
that's meant that it's aged nicely.

131
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:46,335
And that's the same thing I wanted to do with Sea of Thieves.

132
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:50,156
So we had our two goals, we also had art challenges as well.

133
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:55,177
I think these, everyone gets these with making games, you get some challenges that just come

134
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:55,577
along the way.

135
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:58,898
But the first one was to capture the magic of a rare game.

136
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,338
Now that sounds strange, I've just talked about capturing that magic, and also had it

137
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:03,038
as the art challenge.

138
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,339
But the reason why it was a challenge is at the start of the project...

139
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,540
it was going to be without any of the normal rare elements.

140
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,341
So we thought we weren't going to have NPCs,

141
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:13,682
we thought we weren't going to have a story

142
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:16,123
behind lots of elements within the world.

143
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,144
So I needed to work out how we were going to get that charm

144
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:21,405
and that character within the players

145
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:22,905
and also the world surrounding them.

146
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:26,106
The other challenge was it was going to be larger

147
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:27,747
than any game we had made before.

148
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,568
Right from the get-go, we knew that this was going to be

149
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:33,069
a massive open world and something we hadn't done.

150
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:37,579
and it was going to be a style of game we'd never made in an engine we'd never used.

151
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,722
So for this we used the Unreal Engine and it was the starting point

152
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:43,544
so we needed to do some learning as well about it.

153
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:49,289
At the start of the project as well, I did a lot of research. So I've watched probably

154
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,471
every single pirate film that you could possibly do.

155
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:56,035
It's not very easy to go out and pretend to be a pirate, so I've decided that was

156
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,076
probably the best way to

157
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:01,159
understand the theme because we wanted something that embraced the tone of the world.

158
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,143
Once we digested all that reference, we started work on the artwork itself.

159
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:13,508
These are some early examples of the concept that was done for the very inception of the project.

160
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,429
My background is that of a concept artist.

161
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:19,612
It's always my go-to at the start of a project, with most development it is.

162
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:25,315
We've also got a great team at the studio that just jumped at the challenge of creating an adventure game.

163
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:29,339
So we explored the islands and whether there was volcanoes,

164
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:31,981
there was an early idea of what the edge of the world could be like.

165
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:36,446
And here's some early explorations into characters as well.

166
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:40,249
So we were really trying to find the themes.

167
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:42,691
Well, we were trying to find what kind of pirates these were going to be,

168
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:43,432
whether they were going to be...

169
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:47,939
and heroic, or when there were going to be dirty rotten pirates, which we ended up leaning

170
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,144
towards, or how characterful they were going to be, whether they were going to be really

171
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:54,526
cartoony or whether they were going to be fairly realistic.

172
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:59,792
Through all this work and all this concept development, we started to create the art

173
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,112
pillars.

174
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:07,944
So the art pillars, with projects, there's always the overarching pillars of the project.

175
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:11,965
There's always the design direction, the gameplay, the engineering, something that ties it all

176
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:12,285
together.

177
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:16,987
But I also like to create individual art pillars for the art team that sits alongside it and

178
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:18,627
supports all of those themes.

179
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,109
And I like to create the art pillars based around the goals and the challenges that I've

180
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:23,809
already mentioned.

181
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:27,343
And I also like to create the rule of three.

182
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:29,185
So like with anything, three is always good.

183
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:30,327
And if you're an artist, you know,

184
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:33,051
aesthetically three things together is a nice balance.

185
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:37,523
So this is the first pillar that defined the look of Sea of Thieves.

186
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:41,284
So visual pillar number one is an illustrative approach.

187
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:45,946
So in Sea of Thieves we wanted to suggest structure and detail rather than define it.

188
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:51,369
Granular noise is removed and replaced with a more expressive approach to textures.

189
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,251
These are combined with simple construction to create a rich and vibrant world.

190
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:02,334
So this pillar was created to create that timeless art style that I've mentioned earlier.

191
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:09,212
So the simplification that I'm talking about is, in a good example here, is where the silhouette

192
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:10,753
of the forms are kept quite clean.

193
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:17,018
Something I'm a big believer in is that you can get nice visual complexity through combining

194
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:18,019
simplified forms.

195
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,483
One problem that I've seen over the years, and I've done it myself, is as a concept artist

196
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:23,404
you'll create a nice...

197
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:27,368
image and then you start extracting all those elements out and working up the

198
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:29,350
design for each of those individual elements

199
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,513
and you end up pouring tons of detail within those elements and then sticking it all back

200
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:33,854
together

201
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:37,958
and the final image is nothing like what you started with because you just

202
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:41,261
added so much noise into those individual elements when they recombined.

203
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,201
So here's an example of the do's and don'ts.

204
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:47,604
So obviously that palm tree over there,

205
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:49,886
over on the left, is very noisy.

206
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:52,889
It's got lots of detail within the bark.

207
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,732
Where on the right, it's far more simplified.

208
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,023
There was something that I was, we were aware of as well,

209
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:03,284
is that by simplifying the form,

210
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,524
we would end up with a surface detail

211
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:07,685
that could end up looking very tube-like

212
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:11,086
or quite a bit too simple, really.

213
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:13,206
So what we ended up doing was looking at

214
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:15,067
how we could add fasted surfaces

215
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:16,667
within those details as well.

216
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:19,048
So from a distance, the form would be fairly simple,

217
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:20,048
and then as you get closer,

218
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:24,849
you'd see a nice surface within the objects themselves.

219
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:34,746
We also, from the simplified forms, we also wanted to capture an interesting aesthetic within the textures.

220
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:41,571
So it was inspired by concept painting, where you can get very brushmarky and very expressive

221
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:44,233
with a lot of the different elements within it.

222
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:50,318
It's a way of making sure that the world is simplified but never flat,

223
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:53,660
because those textures have that detail level within it.

224
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:58,638
Another aspect of the inspiration for this was by...

225
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:03,563
I'm going to attempt the name, Kazuo-san,

226
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,444
who, he's a renowned painter of background and layout

227
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:07,485
for studio Ghibli films.

228
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:08,986
This one's from Spirited Away.

229
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:12,768
I think a lot of people find Ghibli films quite inspiring

230
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:13,928
and take a lot from it.

231
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:15,849
The thing that I thought was really interesting

232
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:18,451
was how the surface of the wall

233
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:20,232
has lots of different values and hues within it,

234
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:22,173
and there's also these brush marks.

235
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:24,434
And around the door, there's some nice,

236
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:27,135
really defined, called-out areas of wear and tear.

237
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:30,298
This was something that we wanted to try and capture within Sea of Thieves.

238
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,801
So for this we did some early tests on texturing.

239
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:36,604
So an expressive texturing approach.

240
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:40,207
You can see that the rock at the top and how it is at the bottom

241
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,229
and also how we're removing detail from the leaves.

242
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:45,352
These were really early on so we did evolve slightly from this

243
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:47,133
but it shows you the initial outset.

244
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,248
The next image is when they started to all come together.

245
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:54,228
So this is actually an image taken from a game capture

246
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,029
with renders added to it and paint overs

247
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:59,290
to try and stop pulling together that vision

248
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,850
to really try and define what it could look like.

249
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,551
Here's some call outs to those areas within the brush marks,

250
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:08,552
so the way the brush marks are on the palm

251
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:13,933
or the palm tree trunk, and also the rocks.

252
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:21,682
Another aspect of the simplification that we were looking at was how we could reduce

253
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:23,804
noise within blocks of color.

254
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:28,731
So what I mean by that is that the, for instance if you look at the palm tree, you've obviously

255
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:34,118
got that very big green top and the trunk itself is made mainly from brown notes and

256
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:34,378
colors.

257
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:38,100
The same thing with the grass, it's got quite a purity to it.

258
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:42,062
The idea around this is that you get a clean color read from each of those objects, so

259
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:46,644
we're not spreading lots of different colors over the trunk of the tree, it's not got green

260
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:48,925
moss going up it, it's not blurring altogether.

261
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:54,207
So the idea would be that if you actually do blur the image and blur the internal detail,

262
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:59,309
it still gives you that read of that environment, because it's staying pure to it.

263
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,730
So as an example of these rules in action,

264
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,611
I'm going to show you two images.

265
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:06,252
So this is the first one.

266
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,515
So that's one of the many chests that you can find in Sea of Thieves.

267
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:13,017
So those of you who have played the game

268
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,258
will have probably found this in the world and run around with it.

269
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,861
And here's another version of that image.

270
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,422
So for the keen eyes amongst you, you'll

271
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,484
realize the first one is a concept art,

272
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:26,165
and the second one is a 3D model.

273
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,984
So this was the really kind of high five moment for us in the game.

274
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:33,826
We'd really managed to achieve the ability to get that textures,

275
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:37,409
the simplified look, the separation of the colors within the object.

276
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,132
So that was quite a key moment when we realized we could do this.

277
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,334
And this was the right approach.

278
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:47,758
Another important part for me about creating an illustrative approach

279
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,519
was the way we treated lighting.

280
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,522
So I like to think of it as painting with light.

281
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:56,085
So it was such an important part of the world.

282
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,346
We wanted the world to be vibrant and expressive,

283
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:00,647
and we wanted the world to heighten the emotions

284
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:01,427
when you're on the sea.

285
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:03,728
So those storms that were dark and moody

286
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:05,009
and those beautiful sunsets,

287
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:09,311
they were all derived to make you feel those emotions

288
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:09,931
when you look at them.

289
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:17,893
And the inspiration for that came from looking at color keys found within 3D animation movies.

290
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:22,074
Just love the way that they push the vibrancy within it,

291
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:26,056
and also where they're not hindered by overly realistic lighting.

292
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:30,477
They do heighten it to make them a motion of that moment within the film.

293
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:34,838
These images are from my favorite, one of my favorite artists, which is Nathan Foulkes.

294
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:36,719
I really recommend you go and look at him.

295
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,780
He's got amazing charcoal work, and his color keys are phenomenal.

296
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,142
So, the ones down in the corner here, so there's two of the images are from Rio.

297
00:16:44,943 --> 00:16:48,905
The one in the bottom right is from Puss in Boots and the top one I think is from Spirit.

298
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:53,128
But yeah, I just love the way that that worked and we wanted to capture a bit of that within the world.

299
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,589
So, here are first tests doing that.

300
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,172
So, we were looking at the way that the light could change one environment,

301
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:03,895
how by having those different colored keys within the world, we can make the mood change.

302
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:05,956
So, these were the first early tests of that.

303
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,932
And here it is applied to a three-dimensional environment.

304
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:13,513
So this was taken from my diorama.

305
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:16,795
And you can see that we were playing

306
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:17,736
with the colors there again.

307
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,976
And we were also looking at the way

308
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,877
that weather changes a location.

309
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:24,479
By having it rainy, you could get a different emotion.

310
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,760
I just looked out in the crowd.

311
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,861
There was one of our tech art directors

312
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,922
was just smiling at me, because you can remember this

313
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:30,602
from back in the day.

314
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:35,305
And this leads me nicely to what I'm going to show you next,

315
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:35,885
which is the.

316
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:39,787
Engine, Viz, Dev.

317
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:42,628
Or getting to know Unreal.

318
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:45,610
So obviously, we needed to get to know Unreal as a studio.

319
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,331
The art team had never used it before.

320
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:49,532
Maybe some of them had used it in passing,

321
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:53,315
but a lot of us had not used it to make a main game.

322
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,702
So we decided the best thing was to create a small diorama, a little chunk of land

323
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:01,864
where we could test out all these theories that I've been talking about.

324
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:04,445
We could test the texturing, the simplification,

325
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:07,746
and just some of the tech that we were playing with at the time.

326
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,228
So I'm going to let that play for you now.

327
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:16,430
So that was our first test to prove this all out.

328
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,411
As you can see, it contained a lot of interesting things

329
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,191
within it with the simplification that I talked about,

330
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,372
but it also had two elements that turned out

331
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,732
to be really important for the game.

332
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,713
And also leads me quite nicely to my next art pillar,

333
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:33,855
which is pillar number two, a sea of motion.

334
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,701
So, in Sea of Thieves, clouds form and waves crash

335
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:40,641
and also sails billow in the wind.

336
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:43,342
The plants would sway in the breeze as well.

337
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:44,582
From the swell of an ocean

338
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:46,783
to the swinging of lanterns below deck,

339
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:47,903
the world was never still.

340
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:51,243
This is especially prominent in the water

341
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:53,604
and also the sky, weather, and the passage of time.

342
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:55,684
So this was really important

343
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:57,124
to create that sense of a living world

344
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:59,525
and that drama of being on a pirate ship,

345
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:01,045
sailing through the waves.

346
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,123
and it became quite obvious when you look at a screenshot of what the game looked like

347
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,305
and we could see this within the prototype early on

348
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:14,209
that there is a lot of water, there is a lot of sky

349
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,370
so that was going to be our world

350
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,734
it was a world where you could go to islands but the player would see this a lot of the

351
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:20,954
time

352
00:20:20,974 --> 00:20:22,355
so there's a big chunk of boat as well

353
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,318
but if the player was to look to the right or to the left

354
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:26,659
they'd end up seeing this

355
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,662
so again, more sky, more water

356
00:20:30,822 --> 00:20:34,164
So we knew that this was going to be a really important part of the game.

357
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:40,186
So the sea was going to be this big powerful character within the world.

358
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:44,407
We wanted it to be dynamic and also feel like its own entity.

359
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:49,209
It had a power to force the player around in the world so as their boat is crashing through the waves.

360
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:52,433
triggering these emotions as you ride over the crest.

361
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:55,996
And it also became one of our highest visual bars within the game.

362
00:20:57,317 --> 00:21:00,659
And it varied from appearance depending where it was in the world, so from calm

363
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:02,160
lagoons to big storms

364
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:03,961
to just the open sea.

365
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:05,883
So...

366
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:08,905
there is an action.

367
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:13,208
So, interestingly enough, I spent quite a long time thinking about

368
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:15,490
water and how stylized it should be within the world.

369
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:21,258
I did experiment with creating something more stylized,

370
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:24,899
but realized that as soon as you start removing

371
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,760
some of the essence of what water is from it,

372
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,860
it just didn't feel like that element anymore.

373
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,321
And you actually see that with, again,

374
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:33,641
in animated 3D films, I'm a big fan of them,

375
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,822
and you can see that water within it

376
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:38,162
is often treated as realistic water.

377
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,863
And the reason for that is because

378
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:42,183
it just doesn't feel right if you change it.

379
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:47,906
But we did add stylization to it, so it's fairly realistic in the way that it moves and acts.

380
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,128
But the way that the light cascades through it,

381
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,329
and also the tones and colours that we added to it,

382
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,990
each of those things are hand-done

383
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,033
to create that sense of an expressive painterly kind of quality.

384
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:03,155
Also, the seafoam as well has got a very defined pattern within it

385
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:07,938
that we repeat to kind of mimic the paint marks

386
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:10,059
that you find within the textures as well.

387
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:16,050
So there's the water and now I'm going to show you another video which is just focused on the water.

388
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,931
So enjoy our lovely waves.

389
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:19,632
Everyone always says they're beautiful.

390
00:22:56,745 --> 00:22:59,407
Okay.

391
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:24,066
Thank you very much.

392
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:25,588
We have got a great rendering team

393
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:26,369
that put that all together,

394
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:29,854
but it really was a huge effort from both the rendering team,

395
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,538
also the tech artists, the lighting people,

396
00:23:32,698 --> 00:23:34,801
and there were so many people involved in creating that.

397
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,828
So going back to that image, we'd sorted the water,

398
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:40,930
we'd obviously, that's in the bag,

399
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,072
but we'd got the big sky above it.

400
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:45,894
And we also knew that that wanted to be a character as well,

401
00:23:46,194 --> 00:23:47,836
as equally as powerful as the water.

402
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:50,898
So for this, we looked at lots of reference

403
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,319
to try and get inspiration.

404
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,321
And through looking at this reference,

405
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:57,224
it became quite obvious that we wanted the sky

406
00:23:57,304 --> 00:24:00,126
to have these big, bold forms within it,

407
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:03,169
and then to almost have a sculptural quality.

408
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:08,448
They should grow and change and dissipate and even cast shadows across the environment.

409
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:13,071
The sky needed to not only create a sense of wonder, but also fear.

410
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:16,714
The moment that you sail into a storm, how does that really feel?

411
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:22,318
So with that, we decided we needed to try something a little bit different.

412
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:26,566
which was to create large geometric, geometry-based clouds.

413
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,709
So this was early concept for how that could look.

414
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:33,691
And the idea was that I painted all these different

415
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:37,193
big shapes out and looked at how they just disappeared

416
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:41,096
into the horizon, also how that they would be really nice

417
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:43,657
as you sailed underneath them and they passed overhead.

418
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,439
This was how that they should look in the game

419
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:48,160
in the sense that they were more fluffy

420
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,481
and more kind of like expressive.

421
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,946
So that was the early exploration into that.

422
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:58,950
By having large geometry-based clouds, we also realized that we could do some quite

423
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,710
interesting things.

424
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:05,075
Maybe we could make a skull appear in the clouds, which would be quite an interesting

425
00:25:05,115 --> 00:25:05,295
thing.

426
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:07,838
And this was an early idea for Skull Island.

427
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:10,180
We realized that we wanted to put a skull island in the game.

428
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,041
It has to be in every pirate trope.

429
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:18,412
But rather than have a big island carved out of a skull, we thought how about having a

430
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:19,272
big cloud above it.

431
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:24,956
This was an idea early on that actually got used later within the development for something

432
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:25,216
else.

433
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:28,238
Who's attacked a skelly fort?

434
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:29,038
Has anyone done that?

435
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,080
So for those of you that don't know,

436
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,481
if you sail across the waves,

437
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:34,742
you can see a big skull on the horizon.

438
00:25:35,303 --> 00:25:36,984
It's the sign that a skelly fort

439
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,485
has appeared within the world,

440
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,826
and you can go and battle the skeletons within it

441
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,708
and maybe steal their riches.

442
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:46,370
So again, I've got another short video to show you,

443
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,732
which is the clouds in action.

444
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:53,736
Here we go.

445
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:36,713
a

446
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:39,495
a

447
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:42,036
a

448
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:43,057
a

449
00:26:43,197 --> 00:26:44,118
a

450
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:44,338
a

451
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:44,858
a

452
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:45,438
a

453
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:49,101
a

454
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:49,301
a

455
00:26:49,481 --> 00:26:49,981
a

456
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:50,642
a

457
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:13,199
you

458
00:27:28,742 --> 00:27:31,547
We even had some really interesting fun tests of putting

459
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:33,971
the shape of a ship in the sky as well.

460
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:36,334
So we really did just throw lots of things within it to

461
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:37,036
see what would happen.

462
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:40,000
Again, the tech art team put this together.

463
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,464
It was a phenomenal piece of work.

464
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:47,877
Alongside those clouds, the clouds, the water,

465
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:52,739
I also wanted a world in which there was just that sense of movement within it.

466
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:57,240
So I've mentioned those big, bold things, but also the little things were important.

467
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:00,942
The world needed to have a sense of life.

468
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:03,923
And I think through those small little moments, it just shows you how.

469
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:07,484
how just it's peaceful to watch it just move.

470
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:10,245
There was one moment where we didn't have the trees swaying

471
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,645
in the breeze and they just felt like concrete.

472
00:28:13,006 --> 00:28:15,326
And as soon as we turned it on and we actually got it in,

473
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:17,107
they just started to really move

474
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:18,627
and it just felt so beautiful.

475
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:21,488
You almost kind of realized how much you'd missed it

476
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:22,088
when it wasn't there.

477
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:25,149
So I'm now gonna...

478
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:28,546
As this is playing, I'm going to talk about something else

479
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,767
I'm going to share with you next, which

480
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:32,228
is something we've never actually shared outside

481
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:37,751
of the studio before, which is the art CG trailer.

482
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:42,354
So really early on, we'd obviously

483
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:44,175
were developing the art style.

484
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,496
We had this prototype that was going

485
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,357
to be rich with gameplay that was developing

486
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:49,418
and really powering along.

487
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:53,478
But we needed to prove out more of the art style.

488
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:57,001
We weren't actually building all of the world at that point.

489
00:28:57,442 --> 00:29:00,104
So we tested out on the small island, we created the rules,

490
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:02,406
we'd done a few art tests ourselves,

491
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:05,208
and we needed to test those theories more.

492
00:29:05,848 --> 00:29:08,931
So for it, we decided to create a CGI trailer.

493
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,132
And we actually worked with a partner

494
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:12,334
we've used several times in the UK, which is real time.

495
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:18,539
And to begin with, we started by just exploring more areas that could exist within this trailer.

496
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,143
So we looked at islands, we looked at the clouds again.

497
00:29:21,163 --> 00:29:27,331
We looked at what it would feel like below the ship, so how it's kind of all cozy and

498
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:30,135
warm and also that close feeling compared to the outside.

499
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:37,062
We looked at moments of finding areas of interest, such as an undead pirate captain that would be sitting on a throne.

500
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:40,866
We also started working on defining our characters even more.

501
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:45,830
So, this is the first three characters that really started to get that Sea of Thieves style.

502
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,595
And I'll talk a little bit more about why they have the Sea of Thieves style in a bit.

503
00:29:52,602 --> 00:29:56,168
And through making this trailer, we were able to test things out,

504
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,851
such as our lighting that I've mentioned,

505
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:01,737
and also take some of our early block-out models of the ship

506
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:03,240
and really work them up.

507
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:06,185
So for example, like this ship here.

508
00:30:07,717 --> 00:30:12,264
And we also looked at early aspects of what our first kraken could look like.

509
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:15,970
So there's some of the exploration about what a tentacle would look like.

510
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,895
Through this process I found it immensely useful.

511
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:21,759
We were able to prove out lots of different ideas.

512
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:25,214
and also give lots of different feedback,

513
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,935
play around with the different approaches to things,

514
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:29,636
look at the way we're treating decks of the ship,

515
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:32,117
look at the way that we're building the world,

516
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:34,038
look at the detail, even the angle of the ship

517
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:34,978
and the twist of the ship,

518
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:38,080
the way that it was made to feel a little bit rickety.

519
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,181
So I'm gonna play that video now,

520
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:42,462
but I'm not actually gonna show you the full trailer.

521
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:44,283
What I'm gonna show you is parts of it

522
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:46,164
and also some of the tests that were made through it,

523
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:47,524
because I think that was the important part.

524
00:30:47,925 --> 00:30:49,305
It was proving out these theories.

525
00:32:37,642 --> 00:32:38,364
always end on a bang.

526
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:43,692
So, yeah, so that was a really, really fun thing to do

527
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:47,158
and I feel immensely lucky in my job to be able to go and.

528
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,372
explore visuals like that.

529
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:53,434
So now we're gonna come to one of our last pillars,

530
00:32:53,574 --> 00:32:55,236
which is a world of stories.

531
00:32:56,336 --> 00:32:57,857
So as I mentioned before,

532
00:32:58,218 --> 00:33:00,960
we were gonna be making this characterful rare game,

533
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,481
but it was going to not have any NPCs in it,

534
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:05,062
and it wasn't gonna have any of the normal rare thing

535
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:05,683
that we were gonna have.

536
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,105
We did get it, we did actually start adding it in,

537
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:10,466
we realized how important it was to it.

538
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,268
But right at the beginning,

539
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:14,249
we needed to work out how to make that feeling

540
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:15,650
come across through the entire world.

541
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:22,134
So we knew that the pirates were going to have these really fun adventures,

542
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:27,159
and they were going to have really nice locations to go to and explore,

543
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:31,582
that would have this sense of story, have this sense of history within it.

544
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:35,986
But we also wanted to make that character and that story and that rare charm

545
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:38,708
sing through every single aspect of the game.

546
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:43,874
So, for this, we made it so that every single item has its own story.

547
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,238
So, as you can see, there's a shovel and a blunderbuss,

548
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:51,081
and the way in which it has a sense of history to it.

549
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:54,565
And this was applied to every single item within the game.

550
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,702
and every single part that we actually built.

551
00:33:58,442 --> 00:33:59,863
So nothing was new as well.

552
00:34:00,384 --> 00:34:02,745
So this is a fairly kind of shiny sword,

553
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,867
but it has a sense that it's got chips in it,

554
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:07,108
it's got dents in it, it's been used before.

555
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,991
The idea was that you'd have stolen it from another crew

556
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:12,372
or found it within the world.

557
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:14,714
So everything in Sea of Thieves is secondhand.

558
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,996
The idea of Sea of Thieves is this bubble

559
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,016
of pirate adventure.

560
00:34:18,477 --> 00:34:21,059
So no one's making lots of new swords.

561
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:23,400
They're fixing a lot of swords and bringing them in.

562
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,894
So the three important aspects of creating this life story

563
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:30,957
that really sang through,

564
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:34,301
and that was wonky with logic, I will explain that,

565
00:34:35,883 --> 00:34:38,666
wear and tear, and patched and repaired.

566
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:45,632
So Wonky, which turned out to be a cornerstone of conversations around the art direction,

567
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:49,235
is this.

568
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:56,780
So Wonky is a general term to cover distortion and disruption of surfaces that have been

569
00:34:56,821 --> 00:34:57,761
caused by its history.

570
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:02,225
So they can be poorly built, damaged, or even warped with age.

571
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:05,127
There's an example of what it is and what it isn't.

572
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:08,529
So it's amazing when you're doing stylized games how quickly...

573
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,591
it sometimes can just turn into quite tropey,

574
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:17,174
to put it in a better word, of cartoon-stylized forms.

575
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:20,615
So you can get a lot of stylish pinches or distortions.

576
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:23,637
And what I wanted to make sure was all of this wonky feel

577
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:26,638
wasn't through just askew items.

578
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:29,359
It was through the fact that there was a history within it.

579
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,061
So here are some examples of that.

580
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:34,682
We have the deck of the ship.

581
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:36,883
well, the stairs down.

582
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:40,305
So the rail is warped with age, and it has this slight bow in it.

583
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,867
And the steps are even and worn.

584
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:48,070
Another example within the world is, oh, there's a crate.

585
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,711
This is an example of it when it was done wrong.

586
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:53,072
So the crate, you can see on the left there,

587
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:55,154
it just, no one would make a crate like that.

588
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,455
It just feel, you couldn't stack them.

589
00:35:57,935 --> 00:35:59,476
They would just fall all over the place.

590
00:36:00,097 --> 00:36:00,717
It wasn't wonky.

591
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:05,023
it was just cartoon distortion.

592
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,728
The one on the left is a more see-if-the-easy crate,

593
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:10,372
in the sense of it's been made out

594
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:11,634
of a mismatched piece of wood.

595
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:13,017
It's got the wear and tear within it.

596
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:15,761
So they're the two examples of done right and wrong.

597
00:36:17,562 --> 00:36:19,284
Here's some more examples of the deck of the ship,

598
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,327
the way that there's chips and dinks.

599
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,372
And these are really an example of how much care

600
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,836
and love we put into every single item within the world.

601
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:31,683
Another example is the beam of wood that's around the.

602
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:33,764
the post that's around the captain's door.

603
00:36:34,244 --> 00:36:35,864
So rather than, if it just went in

604
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:39,585
and it was flat geometry, it would feel overly clean.

605
00:36:39,986 --> 00:36:42,946
But as soon as we started knocking corners,

606
00:36:42,986 --> 00:36:44,847
as if someone's ran through it with a treasure chest

607
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:46,547
and knocked it around a few times,

608
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,228
or even where there's a cut mark,

609
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,908
where a sword has been slashed against it,

610
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:53,109
these things all give a sense of history.

611
00:36:57,534 --> 00:37:01,516
So, the wear and tear even expanded to the characters themselves.

612
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,278
So, no matter how smart the clothing would be,

613
00:37:05,378 --> 00:37:08,119
so the character on the left there,

614
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:11,120
she's got kind of like an admiral kind of clothing,

615
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:14,782
but it's still patched and repaired, it's still got areas of dirt and wear,

616
00:37:15,622 --> 00:37:18,144
and that continued within all of the clothing through the game.

617
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:21,365
So we had holes and rips and torn edges.

618
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:24,847
So, again, this pillar tied into all of these,

619
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:26,908
everything within the game.

620
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:30,265
So more examples of it.

621
00:37:30,846 --> 00:37:32,988
This was a term that we ended up using all the time as well.

622
00:37:33,028 --> 00:37:34,810
So there was wonky, there was dinks.

623
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,193
If something didn't look CFDs, we'd normally say, make sure

624
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:39,955
it's a little bit wonky and add some dinks.

625
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,737
And it worked every time.

626
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:45,539
So I love it as a system.

627
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,320
So again, you can see the chips and the dinks

628
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,461
within the thing.

629
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:51,502
So a skeleton's head to the clothing, to the swords,

630
00:37:51,843 --> 00:37:53,483
it really was something that just kept working.

631
00:37:54,124 --> 00:37:55,865
Another aspect of creating this sense of history

632
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:57,566
within the world was patched and repaired.

633
00:37:58,366 --> 00:38:00,207
So if you look at the deck of the ship,

634
00:38:00,527 --> 00:38:02,428
there are actual kind of like planks of wood

635
00:38:02,888 --> 00:38:04,689
at right angles to what they should be.

636
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:07,271
Now I know every sailor would probably tell me

637
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,791
this is not how you fix a ship.

638
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:12,045
And I did have a conversation with someone on the team where they were going,

639
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,226
you just wouldn't do that.

640
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:18,247
Um, but it speaks to the fact that I felt he spoke to the fact that these

641
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:19,947
pirates were, didn't really care.

642
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:24,508
There were just sluggishly kind of dirty pirates that were just sailing around

643
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:24,868
the world.

644
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:28,149
So these ships needed to feel battered and worn.

645
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:31,170
And this started to give a little bit of that character within the deck of the

646
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,670
ship itself.

647
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:37,371
Also, the patched and repaired expanded to things like the sails,

648
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:38,712
where we have patches on the sails,

649
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:41,735
and we used a lot of wraps within certain items

650
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:44,717
to show that it was shorn up for stability.

651
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:48,900
So the idea of that was that you could apply that to it,

652
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,162
and it would have that sense that it's been broken,

653
00:38:51,202 --> 00:38:53,484
and a pirate's picked it up, wrapped it up themselves,

654
00:38:53,904 --> 00:38:56,706
rather than take it to a blacksmith and then fixed it.

655
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:59,328
So it had that sense that it was out on the ocean waves

656
00:38:59,388 --> 00:39:00,529
having an adventure of itself.

657
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:08,093
So these were the visual pillars to ride from the goals.

658
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:13,980
So from the illustrative approach that we took

659
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,924
to the world in motion.

660
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:19,734
and a world of stories.

661
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,657
These were the three things that detailed the entire game

662
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:25,299
and really guided our vision.

663
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:28,821
These came together fairly early on within the development

664
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:31,384
and they just kept helping us through everything.

665
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:33,185
So every time we put something new in the game

666
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:35,287
that we weren't sure about, a new material

667
00:39:35,387 --> 00:39:37,668
or a new substance, we were able to look at it

668
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,170
and apply this thinking to it every single time

669
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:43,013
and it would instantly just feel like Sea of Thieves.

670
00:39:44,995 --> 00:39:48,279
I've included this picture of World of Stories because this is something I didn't mention

671
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:52,003
earlier on but I thought it was quite interesting, is another aspect of World of Stories that

672
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:54,926
we add is we actually put our players into the game.

673
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:59,931
So when a player has done something particularly noteworthy on our forums, in the world, on

674
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:04,035
Twitter, within the game, we often immortalise them within it.

675
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:05,417
And this is the Georgian Kraken.

676
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:08,579
So there's a character called Clumsy George on the forums,

677
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:11,741
and he was one of our players.

678
00:40:11,862 --> 00:40:14,884
And he wrote a story about fighting a kraken with a broom.

679
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,785
And so we turned him into a tavern.

680
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:18,606
So he got his own tavern in the game.

681
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:22,950
So again, we're adding history to the world all the time.

682
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:29,463
So, you can see that even from the smallest element within the world, these rules are

683
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:29,863
applied.

684
00:40:29,923 --> 00:40:36,144
So, from the way that these small bolts, nails that got knocked into the wood and the way

685
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:39,745
that they split the wood, that's the dinks, that's the wear and tear, that's the story.

686
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:45,967
The way that the items all have that sense of history, from a broken hurdy-gurdy to a

687
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,287
tankard to a blunderbuss.

688
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:49,698
It all got applied.

689
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:51,520
And to our characters as well.

690
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,701
So here are the characters.

691
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:55,763
So we were knocking teeth out.

692
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:57,804
We were adding scars to them.

693
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:01,447
Our system actually enables you to create heroes

694
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:04,549
within the world, but also dirty, rotten pirates.

695
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:06,791
And the idea was that I think there's enough lantern-jawed

696
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,593
heroes in games, so it's nice to be able to show

697
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:10,233
the other side of it.

698
00:41:12,964 --> 00:41:16,246
From the skeletons that you fight as well that you've seen earlier on with it with the

699
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:23,128
breaks within the face and the dinks and also those hidden moments of exploring within the world like finding the secret of a

700
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:26,750
sunken treasure treasure ship and

701
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,951
The interesting locations like one of these ports which it has a sense of story to it

702
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:35,733
Like how did that ship get up there? It was obviously a big wave or a kraken through it

703
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:41,600
So I'm going to finish up by showing you some interesting then and now moments.

704
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,323
I talked about the prototype and so I'm going to show you some pictures of the prototype

705
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,045
and actually what it looked like in game.

706
00:41:48,585 --> 00:41:54,990
So the prototype continued, we continued working on the prototype for quite some time in the game

707
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,753
so it ended up where we were putting box models back into the prototype

708
00:41:57,793 --> 00:41:59,854
to represent certain of the game world elements.

709
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,496
So this is one of our ports that you can explore

710
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:03,977
and this is what it looked like in the prototype.

711
00:42:05,534 --> 00:42:06,655
This is what it looked like in game.

712
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:09,297
And there's another one.

713
00:42:09,517 --> 00:42:11,359
So here's an island within the world.

714
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,963
And this is what it ended up looking like.

715
00:42:14,983 --> 00:42:18,086
This is Shark Bait Cove with an interesting shark statue

716
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:18,426
in the middle.

717
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,529
And you may get eaten by sharks if you go into the water.

718
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:25,603
And also the deck of the ship, of course, important.

719
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:28,686
And that's what it looked like in game.

720
00:42:28,866 --> 00:42:31,989
So it was really fun doing all these things.

721
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,273
A really fun thing that I don't know if any of you have seen the prototype

722
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:37,495
within some of the videos that we've actually released,

723
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,358
the world was filled with Tic Tacs for a long period of time.

724
00:42:42,138 --> 00:42:43,659
So they always get a laugh.

725
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,780
They populated everywhere.

726
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,301
The mermaid, if you've ever seen the mermaid in our game,

727
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:51,322
she pops out of the water when your ship sinks

728
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:52,642
and she comes to your rescue.

729
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:55,983
The mermaid form of her is truly frightening

730
00:42:56,304 --> 00:42:57,344
when she pops out of the water.

731
00:42:57,384 --> 00:43:00,865
This massive buoy of a character pops up in front of you.

732
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:02,726
But that's what it looked like in game.

733
00:43:02,766 --> 00:43:04,426
So few of the Tic Tacs have been hidden.

734
00:43:05,787 --> 00:43:08,788
And finally, there's an island there next to the ship.

735
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:11,389
And here it is in game.

736
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:14,707
So this was a really interesting journey for us, making Sea of Thieves.

737
00:43:15,987 --> 00:43:19,368
Sea of Thieves is a game about a pirate crew in a shared world adventure

738
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,868
with the freedom to choose their own adventure

739
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:26,129
that speaks to the charm and playfulness of Rare.

740
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:28,630
So that's the end of my talk,

741
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,090
and I'd just like to say thank you for coming today,

742
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,911
and if you have any questions at all, please do let me know.

743
00:43:45,835 --> 00:43:46,255
Any questions?

744
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:47,036
Excellent.

745
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:47,716
Hi, Ryan.

746
00:43:47,936 --> 00:43:48,156
Hello.

747
00:43:48,196 --> 00:43:50,437
Thank you very much, and congratulations

748
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:51,557
for this release.

749
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:52,298
Thank you.

750
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:55,539
I have a question about the lighting.

751
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:55,619
Yes.

752
00:43:57,339 --> 00:44:00,360
In your video, we see that the sun is almost

753
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,021
on a vertical trajectory.

754
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,642
Is it still like that in the game?

755
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:07,983
And if yes, is it a deliberate choice related

756
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:09,763
to art or a technical issue?

757
00:44:10,777 --> 00:44:16,764
We played around with the way that Sun, I would have to think, the technical artist that did it.

758
00:44:16,804 --> 00:44:21,329
We did actually explore different configurations of it, and we decided that just worked for us.

759
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,491
Really, it was as simple as that.

760
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:25,533
Okay, thanks.

761
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:34,768
Hello. Hello. I just wanted to say this game looks absolutely beautiful. Thank you very much.

762
00:44:35,448 --> 00:44:42,273
And I was wondering, because you talk so much about putting history into like the items and

763
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:49,759
the characters, I was wondering what your process was for that when it came to conceptualizing the

764
00:44:49,899 --> 00:44:55,683
islands, because there's so many different islands. Did you like create an individual

765
00:44:55,723 --> 00:44:56,984
history for each of them, or?

766
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:00,082
So we did, yes, we did create a theme.

767
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:02,624
So to begin with, within the prototype,

768
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:04,667
they were just designed to create the feeling,

769
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:06,549
different feelings within it, whether it was a big valley

770
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:08,171
or lots of different islands together.

771
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:10,974
And then once we had those configurations of the landmass,

772
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:12,716
we started to look at what we could do

773
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,398
to create that sense of history.

774
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,021
So for instance, there's an island called Snake Island,

775
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,123
and we started adding lots of...

776
00:45:20,064 --> 00:45:25,247
cave painting style things within it and also little artifacts and areas within it.

777
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:31,111
So yes, it was each, the artists kind of were given an island and tried to come up with a theme that they could dress it.

778
00:45:31,932 --> 00:45:35,314
We've also got a riddle system when you're solving adventures within the world.

779
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:40,097
So you have to go around with a map and solve riddles and those riddles all tie to

780
00:45:40,277 --> 00:45:45,440
those moments within the world that you can find. So it was key as part of gameplay and as well as the lore of the world.

781
00:45:46,281 --> 00:45:47,242
Thank you. Okay.

782
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:51,567
Hello.

783
00:45:51,908 --> 00:45:52,148
Hello.

784
00:45:52,568 --> 00:45:54,189
Um, sorry I'm losing my voice.

785
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:54,710
That's alright.

786
00:45:55,230 --> 00:46:01,815
So I wanted to make it known that me and my group, when we first got in, we like immediately lost our ship.

787
00:46:02,315 --> 00:46:07,219
And so we saw the Merman, and we named him Marmon the Merman, so I want to make that canon.

788
00:46:09,562 --> 00:46:11,243
I'll have to talk to our writers.

789
00:46:11,263 --> 00:46:13,204
Puns.

790
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:19,969
Okay, so I want to know how you decided that there wasn't going to be a tutorial.

791
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:23,571
Because that was like my favourite part of the game.

792
00:46:23,692 --> 00:46:25,113
That there wasn't a tutorial?

793
00:46:25,153 --> 00:46:25,873
Yeah.

794
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:29,556
That was born out of the fact that the prototype...

795
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:33,238
Okay, so, interesting story.

796
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,342
So yeah, so the prototype was made and we were just concentrating on the main mechanics.

797
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,692
And there was a big debate over how much of an onboarding there would be,

798
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,354
but there was a sense of trying to get discovery.

799
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:49,477
So, in the trailer in 2015 for E3, I think it was,

800
00:46:50,137 --> 00:46:52,799
we actually invited a whole bunch of rare fans,

801
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,462
or people that entered competitions, to come and play the game.

802
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:59,164
And we've got these test labs at the studio,

803
00:46:59,304 --> 00:47:02,086
and we put them all in a lab, and we didn't tell them anything.

804
00:47:02,126 --> 00:47:03,627
They didn't know it was a pirate game.

805
00:47:04,227 --> 00:47:07,111
They didn't, oh, maybe they did know it was a pirate game.

806
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,233
Yes, they knew it was a pirate game.

807
00:47:08,673 --> 00:47:10,516
They didn't know what the mechanics were

808
00:47:10,556 --> 00:47:11,718
or how to play it or anything.

809
00:47:12,238 --> 00:47:13,320
And we just put them in the room

810
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,283
and then we all stood watching the feeds going like,

811
00:47:15,343 --> 00:47:16,524
are they gonna work this out?

812
00:47:17,454 --> 00:47:19,315
And they just started to work out.

813
00:47:19,335 --> 00:47:20,716
They started to come together on the ship.

814
00:47:20,736 --> 00:47:21,537
They started to climb.

815
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:26,059
And I think it was that approach to creating tools and

816
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,101
objects in the world that you could just understand to

817
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:28,701
interact with.

818
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:32,624
So the hope is that with a light bit of gentle prodding

819
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:34,965
in the general direction, people will

820
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:36,006
discover it themselves.

821
00:47:36,046 --> 00:47:38,727
And that was, from talking with the designers, that was a

822
00:47:38,787 --> 00:47:40,268
key part that they wanted to try and get across.

823
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:45,074
Okay, and so how did you decide that that would be better?

824
00:47:45,594 --> 00:47:49,278
Because there's the risk of people immediately getting bored

825
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:50,879
and like, oh, this game has nothing in it,

826
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:54,522
when there's really a lot more than that.

827
00:47:54,882 --> 00:47:57,725
I think it's, we're gonna look at feedback,

828
00:47:57,845 --> 00:47:59,386
obviously, from players as well,

829
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:01,208
to see what actually happens.

830
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:03,690
But I think there's a lot of people

831
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,852
that appreciate it as equally need it.

832
00:48:05,952 --> 00:48:08,354
So we're gonna weigh that up, and I think that's the thing.

833
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:14,135
First off, I just want to say your implementation of HDR

834
00:48:14,316 --> 00:48:17,037
is probably the best I've seen in any game so far.

835
00:48:17,057 --> 00:48:19,478
It is gorgeous on my big 4K TV.

836
00:48:19,578 --> 00:48:20,739
It's amazing.

837
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:21,539
Great rendering team.

838
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:22,660
It's fantastic.

839
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,161
I did have a question about the transitions

840
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,682
of the weather and the sky between biomes.

841
00:48:28,003 --> 00:48:28,123
Yes.

842
00:48:28,143 --> 00:48:29,603
It's fairly instantaneous.

843
00:48:29,623 --> 00:48:31,124
Like, you could be a green sky, and then it

844
00:48:31,164 --> 00:48:33,565
goes perfectly blue, like, 10 seconds later.

845
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:35,326
Is that an intentional decision, or is that

846
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:36,847
something that's going to still be worked on in the future?

847
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:40,014
I think there are areas where it goes quickly.

848
00:48:40,174 --> 00:48:43,556
So it really does depend how big the transition

849
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:45,577
between the zones are.

850
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:48,319
So we've actually shrunk some of those transitions down

851
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:49,680
for gameplay.

852
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,661
So we've actually brought the islands together and those

853
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:52,302
zones together.

854
00:48:52,342 --> 00:48:54,283
So for those of you that don't know, see if these are

855
00:48:54,303 --> 00:48:55,504
separated into three zones.

856
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:56,805
And there are a big three.

857
00:48:56,825 --> 00:48:58,906
There's actually four different lighting zones

858
00:48:58,946 --> 00:48:59,447
within the world.

859
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:00,687
There's a central neutral one.

860
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:02,609
And we squash those together.

861
00:49:03,669 --> 00:49:05,230
So that's the way it is at the moment in the world.

862
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:05,711
But we're.

863
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:07,572
continually improving.

864
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:09,753
So now you've said that, I'm definitely going to go and

865
00:49:09,773 --> 00:49:11,534
check that out.

866
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:13,975
Anecdotally, there's sometimes where you'll be sailing and

867
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,156
it's like you're just coming out of a storm.

868
00:49:16,777 --> 00:49:18,157
And then it's like the sky is all green.

869
00:49:18,377 --> 00:49:19,978
And then a split second later, it's like

870
00:49:20,038 --> 00:49:20,859
perfectly blue skies.

871
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:21,919
It's like nothing dissipated.

872
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:23,200
It just sways.

873
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:23,480
Right.

874
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,561
I'm going to look at that.

875
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:25,381
Sounds like a bug.

876
00:49:25,401 --> 00:49:26,402
Thank you very much.

877
00:49:26,442 --> 00:49:27,942
Northeast side of the mountain.

878
00:49:27,962 --> 00:49:28,102
Right.

879
00:49:28,122 --> 00:49:28,663
We'll have a look at that.

880
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:32,179
Yeah, thanks for the talk.

881
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:33,200
It's really inspiring.

882
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,604
I'm curious, was the timing of the launch just a coincidence

883
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,985
with GDC?

884
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:43,087
Or was that planned?

885
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:44,749
It was just coincidence.

886
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:45,389
I see.

887
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:48,311
And I did debate whether I was going to do this.

888
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,354
Jeff actually invited me to come in and do this talk.

889
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:56,258
And I did sit at the studio going like, launch week, GDC.

890
00:49:56,718 --> 00:49:58,960
But it was an opportunity to be here and actually.

891
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:02,176
and talk about the game so close to launch it felt like a fun thing to do

892
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:03,697
and how did the launch go?

893
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:10,462
exponentially hugely well uh... just massive uh... so

894
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,784
we've got more numbers than we ever dreamed of coming into the game

895
00:50:14,305 --> 00:50:17,106
there's some ridiculous numbers like five thousand people a minute

896
00:50:18,387 --> 00:50:19,648
trying to enter the game, it's just crazy

897
00:50:20,169 --> 00:50:23,431
so very good awesome congratulations thank you

898
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:28,194
i think there's no more questions

899
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,551
So that's it. If anyone has got any other questions for me, I was actually told to remind

900
00:50:33,571 --> 00:50:37,932
you of one thing, which was the questionnaire that gets sent out in email to you. If you

901
00:50:37,972 --> 00:50:41,672
could fill that in, it's really helpful to the GDC organisers because they will know

902
00:50:41,732 --> 00:50:46,453
what talks to put on next year if you found this interesting. Hopefully you did. If you

903
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:50,534
didn't, come and talk to me. I'll take the feedback anyway. And I'll be outside if anyone

904
00:50:50,554 --> 00:50:53,475
wants to have a chat with me about anything. Okay? Thank you very much.
