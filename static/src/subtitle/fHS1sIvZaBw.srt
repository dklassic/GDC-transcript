1
00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:01,939
This is GDC Podcast.

2
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:03,408
Uh, that's a big pop.

3
00:00:25,378 --> 00:00:27,058
Hey everybody, I'm Chris Graft.

4
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:28,579
I'm here with Alyssa McElhune.

5
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,179
Hello.

6
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:29,699
I'm Alyssa.

7
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,300
I'm a news editor at Gamasutra.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,420
Oh yeah.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,280
Forgot to say what I do.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,141
I am editor in chief of Gamasutra.

11
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:36,801
At least I try to be.

12
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:40,902
And this is the second episode of GDC podcast, right?

13
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:41,703
Yeah.

14
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:42,383
Second episode.

15
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:46,864
I know that, that, uh, it's got that fresh podcast smell.

16
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:50,605
Just open it up and just take that whiff.

17
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:54,506
That's the fun thing about doing this monthly so far is it feels like it's been a week since

18
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:55,207
we recorded this.

19
00:00:56,227 --> 00:01:00,170
I know, it feels like we've been doing this for about 30 years now.

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,471
Oh yeah, seasoned podcasters over here.

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,552
Very seasoned, there's been no editing at all in all of these.

22
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:10,814
All of this is exactly how it happened.

23
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:15,856
So again, we're here for GDC, that stands for Game Developers Conference.

24
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:23,400
And we kind of started this so that we could give people some insight into these fascinating

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,082
people who make video games and kind of let people know how they make them.

26
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:29,943
I think that's a pretty, that's a noble goal.

27
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:33,766
Oh yeah, turns out they don't just will themselves into existence.

28
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:38,410
There's hardworking teams of dedicated people behind all those many, many, many

29
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,792
games that are coming out in quick succession this year.

30
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:42,213
It's, it's true.

31
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:46,056
Uh, well, not all of them will themselves into existence.

32
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:49,699
I think that Will Wright actually willed himself into existence.

33
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,320
And that's how he got his name.

34
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:52,141
Thank you.

35
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:53,682
Because Sims content this week.

36
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:54,843
Oh yeah.

37
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:56,825
Well, let's talk about all we get.

38
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:59,307
We have to talk real quick about like, well, all right.

39
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,048
What are you playing?

40
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:08,808
right now. I'm killing time. As we're recording this, a new Sims game pack comes out like three

41
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:13,153
hours ago, and it is killing me that I can't be playing it right now. So it'll be that for

42
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:15,616
the rest of the week. You're that dedicated of a podcaster.

43
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:19,670
And you have waited this long to play the new Sims.

44
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,510
Oh yeah, it's installing.

45
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,910
Like on my lunch I went to go start installing it.

46
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,351
So it's, it pains me.

47
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:28,052
What do you like so much about The Sims?

48
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:30,592
I mean it's a great game, but you're obsessed with it.

49
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:32,733
I am a micromanager.

50
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:37,834
And it gives me a way to productively micromanage without pissing anyone off.

51
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:39,934
Without pissing anyone off?

52
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,358
I don't know, it's one of those weird kind of like, with like Sardine Valley and Animal

53
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,680
Crossing where you have a bunch of like small little tasks you just kind of like focus on

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,022
and get into routines and set up all this and there's like creative output in it.

55
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:54,542
It's just really relaxing.

56
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:56,483
So none of your sims are pissed off?

57
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,781
No, no, they're all very happy and I hold them to very high standards individually.

58
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,963
Do you ever do the cruel thing where you just kind of build them into a room and, you know,

59
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:06,804
punish them like that?

60
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:07,764
Are you...

61
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:10,105
They make it harder in these ones.

62
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:12,466
You can't just like delete the pool ladder anymore, but...

63
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:13,126
Yeah.

64
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,667
We treat our sims humanely in the year 2019.

65
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:17,228
That's good.

66
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,990
And then I'm playing games too.

67
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,610
Yeah, I was going to ask, do you play any video games?

68
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,324
Um, do I game? Am I a gamer?

69
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:26,885
Are you a gamer?

70
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:37,036
Am I a gamer? I'm actually playing Astral Chain from Platinum, and it's a lot less Bayonetta,

71
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:41,080
and it's a lot more kind of...

72
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:44,362
More detective stuff than I thought there would be.

73
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:53,288
You're basically demon police, and there are these things called chimera that keep on coming through portals

74
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:59,252
and infecting people and doing all this weird stuff to people.

75
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:04,735
But I'm surprised how much of a mix of action and detective work is in there.

76
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,874
Yeah, from the E3, I think, trailer, it looked like it'd be this really kind of like niche

77
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:13,276
little game that not a lot of people would get into, but a lot of people have been talking

78
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:13,997
about that one.

79
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:20,021
Yeah, and also there is a toilet fairy in it.

80
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:22,583
Oh, is that the one that talks about your tweets?

81
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:26,129
Yeah, yeah, that's, uh, well, yeah, that was my hilarious tweet joke.

82
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,271
Like, I contributed, um, something to the toilet fairy.

83
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:35,872
I don't know what it was, it was an item.

84
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:42,593
It wasn't, it wasn't any, uh, yeah, anyway, the toilet fairy thanked me for blessing it.

85
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:43,866
Video games are art.

86
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:45,027
They are.

87
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:53,593
And speaking of video games, the Game Developers Conference, there is actually some stuff happening

88
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:53,873
with it.

89
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:57,515
So we opened up the call for summits.

90
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:06,401
So if you have ideas for talks that involve AI, animation, independent games, game narrative,

91
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:13,025
math in game dev, then you should submit a talk on the website.

92
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:18,028
You can find that information at gdconf.com.

93
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,811
There's also VRDC, game career development.

94
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:26,294
You can submit your talks before midnight.

95
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:33,699
On September 30th at that website, that's midnight, uh, before you turn into a pumpkin.

96
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,183
There's also, there's also more, uh, there's also a XRDC coming up in October.

97
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:43,906
That's 14th through 15th at Fort Mason Festival Pavilion.

98
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,088
And, uh, that's in San Francisco.

99
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:53,393
That has to do with all of the fancy visual computing stuff where, uh, virtual

100
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:56,535
things are overlaid on reality.

101
00:05:57,803 --> 00:06:02,105
AR, XR, VR, MR, the various R's, the XR's.

102
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:04,005
Yeah, all the R's.

103
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:05,126
All the R's.

104
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:07,607
2020 IGF submissions are now open as well.

105
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:10,388
Those are due by midnight on September 30th.

106
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:12,888
Students and non-students can submit games.

107
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:18,249
judged on excellence in visual art, audio, design, narrative, and best student game,

108
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,270
with finalists in all of those categories.

109
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,491
And there is a program going where underrepresented groups can apply for a fee waiver.

110
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:32,832
More details on that can be found at igf.com slash submit hyphen your hyphen game.

111
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:39,474
All right. This is where we start to tease the next guest here.

112
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:40,854
Well, not tease our next guest.

113
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,563
Uh, tease what he does, right?

114
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:44,765
Yeah.

115
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:45,265
Don't tease me.

116
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:47,849
A little background.

117
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,332
This person is a past.

118
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,476
This is like going to be one of my things on this podcast now.

119
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:53,658
Huge hype.

120
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,353
Right before we introduce the person.

121
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:56,954
All right.

122
00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:01,055
Our next guest is a past GDC speaker.

123
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:04,116
He's written for Gamma Sutra and Game Developer Magazine.

124
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:04,716
What?

125
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:13,599
A writer and composer and a game dev at Zachtronics, where he worked on such

126
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:24,586
cool system-y type games like Opus Magnum, Xapunks, Shenzhen I-O, and also in a past life

127
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:35,014
worked AAA at Bungie, Treyarch, 343 Industries. They made some games. Some of those games were

128
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:41,378
Halo and Call of Duty, including Call of Duty 2 Big Red 1.

129
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:43,493
Which I enjoy.

130
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,595
And I also...

131
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,818
Where are you getting this bio from?

132
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:49,500
Oh my god.

133
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:52,282
It's all on the internet, sir.

134
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:53,284
Okay.

135
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:53,764
Yeah.

136
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:54,865
I enjoy...

137
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,388
I like saying Big Red One as in Big Red One.

138
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:58,639
Big red one.

139
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,660
Yeah, big red one.

140
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:08,926
And so, if you, oh, he also did the great Twine game, The Writer Will Do Something.

141
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:12,008
That is about floundering development of a AAA game.

142
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:20,413
And the latest game to come out is Eliza from Zachtronics.

143
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,795
So if you'll join me in unveiling our guest.

144
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:33,144
Matthew Burns. Hi, Matthew. Hi. Hi. Well, you have a long storied past in the game industry.

145
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:41,090
I've actually known of you for a while. I feel like now I know you a bit.

146
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,812
After all that research that you've done. Yeah, yeah.

147
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:48,776
After stalking me on the internet, yeah. Yeah, this is what Alyssa and I are getting

148
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:52,618
really good at. We are better at internet stalking than we are at podcasting.

149
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:55,820
Which, you know, that's okay.

150
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,982
That'll hopefully that'll pay off someday.

151
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,343
Now you started in the game industry.

152
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:05,007
It seems like you must've started pretty early on in your life.

153
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:09,370
Uh, like in your, in your career, can you talk about how it all started?

154
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,551
How I got started?

155
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:10,991
Sure.

156
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:11,351
Yeah.

157
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:16,034
Um, I think it was 2000 or 2001, something like that.

158
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:21,098
Um, so I guess it's coming up on like 18 years now.

159
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,520
Um, started right out of school.

160
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:29,884
As a tester in the basement of Activision in Santa Monica, the same building that they

161
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:31,525
still are in right now.

162
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:39,929
But I was absolutely just a temp tester, kind of starting on the lowest rung, and eventually

163
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,329
became a producer.

164
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,372
And I was a producer the entire time I was on AAA and went through the various studios

165
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,913
that you mentioned and various franchises that you mentioned.

166
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:49,973
And then I...

167
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:55,401
I tried to go indie once, that didn't work out, and I went back to AAA, and then I tried

168
00:09:55,421 --> 00:10:01,504
to go indie again, and now I'm here at Zachtronics where I do the writing and music, which is

169
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:08,307
more interesting to me than the production stuff for right now, because it's new and

170
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,847
it's stuff I haven't done before.

171
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:14,750
So I guess that's the short version of my journey through the game industry.

172
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,772
Just taking notes here, basically you crawled out of the basement of Activision is how I

173
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:20,052
heard it.

174
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:20,844
Yes.

175
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:22,306
Mm-hmm.

176
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:23,247
And made your way.

177
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:28,071
So the test department at Activision is literally in the basement of the building.

178
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:28,612
Like there's...

179
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:29,853
Of course it is.

180
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,194
It's like metaphorical.

181
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:33,836
And it's kind of funny.

182
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:39,461
It's also a little bit, you know, like sad, but like it's always been in the literal basement.

183
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:41,703
Can you describe this basement?

184
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,165
Was it dank, damp?

185
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:49,546
It's, you know, there's no windows obviously and it's just sort of this large open space

186
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:55,871
that is the underground floor of like a large office-y building and there's fluorescent

187
00:10:55,911 --> 00:11:02,916
lights that buzz faintly and a break room with vending machines in it with, you know,

188
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:03,997
bags of...

189
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:08,508
There's a slightly more upbeat metaphor there, like, oh, testers are the foundation of game

190
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:09,009
development.

191
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:12,350
If you really want to put that on a cat poster, you can get there, I think.

192
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,760
That's true.

193
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,621
It's an important job, yeah.

194
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:38,804
I mean, it's like, we're making fun of it, but it is, yes, absolutely an important job

195
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:43,507
and absolutely not something that shouldn't be taken seriously, like it should be taken

196
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:44,287
very seriously.

197
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:47,089
But Windows are also kind of beneficial to mental health.

198
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:48,430
Yeah, exactly.

199
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,373
I think, I mean, I'm totally willing to go on the record and say that Activision probably

200
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:57,715
could stand to treat their testers better, both then and now.

201
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:04,038
The AAA though, working in that for years, just to dig into that a little bit more,

202
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:10,620
was it anything near what you expected? Because I bet that there are listeners that are thinking,

203
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,141
you know, there are still people out there, despite the news of how hard it can be in this industry,

204
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:18,862
do you have a romanticized idea of it? Were you like that?

205
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:24,424
Um, I think so. I think for like people who are going into AAA now,

206
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,485
they definitely have a better sense of like,

207
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:30,444
Crunch and work-life balance issues and things like that.

208
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:33,807
Like when I talk to students now, a lot of them are familiar with the,

209
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,508
with the stories and reporting that has been done on that.

210
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:40,691
And that's a great credit to like the reporters who've been willing to like

211
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,252
try to put these stories out there.

212
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,955
When I started, there was less of that, like less of like, here's what

213
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,556
to expect when you do AAA.

214
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:53,300
So I didn't necessarily have like a specific notion of like, this

215
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,420
is what it was going to be like.

216
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,022
It was more just like, okay, now I'm working on a big,

217
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:04,540
Call of Duty is like a big game, seems important, and I'll just do what it takes to get it done.

218
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:15,611
So at that time the industry was just a little bit less established and there was just more kind of fly by the seat of your pants.

219
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,173
Not that it's amazing now, right, but there's just like...

220
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:26,839
smaller teams and less developed processes, and just doing things and hoping that they work.

221
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,381
So I didn't have this specific idea of, like, it's going to be like this. I just

222
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:33,642
kind of went in hoping to be useful.

223
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:39,578
Well, you've had a lot of different jobs in games.

224
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,401
You said that you're a producer.

225
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:46,069
That was the QA and producer side is what you were focusing on.

226
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:50,256
Now what kind of drew you more towards...

227
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:56,798
uh, the focus on the writing and you're also a composer who writes excellent music for these

228
00:13:56,858 --> 00:14:03,601
games. You know, what, yeah, what drew you towards that? Well, so I, you know, it's like I joined

229
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:10,943
games because I was interested in them creatively. Like I actually was a tester for three years and

230
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:16,385
a producer for like 10 years, but the entire time I had been doing like my own writing on the side

231
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,025
and my own music on the side.

232
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:22,376
Because I think fundamentally I am a creative person and I always was.

233
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:29,822
But the thing about like working in, in games on AAA games, I actually, there

234
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:33,525
was a point at which I could decide whether I wanted to be like a designer.

235
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:36,327
Like I want to, if I wanted to follow like the design track

236
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:37,608
on stuff like Call of Duty.

237
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:41,772
And to be super honest, like.

238
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:46,778
The design problems that you have to solve on a game like Call of Duty were not as interesting

239
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:52,141
to me as the logistical problems that you have to solve on how to put the team together

240
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:58,565
and how to do the voice recording and how to coordinate all the designers and all the

241
00:14:58,665 --> 00:14:59,766
assets and stuff like that.

242
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:04,428
So I pursued the production track in AAA because I thought I would like...

243
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,580
be able to learn more of the kinds of things that I was interested in, and see a lot of

244
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,301
the different disciplines, and stand in on a mocap session, and make a big list of animations,

245
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:24,684
or be in the recording studio, participate in all of that kind of stuff, as opposed to

246
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:29,625
the kinds of design problems that you solve in Call of Duty, which are interesting, but

247
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:32,445
were just less what I wanted to pursue at that time.

248
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:36,309
When you went indie for the first time, did you stick with kind of a production side of it?

249
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,671
Or were you more in the design trenches?

250
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:43,676
Yeah, no, at that point, then I was like, oh, I want to like, it was, it was tough.

251
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:48,000
So the first time I tried to go indie was like around 2011 or 12.

252
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,523
So that was like when indie stuff was really, really early on.

253
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,805
And it was like, maybe this is a thing that can be done.

254
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:59,790
And I myself didn't necessarily have a great idea of exactly how it was going to work.

255
00:15:59,870 --> 00:15:59,990
Like.

256
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:05,267
You had to sort of be entrepreneurial too at the same time and like pitch your game.

257
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:10,151
And there wasn't necessarily like a, a great pipeline for how to pitch the pitch stuff.

258
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:15,755
Um, so I thought, you know, I have to be like some sort of business guy too.

259
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:21,600
And then also like be involved in like design and like creative direct the

260
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,401
game as well at the same time.

261
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:28,125
And, um, it was a super, super artsy game that I think.

262
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:33,175
wasn't the type of game that a big publisher would pay a lot of money for, especially back

263
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:33,395
then.

264
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:39,620
I think maybe now there's more interest in that type of game and there's more models

265
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,741
for how that type of thing could work.

266
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,664
But at the time it didn't quite come together.

267
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,467
But yeah, it was always like trying to be creative.

268
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:54,411
The Twine games that I've made were made while I was not working at Zachtronics and working

269
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,954
at other jobs, and I would go home and work on my Twine games and that kind of thing.

270
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:02,274
You had mentioned that you, you tried to go indie first.

271
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:05,295
Uh, can you talk about what happened there?

272
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,455
Because there was that period and then you had, then you went back to AAA.

273
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:09,276
Yeah.

274
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:13,217
Um, uh, I saved up some, I had saved up a bunch of money and I

275
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:14,177
was like, I'm going to do it.

276
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:16,257
I'm going to pursue the indie dream.

277
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,699
And so in like 2011 or 12, something like that, me and some friends that I

278
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:26,020
had met were like, yeah, we're going to make a game and I said I had saved up

279
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,980
money, but it was like,

280
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:27,738
to

281
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:28,818
pay everyone for their contribution.

282
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:56,714
Um, but so we worked on it and we, we came, we had like this, um, sort of demo of, of the game.

283
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:01,799
It was this musical shooter, uh, that we were calling Plonk at the time after the named after

284
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,681
the physicist Max, Max Plonk.

285
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:10,908
Um, and it was like, it was kind of like inspired by like, uh, Rez and Tetsuya Mizuguchi kind of

286
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:16,313
games where it's like cool electronic music and, and sound and stuff.

287
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:20,598
And I was trying to get money to finish it.

288
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:25,300
And this was, again, this was a time when there weren't a ton of indie publishers.

289
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,782
I think like Devolver was around at this time, but many of the other ones weren't.

290
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:34,205
And so then I would like try to, I was like, try to pitch to like, you know.

291
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:39,547
Konami or something, right? And it was just like, why would I, it doesn't make any sense. And,

292
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:44,569
and so it was just, it just didn't, like, it didn't happen. Like people were just not interested

293
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:49,190
enough in the game. It was like too artsy, too out there, not enough precedent for the type of

294
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:56,652
game it was. And to like, um, the, the deals that were out there for this, this type of thing,

295
00:18:56,672 --> 00:19:01,994
we're just like, we're just kind of almost condescending, you know, it would be like,

296
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:03,695
I would go to like a publisher and they would be like,

297
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:07,876
And I would be like, hey, I have this game and I need this amount of money to make it.

298
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,377
And then I, and then I'll give the game to you.

299
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:12,879
And then they would come back with their counter offer and they would be like, how

300
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:13,379
about this?

301
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,261
We don't give you any money and you still give us the game.

302
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:21,044
And it would just be like, okay, that's not, you know, that's not like a real thing.

303
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:26,028
So eventually the money that I had saved up to like pay my rent was running out and I

304
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:28,109
was like, okay, sorry, I guess this didn't work.

305
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:31,711
So I had, I got another job in AAA to kind of like continue it.

306
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:33,152
But I still felt like, you know.

307
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:40,225
that I had failed in some way, because I didn't finish the game that I was trying to make at that time.

308
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:42,727
Yeah, well, I guess join the club, right?

309
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,709
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

310
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:50,692
Yeah, I forget about those times, and you said this was around 2011?

311
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,060
I think so, yeah, 10, 11, or 12, something like that.

312
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:07,044
So to me, I'm pushing 40 now, 2011 does not seem like that long ago, and it was such a

313
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:17,209
different time, where this kind of rise of the mid-tier, or the more boutique-style publishers

314
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:18,409
like Devolver.

315
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:24,031
Uh, weren't really, uh, established as they are now, or a lot of them,

316
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,072
not even around at all.

317
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:31,974
So the idea, the idea of you, uh, and you know, your little team pitching

318
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:38,116
to the same company that publishes like Metal Gear Solid, uh, you know, or

319
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:39,276
triple A games like that.

320
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,917
It's, I mean, it's almost comical these days.

321
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:45,538
It really was a clear, it really was a clear like mismatch.

322
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:47,950
And it was like, hey, I want to do this artsy thing.

323
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,870
And they were just like, I don't know what to do with this.

324
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,231
I think now there's much more of like a framework that you can be like, Hey, I

325
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:57,032
am this type of game and they understand where you're coming from a little bit

326
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:57,292
better.

327
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:00,413
It really was a different, it was super different time.

328
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:00,933
And you're right.

329
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:02,313
It wasn't that long ago.

330
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,253
Yeah.

331
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:08,655
Now, Zachtronics, uh, you, you joined Zachtronics in 2016.

332
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:09,575
Is that right?

333
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:14,887
Yeah, so I had worked with Zach prior to that. I'd done the music for

334
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:20,309
Infinifactory and written some stuff for TAS100, but in 2016 is when I joined,

335
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:24,290
basically full-time, to do both the writing and music for Zachtronics games.

336
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:32,593
So Shenzhen IO was the first Zachtronics game that I did both the writing and music for.

337
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:42,366
So this always struck me as an interesting pairing too, because you are kind of shaping

338
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:44,587
the future of Zacatronics.

339
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:54,253
As you know, Matthew, I interviewed Zac at GDC a couple years ago, and we talked about

340
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:55,233
the influence that...

341
00:21:55,954 --> 00:22:00,397
you're having on it. When you're going into Zachtronics, so if our listeners who don't know,

342
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:09,545
Zachtronics does very systems-based doohickey type of games where you add and subtract things

343
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:16,070
from systems and you basically, in some of them you press go and then the system just starts going

344
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:21,815
and it might collapse in on itself or it might magically work and it just gives this amazing

345
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,056
sense of

346
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:30,299
uh, progression, like intellectual progression, intrinsic reward is a big thing with these games.

347
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,320
Now, bringing you on, what was the goal with you?

348
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:40,042
I mean, many of the Zachtronics games mechanically, I mean, they, they come,

349
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:44,444
so with the exception of Eliza, like the mechanics of the Zachtronics games definitely

350
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:49,285
continue to just come from Zach. Um, I don't really try to like...

351
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:54,927
make any design contributions to stuff, especially the more hardcore ones, the ones where you

352
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:56,748
just do assembly language programming.

353
00:22:57,288 --> 00:23:02,532
I don't really have anything to offer there from a design standpoint.

354
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:08,435
What we do talk about, especially early on in the design process, is just the overall

355
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:15,420
story of the game and the world that the game takes place in, and the arc that we take players

356
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,461
on as they do these tasks.

357
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:21,785
And that's something that's very important, I think, to us as a studio.

358
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:22,746
It's important to Zach.

359
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:28,451
He doesn't want to make games that are just about manipulating abstract symbols in a vacuum.

360
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,714
They have to connect back to the real world in some way.

361
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:37,639
And that's where I really get involved, and I think that that's something we talk about from the very get-go.

362
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,202
We don't design a game and then put a skin on it.

363
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:43,285
Like, oh, maybe this could take place in medieval times.

364
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,462
medieval stuff on it.

365
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:50,790
It's really about designing the mechanics and the world and the story all together,

366
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,611
all at once.

367
00:23:52,252 --> 00:23:58,003
And hopefully, by doing that, they all reflect on each other and reinforce each other.

368
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:04,398
Now the latest Zachtronics game, Eliza is a game that just came out recently and it's

369
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:10,542
quite a departure in that it is a visual novel.

370
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:16,586
It's not one of these super mechanic-savvy games that Zachtronics has become known for.

371
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,129
Can you talk about the...

372
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:25,873
How about this, Alyssa, what are you thinking?

373
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:27,374
We're both playing this game right now.

374
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:34,237
What are you thinking of Eliza? I was not emotionally ready to start it at like 10

375
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:41,541
p.m. at night. That was a mistake. But I feel kind of bad because my preconception of

376
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:45,843
Zachtronic games prior before this conversation and before doing a

377
00:24:46,723 --> 00:24:50,005
research and leading up to this had been like, these are puzzle games that are

378
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:54,467
way too tough for me. I had no idea of like the the element of kind of world

379
00:24:54,507 --> 00:24:55,508
creation that went into that.

380
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,091
Had compartmentalized them away as puzzle games.

381
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:00,875
And I'm going to go back and recheck some of them now.

382
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:12,491
No, that's okay. I think absolutely the most memorable thing about them is the fact that they are these sort of programmy puzzle games or engineering puzzle games.

383
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:20,433
Where you literally have to do engineering. You literally have to do an engineering job to finish the level.

384
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:23,994
One of the descriptions I read for them was, oh, they're puzzle games for programmers.

385
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:25,174
And I'm like, that is so technical.

386
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:26,295
Right, yeah.

387
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:28,095
But there's value in technical stuff as well.

388
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:33,577
Then you go to Eliza, which is a visual novel, which is a very niche genre on its own,

389
00:25:33,677 --> 00:25:36,897
and entirely different from puzzle games altogether.

390
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:37,718
So how did the...

391
00:25:38,658 --> 00:25:44,362
idea to be like, here's a story I want to tell with these kind of mechanics about all of this.

392
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:48,185
And how did that kind of snap into visual novel for you guys?

393
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:55,811
Yeah. And can you just give kind of our listeners, just the background of the story of what Eliza is about?

394
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:56,331
Oh yeah, that too.

395
00:25:56,872 --> 00:26:03,617
Sure. Yeah. So Eliza is a visual novel. It's kind of about this therapy app that a large

396
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,718
tech company based in Seattle has developed.

397
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:12,093
The way I pitch it to people often is saying, imagine Amazon added a therapy

398
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:13,834
function to Amazon Alexa.

399
00:26:14,254 --> 00:26:17,577
So you would come home after a day at work and just be like, Alexa, I don't

400
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,217
feel so good.

401
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:20,859
And Alexa would be like, why don't you feel so good?

402
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:23,922
And then you could just talk to your Amazon Alexa and it would listen to you

403
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:30,226
and creepily record you and upload all of your deep thoughts to Amazon.

404
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,590
And so it's a little bit like that, although there's a twist in that.

405
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:42,719
The AI responses provided to it are supposed to be read by real human beings called proxies.

406
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:49,181
And proxy work is maybe analogous to like Uber or Lyft or DoorDash or something like that, where

407
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:55,383
you as a proxy, your job is to just kind of show up and like read these words that are provided to

408
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:58,863
you at someone who is in for therapy.

409
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:06,234
So it's about these therapy clients that come in, it's about you being the proxy and not really

410
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:11,801
having a choice about what you say to them, and it's also about the people who make this technology

411
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:16,187
and whether they're really helping or not, and the choices that you make when you work

412
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:19,551
in technology and the effect that you have on the world as an engineer.

413
00:27:20,244 --> 00:27:22,725
So that's kind of in a nutshell what Eliza is all about.

414
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:24,006
There's a lot of other stuff too.

415
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:27,368
There's stuff about, you know, burnout and working in the, in the tech industry.

416
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:29,270
There's stuff about all this other stuff.

417
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,911
There are so, there's so much stuff in it.

418
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:32,932
It touches on.

419
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:43,501
All this stuff like AI bias, you know, you're talking about, like you said, burnout, work-life

420
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:55,812
balance, this responsibility that people developing technology feel or don't feel about it, what

421
00:27:55,852 --> 00:27:56,412
they're making.

422
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:59,575
What got you thinking about all this?

423
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:01,076
Did you just watch a bunch of Black Mirror?

424
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:05,639
Or, I mean, like a lot of this stuff is very realistic.

425
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:06,179
That's one thing.

426
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,101
This is a believable world.

427
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:15,785
Well, I mean, living in Seattle for the past decade or so, seeing the city

428
00:28:15,825 --> 00:28:21,889
transform pretty dramatically as Amazon has taken over more and more

429
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:24,310
of it is one thread of that.

430
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:29,373
Because I work in games, many of the people that I'm, you know,

431
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:36,105
Professional colleagues with or friends work at companies like Microsoft or Amazon.

432
00:28:36,826 --> 00:28:39,447
You know, Microsoft has a big, has Xbox, right?

433
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:41,368
And Amazon has Amazon game studios.

434
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:48,812
So there are plenty of Microsoft, Amazon, and Google has a big campus up here as well.

435
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:53,595
Employees of these big tech companies in this area and people that I know.

436
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:58,657
I also, you know, I mentioned earlier, I work on my own stories in my own time.

437
00:28:59,058 --> 00:28:59,178
And.

438
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:06,682
When I, during one job that I had had, like five or six years ago, I think I'm

439
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:14,048
going to say like 2014, I saw a demo of a real therapy application developed

440
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:18,251
with funding from DARPA that was cameras on people's faces.

441
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:23,475
And there was like a, a, a 3d avatar that was talking at them, like this,

442
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:28,258
like kind of old school, like second life looking 3d person.

443
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,342
And it was like, you know, how are you doing?

444
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:33,203
And then the person would be like, Oh, I don't know.

445
00:29:33,263 --> 00:29:37,986
And then all these like metrics would be like on their face, like if they were

446
00:29:38,046 --> 00:29:40,949
blinking or smiling or, you know, all of that kind of stuff.

447
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:45,892
And it was the point of the system was to determine if people maybe had

448
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:48,794
signs of PTSD or something like that.

449
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:51,977
And the reason why it was funded by DARPA, which is part of the defense

450
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:56,340
department, was because maybe they were going to like, use it on soldiers who

451
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:56,640
we like.

452
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:00,524
came back from Afghanistan or whatever, and then they would like sit them in

453
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:04,147
front of this like computer system and it would like scan their face while they

454
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:06,949
talked to see if they were, if they had PTSD or not.

455
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:13,313
So I saw that demo and it was just like, really stuck with me, right.

456
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:18,196
For, for whatever reason, it was just like the, the idea of that, you know,

457
00:30:18,236 --> 00:30:22,819
you send some 20 year old kid into war and give them PTSD and then they come

458
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:24,600
back and they have to talk to a robot about it.

459
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:24,800
Like.

460
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:29,345
I really wanted to do something with that, or make a story about it.

461
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:36,428
And this was before Black Mirror, but it just felt really arresting.

462
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:40,949
And so I was thinking about, maybe I'll make this a twine game or something like that.

463
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,950
And so I had written a bunch of stuff about it.

464
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:48,272
So one day, Zach and I were talking.

465
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:51,853
I think this was after Opus Magnum.

466
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:54,754
We were just talking about future stuff that we could do.

467
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,523
I think that Zach feels that we can always make more puzzle programming games.

468
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:04,626
Like, we feel like we understand that genre pretty well.

469
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:06,808
Zach is basically the inventor of that genre.

470
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:10,691
But it's cool to try new things and do new things.

471
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:12,813
And so I told him about this idea that I'd had,

472
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:17,837
and then I was like, kind of pitched him on this idea of doing it as a visual novel

473
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:22,241
that takes a little bit of art and a little bit of programming time and stuff.

474
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:23,999
And he was like, yeah, let's do it.

475
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,880
Let's make it, let's make this as a Zachtronics game and sort

476
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,120
of put it through our process.

477
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,961
And so that allowed the art to happen and that allowed like the voice recording

478
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:36,222
to happen and things like that.

479
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:40,723
So I totally jumped at the chance to be able to, to do it that way.

480
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:47,144
Did, did Zach have any reservations whatsoever that it might not resonate

481
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:50,305
with the typical Zachtronics audience?

482
00:31:50,817 --> 00:31:55,421
Absolutely. Yeah, we talked about that a lot. There were a lot of like, we had no

483
00:31:55,481 --> 00:32:00,486
idea if anyone would like this at all. We had no idea if like, Zachtronics fans

484
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:05,931
would like yell at us and be mad and you know, show up at our at our homes or

485
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:06,832
something like that. Right?

486
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:08,473
You made a visual novel.

487
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:13,978
Yeah, right. Like, we were concerned about that. We were also concerned that

488
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:17,421
like by by making a visual novel about like, kind of just

489
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,458
30-somethings talking about their careers and stuff?

490
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:25,203
Like, that's not really typical visual novel fare, right?

491
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,527
And so maybe fans of visual novels won't like it,

492
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:31,869
and then also people who are not fans of visual novels

493
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,013
won't play it anyway, because it's a visual novel.

494
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:37,475
So it's like, maybe we're making a game for nobody.

495
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:40,838
And that was a real fear.

496
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,822
And then also, yeah, how would people who associate Xectronics with this very specific genre, how would they feel about it as well?

497
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:54,143
I mean, isn't Grey's Anatomy about people talking about work in their 30s and 40s and people like that, right?

498
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:55,743
Sort of?

499
00:32:55,983 --> 00:32:58,724
The Grey's Anatomy of video games, is that what you're getting at?

500
00:32:58,764 --> 00:33:02,865
Yeah, I don't know. It's definitely like, you know, it's about like adult...

501
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:07,791
things and I mean adult in the sense of like paying your mortgage adult not the other kind

502
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:16,894
of adult. Yeah, it's and Alyssa and I were talking about how um and this isn't uh this is a this is

503
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:24,798
a compliment to the game. It is it's it's depressing and um it's but in in a way that

504
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:34,567
I want games to make me feel something real, and I think that a lot of people will agree

505
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:37,269
with me that that comes along not very often.

506
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:44,457
And when you're sitting there with the initial patient, you're sitting there as the proxy,

507
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:46,679
and then you start to realize that...

508
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:55,527
You can only read out what the Eliza AI is telling you to say or else you'll get fired.

509
00:33:56,287 --> 00:34:00,251
Like right there, it just, it, that takes away your agency.

510
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:08,177
It takes away your, uh, your, uh, your propensity to help people.

511
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:08,918
It takes away, uh, any.

512
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,602
empathetic action that you could possibly take. And that's what's interesting. Like,

513
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:23,105
and you've talked about this before at GDC, about choice and how you handle choice. And a lot of

514
00:34:23,165 --> 00:34:27,626
times it's not about the choices that are interesting, it's about how they're presented.

515
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:34,449
So can you talk about that, about designing for choice in a game that doesn't have much of it?

516
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:42,096
Yeah, so I mean, I'll just come out and say it, that the way Eliza is designed is that you don't

517
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:47,779
have a choice for a very long time. I want to say the first two thirds of the entire game are just

518
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,283
completely linear. And then it opens up towards the end, and you do have a choice. And that's a

519
00:34:53,323 --> 00:35:00,768
very, very deliberate design strategy that I'm using from a narrative design standpoint of using

520
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,009
all of that time at the beginning to set up

521
00:35:04,214 --> 00:35:08,601
Like a very, what I think is a very interesting and complex choice at the end.

522
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:13,689
So instead of bombarding you with small incremental choices throughout the duration of your play,

523
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:19,458
what you get is kind of an interesting situation and an interesting story and an interesting world, hopefully.

524
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:23,522
And then you are presented with the chance to make a choice.

525
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:25,104
It's a lot more resonating.

526
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:26,345
That's my theory anyway.

527
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:29,928
The choice itself becomes a lot more resonating when you

528
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:34,132
understand all of the factors around it, instead of you just

529
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,994
start the game and you're presented with a choice

530
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:39,978
immediately with no context of I don't know what I'm choosing

531
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:41,419
to do if I make these choices.

532
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:41,920
Really.

533
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:47,399
It's like you're... yeah. That fills me with anxiety.

534
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,323
There's six chapters in the game, I'm on chapter five.

535
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:56,146
You're getting there.

536
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:59,569
What you're describing is kind of like blowing up a party balloon.

537
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,432
And, you know, your decision is like, should I stop blowing into it?

538
00:36:05,852 --> 00:36:07,132
Or should I just like keep going?

539
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:10,654
It's like all of it, all of this is just building up to one big thing.

540
00:36:10,674 --> 00:36:13,375
And I think that's a completely fascinating design decision.

541
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:14,555
Yeah.

542
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:18,657
I think it really allows you to do stuff that you couldn't do in any other way.

543
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:22,198
I remember, and so I was, I did talk about this at GDC.

544
00:36:22,238 --> 00:36:25,159
I think that's like an interesting approach to think about.

545
00:36:25,899 --> 00:36:28,120
And it, the game itself, like.

546
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:31,593
It's not really very fantastical in a lot of ways.

547
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:34,437
Like it's really just like modern day kind of life.

548
00:36:34,897 --> 00:36:36,860
Um, there's nothing about it.

549
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,746
That's like made up except for the therapy stuff.

550
00:36:41,787 --> 00:36:45,011
And even then, since the game came out, everybody's been like.

551
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:49,684
emailing me like these apps they found on the app store that are like chatbot for for

552
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:55,387
Cognitive behavioral therapy or whatever like it's a lot of believable. It's totally a thing now

553
00:36:55,687 --> 00:37:00,791
Yeah, I think like going into that very first so you start like the your character is

554
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:06,334
a first day as this proxy right when you play, and they're going through and talking through

555
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:10,076
their entire, like, okay, so you have to go in this room and listen to this person and

556
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:10,736
stick to the script.

557
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:12,117
It's very important that you stick to the script.

558
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:14,598
And then it's hammered in, and I'm like, oh, here's the mechanic.

559
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:17,660
It's going to be I have to sit here and right away I'm going to have to decide if I'm going

560
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,842
to stick to the script or if I'm going to take a different option.

561
00:37:21,362 --> 00:37:26,125
Because that's a very visual, novel-y kind of binary choice, is like, do I do A, go down

562
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:27,946
this road, or do I do B and go down the other path?

563
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:31,288
But right away you don't get that.

564
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:33,329
And I think that kind of...

565
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:39,294
You get resigned to that same kind of anxiety that Chris was talking about, but at the same

566
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:41,615
time in other...

567
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:46,759
Outside of the ELIZA therapy office, you have your text conversations or your face-to-face

568
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:51,062
conversations where you can choose between two answers, and the answers might not necessarily

569
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,383
be different outside of tone.

570
00:37:52,443 --> 00:37:53,364
The outcome will be the same.

571
00:37:54,389 --> 00:38:00,510
And those two, like, the difference between those two kinds of decision, and also the

572
00:38:01,491 --> 00:38:07,472
subtle differences between the actual choices you make really do a lot to define the character

573
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:08,972
you're playing as, it feels like.

574
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:14,374
Especially because in visual novels, the ones I've played have been, like, anime nonsense

575
00:38:14,414 --> 00:38:16,094
because that's me in a past life.

576
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:21,335
But a lot of times your protagonist becomes this empty vessel that you fill with your

577
00:38:21,355 --> 00:38:21,955
own personality.

578
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:27,478
And the protagonist in Eliza has her own motivations, her own goals, and her own backstory that

579
00:38:27,498 --> 00:38:30,780
you uncover through these unique kind of narrative design choices.

580
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,883
I don't have a question I'm building up to here other than that it's very impressive

581
00:38:34,923 --> 00:38:39,786
how all of that was kind of drip-fed to me by subverting what I expected of visual novels

582
00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:40,186
in a way.

583
00:38:40,706 --> 00:38:41,827
Yeah, for sure.

584
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:50,905
I think that any textbook that you open about game design will say, well basically will

585
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:53,307
say games are different because they're interactive.

586
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:58,151
Games are different from other mediums because they present you with choices.

587
00:38:58,492 --> 00:39:00,674
That's like the defining feature of games.

588
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:04,297
You hear any pundit talking about games will say this.

589
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:08,340
And so what's so powerful to me...

590
00:39:09,544 --> 00:39:14,766
Like in that is like actually denying someone a choice like that can be such a powerful

591
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:20,988
like move because like it's a game you would think that you would want to give people a

592
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:25,130
choice and so going going against that is like kind of a really interesting.

593
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:32,906
way to use the tools that you have as a game designer. It's like using silence as a composer

594
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:39,750
or blank space as a writer. I don't know. But the absence of the thing that makes the medium

595
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:47,355
what it is, I think, can enhance the other parts of... It can enhance the choices that come later,

596
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:49,317
and it can contrast with...

597
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:54,211
Like you said, the moments in her daily life, in Evelyn, the main character's daily life,

598
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,697
where she does have a little bit of choice, and then at work where she has absolutely

599
00:39:57,737 --> 00:39:58,158
none at all.

600
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:07,229
Let's just sit here dead air for five minutes to subvert the notion of a podcast.

601
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:10,591
We can do that in our intro, I think.

602
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:17,774
So when Sid Meier says, you know, a game is a series of interesting choices or decisions,

603
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:22,217
you don't necessarily agree with that.

604
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,462
Um, I think it's, well...

605
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:30,783
Sid Meier's going to be listening, so you better be careful.

606
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:31,163
Okay.

607
00:40:31,943 --> 00:40:35,744
Well then, no, I don't, I don't, I actually don't agree that a game is a

608
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:37,104
series of interesting choices.

609
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:40,805
I think that what a game is, is actually very difficult to define.

610
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:45,546
And, and once you, you know, when you read game theory, uh, stuff like people

611
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:48,187
are like, oh, um, Ludwig.

612
00:40:48,705 --> 00:40:55,207
Wittgenstein picked the word game as an example of a word that's impossible to define,

613
00:40:56,608 --> 00:40:59,869
and he had all these examples about how you can't define the word game.

614
00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:05,891
It's worth reading. Everyone has their own definition of game, I think.

615
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:10,393
A lot of people think that visual novels are not games at all.

616
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:15,234
But I think that Eliza does have interesting choices in it.

617
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:19,155
Or at least one interesting choice in it.

618
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:24,482
And so if Eliza is a series of one very interesting choice, is it a game or not?

619
00:41:25,243 --> 00:41:25,623
I don't know.

620
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,286
I'll let you decide as long as you buy it and play it.

621
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:34,508
Well, I, it's, you know, whatever you think of it is like, it's, uh, I think that what

622
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:42,009
it's doing to me, what it's, how it's making me think about the topics at hand, how it's

623
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:44,890
making me think about the world around me.

624
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:51,832
I don't think that that could be done as effectively if it were a game that were,

625
00:41:52,192 --> 00:41:55,452
you know, as soon as I say this, some like Indy is going to release an amazing game

626
00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:57,373
with lots of like stuff like that.

627
00:41:57,733 --> 00:42:03,114
But like this game, I just don't, it would, like the fact that it takes away the agency from me,

628
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:08,195
that really, that grabs me and it's compelling.

629
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:11,136
It's a deliberate, yeah, it's a deliberate choice. Like again, like I said, like,

630
00:42:12,216 --> 00:42:17,837
you know, at Zachtronics, like we've made the, we make these extremely mechanics heavy games,

631
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:23,758
right? So it's not like beyond us to design a therapy game where like procedurally generated

632
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:24,618
people come in.

633
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:30,131
who have like four or five conditions and you like have to like give them procedurally

634
00:42:30,191 --> 00:42:35,594
generated like prescriptions or like figure out what to say to make them feel better.

635
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:40,937
And then we've created this like weird like simulation-y kind of model of like mental

636
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:45,099
health which is like weird and not something I wanted to get into, right?

637
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:48,820
Because then you're making as soon as you start designing a system around that, then

638
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:53,763
you're then you're starting to make this procedural argument that like, oh, if someone is depressed,

639
00:42:53,883 --> 00:42:54,303
they need...

640
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:59,336
this, right? Like, if someone has X problem, then they need Y.

641
00:42:59,456 --> 00:43:01,878
And if, if you don't give them that, then they're bad.

642
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:04,720
And if you do give them that, then they're better. And it's like,

643
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,384
I didn't want to like every person in, in Eliza is just their own person.

644
00:43:09,604 --> 00:43:11,886
They're their own specific, like case.

645
00:43:12,286 --> 00:43:15,829
And that and the reason why that's true is because it's a completely linear and

646
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:19,152
there's no choice. And again, that's a deliberate decision.

647
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:26,554
Modeling mental health just seems like such a minefield of unintended consequences and

648
00:43:26,595 --> 00:43:29,036
things and arguments that I didn't want to make.

649
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:32,818
It's a deliberate decision that kind of makes a commentary on that way of thinking.

650
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:37,902
Because there's one specific person in general where Chris and I both talked about it and

651
00:43:37,922 --> 00:43:43,605
we're like, yeah, she just came in to have a chat and the AI is like, well, here's a pill for you.

652
00:43:44,305 --> 00:43:47,586
Right. And like a lot of that is just kind of like you sit there at your computer going like oh

653
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:51,748
Oh, this is a commentary. My eyes like pop out of my head. Yeah

654
00:43:51,768 --> 00:43:59,490
Wait a minute, and then you know you have you have to sit there and then you have to repeat what the AI says and

655
00:44:01,051 --> 00:44:04,672
It feels like you are making things worse

656
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:11,634
That you're contributing to something bad. Mm-hmm. And then you get into all of this stuff like

657
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,036
You know, what am I, you start thinking, what am I involved in?

658
00:44:15,056 --> 00:44:16,597
Uh, what am I doing?

659
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:20,681
You know, the, to this world, what's my impact on this world?

660
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:26,025
Uh, is like the, these little things that you do, uh, is that making it better?

661
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:27,025
Is that helping people?

662
00:44:28,086 --> 00:44:28,286
Right.

663
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:32,389
And that's kind of the ultimate like question that the game asks, right.

664
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:37,413
It was, which is what are you, how are you contributing to the world and how do

665
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:38,654
you feel good about what you're doing?

666
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,295
Um, yeah.

667
00:44:40,922 --> 00:44:46,686
I'm gonna... no, no, don't wrap it up. I'm gonna hijack. I have one more question I want to ask before... I know we're running short on time.

668
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:58,615
But it's like, it's half a credit to the voice acting and half a credit to the writing that like, all of those characters and all those situations in like, the Eliza therapy sessions all seem human.

669
00:44:58,815 --> 00:44:59,335
And not like...

670
00:45:00,216 --> 00:45:05,364
People really... I think it's easy when you're dealing with mental health topics and trauma

671
00:45:05,384 --> 00:45:11,953
and anxieties and stuff like that to write characters that are just those traits. But like,

672
00:45:12,494 --> 00:45:14,597
so far all the people I've encountered feel like they...

673
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:21,162
have rounded out lives and that everything seems like amazingly human in actuality.

674
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:27,346
And I guess I wonder if you can talk a little bit about writing human characters or the voice

675
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:32,830
acting process of coaching into getting this really genuine feeling in each of those very

676
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,453
personal intimate moments. Yeah, totally. I mean, I could talk about both of those things for a

677
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:39,675
really long time. But I'll say.

678
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:48,125
In terms of, I'll start with the voice acting, like, when the voice actors came in, I, we just talked about how I told them that I was

679
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:54,828
interested in getting very naturalistic performances and not, you know, stagy performances, and

680
00:45:56,189 --> 00:46:02,854
not to worry about like where one line begins and where one line ends. Oftentimes in game scripts,

681
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:09,059
the lines have to be very separate, and actors who know how to act for games know to like pause

682
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,142
between lines because they're going to be cut up into the dialogue stuff. And I said, well,

683
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:18,375
If it feels natural to just run into the next sentence, just do that, and I'll fix it on

684
00:46:18,435 --> 00:46:22,679
my end so that the one line becomes two lines, or two lines become one line.

685
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,160
And stuff like that.

686
00:46:24,341 --> 00:46:31,187
And sentences that I had written that were weirdly stilted or whatever, we fixed in the

687
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:36,652
recording booth as we went, just to find that really natural delivery and that really natural

688
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:37,213
performance.

689
00:46:37,737 --> 00:46:40,898
And a lot of that was the actors responding to me,

690
00:46:40,938 --> 00:46:42,758
like trusting them with the material.

691
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:46,220
Like I didn't try to say it this way

692
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,060
or come at it this exact way.

693
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,101
It was more like providing a space

694
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,442
to let them find a place to take it.

695
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:55,703
So that's the voice acting part.

696
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,164
And again, I could talk about that for a really long time.

697
00:46:58,844 --> 00:46:59,524
The other thing was,

698
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:06,644
I did some, you know, when I was doing my research before or during writing this, I

699
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:11,825
spoke to some, some people, some mental health professionals, interviewed them.

700
00:47:12,526 --> 00:47:18,968
I also drew on my own experience going to therapy and sort of like what I what I know

701
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:22,168
from my friends as well who have experienced similar things.

702
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:27,770
And I think it was important to me to like show that people you don't you don't talk

703
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:27,990
about.

704
00:47:29,027 --> 00:47:33,929
Your deepest problem, like the first thing when you walk into your therapist's office,

705
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:38,290
right? You don't just immediately bring up the thing that's lurking underneath everything at

706
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:43,332
all. You don't just like, you know, you're not like, it's not like your therapist is like,

707
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:45,472
how are you? And you're like, Oh, my parents disowned me.

708
00:47:46,132 --> 00:47:48,913
That's like lurking in the background. And sometimes it takes like.

709
00:47:49,594 --> 00:47:55,037
multiple sessions to even get anywhere near there. A lot of people don't talk, like, they

710
00:47:55,057 --> 00:48:00,420
don't even feel comfortable talking about the real issue. And so like, showing that

711
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:06,304
people don't necessarily just like, do that was also very important to me. That there's

712
00:48:06,404 --> 00:48:09,947
always like something, you know, the real issue is kind of lurking in the background

713
00:48:11,207 --> 00:48:15,750
a lot of the time. And then and if if the therapy clients feel more human for that reason,

714
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:16,211
I think it's that

715
00:48:16,231 --> 00:48:16,771
Transcribed by https://otter.ai

716
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:21,098
It's that part of that approach, you know, in the writing to get there.

717
00:48:22,118 --> 00:48:29,363
Last question, uh, before we let you go, is there any happy ending in this

718
00:48:29,563 --> 00:48:32,405
relationship between humans and technology?

719
00:48:34,506 --> 00:48:38,449
Like in the real world, like in the real world, you know, I think, I, I

720
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:40,550
think that, that it is possible.

721
00:48:41,391 --> 00:48:46,093
Um, I'm, I'm not sure if it is probable, but I think that it is possible because

722
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:46,754
I, I believe.

723
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:51,268
The technology itself on its own is neutral, right?

724
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:52,749
And that's really just how we use it.

725
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,812
Like technology on its own is not good or bad.

726
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:55,893
It's how it's applied.

727
00:48:56,494 --> 00:49:01,920
And if we are careful and think about how we apply technology, then we can benefit from

728
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,040
it.

729
00:49:02,641 --> 00:49:04,323
And of course, we're all being very careful.

730
00:49:04,782 --> 00:49:07,623
And we're doing a great job of it so far.

731
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:09,524
You hear that Amazon Alexa in the corner.

732
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:10,484
Yeah, right.

733
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:11,485
Nothing to worry about.

734
00:49:11,505 --> 00:49:13,305
I feel like everything's going smoothly.

735
00:49:13,345 --> 00:49:15,686
I don't know about you guys, but I think everything's going great.

736
00:49:15,826 --> 00:49:16,786
Love that technology.

737
00:49:17,106 --> 00:49:18,507
Right, you love that technology.

738
00:49:19,147 --> 00:49:21,248
On that note, we all love technology.

739
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:23,088
We also all love Eliza.

740
00:49:23,709 --> 00:49:26,150
And thank you so much, Matthew, for joining us.

741
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,370
And best of luck with the game.

742
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:29,291
Thank you.

743
00:49:29,311 --> 00:49:30,031
Thank you for having me.

744
00:49:49,137 --> 00:49:51,278
Alright, Matthew's out of the room now.

745
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:53,739
Uh, that's heavy stuff.

746
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,180
Yeah.

747
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:55,921
Right?

748
00:49:56,361 --> 00:50:00,643
I kinda just wanna swoop back to my notes that started off with visual novels.

749
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:01,583
What a genre.

750
00:50:01,963 --> 00:50:02,264
Yeah.

751
00:50:02,764 --> 00:50:03,264
Yeah, yeah.

752
00:50:03,744 --> 00:50:05,445
I wanna swoop back into the fetal position.

753
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:13,973
No, it's such a good game and hopefully it doesn't, you know, turn people off who might

754
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:15,775
be listening to this.

755
00:50:17,617 --> 00:50:22,001
That it is, there's some profound stuff in there, right?

756
00:50:22,407 --> 00:50:26,449
Yeah, the last thing we want to do is get guests on the show and then discourage people

757
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:27,330
from playing their games.

758
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:33,913
But I think the one thing that I tried to get out of it when we were all chatting, but

759
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:37,555
the one nice thing about Eliza is that it feels like it deals with a lot of heavy topics

760
00:50:37,615 --> 00:50:38,335
but it gives them...

761
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:44,780
the weight that they deserve and the amount of thought they deserve and the entire game's

762
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,682
about the same questions that you're asking as you're playing it.

763
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:50,204
So in that note, the writing is very…

764
00:50:50,224 --> 00:50:55,468
I have the word meaningful written a million times throughout my notes here, because everything

765
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:59,391
just feels meaningful and feels very cared about.

766
00:51:00,285 --> 00:51:08,268
Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, a lot of sci-fi, which, you know, this is, it's very

767
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:16,991
near future sci-fi, I think, is really kind of, there's kind of one point of view and

768
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:19,091
it's technology sucks and we're all doomed.

769
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:21,833
This isn't like that.

770
00:51:22,474 --> 00:51:30,600
There are characters who really believe in this kind of AI-based therapy.

771
00:51:31,361 --> 00:51:37,546
There's a character that really believes that this is going to help people.

772
00:51:38,347 --> 00:51:40,368
And that's the reason that they're in it.

773
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:49,153
So you have a spectrum of people who think of Eliza, the AI,

774
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:50,574
in all these different ways.

775
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:54,657
You have the extreme, who is this character Nora,

776
00:51:54,797 --> 00:51:56,938
who used to work on the project.

777
00:51:57,478 --> 00:52:01,581
And then she left to lead the life of a musician and an artist.

778
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:04,483
And then she becomes one of the harshest critics of it.

779
00:52:05,643 --> 00:52:14,046
Whereas you have the big CEOs of these tech companies who are all about it.

780
00:52:14,766 --> 00:52:18,948
And then you have the people in the middle who are somewhere in between.

781
00:52:20,394 --> 00:52:26,316
Yeah, if you break it down to its most basic parts, there are these very clear, against,

782
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:32,177
for, chaotic in the middle, these very clear sides, but in the actual implementation of

783
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:35,798
it it's really human and believable and just a really good game.

784
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:36,319
Visual novels are good.

785
00:52:38,139 --> 00:52:46,365
Yeah, and it reminds me of, and people see this, or people have seen it if they've played the game,

786
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:52,228
it reminded me of when I was in college a little bit and I was telemarketing and it's like stick

787
00:52:52,248 --> 00:52:57,392
to the script and then you have your boss. Yes, I was a telemarketer. I was one of those

788
00:52:57,932 --> 00:53:01,475
awful people. Shaking my head, you can't see it, but I hope you can feel it.

789
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:03,777
It was college, I needed the money.

790
00:53:04,878 --> 00:53:07,621
Which is probably what a lot of these proxies in ELIZA thought.

791
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:15,008
It was college, I needed the money, so I became a proxy for machine learning robot thing.

792
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:17,790
But yeah, stick to the script.

793
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:22,395
You have no agency, and by the way, your boss is listening in on you.

794
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:24,637
Make sure that you're doing the job right.

795
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:33,008
I think my one big high-level takeaway from this conversation is just the benefit of not

796
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:35,990
sticking to your brand, I guess, in a way.

797
00:53:36,771 --> 00:53:41,014
In a million years, every—well, three weeks ago when this was announced, every single

798
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,877
headline was like, Zachtronics is making a visual novel?

799
00:53:44,477 --> 00:53:48,400
No one could believe it, because it's such an out-there game based on the past library

800
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,281
that they'd put out before.

801
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:53,985
But like, they did it and they went for it and it just, it resonates in such a great way where

802
00:53:54,005 --> 00:53:58,108
like sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone and everyone should make a visual novel is

803
00:53:58,128 --> 00:54:04,413
what I'm getting at. And I've seen some of the user reviews, you know, pray for me, I went into

804
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:10,498
the Steam user review section. Brave. But yeah, I was just looking at it and there are Zachtronics

805
00:54:11,479 --> 00:54:17,804
fans of the previous games who really like this one. So, you know, there might be more overlap

806
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:18,405
than you think.

807
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,701
It's interesting how the theme of...

808
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:23,722
They went from puzzle games for programmers

809
00:54:23,742 --> 00:54:25,643
to a game about big...

810
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,245
The programming morality question is there.

811
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,946
There's always this underlying beat

812
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:32,066
that's very interesting

813
00:54:32,086 --> 00:54:34,668
to see when they deviate from genre.

814
00:54:34,828 --> 00:54:36,068
It's just a very cool outcome.

815
00:54:36,569 --> 00:54:43,575
When, when I talked to Zach at GDC, uh, he was, he was very much like, I mean,

816
00:54:43,856 --> 00:54:52,063
they have, they released a huge, uh, instruction manual for, uh, I think it's

817
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,445
for TIS, um, and it.

818
00:54:55,927 --> 00:54:58,048
It's actually like an engineering manual.

819
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:03,610
It's like meant to be like an actual electronics, like engineering manual.

820
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:07,872
And so, you know, you got that novelty thing and Matthew did work on that as well.

821
00:55:08,552 --> 00:55:14,054
Uh, but you do have this, this reputation, like even Zach was like, if you don't,

822
00:55:14,254 --> 00:55:17,656
if you don't understand our games, uh, you know, I don't care.

823
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,603
And you know, the crowd at GDC were just like, yeah!

824
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:25,766
Because it does give you kind of a special thing.

825
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:26,746
Like, I understand this.

826
00:55:26,847 --> 00:55:29,249
Like, this is a game for me, for my brain.

827
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:35,455
And then you come out with this that, you know, kind of that questions a lot of things

828
00:55:35,595 --> 00:55:37,817
that programming lays the foundation for.

829
00:55:39,399 --> 00:55:40,160
Oh yeah, that's cool.

830
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:45,361
Yeah, I think like all of my in the conversation notes are just like things I wanted to dig in

831
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:50,202
on more because there's just so much so much cool surrounding how this came to be.

832
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:55,843
Yeah, it touches on so many different things. Now, we're not talking spoilers here. So

833
00:55:57,403 --> 00:56:06,665
yeah, keep listening. But it talks about it touches on things like, as a society in today's world,

834
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:07,745
where

835
00:56:08,993 --> 00:56:14,356
Coding, yes, is important, you know, STEM is very important and all that, but at the

836
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:19,659
same time we are devaluing the arts, for example.

837
00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:26,122
You know, we are associating intelligence with one skill set.

838
00:56:27,142 --> 00:56:27,782
You know what I'm saying?

839
00:56:28,042 --> 00:56:29,604
Which is, you know, coding.

840
00:56:29,944 --> 00:56:35,729
That's a smart thing to do and then, you know, if you don't know how to code, you just, you

841
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:38,692
know, write books, you know?

842
00:56:39,132 --> 00:56:42,635
One of those in our society is valued over the other.

843
00:56:43,655 --> 00:56:48,478
Yeah there's Nora, I'm so bad with names, that applies to game characters as well, but

844
00:56:48,859 --> 00:56:52,021
Nora the programmer turned really cool DJ.

845
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:52,861
Yeah, the musician.

846
00:56:53,682 --> 00:56:58,405
And like her, there's a conversation early on, it's all early on, no spoilers, that kind

847
00:56:58,425 --> 00:57:03,929
of equates certain things in her programming life to using those same skills as artistic

848
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:08,833
expression as a musician and just a lot of really cool kind of little conversation starters

849
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,054
in there to really make you think.

850
00:57:10,442 --> 00:57:15,114
Yeah, she's like an electronic musician and she's using all of this stuff.

851
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:18,062
You know, her music is about input and output.

852
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:24,997
I meant to mention it when Matthew was still on the call, but that song was really good

853
00:57:25,017 --> 00:57:28,780
and I wanted to mention it, but the music's really great too and there's a lot of subtle

854
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,863
things to it and I should have said that when he was on the call.

855
00:57:32,543 --> 00:57:35,266
Matthew is too good at too many things.

856
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:41,631
This podcast isn't long enough to go through all of his talents.

857
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:47,094
The game is great.

858
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:48,856
It's Eliza.

859
00:57:49,256 --> 00:57:51,639
I think that's it.

860
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:53,661
So we should wind her down here, right?

861
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:56,564
Yeah.

862
00:57:56,584 --> 00:58:01,849
We're actually on iTunes and Google Play, which

863
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:03,410
I don't think anybody uses.

864
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,393
So shout out to people who use.

865
00:58:08,313 --> 00:58:10,195
Google Play for podcasts.

866
00:58:10,975 --> 00:58:12,396
And also Spotify.

867
00:58:13,217 --> 00:58:17,539
We're actually getting some followers off of our first one, which is good.

868
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:22,912
Spotify's podcast stuff has apparently gotten a lot better just in the past couple months.

869
00:58:22,992 --> 00:58:26,275
Not just because the GDC podcast is now on the platform, but like...

870
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:27,096
I think that it was us.

871
00:58:27,656 --> 00:58:29,338
We pushed, we kicked it off, but yeah.

872
00:58:29,658 --> 00:58:30,539
Yeah, it was us.

873
00:58:30,979 --> 00:58:37,325
All you people who want to do a new podcast, ride the wave of the GDC podcast.

874
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:39,607
So we're gonna go now.

875
00:58:40,488 --> 00:58:41,309
I'm Chris Graft.

876
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:42,670
I'm Alyssa McAloon.

877
00:58:43,363 --> 00:58:44,124
