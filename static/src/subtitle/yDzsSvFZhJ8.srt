1
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:05,479
Hi everybody, thank you for attending this talk.

2
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:07,800
My name is Florent Morin.

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,983
As you can tell by my wonderful accent, I'm from France.

4
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:15,585
And I'm going to try to explain to you

5
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,447
how in our game, Bury My Love,

6
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:21,309
we try to make the player feel helplessness.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,612
Helplessness is not a feeling that is often explored in video games,

8
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:30,637
but when you tackle certain topics, you just don't have the choice.

9
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:31,939
And that was our case.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,823
I'm supposed to remind you to turn off your phones,

11
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:39,967
and also if we don't have time for any questions at the end of the talk,

12
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,931
we can meet in the wrap-up room of Overlook 2022.

13
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:44,651
Thank you.

14
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:51,337
So, very quickly, who am I? I'm a former journalist.

15
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:55,801
I've been a journalist for 10 years before I started making video games.

16
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,204
And then I founded The Pixel Hunt in 2013.

17
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:05,590
And The Pixel Hunt is a video game studio that specializes in reality-inspired games.

18
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:09,714
What are reality-inspired games? Well, I'll come back to it in...

19
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:15,280
A moment. Our latest game is Bury My Love.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,843
Now, I'm sure a lot of people here have already played it,

21
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:22,145
but I'm not sure everyone has, so here's a quick trailer

22
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:24,206
for you to get familiar with the project.

23
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:55,554
So, Bury My Love is a reality-inspired game.

24
00:02:56,074 --> 00:03:01,456
It is a game that is directly based on true real-life events.

25
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:06,639
In our case, the story of migrants who fled from Syria

26
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,719
and are still fleeing from Syria today

27
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,901
and try to reach Europe in hopes of a better life.

28
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,706
It was written by the help of Dana.

29
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:18,710
Dana is a Syrian woman who left Damascus in 2015

30
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,893
and who's now living in Germany.

31
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:24,935
And we met Dana because of an article

32
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:26,857
in French newspaper Le Monde,

33
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:29,279
where she was telling the story

34
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,642
of how she kept in touch with her family via WhatsApp

35
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:35,305
for all the journey she made.

36
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,453
So this was a very inspiring story and we decided to make a game that would mimic the

37
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:50,497
way migrants use messaging apps because you may or may not know that nowadays almost every

38
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:55,279
migrant has a smartphone and for them that's not a luxury, that's actually the only way

39
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,702
they have to keep in touch with their friends and families, so that's very crucial to them.

40
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:04,945
Then again, when you make a reality-inspired game,

41
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:07,746
there are ethics you have to respect.

42
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,388
And they are actually quite close to journalism

43
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:13,810
or documentary filmmaking ethics.

44
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,591
So I was already familiar with them

45
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,071
before I started making games.

46
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:22,764
Things you could, you should do is to respect reality.

47
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:25,666
You have to gather a lot of documentation,

48
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,607
you have to be really sure to really know

49
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:28,528
what you're talking about.

50
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:31,730
And you also obviously have to listen to the people

51
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,531
who actually experience the story

52
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,592
you are telling in your games.

53
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,835
There also are things that you should not do.

54
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:41,517
And the main and most important thing,

55
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:45,138
and the thing that is really different from classic games,

56
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,680
is that you should not be too player-centric.

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,862
A lot of games focus on the player and on fun.

58
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:54,944
And sometimes that makes players a little bit

59
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,744
like untitled brats.

60
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:01,907
They expect that the game is built around and for them

61
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:02,808
and for the pleasure.

62
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:05,529
That's not what we did for Birmingham Love.

63
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:07,650
That made us get some.

64
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:15,199
some hefty comments, but still we are happy with it because it was mandatory for the topic

65
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:16,220
we wanted to tackle.

66
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:21,283
So I pushed the wrong button because I'm so scared.

67
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:29,128
What we learned actually listening to migrants, we've been listening to Dana, obviously we've

68
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:33,931
been chatting with Dana over WhatsApp, asking lots of questions, but we also listened to

69
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:36,373
lots of other migrants and read and...

70
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:43,148
saw things. And what we learned is that no matter how you prepare your journey, things

71
00:05:43,188 --> 00:05:47,353
will go sideways. There are too many things that you cannot control, that you are not

72
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,996
aware of, too many policies that change.

73
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:53,616
So you will need to adapt.

74
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:56,318
You will more often than not have the feeling

75
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,480
that you are not in control at all.

76
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,482
Also, being connected with your loved ones

77
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,165
is nice because you have them in your pocket.

78
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,547
You can give them updates on your situation.

79
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:08,629
But it's also very hard.

80
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,134
because they are always with you

81
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:13,876
while not being physically with you.

82
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:16,218
So if something bad happens to you, what should you do?

83
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:17,039
Should you tell them?

84
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,561
Should you keep them from knowing

85
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:20,922
because you don't want them to worry?

86
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:22,383
Should you lie to them?

87
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:24,605
This is difficult.

88
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:27,107
And it's also difficult on the other side,

89
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,809
when you're someone who's stayed in Syria

90
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,531
or who's already in Germany,

91
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,894
and you're waiting for news and you don't get news.

92
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:39,622
Whereas you know you could get news because they have a phone.

93
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:41,746
What happens? What's going on?

94
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:44,512
This is very difficult to live through.

95
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:49,204
And for those who stay, or for those who are already arrived,

96
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:52,445
helplessness is the feeling that they get the most.

97
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,186
And this is the feeling that they have the most trouble

98
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:55,947
dealing with.

99
00:06:56,187 --> 00:07:00,369
So that's why we designed our entire game around this feeling

100
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:01,129
of helplessness.

101
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:05,051
We wanted you, as players, to obviously not live their lives,

102
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:08,632
because it's just a video game, but to empathize

103
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:11,693
and to understand what those people go through.

104
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,861
So how did we do that?

105
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:17,424
How did we convey this feeling of helplessness

106
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:19,006
as a game design?

107
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,811
First of all, we put you in a position.

108
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,368
where you are not on the ground.

109
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:27,929
It's not you who travels.

110
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,212
You play as Majd, Nor's husband.

111
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,093
And I don't even like to say that

112
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:35,515
because you're not really playing as Majd.

113
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:37,817
Majd is a character on his own,

114
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:39,818
and sometimes he will say things

115
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:41,340
that you would probably not say

116
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,082
because maybe of cultural differences or anything.

117
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:47,764
So it's not even about you as the player,

118
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:50,466
but the character you are impersonating

119
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:51,567
is not on the ground.

120
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:52,468
He's not the one who is.

121
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:59,439
living things. So that's a kind of a special situation for a video game.

122
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:06,689
So to make you understand that, we thought we had to make a very living Noor.

123
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:10,612
We wanted to convey to you the feeling that you were talking to a real person,

124
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:16,197
that Noor was really alive. And how did we make that?

125
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:20,361
First, we tried to make her as consistent as possible.

126
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:25,546
Noor is brave, she's zestful, she's independent, she's also fairly stubborn.

127
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,227
And she has a tendency to trust people too easily.

128
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:31,468
Those were our writing guidelines

129
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:34,409
that we tried to keep along the way

130
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:38,790
when we were writing the 110,000 words of the game.

131
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:42,272
Because we wanted you, no matter which path you would take,

132
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:44,673
to feel that you were really connecting

133
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:46,733
and bonding with a real person.

134
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:51,801
Then again, Noor lives through very tough times,

135
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,602
and sometimes she will lie too much.

136
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:57,444
This comes from a testimony from Dana,

137
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:01,346
and I think it's one of the best proofs of love

138
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:03,026
that you can even give someone.

139
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:05,147
You are living through a very terrible situation

140
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:07,028
and you don't want to tell your loved ones

141
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:09,149
because you don't want them to worry.

142
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,171
So Nour lies to Majd, and she lies to you.

143
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,412
And sometimes if you're very careful,

144
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:17,953
if you read her, all her message very carefully,

145
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:21,555
you will notice all the time that she told you something

146
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,756
at one moment, and then you realize

147
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,417
that it wasn't the complete truth.

148
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:27,358
So that makes you feel helpless.

149
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:31,620
Why did she feel compelled to hide things from you?

150
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,341
Because they are terrible things,

151
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,962
because she thought you could not do anything about that.

152
00:09:37,863 --> 00:09:39,163
That's up to you to imagine.

153
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,594
And also, Noor hesitates when she talks to you.

154
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:46,175
And this is also an important way to make you feel

155
00:09:46,215 --> 00:09:48,255
that she actually leaves things.

156
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:52,056
One very quick technical point.

157
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:57,058
To make Bermuda Love, we used Inkle Studios

158
00:09:57,778 --> 00:09:59,578
scripting language, Ink.

159
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,439
And because it's open source, and because it's awesome,

160
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:06,400
and because the people at Inkle Studios are super dope,

161
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,441
so thank them.

162
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:13,382
Okay? And in the script we put some commands, and for instance, these fake commands,

163
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:20,264
followed by a time in milliseconds, will make this little animation of Nouri's typing

164
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:22,205
appear on the screen, then disappear.

165
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:27,286
So you would think as a player, oh, she wanted to tell me something, but she changed her mind.

166
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,586
Why did she do that? And you don't have the answer.

167
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:31,827
You just have to imagine why.

168
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:34,088
Also...

169
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,019
Majd is not on the ground, but he loves Noor,

170
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,221
so he wants to help her very, very, very bad.

171
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,421
So he will feel compelled to give advice,

172
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,842
even though you don't have enough information

173
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:49,983
to know which advice is good or which advice is bad.

174
00:10:50,203 --> 00:10:53,204
So sometimes you will give Noor bad advice

175
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:55,945
and you will maybe feel bad about that,

176
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:59,606
but it came from a good part of your heart.

177
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:00,467
You wanted to help her.

178
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,508
You just didn't know what the consequences would be.

179
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:08,938
But the main feature to make you understand that you are not on the ground is the fact that

180
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,802
Bury My Love is a game that consists of 99% of waiting.

181
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:17,403
You are actually not playing the game.

182
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,846
You can put the phone in your pocket because Noor has to do things

183
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:23,207
and she doesn't have time to chat with you

184
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:27,951
and so you have to wait for a new notification for her to come back to you.

185
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:30,372
She's the one who's leaving the things.

186
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,894
You are just the one who is there for her.

187
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:35,740
if she needs you, but she doesn't always need you.

188
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:37,941
How did we convey that?

189
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:40,743
First, we had three states for Noor.

190
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,985
The basic state is that she's online,

191
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:46,827
so she appears online like in every chat applications.

192
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:50,630
But when we add a little command line on the script,

193
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,392
wait for 30 minutes and be busy,

194
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:57,175
then the status turns to busy.

195
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:59,136
So you know that she's still connected,

196
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,558
she's still there, she's normally okay.

197
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,569
But she can't talk to you because she has things to do.

198
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,771
But sometimes, there will be waiting times

199
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:10,293
where Noor will appear as offline.

200
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:12,814
And then you will start wondering, what happened?

201
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:13,335
Why?

202
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:15,156
Why is she completely offline?

203
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:17,217
Doesn't she have battery in the phone anymore?

204
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:21,279
Is she in a zone where there's no signal, no coverage?

205
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,081
Or is something worse happened?

206
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:27,563
Well, you will not know until Noor is back online.

207
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,104
And as you are not on the ground,

208
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:31,145
you will not decide when she will be back online.

209
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:36,275
Also, we did not hesitate to populate the game with very,

210
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:38,116
very short sessions.

211
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:42,077
For instance, in this screenshot, you must wait for

212
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,937
20 minutes for her to come back.

213
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:47,298
And she just comes and tells you that she's approaching

214
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:50,399
the border and that she will be away from coverage.

215
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:53,179
And so she can't talk to you anymore.

216
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,360
And then she's.

217
00:12:55,565 --> 00:13:00,047
off again. So you have a notification, you read three sentences and then you can put

218
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:04,950
your phone back. We try to do that in order to make you feel that she's the one leaving

219
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:11,953
the things and you are not. The second point is that even when you can talk to her and

220
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:17,375
even when you make choices, you are often not really in control.

221
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:24,310
To explain that, I have to give you a little detail about how Noor works as a game character.

222
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:26,413
She's defined by three variables.

223
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:30,238
The first one is her money. She leaves her country with a sum,

224
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:33,002
and she will have to pay smugglers to pay for...

225
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:36,623
a bed to eat food and everything.

226
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,424
And sometimes you will reach situations

227
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,265
when if she doesn't have enough money,

228
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:41,746
she can't do some things.

229
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,988
But there are two other variables

230
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:46,469
that are more psychological.

231
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:47,930
The first one is the love,

232
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,272
the love relationship between her and you.

233
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:56,817
And sometimes you will give her advice that will maybe make her love you less or love you more

234
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:58,398
and you will not know that.

235
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,640
And the third one is her morale. Is she doing okay?

236
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,623
Did she live through something that was really bad for her morale?

237
00:14:06,824 --> 00:14:10,807
Those three variables are evolving during the entire game.

238
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:16,389
And this is important because sometimes, very rarely in fact,

239
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,611
you will have direct decisions.

240
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,093
When Noor doesn't know what to do, for instance,

241
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:25,538
should she go to location A or location B,

242
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,561
she will ask you and you will be able to tell her what to do.

243
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:32,084
And if she's in a good mood, she will listen to you.

244
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:34,506
And sometimes she will not listen to you because she's stubborn.

245
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,649
But you will then have direct decision.

246
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:40,131
Okay, go that way, I think it's better,

247
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,332
and she will follow your advice.

248
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:43,975
But that's very rare, actually, in the game.

249
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:46,957
Most of the very important decision

250
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:48,619
that you will have to make are blind.

251
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:54,326
I mean, when you make them, you don't know that they are actually important decisions.

252
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:59,631
You just know that they are decisions that might seem trivial, or that might seem not

253
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,915
very important, but that might have very important consequences later on.

254
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:07,578
We keep you in the dark on that for the very same reason.

255
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:10,181
We want you to not feel in control.

256
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:16,601
And also, there will be decisions that you will not even be aware you are making

257
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:19,903
because you will not make a conscious choice.

258
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:24,446
For instance, very often in the game, you will answer Noor with an emoji.

259
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:28,469
And you see in this example that you can answer with three different emojis.

260
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:33,612
And two of them will give her a plus two in her love for you.

261
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:38,475
and one will give her minus six points in love for you.

262
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,117
That's actually very small values, it's not a lot.

263
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:44,419
But it's cumulative, and decision after decision

264
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,701
after decision, your relationship with her will evolve,

265
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:49,282
and her morale will evolve.

266
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:52,604
And then she will reach a point in her journey

267
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,065
when she will need a special...

268
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:58,168
a certain level of morale or a certain level of love for you

269
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,510
to take a decision or another decision.

270
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,173
And he will reach that point and take the decision accordingly.

271
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,296
So you will not have a direct control on the choice,

272
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:10,538
but the choice will happen anyway because it's cumulative over time.

273
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,122
But in any case, those variables are never displayed.

274
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,423
They are never visible to the player.

275
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:22,685
We don't want you to check for every choice you make,

276
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:25,546
like you would do in Reigns, for instance,

277
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,348
when you have a direct feedback over the variables of the game.

278
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:32,249
We want you to follow your guts and to give her

279
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,950
the advice you think are best.

280
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:41,404
And we came up with this idea after a long thinking process.

281
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:43,886
In the beginning, we thought we would add

282
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:46,749
to the status bar a mood indicator that would vary

283
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:50,393
depending on the level of love and level of morale

284
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:51,214
that Noura would feel.

285
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:56,257
and that would give you a little clue about how she felt.

286
00:16:56,998 --> 00:17:00,340
But we felt that it would be too extra diegetic,

287
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,261
that it would feel too much like a game

288
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,763
and not enough like talking to a real person.

289
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:07,364
So we decided to put this away.

290
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:11,127
What we did is at some moment in the game script,

291
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,588
we changed some expressions of Noor

292
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:15,009
depending on her condition.

293
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:17,270
So the only way you have to know how she feels

294
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:20,212
is to really, really pay attention to how she talks to you.

295
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:27,929
The third thing we wanted to put in the game to make you feel this helplessness

296
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,911
is that we wanted to be clear that for migrants life is not fair

297
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:36,593
and also that death is part of the journey.

298
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:44,196
We actually had a very long discussion among the team about this question.

299
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:47,417
After all, we spend a lot of time building

300
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,643
the relationship between you as a player and Noor.

301
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:54,524
So making her die can be terrible.

302
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:57,405
And also, we are talking about the real lives

303
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:59,706
of real people who really are risking their lives.

304
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:05,429
So would it be disrespectful to put death in the game?

305
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,510
But actually, we thought that it was the contrary,

306
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,311
the other way around.

307
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:17,609
it would have been disrespectful not to put death in the game because they are risking their lives and you should not ignore that.

308
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:24,810
So, there are 19 different endings in the game and some of them are very bad, including death situation.

309
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,271
And there are 39 ways to reach one of those 19 endings.

310
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,892
And as you can see, some of them are really bad.

311
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:38,833
But the majority of them are somewhere in between and that comes directly from the documentation phase where we...

312
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:43,317
noted that for most migrants, when they stop migrating,

313
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,019
that's because they are stuck somewhere.

314
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,104
They have to wait in a camp for their administrative status

315
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,746
to evolve, and they don't know.

316
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:52,727
They are stuck in limbo.

317
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,610
And we wanted to render that in the game also.

318
00:18:56,988 --> 00:19:02,592
But let me give you an example of how death can occur in the game.

319
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:05,414
And you will see how unfair this is.

320
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:07,536
This is the smuggler sequence.

321
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:10,438
I'm sorry, but it's a slight spoiler to the game.

322
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,820
But again, it's a conference, so I have to unveil things.

323
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,522
And in the smuggler sequence, you are in Izmir.

324
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:20,585
It's a Turkish city not far away from the Mediterranean Sea.

325
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:25,369
And Noor wants to take a boat to cross to Lesbos in Greece.

326
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:28,608
So the first choice you have to make is decide together

327
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,874
which smuggler she's going to see to cross the sea.

328
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,678
She can decide between a smuggler she doesn't know

329
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,641
but has met on the ground or another smuggler that was.

330
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:47,206
that she vaguely knows through mutual acquaintance.

331
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:49,347
So you have to choose that,

332
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:51,468
and you don't know which one is the best.

333
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:53,548
You just have to trust your guts once again.

334
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:56,949
Then she asks you, did I forget something?

335
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:59,630
Do you think about something I should take on my journey,

336
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,611
on my boat journey?

337
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,471
And you can advise her to take.

338
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:05,674
seasickness medicine or a flashlight.

339
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:09,217
Why should you decide to tell her one thing or another?

340
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:09,898
I don't know.

341
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:13,300
You should decide because you think one thing is best,

342
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:18,265
but you have no reason, no particular reason to decide.

343
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:24,939
And depending on those two choices, you can reach three, four different endings to this sequence.

344
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,442
In one of the combinations, Noor ends up okay.

345
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:33,506
She crosses the sea and it's tough, but she arrives fine.

346
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:39,591
In two of them, she makes it, but the journey is very, very complicated

347
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:43,754
and she's in a trauma because she sees things that are tough.

348
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,376
In the last one, you get to an ending.

349
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:51,417
And in Bury My Love, every ending is an audio log.

350
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:53,378
And this is the audio log you get.

351
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:57,899
Majd, I don't know if you're going to get this,

352
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,760
but I'm freaking out.

353
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:03,502
If the rescue team don't come soon, we won't.

354
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:06,303
We won't hold on.

355
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:08,584
Whatever.

356
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:14,586
I wanted to tell you, I love you.

357
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:14,866
I love you.

358
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:20,925
I love you, I love you, I love you.

359
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,025
Oh shit!

360
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:30,487
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.

361
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:33,788
Well, let me tell you something.

362
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,748
If I was a player and I played a game like that,

363
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:41,090
that's after two choices that I didn't have any idea.

364
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:44,381
of how to take them, how to make them,

365
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:47,103
ended up like that, I would want to punch

366
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:48,284
the game designer in the face.

367
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:51,406
Please don't punch me in the face.

368
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,708
As a game designer, I think it's important

369
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:58,911
to make you feel helpless and frustrated

370
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:02,053
and feel that it's terribly unfair because it is,

371
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:05,536
but simply because what we are talking about here

372
00:22:05,676 --> 00:22:09,078
is a terribly unfair situation, so sorry.

373
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:17,189
Actually, the only thing migrants have is to live by the moment.

374
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,894
They know better than everyone that it's not the destination that matters.

375
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:28,099
It will matter at a time, but they take one day after another.

376
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,841
And it's the journey that matters.

377
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,564
And that's what we try to do also in Bury My Love.

378
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:36,504
We wanted you to feel that way, to care about the journey,

379
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:40,766
to care about the good moments that you may encounter,

380
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,508
to care about the bad moments that you may also encounter,

381
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:51,872
and to understand that there will be many unexpected ones,

382
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:54,853
many surprises, many moments where you will have to adapt

383
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:57,855
to compensate for your lack of control.

384
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:06,740
So to render that, we made another thing that any good game design teacher would advise strongly against.

385
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,821
It's that there is no safe points in Birmingham I Love.

386
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:17,783
Even when you reach an ending, you cannot start back from one part of the story and decide,

387
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:22,645
oh I made this decision but it was very wrong, I want to go back there and change my decision.

388
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:24,405
You cannot do that in Birmingham I Love.

389
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:30,598
You have only two solutions when you reach an ending.

390
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,501
The first one is to restart from day one.

391
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:36,842
And why is that?

392
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:41,104
That is because for us, Noor is not a real person,

393
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:43,025
contrary to what I told you.

394
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:46,867
For us, Noor is a metaphor for the thousands

395
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:49,468
and hundreds of thousands of persons

396
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:51,849
who actually did this journey.

397
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:57,213
And we wanted you to feel that way, that every time you play Bury Me, My Love,

398
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:04,837
you play someone else, you play a new person that is trying to face a new situation.

399
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:11,700
But you have another possibility. You can also never play the game again,

400
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,963
and that's not a troll, I really mean it. I'm completely okay with that.

401
00:24:17,043 --> 00:24:21,265
You can never play the game again because, ultimately,

402
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:25,639
Burying My Love is a game about coming to terms with the idea

403
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:27,480
that no matter how much you love someone,

404
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,841
there are times when you simply cannot save them.

405
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:33,462
Thank you.

406
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:46,907
I hope you have questions because I've

407
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:48,808
been rushing through the presentation

408
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:52,570
to be lucky enough to discuss it with you.

409
00:24:55,651 --> 00:24:56,171
Hi.

410
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:57,292
Hi.

411
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:57,952
My name is Jeremy.

412
00:24:57,992 --> 00:24:58,552
It's great to meet you.

413
00:24:58,572 --> 00:25:00,993
Thank you so much for doing this and presenting.

414
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:05,475
It's, uh, I don't even know how to, I have words.

415
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:07,556
I have a lot of questions.

416
00:25:07,696 --> 00:25:08,536
I'll ask one for now.

417
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:17,200
Why is it important for you for players

418
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,821
to feel helpless when playing this game?

419
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:23,382
And how does getting your players to feel that

420
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,003
make them care about the situation?

421
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:29,239
I'm not a... how to put that?

422
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,161
This is not advocacy.

423
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:37,624
I don't care about changing the player's mind or anything.

424
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:41,727
I'm not an NGO. I don't have an agenda.

425
00:25:42,968 --> 00:25:45,670
Nor do I want to make a political statement.

426
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:48,272
When I documented for this game,

427
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:52,534
I was so overwhelmed by all unfair and...

428
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:55,495
and terrible those situations were.

429
00:25:55,975 --> 00:26:01,657
And I thought to myself, if we, in the situation we are in,

430
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:03,598
privileged situation we are in,

431
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:07,140
can have a game that can give us a glimpse

432
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,481
of what it is to go through those situations,

433
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:12,782
it is worth it.

434
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:15,583
We should try to do a game like that.

435
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:18,344
So that's the main reason why I wanted to make this game.

436
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:20,385
And that's why I decided to...

437
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:26,505
design the whole game around this idea that the player should feel the same way.

438
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:28,246
Thanks.

439
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:29,246
Welcome.

440
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:31,447
Hi.

441
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:31,947
Hi.

442
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:37,208
So first of all, congrats on having the guts to make all those tough decisions,

443
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:42,010
going against the usual conventions of the game design.

444
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,354
But my question is about, so that audio log thing was very

445
00:26:46,394 --> 00:26:48,196
powerful, very emotional.

446
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:54,282
When you built that, how did the community react to it?

447
00:26:54,422 --> 00:27:00,109
And did their reaction affect how you guys ended up handling

448
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,291
that kind of thing, that emotional stuff?

449
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:04,714
Actually.

450
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:10,674
It didn't have any impact because we weren't in an open development,

451
00:27:10,814 --> 00:27:12,975
so we didn't have any feedback on the game.

452
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:14,936
Why? Yes, we ran playtests.

453
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:17,777
But they were mostly functional playtests,

454
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:20,779
and we had some questions in the playtest

455
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,539
on the writing styles and the endings,

456
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,541
but we didn't really care about those.

457
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:30,907
We really wanted to be sure that people knew where to click,

458
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:33,429
but the story was ours.

459
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:35,010
And I think that it's important.

460
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,612
You know, I've had lots of discussions

461
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:41,034
with the people in the games industry in France

462
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:43,675
about, are there authors?

463
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:51,638
in video games and they say no, it's a common work, there's no authors, we're not filmmakers or anything, and I get that.

464
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:59,480
But I also think that some games should be the work of authors, and they should decide what they want to make and

465
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,300
regardless of what

466
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,262
the audience may or may not think. And if we make bad choices, then the game will be bad and it will be on us.

467
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:13,263
But you know, that's like every piece of art. It's our responsibility.

468
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:14,726
OK, thank you.

469
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:19,968
Hey, I actually have two really quick questions.

470
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:21,829
First, I wanted to say a really good presentation.

471
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:24,090
It was cool seeing how you treated Noor as a person.

472
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,671
And you're able to have her maybe decide not to text you,

473
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:28,332
which is really cool.

474
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:31,293
But my first question is, as a journalist,

475
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:34,955
do you see yourself having more stories, maybe

476
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:38,536
in a similar context, maybe not, in the future with more games

477
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:39,417
coming up with Pixel Hunt?

478
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:40,697
And my second question is, where'd

479
00:28:40,717 --> 00:28:41,878
you get that shirt that's pretty rad?

480
00:28:43,475 --> 00:28:43,916
Threadless.

481
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:44,916
OK, that's a good shirt.

482
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:47,917
OK, for the first question, I definitely

483
00:28:47,957 --> 00:28:50,899
intend to make only reality-inspired games.

484
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,301
But that doesn't mean that it's only inspired by the news

485
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:59,022
or the real events.

486
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:01,523
Actually, my next project is about something

487
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:02,424
much more intimate.

488
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:07,791
what it means to be a person, and what is important for us.

489
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:12,097
So it won't be directly linked to something that happens in the world,

490
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:16,683
but I think we are all part of the world, so we are all something that happens in the world.

491
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:18,186
Cool, sounds great. Thank you.

492
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:18,907
You're welcome.

493
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:26,670
He asked what I wanted to ask already, so I just wanted to congratulate you on almost

494
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:33,115
making an entire room of grown-up people cry with that audio.

495
00:29:33,296 --> 00:29:38,200
It's by Chloe Hollings, and she's a very, very talented voice actor.

496
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,763
And the French voice actor, Bayard Reyes, is like...

497
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:44,965
I cried while recording the audio with her.

498
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:45,686
It was amazing.

499
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,388
It was very sad, actually, but you know what I mean.

500
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:51,346
I do agree, that's a really red shirt.

501
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:54,969
Thank you.

502
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:59,833
I almost came with another one, so I'm pretty glad.

503
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:02,756
Thank you very much, it was a wonderful presentation.

504
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:04,177
I have a question for you.

505
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:09,741
Is the game actually waiting for you to make a decision, or it's like an ongoing process?

506
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:14,265
So basically, whether you interact with a character or whether you're not.

507
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:16,998
It's like a continuous journey.

508
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:19,819
Do you have to play the game for it to complete?

509
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,940
Yes, definitely.

510
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,162
And that's actually something that's a bit subtle.

511
00:30:25,302 --> 00:30:28,223
And I'm very frustrated with my English right now

512
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:30,144
because I can't explain it the way

513
00:30:30,184 --> 00:30:32,826
I would want it to be explained.

514
00:30:32,986 --> 00:30:38,228
But the idea that you choosing an emoji over another

515
00:30:38,508 --> 00:30:40,750
can completely change the whole story.

516
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:46,753
such a mundane thing as an emoji can have a little, little impact on Noor.

517
00:30:47,154 --> 00:30:53,639
But that's just the thing that makes her drop or that helps her to keep going.

518
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:55,731
this is really important.

519
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,952
And lots of people have told us, but this is a linear game.

520
00:30:58,392 --> 00:30:59,553
I don't have the impression,

521
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:01,994
I'm not under the impression of making any choice.

522
00:31:02,814 --> 00:31:04,475
And they did not replay the game,

523
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,616
so they did not notice that they could have two playthrough

524
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,117
and never see one single scene in common.

525
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,298
And that's actually a compliment,

526
00:31:12,598 --> 00:31:16,439
because I don't want them to have the feeling

527
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:19,080
that they have power and control over the story.

528
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,841
I want them to live the story and,

529
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:27,887
and just leave it in the moment as those guys in the real life do.

530
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:29,528
Yeah, I understand. Thank you very much.

531
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:30,689
Thank you.

532
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:35,652
So, thanks everybody. That's it.

533
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:40,015
I had something else I should tell you, but I don't remember what it is.

534
00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:43,857
Oh yeah, don't forget to rate this talk.

535
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:45,278
Thank you very much.
