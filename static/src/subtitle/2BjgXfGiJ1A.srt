1
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,600
Thank you and welcome, everybody,

2
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:11,524
to our talk about the making of Tetris Effect.

3
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,927
As you hopefully know, Tetris Effect,

4
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:19,931
the new take on the classic puzzle game for PS4, PSVR.

5
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,392
If you don't know what Tetris Effect is,

6
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:24,115
if you know what Tetris is and you see this talk,

7
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:26,116
you're going to get the idea, I think, pretty quick.

8
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,481
So the format for the talk is going

9
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:33,144
to be roughly in the chronological order

10
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:35,747
that we took through development.

11
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:37,849
And then we're going to summarize

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,612
at the end with some key takeaways

13
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:43,775
that we each felt like we learned from the project.

14
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:47,018
But this is really Ishihara-san's talk.

15
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:49,220
the director of the project.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,001
But we're gonna be playing musical chairs a bit

17
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:53,701
and switching back and forth to the podium.

18
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:58,243
So yeah, we wanted to just all introduce ourselves

19
00:00:58,303 --> 00:00:59,464
at the top here.

20
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:00,004
I'll start.

21
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:01,364
My name is Mark McDonald.

22
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:05,166
My title is VP Biz Dev and Production at Enhance,

23
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,967
but we're a really small shop,

24
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:08,427
so we all do lots of other jobs.

25
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:11,108
I do some PR, marketing.

26
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:14,489
I'm gonna talk a lot about focus groups that we ran.

27
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,231
for Tetris Effect, that sort of stuff.

28
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:20,293
My background is in the media.

29
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:23,836
I started off on video game magazines,

30
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:26,358
so you can kind of get a rough idea how old I am.

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,900
Electronic Gaming Monthly, Official PlayStation Magazine.

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,463
I switched to online, ran the video side

33
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:34,724
of a site called 1up.com.

34
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:41,804
And then moved to Japan about 10 years ago and to the dev side of the industry where

35
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:49,327
I worked with some friends at a company called 8-4, which is a terrible company filled with

36
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:50,088
garbage people.

37
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:52,389
Stay away.

38
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,190
But one of them is up here on stage with us.

39
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:59,246
Graham Howard, thank you very much.

40
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,488
Graham is going to be doing interpretation for Ishihara-san.

41
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,510
So yeah, anyway, 8.4, I was lucky enough

42
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,052
to work on big titles for Nintendo, Capcom.

43
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:13,114
Imagine makeup artist, that sort of thing.

44
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:16,775
And that's where I first started working with Mizuguchi-san,

45
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,377
consulting on what would become ResInfinite.

46
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:21,937
That was about three years ago.

47
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,459
And eventually, when I left 8.4, I ended up at Enhance

48
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:27,319
and have been there ever since.

49
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,200
So with that, Isharu-san, I'll hand it over.

50
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,910
My name is Takashi Ishihara.

51
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,571
Good afternoon everyone, my name is Takashi Ishihara.

52
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:51,735
In the past, I've worked as a concept artist and art director on games that fuse music and visuals, such as Child of Eden, Luminous, and Rez Infinite.

53
00:02:52,155 --> 00:03:00,098
In the past, I've worked as a concept artist and art director on games that fuse music and visuals, such as Child of Eden, Luminous, and Rez Infinite.

54
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:04,480
I am the development director of Tetris Effect.

55
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,481
Thank you for having me.

56
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:30,393
pretty long years, since 1990.

57
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:33,976
So I joined SEGA in 1990,

58
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:39,580
and I produced SEGA Rally and arcade games, racing games,

59
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,742
and the Reds, Space Shuttle M5,

60
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:45,365
Child of Eden, Luminous, and so on.

61
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,387
And this title, Tetris Effect,

62
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:51,930
this is my 20th produced title.

63
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:56,799
So yeah, thank you for coming today.

64
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:01,783
So let me talk about the Tetris effect.

65
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:07,087
So the beginning of the story.

66
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:16,671
I met Hank Rogers long, long years ago, who is the CEO and chairman of that Tetris company.

67
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:23,078
And he's living in Big Island, Hawaii, in the United States.

68
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:33,214
And so I met him a few times in the big island and we watched the stars and you know,

69
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:41,797
watched the fires and the huge, you know, the big nature. He's living in a big, huge ranch and

70
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:49,481
so you know, the many horses and sheep and many animals. They have a nice little compound.

71
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:52,142
It's an amazing, crazy place.

72
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:56,366
And so we had a discussion like, hey, Gucci.

73
00:04:56,826 --> 00:05:01,190
So he called me Gucci.

74
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,673
Some people call me Miz, and some people call me Gucci,

75
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:05,754
and whatever.

76
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,195
You can call me any.

77
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:10,978
So he said, hey, Gucci, why don't you

78
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:13,840
make a Tetris with the music?

79
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,523
So he played Rez and the Luminance.

80
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:18,805
And

81
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:22,158
So he asked me, you know, that kind of things.

82
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:25,320
So, and yeah, yeah.

83
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,202
But that is luminous, you know?

84
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:32,844
So he said, yeah, I know, but you know,

85
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:36,646
the Tetris is, you know, is a very special mechanism.

86
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:37,927
You know, it has.

87
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:42,230
Like he's talking about zone experience of Tetris.

88
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,011
You know, have you played Tetris?

89
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:45,392
Yeah.

90
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:49,414
I think it's the most famous game, you know, in the world.

91
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:54,745
And so you know about the zone experience, you know,

92
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:59,189
you concentrate, you play, you don't think, you know,

93
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,352
just feel, and then you can play without thinking.

94
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:08,056
So this is a very strong experience and a very special,

95
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:10,337
unique, the point of the Tetris.

96
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:13,180
So, and we had a discussion, you know,

97
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,762
the mixing, the music sounds and the visual

98
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:18,824
and new type of storytelling.

99
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:29,557
We may make a new type of game, and also with the new technology like VR.

100
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:34,436
So maybe we can make a totally new thing.

101
00:06:35,217 --> 00:06:39,317
So this is just beginning, the kind of story we have.

102
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:41,618
Then I came back.

103
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:45,098
Oh, yeah, I got the keywords from Hank,

104
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:49,139
like Tetris music, feel good, and a few zen,

105
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,480
and a few in the zone.

106
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,020
That means flow.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,001
So that kind of inspiration is getting bigger in my mind.

108
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:58,781
And then.

109
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:03,486
Coming back to Tokyo, and I met Ishihara.

110
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:11,893
So yeah, and I asked him, OK, please give me

111
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:16,397
some design and drawing, start to draw some inspirations.

112
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:22,602
And he gave me some really key great art like this.

113
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:24,363
This is very special.

114
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:26,045
The first.

115
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:28,319
the one of the art.

116
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:34,483
So you can see the sounds and the visual mixing.

117
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:39,046
You erase, disappear the line, and you get the sound effects

118
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:44,449
and some smoke, fire coming, and the moving with the music.

119
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:52,134
And if you can see this with VR, you can imagine what's

120
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:53,315
kind of happening.

121
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:56,597
And he gave me that kind of art.

122
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:04,666
It's very unique and you know, the feel, some story and emotional.

123
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:14,368
And like this, you know, feel the music, the feel, the atmosphere.

124
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:21,130
And this is really trippy, psychedelic, but moving with the music and

125
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,230
the sounds and watching this 3D.

126
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:27,191
So this is a spacey galaxy.

127
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:37,412
And then, so we usually we have a pretty long pre-production before we make the game.

128
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:43,655
Just only, you know, the play in my mind, your mind.

129
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,641
You know, to play and play and play and play,

130
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,462
and you listen to the sound, the sound, the sound of music,

131
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:53,803
and the music reacts with the visual particles and moving.

132
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,743
Yeah, this is the, you know, we need the imagination.

133
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,204
But we have that kind of a period.

134
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:04,704
By small people like me and Ishihara,

135
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:06,865
and sometimes the sound designer,

136
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:10,665
but we have this pretty long pre-production.

137
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:11,446
I think we had,

138
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:13,406
how long was it, two years, a year and a half?

139
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:23,075
Almost two years pre-production, just before we make the demo, before interactive demo.

140
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:32,701
So I think this is a very unique style for Enhance. And after all, if we want to move,

141
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:42,286
if we want to move, you know, okay, let's make the movie first. So this is the first movie we made.

142
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:46,478
And so we had the concept like this.

143
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:50,939
Okay, so this is a, okay, let's call the project Zen Tetris.

144
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,081
So this is a code name, but Zen Tetris,

145
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,882
and this is kind of an image.

146
00:09:58,482 --> 00:09:59,963
So the mark made this image.

147
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,944
So I asked Ishihara-san to make this image.

148
00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:07,706
And this, in kind of the movie, I think helped a lot.

149
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,034
getting everybody on the same page.

150
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:13,016
It also helped when we were pitching it to partners and stuff like that.

151
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:16,018
But to Mizugu-san's point, you know, we would not have had that

152
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:19,761
if we hadn't spent two years, if they hadn't spent two years.

153
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:21,842
I came on in the middle of it in pre-production.

154
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:24,164
And so that's one of the things that Enhance we really believe in.

155
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:26,605
And our studio structure allows us to do that.

156
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:30,619
where we can have just a couple people noodling on something for a couple years,

157
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:33,041
getting the art really right.

158
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:37,945
And so this was, yeah, we were going to kind of go this direction for marketing.

159
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:41,007
The name of the game we thought was going to be Zen Tetris.

160
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:42,188
We'll talk about that later. But.

161
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:50,829
One thing just to add before we now go to Isharasan was that the movie was great and everything that

162
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:55,970
Demis was talking about I was fully on board with, but the one thing that you know you didn't see in

163
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,951
that movie was any new kind of gameplay, right? It was all very stock standard Tetris, which

164
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:09,033
maybe that's okay. It certainly looked really cool, especially in VR. Maybe that would be enough, but

165
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:17,002
from very early on there was this question of well is it okay to not have some new kind of gameplay thing

166
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:24,144
and anyway that's that's kind of foreshadowing so with that why don't we switch over to

167
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:35,287
Ishihara-san. Okay so then okay I talk with him with Ishihara-kun

168
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:40,968
So, and me and Mark, so we had a discussion,

169
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:46,952
okay, let's ask to Ishihara as director.

170
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,154
This is his first director project.

171
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:53,977
So, yeah, I want to introduce him a little bit.

172
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:59,241
So he was high school student, high school kids,

173
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:01,022
when I was made a res.

174
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:04,869
first grads, 2001.

175
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:13,016
And after graduating the school, he chased me to Sega.

176
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:17,679
But I quit Sega, and I moved to Q Entertainment.

177
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,060
But he worked.

178
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,662
In Sega, maybe two, three years.

179
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:25,364
It was right after he got to Sega, Mizuguchi-san promptly left Sega.

180
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:29,065
And the whole reason that he came to Sega was to work with Mizuguchi-san.

181
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:33,127
But in Japan, you can't just pick up and leave, especially in Japan,

182
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:34,348
after you start working somewhere.

183
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,209
So he was stuck there for at least a couple of years.

184
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:36,429
Yeah.

185
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,570
I hope he's not a stalker.

186
00:12:39,997 --> 00:12:44,958
But so he did a really good job in a project, Child of Eden.

187
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,179
So he drew the 3,000 art.

188
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:49,740
That was amazing.

189
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,401
And he also did the Resident Infinite art director.

190
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:58,102
And then, OK, it's a really good time now.

191
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:00,062
So Ishihara, go.

192
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:04,663
So OK, I want to introduce Ishihara-kun.

193
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:20,023
So after that, I went about preparing for development to start, all by myself, a little bit at a time.

194
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:26,831
This is a simple specification, but it is information on the layout required to build a VR space.

195
00:13:27,324 --> 00:13:30,105
And what we have here is a fairly simple design document,

196
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:34,305
but it contains all the layout information necessary for structuring spaces in VR.

197
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:50,569
The face you see here is the player, and you can see a representation of two manta rays that are swinging before the player's eyes,

198
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:52,829
and you also have bubbles rising up from below.

199
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:57,439
This is a representation of a tetromino block.

200
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:03,905
When you delete a tetromino, beautiful water particles fly into space.

201
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:06,587
This is a design document for the dolphin stage.

202
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:28,238
This is the stage where you have windmills floating in the sky.

203
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,519
I had been imagining an experience where you could fly through the sky in VR.

204
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:38,622
And finally, we have a total of 30 different stages.

205
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:44,954
And eventually I had design documents for all of the 30-odd stages in the game.

206
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:50,516
At this time, things were quite busy at Enhance due to the ongoing planning and development of REZ Infinite,

207
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:55,858
so pre-production of Tetris continued behind the scenes for almost two whole years.

208
00:14:56,538 --> 00:15:01,800
At this time, things were quite busy at Enhance due to the ongoing planning and development of REZ Infinite,

209
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,641
so pre-production of Tetris continued behind the scenes for almost two whole years.

210
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:16,814
When thinking about the game's design, I was also considering how best to present sound as well.

211
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:27,998
I have to look at how the sound and visuals come together in the production to allow a sense of depth to the end product, to create an atmosphere for performance.

212
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:36,428
If you don't have an idea of how visuals and sound will come together in presentation at this point in time,

213
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:41,792
said presentation will ultimately lack depth, and it prevents a gameplay experience that truly feels great.

214
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:48,036
And so, as development of REZ Infinite came to a close at the end of 2016, so began the development of Tetris Effect.

215
00:15:57,117 --> 00:16:03,580
We started the project 3 months ago, and created a demo of playing Tetris in the deep sea.

216
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,301
Here is the video.

217
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:10,143
Our starting point was a prototype that allowed the player to enjoy Tetris in a deep sea environment,

218
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:12,384
which we made within 3 months of starting the project.

219
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,625
We have a video of just that, so let's take a look.

220
00:16:32,294 --> 00:16:37,420
Since the game is being created for VR, we made absolutely everything in 3D, from the blocks to the background.

221
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,226
The space is filled with schools of fish, manta rays, and whales, all of which swim around the environs.

222
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:48,972
The space is filled with schools of fish, manta rays, and whales, all of which swim around the environs.

223
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:59,038
We also made use of large amounts of particles and 3D sound as well, making it a very rich production overall.

224
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:05,360
We also made use of large amounts of particles and 3D sound as well, making it a very rich production overall.

225
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,042
However, we encountered two very big problems.

226
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:14,823
However, we encountered two very big problems.

227
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:24,670
The first problem was that we couldn't feel the comfort of the most important point in enhancing the game.

228
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:31,335
Our first problem was that the game simply didn't feel good, which is something we at Enhance value above all else in our creative process.

229
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:38,240
On the contrary, we felt tired, sleepy, and unable to concentrate.

230
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,266
It was actually worse than just not feeling good. It actively induced feelings of drowsiness, fatigue, and caused people to have difficulty concentrating.

231
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,973
After lunchtime, when I was playing a test game,

232
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:54,116
I often fell asleep while wearing VR helmets.

233
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:57,698
There were often times where when sitting down for a test play after lunchtime,

234
00:17:57,758 --> 00:18:00,220
I would wake up to find out I had passed out with the VR helmet on.

235
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:05,324
Since we were not able to express the feeling of the game,

236
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:09,327
we felt the need to enhance our Synastasia engine.

237
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:17,391
The game lacked the presentation and expressiveness necessary to inspire something that feels great in the player,

238
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:20,632
and I believed the answer was to improve our Synesthesia engine.

239
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:29,155
The Synesthesia engine is a proprietary system of ours that we use for creating sound and particles, and we used it for REZ Infinite as well.

240
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:36,617
The Synesthesia engine, by the way, is a proprietary system of ours that we use for creating sound and particles, and we used it for REZ Infinite as well.

241
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:58,493
The second problem was that the player's mental energy was largely dedicated to manipulating the tetromino blocks, to the point where the player was, when you get down to it, basically not taking in any of the visuals or sound at all.

242
00:18:59,624 --> 00:19:00,766
This is not an overstatement.

243
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,250
There were many people who don't remember

244
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,292
the existence of fish, manta rays,

245
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,394
or even the sound of the song.

246
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:09,196
And I'm honestly not exaggerating here.

247
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:10,938
There were many people who could not recall

248
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:12,880
that there were fish and manta rays swimming around

249
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:14,803
or that there was even music playing at all.

250
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:21,615
This experience was nothing like any other Tetris experience.

251
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,608
and people were like, what, there was a space whale?

252
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:43,849
I totally didn't see the space whale.

253
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,391
So people were not getting it at all unless,

254
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:51,093
and sometimes it's kind of problem maybe 2.5 that we had,

255
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:53,414
which is if the manta ray,

256
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:55,055
people wouldn't notice the manta rays at all,

257
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:57,156
but if the manta ray dared to,

258
00:19:57,436 --> 00:19:58,937
even for like a split second,

259
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,918
cross over the play field, the matrix,

260
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:04,779
it was the first thing when people took off the headset

261
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,119
was like,

262
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,960
Get that fucking manta ray out of this fucking game.

263
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,881
That thing is driving me crazy. It's terrible. I want it out.

264
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,901
Destroy them all.

265
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,462
So yeah, so there were a few problems right at the start.

266
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:37,826
Of the two problems that we had on our plate, I felt like the second one was what needed to be addressed first and foremost, so that's where I started.

267
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:55,037
I figured this phenomenon must be a result of how, when wearing a VR helmet, the human brain is deluded into believing that the VR space it sees is the real world.

268
00:20:55,808 --> 00:21:03,174
The player seemed to be discarding all information they believed to be of no use to them, instead concentrating entirely on one single point, manipulating tetriminos.

269
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:11,761
It seemed to me that the player would discard all information they believed to be of no use to them, instead concentrating entirely on one single point, manipulating tetriminos.

270
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:15,804
I took on several challenges to solve the problem.

271
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,535
And so in an attempt to solve this issue, I tried a number of things.

272
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:37,661
I had experimented with ideas like making the presentation more over the top, or drastically

273
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:41,465
changing the angle at which the game is played, but we ended up going back and forth between

274
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:45,409
prioritizing presentation, which would get in the way of actually playing Tetris, and

275
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:48,492
prioritizing Tetris gameplay, which would cause the presentation to suffer.

276
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:52,296
Unable to completely swing either way, I had quite the dilemma on my hands.

277
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:03,292
I thought on this problem for the next few months, awake or asleep, I had tetrominoes floating around in my head non-stop.

278
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:06,194
I was confused, and I decided to review Tetris again.

279
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:08,036
I felt that I might have understood Tetris before.

280
00:22:25,657 --> 00:22:30,179
After much soul-searching, I decided to take another look at how Tetris plays from the very beginning.

281
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:35,361
I did this because I felt like, at that point, I may have had this idea in my head that I already understood Tetris. ゲームを開始し、一粒のテトリミノが盤面に現れ、回転、移動、設置、消去を繰り返し、クリアするまでの流れを何度もプレイしました。

282
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:39,343
So I start the game, and a single tetromino appears in the matrix.

283
00:22:39,363 --> 00:22:45,486
I played through the process from start to finish multiple times, rotating, moving, placing, and clearing tetrominos.

284
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,972
At this point, I focused on the emotions of the player as they change throughout the game.

285
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,093
So while doing this, I focused on one particular thing,

286
00:23:03,313 --> 00:23:06,054
the emotions of the player and how they change as the game goes on.

287
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:11,456
And I was able to find a hint to solve the problem.

288
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:16,238
In doing so, I came across a certain something that served as a hint in solving my dilemma.

289
00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:34,231
That certain something was the existence of moments when the player, in the midst of doing something that requires intense concentration, is given a moment where they can breathe.

290
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:45,035
It seemed to me like this play sensation was something similar to how people are when they're driving.

291
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:55,258
I usually look ahead, but when I pass a traffic jam or turn a corner, I feel a moment of relief.

292
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,260
When driving, you typically focus on a single point directly ahead of you,

293
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,282
but there is also a sensation of relief every time you find your way out of bad traffic or after completing a turn.

294
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:13,189
At this point, the driver may loosen up and look around,

295
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:14,930
talk to the passenger, or start playing music.

296
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,552
And at those times, the driver's nerves loosen for an instant,

297
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,633
and they unconsciously take a moment to take in the surrounding scenery,

298
00:24:22,014 --> 00:24:24,375
talk to the person in the passenger seat, or fiddle with the radio.

299
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:26,676
Of course, this is within the safety driving range.

300
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,377
Are they still obeying the rules of the road, of course? Safety first.

301
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:34,811
I decided to go over how everything is presented in the game,

302
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:39,556
this time imagining what kind of experience a person has when they go out for a leisurely Sunday drive.

303
00:24:56,815 --> 00:25:01,576
I took the elements that we use in the game's presentation, light, color, sound, and movement,

304
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:05,278
and condensed them into those moments where the player's emotional state is such that

305
00:25:05,318 --> 00:25:06,298
they have room to breathe.

306
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:09,522
We also rearranged most of the composition near the play area,

307
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:13,708
so that players can feel the direction immediately.

308
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:18,776
This is an image of the last possible distance for the driver to move his eyes.

309
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:25,489
Also, we took most of the in-game objects and rethought their placement,

310
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:29,851
moving them close to the play area so that the player would immediately be able to register

311
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:33,432
what they're there to convey. The idea is that they would be placed such that you,

312
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:37,614
the driver in our metaphor, could effortlessly take it all in just by shifting your gaze.

313
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:55,194
In doing so, we were able to create a sensation that allowed players to both engage with the gameplay of Tetris,

314
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,097
while still unconsciously internalizing the surrounding objects and effects.

315
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:06,004
I think it's safe to say that this was made possible by grasping the exact point where the player's emotions are in a kind of a state of flux.

316
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:12,730
I think it's safe to say that this was made possible by grasping the exact point where the player's emotions are in a kind of a state of flux.

317
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:28,019
One thing to just to add to that from the user tests, we had an early sign that that he had a son was on to something here with his kind of driving model that if stuff was in your immediate kind of peripheral vision, you could still take it in.

318
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,142
Certain levels we had from the start where you were flying sort of into the screen.

319
00:26:33,162 --> 00:26:38,805
In the final game there's like a dolphin level, the windmill level, Da Vinci, those levels.

320
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:45,609
From very early on, those were the levels where users were registering what was going on in the stage

321
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:47,570
and also they really liked them.

322
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:53,012
So those were some of the highest rating games and some of the ones users talked about afterwards

323
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:55,314
when we talked to them about which ones were their favorites.

324
00:26:55,354 --> 00:26:58,655
So it was like an encouraging early sign that he was onto something.

325
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:11,797
With the focus issue solved, we then had a definitive link between the visuals and the design.

326
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:17,541
So we then got to work on focusing on the other problem we had, which was one of creating something that feels good.

327
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:31,609
So, what am I getting at when I'm talking about something feeling great?

328
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:44,034
And it's something that we put a lot of emphasis on when creating ResInfinite as well, which is one of Enhance's representative works.

329
00:27:44,652 --> 00:27:50,434
We believe that the connection between gameplay, visuals, and sound is extremely important,

330
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:56,596
and we are committed to balancing these three elements one-to-one.

331
00:27:57,296 --> 00:28:00,297
We place a great deal of importance on the linking of three elements,

332
00:28:00,717 --> 00:28:02,658
gameplay, visuals, and sound.

333
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:07,800
And when balancing these elements, we strive to achieve a perfect ratio of one-to-one-to-one.

334
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:11,153
We try to make it so that no one aspect sticks out.

335
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:14,335
We're conscious of these three things as one larger whole, and we aim to create games

336
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:17,997
that bring out a sense of strong exhilaration that can be gained when they are functioning as one.

337
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:36,048
For Tetris, the gameplay was overwhelmingly strong,

338
00:28:36,408 --> 00:28:42,530
so we needed to increase the visual and sound presence.

339
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,351
For Tetris Effect, the gameplay part was something that stood out as particularly overwhelming,

340
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:52,752
which made it necessary to raise the level of presence and expressiveness of the visuals and sound to match.

341
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:58,914
We extended the two functions, physics and morphing, to the CineStudio Engine.

342
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:15,789
So what I did was we had the Synesthesia engine expanded to include two new functions, physics and morphing.

343
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:26,316
First, by expanding our physics functionality, we were able to give both particle and object movement a tempo that attributed a sense of strength, and that added the element of reality to our toolbox of expressions.

344
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:44,297
This made it easier to internalize things such as atmosphere, temperature, how sound expands and feels,

345
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:48,920
and this made it easier for each and every effect to exude that feel-good sensation that we want.

346
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:51,846
Next is morphing.

347
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:54,627
By expanding the morphing function,

348
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:59,669
a fish is born from a particle and later turns into a manta or a whale.

349
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,029
And next is morphing.

350
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,289
By expanding morphing functionality,

351
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:05,550
we were then able to create a sense of progression

352
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,771
that emerges when a particle turns into a fish

353
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,511
and then transforms into a manta ray or a whale.

354
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:24,707
This allowed for emotions to be turned into stories.

355
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:27,590
And when these pleasant emotions start to pile up and bundle together,

356
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,414
it transforms into what we hope is a very moving experience.

357
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:34,677
You know, this is a like a chemistry, you know,

358
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:40,122
that the physics makes you feel like very emotional.

359
00:30:40,342 --> 00:30:42,944
You know, the impact like, oh, oh, oh.

360
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:45,667
And into the move, moving.

361
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:50,988
It's not making like narrative, you know, it's like a storytelling.

362
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:53,489
So we tried to mix both.

363
00:30:54,669 --> 00:31:01,391
Next, we added some new elements that would not have an impact on Tetris' core game design.

364
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:06,672
And next, we added some new elements that would not have an impact on Tetris' core game design.

365
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:10,013
First, we put some work into the level design.

366
00:31:13,796 --> 00:31:20,162
In normal Tetris, as the player progresses, the speed gradually increases,

367
00:31:20,302 --> 00:31:28,050
but in this game, the speed increases, slows down, and increases again.

368
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,934
In regular Tetris, it's normal for the speed to gradually get quicker as you progress,

369
00:31:32,114 --> 00:31:37,139
but for Tetris Effect, we made it such that it could, for example, speed up, slow down, and then speed up again.

370
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:42,472
As we mentioned earlier, we lower the speed when we want the player to focus on the game.

371
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:47,415
When the game is slow, we increase the speed to get the player to focus on the game.

372
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:50,397
And this is done for a reason similar to what I mentioned previously.

373
00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:54,220
We slow things down when we want the player to be conscious of the presentation.

374
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,643
And we speed things up so the player can focus on the game when there isn't really as much going on on the presentation side of things.

375
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:03,786
Of course, we discussed this a lot with the level designers,

376
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:07,388
and we managed to balance the fun of the game with the quality of the presentation.

377
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:11,412
And this is of course something the level designer and I discussed at great length,

378
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:15,735
so that we could strike a balance that both makes the gameplay engaging and serves the presentation.

379
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:21,760
And yeah, just to add to that, I think this is something that seems simple,

380
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,443
but actually took a long time, really right up until the end of the game to...

381
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:29,845
to really keep polishing and working on what felt right,

382
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:34,168
and what felt unfair, and what felt too crazy back and forth.

383
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,309
Along with it, too, there were a lot

384
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,731
of questions of, in a Tetris game that

385
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:42,812
has a quote, unquote, story mode,

386
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:45,573
what does failure look like?

387
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:50,296
Like, what are you risking by having to continue,

388
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,616
or can you continue?

389
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:54,038
And we'd had it for a really long time.

390
00:32:54,078 --> 00:32:55,620
We did not want to make it something that,

391
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,482
we really wanted to keep it something

392
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:58,563
that everybody could enjoy.

393
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:01,125
So we had it where you could just continue

394
00:33:01,685 --> 00:33:02,826
and your score would reset,

395
00:33:02,886 --> 00:33:04,808
but the amount of lines you cleared stayed the same.

396
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:08,111
And it just felt like there were no consequences at all.

397
00:33:08,171 --> 00:33:09,492
In fact, sometimes people would just.

398
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:13,494
get to a new stage and just go game over so they could kind of start fresh

399
00:33:14,114 --> 00:33:16,874
because they just didn't care about the score. And so

400
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:21,295
that was one of the things that that came on at the end is this and also the

401
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:24,416
next slide is how do we divide up the game? How do we

402
00:33:24,456 --> 00:33:27,997
balance the difficulty to make it where you know this is not

403
00:33:28,037 --> 00:33:30,477
going to be a 40-hour game whatever we do but

404
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:32,218
how do we make it where it's a

405
00:33:32,918 --> 00:33:40,321
It's a satisfying journey, so to speak, and you care when you get the game over screen,

406
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:43,923
and you also care when you're able to clear it without having to continue.

407
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:50,446
And so lastly, Tetris Effect is a game that takes a few hours to finish.

408
00:33:55,916 --> 00:34:01,457
When driving, we used the concept of 7 areas as if we were driving in a parking area,

409
00:34:01,977 --> 00:34:04,958
so that we could stop the game whenever we were tired.

410
00:34:05,438 --> 00:34:07,678
But to again return things to my driving analogy,

411
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:11,079
we implemented this concept of the game being split into 7 areas,

412
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:14,340
along the lines of how you'll find rest stops along a highway.

413
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,140
This lets the player step back and take a break from the game whenever they feel tired.

414
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:21,821
This solved the player's fatigue and sleepiness.

415
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:35,141
Doing this got rid of the problems we had encountered with players getting fatigued or drowsy.

416
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:42,863
And so all of that is how we fused Tetris and a VR presentation into this one cohesive whole,

417
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:47,784
leading to the creation of what we hope you'll agree is a great feeling Tetris experience that

418
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:53,365
the first of its kind. So yeah, so the game was taking shape.

419
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,025
We were starting to feel pretty good about it overall.

420
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:58,306
We'd ask people playing the game.

421
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,146
They were starting to feel pretty good about it overall.

422
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:03,227
We were working really closely with our licensor

423
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:04,227
with the Tetris company.

424
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:06,528
They had good feedback.

425
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:08,648
They were helping us refine a lot of the particulars,

426
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:14,289
a lot of feedback in terms of this color on that color

427
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:15,990
is hard to see when this happens,

428
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,090
and that sort of thing.

429
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,091
They were really good about that sort of stuff.

430
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:22,211
But also, the very particular bits of the controls,

431
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:22,731
you would think.

432
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,513
Tetris is just Tetris.

433
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:28,459
You don't need to work at really fine-tuning those controls,

434
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,901
but actually you do.

435
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:32,485
That's something that took the whole length of the project.

436
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,528
But yeah, overall, they were also

437
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:36,330
really happy with how the game was shaping up.

438
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:37,773
So things were going great.

439
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:44,595
But there was still that concern from earlier on.

440
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:47,678
So it wasn't a new concern.

441
00:35:47,758 --> 00:35:54,504
I had that little inner voice saying that the game still

442
00:35:54,564 --> 00:35:58,027
needed some kind of original gameplay hook.

443
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,148
So.

444
00:36:00,345 --> 00:36:03,106
Here we were reinventing how Tetris looked, how it sounded,

445
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:07,667
most of all how it felt. But what about how it plays?

446
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:12,268
Can't we do something to innovate in terms of gameplay,

447
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:15,829
you know, something that could add or even multiply

448
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,890
everything else that we're doing?

449
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,849
I just really felt the gameplay third of that graphics sound

450
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:26,592
gameplay was lacking a little bit.

451
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:28,214
And it wasn't just me.

452
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:31,656
When I would talk to other people about the game, explain

453
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:33,838
the game, they were into it.

454
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,359
You could tell they were interested and excited,

455
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:36,660
especially when they would play it.

456
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,963
But they were also kind of leaning in a little bit, kind

457
00:36:39,983 --> 00:36:41,745
of, it seemed like, waiting for one more thing.

458
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:43,186
It's like, yeah, OK, yeah, and?

459
00:36:43,966 --> 00:36:46,128
And then there was not that one other thing.

460
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:52,249
So we would talk about this every so often throughout the whole project.

461
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,991
It would kind of come up to the point it became kind of a running thing,

462
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:58,932
which is like, and what about that gameplay thing?

463
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:00,052
Like, what are we doing for that?

464
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:07,434
And Miz and Ishara-san were both, they did both generally agree.

465
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:17,128
that yeah, it would be really awesome to have some kind of new gameplay feature that fit the game and did everything we were hoping for.

466
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,593
But also it was kind of tempered with...

467
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:25,158
some concerns that maybe it wasn't strictly necessary.

468
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:28,261
You know, maybe that could be left to some of the other modes.

469
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:33,385
Maybe this game, the main mode stays this more pure Tetris experience

470
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:36,207
because, you know, it could in fact become a bad thing.

471
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:40,451
If we didn't hit it just right, it could get in the way.

472
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:43,533
It could screw up what people what we know people already love about Tetris.

473
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:52,800
And I think Ishihara-san had a really good point, which was there have been so many Tetris games over the years, you know, hundreds.

474
00:37:53,781 --> 00:38:03,528
And how many new gameplay mechanics can you think of in that time that have stood the test of time, you know, that you can even remember?

475
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:12,974
Besides a few quality of life things like the preview piece and the next window and some of those kind of peripheral things,

476
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:19,318
but real gameplay features, and to be honest, none of us could think of any really,

477
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:25,282
that didn't come off as gimmicky or kind of interesting, but ultimately very forgettable.

478
00:38:26,463 --> 00:38:33,027
And maybe we wouldn't come up with anything, but I did feel really strongly that we had to at least try.

479
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:44,409
At first, we tried to incorporate a rescue system such as slowing down the fall speed of the tetromino,

480
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:48,655
slowing down the time, and eliminating all the tetromino on the board at once,

481
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:53,602
but none of them matched the game design because they lacked the tension required for Tetris play.

482
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:00,691
At the beginning, we had tried implementing systems that were essentially get-out-of-jail-free cards.

483
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:03,491
You could do things like slow down the speed at which tetrominoes fall,

484
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:06,652
turn back time, or erase all the tetrominoes in the matrix.

485
00:39:06,932 --> 00:39:09,713
But they didn't match well with the game design for one crucial reason.

486
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:13,894
They reduced the sense of nervous tension that is necessary to make Tetris fun.

487
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:28,879
And as that was going on, Nishimura-san, the main programmer on the team, came to us with an idea.

488
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:31,762
He said, wouldn't it be neat if the tetrominoes didn't disappear?

489
00:39:31,782 --> 00:39:38,508
This is an idea that allows us to erase lines such as 8 and 16, which were previously only 4-digit.

490
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:51,178
His idea was, if you had a fixed period of time during which tetrominoes would accumulate

491
00:39:51,378 --> 00:39:53,039
instead of disappearing when they form a line,

492
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:57,720
it would be possible to jump right past the four line clears that Tetris players have known up to this point,

493
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,581
allowing for players to clear eight or even sixteen lines at once.

494
00:40:01,581 --> 00:40:07,823
The main programmer was a great programmer who had been in charge of the Tetris gameplay for two years.

495
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,823
He suggested that we try it out as a team.

496
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:23,183
And this main programmer had been in charge of the actual Tetris gameplay part of the game for all two years of its development.

497
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:24,925
And he's absolutely incredible at his craft.

498
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:28,888
So we decided that if this is something that he thought would work, then we should just go ahead and give it a shot.

499
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:32,591
And this here is what he made. Let's take a look.

500
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:50,466
This experience was a great fit for the game design of Tetris, and it created a wonderful sense of cohesion.

501
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:56,228
This experience was a great fit for the game design of Tetris, and it created a wonderful sense of cohesion.

502
00:40:56,628 --> 00:41:02,210
And the sensation it created was something that did a truly amazing job of expressing what it means to be in the Zone.

503
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:07,952
We decided to call this experience the Zone System, and it became a symbol of this game.

504
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:15,160
We called it the Zone System and it became an experience that is symbolic of the title as a whole.

505
00:41:17,915 --> 00:41:23,599
Great. So awesome. We all agreed. We were all fully on board with the zone system.

506
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:32,745
It was basically had everything we were looking for. It was significant, but at the same time it didn't get in the way of the more pure Tetris gameplay.

507
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:39,350
It had benefits for beginner players and for experienced players. It looked cool. It fit the vibe of the game. Everything.

508
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,492
So it was awesome. We were feeling pretty awesome.

509
00:41:44,954 --> 00:41:48,215
But again, there was something else nagging.

510
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:54,438
The little voice again was talking about the online

511
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,199
multiplayer mode that we had planned.

512
00:41:57,299 --> 00:42:01,681
So from the very start of the game, we'd been thinking, OK,

513
00:42:02,861 --> 00:42:03,962
we have to have some kind of

514
00:42:05,103 --> 00:42:06,184
online is a Tetris game.

515
00:42:06,244 --> 00:42:08,987
We have to have some kind of online multiplayer, probably

516
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:09,868
battle mode, right?

517
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:15,395
So we didn't have a great idea for it as the project started,

518
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:17,697
though, so we thought, OK, well, let's get into the

519
00:42:17,737 --> 00:42:21,001
project, and it will kind of naturally come out of making

520
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:21,381
the game.

521
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:27,056
But about a year in, we still didn't really have that idea.

522
00:42:27,957 --> 00:42:29,758
And we put out a call to the team,

523
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:33,061
like, okay, we really now have to start working on that,

524
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:35,963
so let's get all the ideas that you guys have.

525
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:38,264
Ideally, something that breaks the mold.

526
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:40,226
You know, we wanted something.

527
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:44,761
different, but also that still fit the mood of the game,

528
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:47,865
which is not a really easy task when the game is still

529
00:42:47,905 --> 00:42:49,867
called Zen Tetris and you're trying to come up

530
00:42:49,887 --> 00:42:50,608
with a battle mode.

531
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,114
So all that really came back after asking was a pretty

532
00:42:55,795 --> 00:42:58,939
straightforward, fairly standard one-on-one battle

533
00:42:58,979 --> 00:42:59,179
mode.

534
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,251
So the team just really didn't seem into it.

535
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:04,311
Like, they just weren't inspired.

536
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:08,993
And we didn't have, you know, like a Tetris 99 grade awesome

537
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:12,515
idea, which I think is brilliant for multiplayer.

538
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,717
And so it felt like, it really started feeling like we were

539
00:43:16,737 --> 00:43:20,358
going to make this online battle mode because we had to

540
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:21,579
make an online battle mode.

541
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:28,318
But what if we didn't have to make an online battle mode?

542
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:31,843
So something occurred to me while I was explaining all

543
00:43:31,883 --> 00:43:33,946
this to a friend.

544
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:38,053
and saying, well, we have an online battle mode

545
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,493
because we have to have an online battle mode.

546
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:41,294
After saying that a bunch of times,

547
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:45,575
one time it finally was like, wait a second, maybe we don't.

548
00:43:46,115 --> 00:43:47,856
And I know some people probably here are saying,

549
00:43:48,116 --> 00:43:51,357
yes, yes, you do, you really should have,

550
00:43:51,377 --> 00:43:52,117
you guys are idiots.

551
00:43:52,637 --> 00:43:56,778
But that became my pitch to Miz and Isha Hasan,

552
00:43:57,258 --> 00:43:59,999
what if instead of doing that thing that

553
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:05,702
other games have done that you can get online and do for free right now in a pretty good, robust,

554
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:12,925
official version of with like Tetris Friends and that sort of thing. What if we took that money

555
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:18,228
and time and resources and instead doubled down on what was cool and unique and special about

556
00:44:18,668 --> 00:44:22,930
our game specifically? You know, what would that look like? So...

557
00:44:23,982 --> 00:44:28,505
Around this time, I was using a meditation app called Headspace.

558
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:30,426
It's pretty popular.

559
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:31,767
Some of you might have heard of it.

560
00:44:33,528 --> 00:44:39,711
If you haven't, how that app is laid out is it's an app for meditating, and they

561
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:44,554
basically divide up and tailor these guided audio meditations to how you're

562
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:45,834
feeling or how you want to feel.

563
00:44:46,615 --> 00:44:52,137
So if you can't sleep or you want to sleep, if you're anxious, if you want to get energized, etc.,

564
00:44:52,297 --> 00:44:55,618
there's separate places to go for meditations that'll address each one of those.

565
00:44:56,658 --> 00:45:01,080
And with Tetris Effect, we were already getting this feedback from people who were playing it

566
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,641
that they were responding basically the way that we were after, kind of emotionally.

567
00:45:05,806 --> 00:45:06,967
You know, oh, it's soothing.

568
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:09,009
Or, oh, it was really intense.

569
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:11,751
Or certain levels just make them smile and laugh.

570
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:15,253
So again, what if we took our battle mode resources instead

571
00:45:15,273 --> 00:45:18,456
and put them in a new mode designed to provoke more

572
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:19,517
of those kind of feelings?

573
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:23,080
And so that's where we came up with what's now effect modes.

574
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,842
These are different categories for a bunch of different game

575
00:45:25,902 --> 00:45:29,905
modes that you could choose for when you wanted to relax,

576
00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:31,846
or you wanted to really have a challenge.

577
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:35,407
or if you want to just play some old school classic Tetris,

578
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,728
there's a place to go for that.

579
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:42,428
So it wouldn't be a proper GDC speech

580
00:45:42,468 --> 00:45:44,229
without showing you some stuff that I think

581
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:45,589
got left on the cutting room floor.

582
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:49,350
So when we set about to design those new modes,

583
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:51,050
we had certain ones that we knew would go in,

584
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,191
marathon, kind of the mainstay standby Tetris modes.

585
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:57,771
But as far as the new modes, again,

586
00:45:57,831 --> 00:45:59,391
we threw it out to the team, everybody.

587
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:03,473
come up with your best, craziest, coolest, most fun

588
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:07,575
ideas that fit the theme, and let's talk about them.

589
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:09,295
And if it sounds good, let's prototype it.

590
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:11,376
And if it's fun, let's make it.

591
00:46:12,717 --> 00:46:15,758
So other stuff that we ended up not going with.

592
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:19,980
So we always wanted a kind of cooperative online content.

593
00:46:21,038 --> 00:46:24,800
We wanted people to still feel connected to each other

594
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:28,843
in with the theme of the game and not in a one-on-one kind

595
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,625
of battle scenario, but hey, we're all kind of in this

596
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:33,906
together working towards some kind of communal goal.

597
00:46:33,966 --> 00:46:39,089
So what we ended up going with was a weekly ritual, which is

598
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:41,991
where players amass points in designated modes towards a

599
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:42,591
communal goal.

600
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:44,192
And if they reach that goal, they get a reward.

601
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:46,414
I'm kind of speeding up now because we do want to get a

602
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:47,775
couple questions in for QA.

603
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:48,655
So I'll kind of.

604
00:46:49,825 --> 00:46:50,826
speed through the rest of this.

605
00:46:52,448 --> 00:46:56,331
But our original idea was that those communal cleared Tetris

606
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:58,412
pieces were all going to gather into a sculpture.

607
00:46:58,993 --> 00:47:00,394
And if you completed the sculpture,

608
00:47:00,414 --> 00:47:03,256
then it would animate in some weird, hopefully fun,

609
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:04,197
surprising way.

610
00:47:05,798 --> 00:47:08,060
The problem with this was we were going to run this weekly,

611
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,142
and we just couldn't think of 52 good things that

612
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,123
made sense in the game.

613
00:47:12,143 --> 00:47:14,405
It's kind of like, wait, what's going on again now?

614
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:15,506
What game are we making?

615
00:47:16,286 --> 00:47:21,712
Um, but it was kind of funny and sadly though, we had to kill our, our, our

616
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:26,677
dancing astronaut, um, sorry, dancing astronaut, um, game name.

617
00:47:26,737 --> 00:47:26,937
Okay.

618
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:28,419
This part I'm going to really speed through.

619
00:47:28,439 --> 00:47:31,522
The game was called Zen Tetris, uh, since forever.

620
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:33,456
We liked it.

621
00:47:33,656 --> 00:47:35,177
It was different from other Tetris games.

622
00:47:35,237 --> 00:47:36,098
Here's some of the logos.

623
00:47:36,618 --> 00:47:38,619
But as you see, once we started making the logo,

624
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,120
it was like, wait a second.

625
00:47:41,781 --> 00:47:43,042
Zen does mean relaxation,

626
00:47:43,082 --> 00:47:46,704
but it also means kind of simple and austere

627
00:47:46,884 --> 00:47:47,625
to a lot of people.

628
00:47:48,385 --> 00:47:51,627
And our game is giant space whales

629
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:53,448
made out of particles exploding,

630
00:47:53,608 --> 00:47:55,810
literally, into rainbows on the beat.

631
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,291
Like, is this the logo to that game?

632
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:00,372
I don't think so.

633
00:48:00,552 --> 00:48:03,333
So yeah, other logo treatments.

634
00:48:05,354 --> 00:48:05,854
It wasn't good.

635
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:08,514
And in Japanese, Zen, while it would have worked,

636
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:12,015
kind of has this old feeling to it as well, which

637
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:13,156
was what we were going for.

638
00:48:13,596 --> 00:48:14,916
This, at least, we did stumble on

639
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:16,156
while we were doing this kind of thing,

640
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:19,937
because we ended up using this for the subtitle, which

641
00:48:19,957 --> 00:48:21,118
was perfect for Tetris Effect.

642
00:48:21,158 --> 00:48:25,139
But the point of this part is that,

643
00:48:26,936 --> 00:48:29,339
for a different conversation in the marketing conversation

644
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,804
that I was having with another guy at Enhance, Yamada-san.

645
00:48:34,168 --> 00:48:37,789
about the marketing of the game, we kept going back to this Tetris effect.

646
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,890
So the marketing for Zen Tetris was going to use the Tetris effect

647
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,910
because it was a very positive thing that the game had.

648
00:48:44,851 --> 00:48:47,891
You know, the Tetris effect, if you don't know Tetris gets in your brain

649
00:48:47,931 --> 00:48:50,072
and you can't you can't get rid of it.

650
00:48:50,712 --> 00:48:53,093
And it actually has all these health benefits that have been scientifically

651
00:48:53,153 --> 00:48:55,253
proven severe.

652
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:59,374
It can lessen the severity of PTSD, even one of the most recent studies.

653
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:03,195
But distract from cravings, increase the size of parts of the brain, et cetera.

654
00:49:03,935 --> 00:49:05,537
We kept coming back to that Tetris effect.

655
00:49:05,577 --> 00:49:07,500
Let's make a documentary about the Tetris effect.

656
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,523
Let's have an ad where it's like, ask your doctor if the

657
00:49:10,563 --> 00:49:12,886
Tetris effect is right for you, like that kind of thing.

658
00:49:14,588 --> 00:49:16,830
And Yamada-san is just like, wait, why aren't we calling

659
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:17,831
the game Tetris effect?

660
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:19,113
We keep talking about Tetris effect.

661
00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:22,314
And it was kind of like, now it's like, duh, yeah, of course.

662
00:49:22,454 --> 00:49:24,895
But we had been thinking of it for so long as Zen Tetris.

663
00:49:25,575 --> 00:49:27,576
Also, we thought there might be legal reasons why we

664
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:28,156
couldn't do that.

665
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,777
But Miz got it immediately.

666
00:49:30,837 --> 00:49:31,377
He loved it.

667
00:49:31,497 --> 00:49:32,538
Shahar loved it.

668
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:34,138
Tetris Company was fully behind it.

669
00:49:34,198 --> 00:49:36,959
So we changed that at the very last second and got a logo

670
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:39,520
that was much closer to kind of what we were going for.

671
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,141
So, oh boy, real quick, final thoughts.

672
00:49:43,621 --> 00:49:47,745
So my final thoughts are basically listen to your inner voice by giving an outer voice.

673
00:49:47,805 --> 00:49:50,968
So talk things over with the team if you're hearing something.

674
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:53,970
There's two voices in my experience, inner voices.

675
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:59,295
One is this intuitive, really smart, positive thing that knows better what's going on than you do.

676
00:50:00,136 --> 00:50:04,660
The other is, you know, just doubt and fear and doubting everything.

677
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,944
And so my method of separating those two things is to talk it out with other people.

678
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:12,966
And sometimes, like I gave the example of the name, they'll have better ideas.

679
00:50:13,487 --> 00:50:18,550
Other times, just in explaining it to somebody, you end up thinking of something.

680
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:24,433
And so definitely listen to that inner voice, but to kind of separate it, try talking it over with somebody else.

681
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:25,514
And Isha Hasan.

682
00:50:32,653 --> 00:50:53,489
To close things out, on the VR side of things, creating a fusion of Tetris and VR required a great deal of work on the development side to fine-tune the presentation and a whole lot of compromise as well. The whole thing was quite the ordeal.

683
00:50:54,518 --> 00:51:00,881
However, after finishing the game, I felt that it was a plus, not a minus.

684
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:05,823
This time, however, having finished making it, I feel like those difficulties were not minuses, but pluses.

685
00:51:06,603 --> 00:51:07,723
Even in the existing 2D-based games,

686
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:12,085
we have found points that invite you to VR production and VR space,

687
00:51:12,165 --> 00:51:15,087
and by creating such scenes in a new way,

688
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:18,148
I think we have hidden the possibility of changing them to attractive VR content.

689
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:25,713
I believe that even existing games built on 2D foundations have the potential to be transformed

690
00:51:25,753 --> 00:51:29,216
into appealing VR content so long as you can find something that can be used to connect

691
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:31,898
it with a VR presentation or place it in a VR space.

692
00:51:32,238 --> 00:51:36,142
Or if you have no entry point that seems to exist already, you can create one from scratch.

693
00:51:43,035 --> 00:51:47,077
VR is capable of inspiring a whole new dimension of emotions that can't be experienced in 2D.

694
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:52,559
I feel like the game industry is still sorely lacking in VR titles.

695
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:56,681
And at the moment, I feel like the game industry is still sorely lacking in VR titles.

696
00:51:57,301 --> 00:52:04,204
I would be very happy if what I shared today turned out to be a little bit of good know-how for all of you out there. Thank you very much.

697
00:52:04,604 --> 00:52:09,587
It would be great if some of what I've shared today turned out to be a little bit of good know-how for all of you out there. Thank you very much.

698
00:52:10,387 --> 00:52:11,247
Yeah, thank you very much.

699
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:16,282
This is a pretty long journey for us.

700
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:20,464
And yeah, so we had many things.

701
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:23,685
You know, we started from kind of a Zen feel,

702
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:28,307
feel good game, but we decided to mix the new elements.

703
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,409
And yeah, this is all the time, you know,

704
00:52:31,689 --> 00:52:35,410
the game production is like that, isn't it?

705
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:36,371
Yeah.

706
00:52:37,394 --> 00:52:45,862
So, and we learned a lot, you know, we tried to mix, I think the two elements, I'm talking about

707
00:52:45,882 --> 00:52:56,853
the zone, you know, so we wanted to make a very relaxing fugal game and the other hand, you know,

708
00:52:57,093 --> 00:53:01,398
it's kind of like excitement, you know, we needed to combine both.

709
00:53:02,642 --> 00:53:06,025
And so I learned about the zone mechanism.

710
00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:10,148
So zone mechanism, you are in a zone when you are in a zone.

711
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:15,273
So you are kind of the between relax and excitement.

712
00:53:15,754 --> 00:53:17,755
So it's a very small, tiny zone.

713
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:21,899
But yeah, we learned a lot about that.

714
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:25,947
Oh wow, so we can make that kind of a feel,

715
00:53:26,468 --> 00:53:29,210
the using the power of the visual and sounds,

716
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:32,153
and also, you know, tattoo skin mechanism.

717
00:53:33,134 --> 00:53:37,878
So, yeah, I can say to you, you know,

718
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:43,363
we can have much more space to explore.

719
00:53:45,551 --> 00:53:56,694
Using the technology, even if thinking about the VR, AR, MR, XR technology, this is a 3D experience, experiential we can create.

720
00:53:57,254 --> 00:53:58,234
So this is a new era.

721
00:53:59,394 --> 00:54:07,957
But, you know, we have a bunch of space, this is white snow, and this is a big journey and explore.

722
00:54:08,937 --> 00:54:10,938
But, we need to go there.

723
00:54:11,642 --> 00:54:14,563
you know, to make the new kind of experience.

724
00:54:15,364 --> 00:54:17,145
So game has a 50 years history,

725
00:54:17,705 --> 00:54:20,267
and the movie has a 130 years history,

726
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:23,629
but the first people, you know,

727
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:25,570
tried to make a new something.

728
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:30,073
So we are facing to the next era,

729
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:31,794
I mean, experiential era.

730
00:54:32,714 --> 00:54:35,476
So, yeah, it's a really exciting thing.

731
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:43,430
And also I want to thank to my team, Monsters and Resonare.

732
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:45,571
So that was a really good team, you know.

733
00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:48,673
Yeah, we had a long history.

734
00:54:50,894 --> 00:54:52,415
You know, we made Resonate Infinite

735
00:54:53,055 --> 00:54:54,275
and that kind of experience,

736
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:57,237
we can go, we could go to the next step.

737
00:54:58,057 --> 00:55:00,399
And of course we want to go to the next step.

738
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:01,039
That's right.

739
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:01,679
The future.

740
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:02,300
From here.

741
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:11,846
Yeah, and yes, I want to thank to Tetris company. Yeah, so we want to prove, you know, even if the

742
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:20,791
old famous IP like Tetris, it's like a, you know, complete game, nothing add. But is it true?

743
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:25,486
You know, we wanted to prove that, you know, if we can.

744
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:26,667
Yeah.

745
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:29,948
Is it true that you can't add anything to it's already perfect?

746
00:55:29,968 --> 00:55:31,749
There's nothing more that can really be done with it.

747
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:37,071
And I think hopefully us and also now Tetris 99 have proved like, yeah, it's

748
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:39,092
it's just a matter of imagination.

749
00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:40,812
That's totally a new experience.

750
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:43,474
You know, we are making the new experience, right?

751
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,475
We are experienced designer, isn't it?

752
00:55:47,435 --> 00:55:47,675
Yeah.

753
00:55:48,376 --> 00:55:48,916
Thank you very much.
