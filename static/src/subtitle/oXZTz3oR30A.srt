1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:09,519
I'm Laura Hall. I'm a game designer, artist, and writer. I live in Portland,

2
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:15,342
Oregon, and I make a lot of stuff. Right now my focus is escape rooms, but I'm

3
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:20,844
also really involved in like alternate reality games and art installation work.

4
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:24,546
These are some of the things that I've worked on recently. The Amazon Echo

5
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:29,088
Escape at New York Comic Con. There was a national tour of a Resident Evil game

6
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:29,888
that I helped work on.

7
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,073
The Silence in Room 1258 was an installation piece in London in 2017,

8
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:39,317
and the piece that we'll be discussing today mostly is Spark of Resistance,

9
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:41,919
which was the first ever escape room game that I made.

10
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,603
That one, it was in Portland, it doesn't exist anymore,

11
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:51,067
but that was a spy drama set in an alternate universe, kind of Cold War-era dystopia.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,742
And today I'm going to talk about the design principles

13
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:59,105
of how I make deeply narrative and immersive escape rooms,

14
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:01,446
in particular the lessons I've learned

15
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,968
and the mistakes that I've made to learn those lessons,

16
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:08,572
and why those games work best when all of the work

17
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:10,893
that goes into them is totally invisible to the player.

18
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:14,716
But to kick it off, I want to define some stuff first.

19
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:18,739
And can I ask, how many people have actually been

20
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,920
to an escape room?

21
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,520
Yes, that's great.

22
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,522
That makes my job a lot easier.

23
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:29,146
So like a quick overview, they started out as

24
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:31,788
these point and click flash games in the early double aughts.

25
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:35,111
Someone pretty quickly had the idea to translate those

26
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:36,492
into actual physical spaces.

27
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:39,214
But the earliest you're seeing those is around that time.

28
00:01:39,294 --> 00:01:41,776
So this is actually still a pretty new genre,

29
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:45,179
even though it draws from things that have existed

30
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,160
for hundreds of years.

31
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:53,963
When I'm talking about escape rooms, I'm referring to the specific physical space, people buy

32
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:58,667
tickets to visit it, they may or may not be locked in, it's usually against fire code

33
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:01,109
these days to actually lock the door, so that's fine.

34
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,193
There's generally an hour to play the puzzle, sometimes it can be as little as 45 minutes,

35
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,534
sometimes up to 90.

36
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:13,718
And often you're not actually trying to escape anymore, they're usually goal-oriented.

37
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,060
As an example, more often than not, it's defusing a bomb.

38
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:26,162
But it's a relatively new genre, and it's part of what we refer to as immersive entertainment.

39
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:28,343
So some definitions of that.

40
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,124
No Proscenium, which is an amazing resource for this kind of thing,

41
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:36,225
puts it as an experience that physically and usually narratively

42
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:39,486
places the audience in the same space where the action is occurring.

43
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:44,349
And Sarah Thatcher, who works at Disney and is amazing,

44
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,212
she defined it as something without a frame around it.

45
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,334
There's no proscenium, no screen,

46
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:52,915
it's something that's happening in space.

47
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:05,970
That also encompasses things like theater, haunted houses, theme parks, live action role play, installation work.

48
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,313
They draw upon a lot of principles that have crossover in user experience and video game level design.

49
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:21,078
And so while this presentation specifically deals with escape rooms, there are lots of design principles that I think are, and I wish were, universally applicable.

50
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,526
These are some of the dimensions of immersion

51
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:26,166
that you get either in a physical space

52
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:27,546
or in interacting with a screen.

53
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,947
So you're enjoying your time there, hopefully.

54
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:33,608
You're mentally engaged in the process.

55
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:35,728
You're feeling a sense of spatial presence,

56
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:38,149
whether that's in relation to a game controller

57
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,529
or the environment around you.

58
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,930
And the ultimate goal is to feel transportation,

59
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,390
so you're immersed in a narrative.

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,611
To me, that feeling of transportation is key

61
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,031
to all of the work that we do.

62
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:53,353
And then this is a basic spectrum of where immersive works

63
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:53,973
tend to fall.

64
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,214
It's developed by Rachel Pendergrass.

65
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:58,334
So is there a cohesive story,

66
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,395
or is the experience largely about setting a mood?

67
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:04,616
Would the performance work if there was no audience

68
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:08,036
participating, or is it entirely reliant upon participation?

69
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,297
There's other questions about people's ability

70
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:13,397
to move through the space, or whether they're stationary,

71
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:15,298
whether or not there is a fourth wall,

72
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,078
or they're able to engage directly with the actors,

73
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:18,618
for example.

74
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,442
Or whether the narrative is set and it can be influenced by the people doing those interactions.

75
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:30,526
And you can see that escape rooms fall upon the audience dependent line and the atmospheric line.

76
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:34,609
So lots of theming and it can't take place without the people in it.

77
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:40,150
And then also, I'm going to break down some of the elements of our game,

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,313
and there may be other ways that you personally define these,

79
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,455
but when I'm speaking about it, this is what I mean.

80
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,398
The narrative is the story told by the world.

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,364
The set, the objects, everything is speaking to whatever the story is that you're inhabiting.

82
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,707
versus the story or the plot.

83
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:58,811
And that's the action that's playing out over the hour

84
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,053
that people are inside the game.

85
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,418
And then there's another layer, which is the game flow.

86
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,780
That's the puzzles and interactions

87
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,042
that people are progressing through

88
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:07,465
that is driving them forward.

89
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:12,078
So when we set out to design these, we're facing three challenges.

90
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,640
We want to tell a story that's entertaining while people are under a significant physical

91
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,381
and mental stress.

92
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:21,762
We want to tell that story in a physical space in a cinematic way.

93
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:26,264
And we want to use puzzles and interactions thoughtfully to make it fun and reinforce

94
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:27,765
the themes of whatever they're going through.

95
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:30,386
And so again, I want to draw your attention to...

96
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:34,067
the place where escape rooms fall on here

97
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:36,927
because it is different to what my goals are.

98
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:40,808
My goal is to drive it fully into the narrative side.

99
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,429
I have never seen an escape room reviewed

100
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,289
like a theater performance before,

101
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:48,270
and so that is what I'm working toward.

102
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,750
I want it to be taken seriously as art.

103
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,671
But because it is still emerging,

104
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:54,511
you know, there are people who are trying to do that,

105
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:59,372
but generally not so much with the story stuff.

106
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:06,449
So, our first challenge, telling the story while people are under significant physical

107
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,170
and mental stress.

108
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:12,137
When we think about these designs, our first step is narrowing in on what's happening to

109
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:15,782
people's brains in these spaces, and cognitively there's a lot going on.

110
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:20,825
And this is really easy to see when people step inside a theater or a haunted house.

111
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:24,726
They both have visitors crossing a threshold into another world.

112
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:28,887
The lights go down, the music starts, people's hearts speed up a little,

113
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:32,548
their eyes are like adjusting to the light, and they start darting around,

114
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:35,929
and they're keying into what's happening. But that's actually the brain entering

115
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:39,550
a kind of survival mode. And once that switch has been flipped,

116
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:44,826
We're then asking people to solve puzzles or take in information or interact with characters.

117
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:50,232
And it's a real challenge to communicate directly with the player's brain when it's in that

118
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:50,572
state.

119
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:55,978
So I'd like to talk for a minute about what is happening to players mentally when they're

120
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,778
in that escape room.

121
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:58,700
They're in survival mode.

122
00:06:59,001 --> 00:06:59,741
They're excited.

123
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,296
You know, we've used lighting cues in design

124
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:03,837
to bring them into a flow state.

125
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:06,840
And so I want to show you a video.

126
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,363
It's really important that you follow the instructions

127
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,184
on the screen very carefully.

128
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,087
This is an awareness test.

129
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,451
How many passes does the team in white make?

130
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:28,037
The answer is 13.

131
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,798
But, did you see the moonwalking bear?

132
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,202
So that's more generally known as the invisible gorilla experiment.

133
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:12,545
It's a great example of how the brain and the body are doing weird things in concert

134
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:16,307
when they're in stressful situations and when you're asking people to focus on particular

135
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:16,648
things.

136
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,510
And you see that play out in escape rooms all the time.

137
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,251
In our original room.

138
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:26,567
We had a klaxon that blared any time we were delivering a hint to people, and people would

139
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:27,788
be standing right next to it.

140
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:29,449
This is a loud klaxon.

141
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:33,051
And they would totally miss it because they were so deeply engrossed in whatever they

142
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:33,891
were interacting with.

143
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:39,134
And that's something that we just have to keep in mind for basically every single part

144
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:40,515
of the story that we're trying to convey.

145
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:46,818
Another funny kind of lizard brain survival mode thing is that we love to look for patterns

146
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:48,759
in stuff.

147
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,280
Does this sink look worried to you?

148
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:54,758
In an escape room, you can see how that becomes a problem

149
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:57,442
if you need people to find only the specific patterns

150
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:58,563
that you want them to find.

151
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:03,444
So this is what's happening in people's brains.

152
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,765
They're deeply focused to the exclusion

153
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:07,345
of most other information.

154
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:09,786
They're quickly searching and processing

155
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:12,326
to try and make connections between the game elements.

156
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,747
And they're getting mentally and physically exhausted

157
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:16,007
by what they're seeing and doing.

158
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:18,468
Ignoring the physical element is something

159
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:19,608
that you also see a lot,

160
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:22,089
but people become so wrapped up in these games

161
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,669
that they forget that they're standing

162
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:26,270
on a hard, cold, concrete floor for an hour.

163
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,530
And afterward, they're like,

164
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,830
why do my legs hurt so much?

165
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,530
Well, we know.

166
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:36,462
So, the lessons for that are to eliminate red herrings and extra junk wherever possible,

167
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:42,348
to be mindful of how players are able to take in information, and really to lean on the

168
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:43,089
world building.

169
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,112
Understanding that, I think, is respecting the player.

170
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:50,434
We also avoid putting in text unless it's absolutely vital,

171
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,615
because again, they really will not absorb it.

172
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,697
They will process it as quickly as they can for puzzle elements,

173
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:58,398
and then it gets thrown to the side.

174
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,519
So it's a really poor way to deliver any kind of story.

175
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:05,565
Since this is part of the narrative summit,

176
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:07,567
I'm not gonna get too deep into how we go

177
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,951
into the world building, but this is like a summary.

178
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:12,755
There's a huge difference between what the player

179
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:15,539
actually sees and processes and what we need to know

180
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,762
in order to make a world that feels cohesive.

181
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:23,117
Honestly, that could be a whole day-long summit in itself.

182
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:26,638
But so Spark of Resistance, it's a spy drama,

183
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:30,239
but from another perspective, the players are terrorists

184
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,419
instead of freedom fighters.

185
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:34,640
We chose to set our story in an oppressive world

186
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,580
full of censorship, and we knew what we wanted to say

187
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,361
about that, which guided everything that we put into it.

188
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:42,222
But from a player perspective,

189
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:43,842
you're just kind of going on a fun adventure.

190
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:53,309
In Spark of Resistance, that game, this is the lesson in action.

191
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,713
Players are told that there are secret agents who have been activated to investigate the

192
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:01,156
office of a spy who is deep undercover.

193
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:06,400
That person had missed a check-in and we assume the worst, like they've just disappeared.

194
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:09,263
We need these players to go in and figure out what's happened.

195
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:10,905
So this is how it plays out.

196
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,467
Their first puzzle leads to a tape recorder,

197
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:14,908
which says, if you're listening to this,

198
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:15,829
I'm in big trouble.

199
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:19,032
Then the players send a key card

200
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:20,934
through a built-in message tube system.

201
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:22,656
And in the game flow,

202
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,517
that is the first time that that character,

203
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:25,939
which is not a real person,

204
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,001
but that's the first time they become aware

205
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:30,343
of the players in that space in the game world.

206
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,506
The spy then sends them back a note,

207
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:34,807
which is written on another puzzle.

208
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:38,736
and they use that information to distract a security guard

209
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,358
and it displays a video of the spy evading the guard

210
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:42,899
based on the information they've just sent.

211
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,202
The spy then speaks directly to the players via a camera

212
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:47,043
and it's a betrayal.

213
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:49,765
So from that point on, the players are on their own.

214
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:51,767
They have to complete the mission and save themselves.

215
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:57,831
Each of the puzzles moves them forward in the task of investigating the office and helping

216
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,311
the spy.

217
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:03,313
Each one grants them slightly more knowledge about the dystopian world via an increasing

218
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:06,115
amount of security clearance and access to information.

219
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:11,978
And this is all done with, like, two lines of dialogue, a short video and that handwritten

220
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:12,899
message which you can see.

221
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:19,822
So for each of those moments, we boiled the plot and narrative stuff down to its very most essential message

222
00:12:19,902 --> 00:12:23,424
because we knew that people would not be able to process anything more than that.

223
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:28,227
The environment, the object design, and the puzzle mechanics carry the burden of the rest.

224
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,585
So our second challenge is telling an engaging story

225
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:35,546
in a physical space in a cinematic way.

226
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:39,588
Knowing that players are not gonna take in that info,

227
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:43,330
how do we turn, well, you can imagine

228
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,371
the big scroll from Star Wars.

229
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:47,332
How do we turn a huge wall of text

230
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,413
into the single evocative image

231
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,153
which is what kicks off A New Hope?

232
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:52,214
It's a tiny.

233
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,718
Starship flying against a huge inky black sky,

234
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:57,820
and then a massive star destroyer.

235
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,863
You don't need or really remember that text

236
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:02,965
because you know exactly what the dynamic is

237
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:04,727
from the first image that you're presented with.

238
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,469
Show, don't tell, right?

239
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,634
In my experience, when you show up in an escape room, it's all about that sense of anticipation.

240
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:16,858
You don't really know what's about to happen because you want to avoid spoilers for yourself.

241
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,841
You probably don't know what it looks like inside because places generally don't place

242
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,783
photographs of their rooms online.

243
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:25,786
You're maybe a little excited, maybe a little bit scared.

244
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:28,770
So you show up and then the first thing that happens

245
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,772
is that you're handed a letter

246
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:33,095
or you get a really long speech about the world

247
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:34,476
and what you're supposed to be doing in it

248
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:35,677
and it's just a hype killer.

249
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:40,402
So nobody remembers any of the story

250
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:42,083
that is presented in those moments.

251
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:44,886
But thankfully we don't have to reinvent the wheel.

252
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:47,168
There's best practices for moving people

253
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,189
through physical spaces.

254
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,092
from LARP to theater to theme parks.

255
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:53,755
They've also undergone the stress tests

256
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:56,037
that escape rooms as an industry have not.

257
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:57,838
You know, they're putting thousands and thousands

258
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,420
of people through these spaces every day.

259
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,603
So if we look to them for the best practices

260
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,505
of how to convey story in those environments

261
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:05,926
where people are moving through them quickly,

262
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:07,167
we can really learn a lot.

263
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:11,828
And I also have to call out environmental storytelling

264
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:13,750
is like a legitimate meme at this point.

265
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,972
Joking about the way that video games place little vignettes

266
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,754
into levels to tell you, you know,

267
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:21,856
whatever has just happened, but something's happened here.

268
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:24,938
But the reason it's a joke is because it's so obvious,

269
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,001
right, like ideally you're using the level layout

270
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:30,583
and the affordances of all of the objects and interactions.

271
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:36,324
But being obvious in this manner stops the progression of the plot while you look at

272
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:40,586
it and in an escape room where there's a taking timer, that's a huge problem because you're

273
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:42,286
deliberately wasting the player's time.

274
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:44,907
So the lessons there.

275
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:50,368
Use elements from architecture, LARP, theater, films to set the tone and the design for specific

276
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:55,270
emotion and avoid and eliminate frictions that yank people out of immersion.

277
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:01,742
Like when you think of what an office looks like to you, you know, it's probably like this top photo. It's messy

278
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:07,729
There's fluorescent lights. You can see that reflected in media like office space or the office

279
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,854
But when you start looking at more stylized versions of offices in film

280
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:18,921
Also set in sort of dystopian era stuff. You can see where our influences were taken from

281
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:25,145
So our third challenge, to use puzzles and interactions thoughtfully to make the game

282
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:26,767
fun and reinforce the themes.

283
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:33,493
And I have to step back and talk about why we actually like puzzles because actually

284
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:35,115
maybe we kind of don't.

285
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:38,357
People solve puzzles because they like pain,

286
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:40,078
they like being released from pain,

287
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:42,600
and they like most of all that they find within themselves

288
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,841
the power to release themselves from their own pain.

289
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:48,164
I love that quote, but escape rooms

290
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:49,925
are like a kind of funny niche right now,

291
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:52,446
and I think people self-select out of them a lot

292
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,328
because they feel like it's going to be difficult,

293
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,169
but these are behaviors that we see

294
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:57,550
in the real world all the time,

295
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,872
whether that's from video game grinding and farming,

296
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:03,634
like those are terrible terms, that's not fun.

297
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:08,075
as we would define it, but all the way up to marathoning and rock climbing.

298
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,856
That's the type four kinds of fun where it's not necessarily fun while you're doing it,

299
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:14,017
but you're kind of glad you did it.

300
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:16,897
What makes a good puzzle?

301
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,618
Tells you how to solve it inherent in its design.

302
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,959
You don't have to have any kind of explanation.

303
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,660
You also don't need to rely upon outside knowledge like literature or film trivia.

304
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,042
And a good puzzle is also adjustable by adding or reducing the information in it.

305
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:36,316
Like this puzzle is obvious what to do in this,

306
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,798
and this guy is really enjoying doing the obvious thing.

307
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:44,303
So the way to implement that is through the use

308
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:46,765
of diegetic objects, eliminating busy work,

309
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:49,166
only including puzzles that are gonna propel

310
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:51,488
the plot forward, and elimination of friction,

311
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:53,069
and we'll discuss friction in a minute.

312
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,632
This is an example from Spark of how these principles

313
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:57,573
were put into action.

314
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:01,574
Players were presented with a shelf of library books.

315
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,795
If you are familiar with how a library works,

316
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:07,196
you can guess that the stickers on the side

317
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,536
refer to the Dewey Decimal System of cataloging,

318
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:12,737
and putting them into order forms a sentence

319
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:15,498
that directs you toward a page inside one of the books

320
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:17,979
where you find a library checkout card

321
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,419
that you overlay onto a page.

322
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:27,101
It's a really solid design because you can solve the entire thing without any other elements.

323
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:30,843
If you know how the books work, it's easy to do.

324
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:36,064
But actually the player base is now aging out of using libraries, so it's maybe not

325
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:40,506
a great puzzle anymore because it does require extra outside knowledge like typewriters,

326
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:42,626
VCRs and cassette tapes are the same.

327
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:49,098
So everything I've described is about crafting

328
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:50,339
an illusion for people.

329
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,400
They have the illusion of agency,

330
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,802
and they have this feeling that they're propelling

331
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:58,024
themselves through a very carefully crafted puzzle path,

332
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:01,086
but actually nothing that they do is accidental.

333
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,228
Every single thing that they maybe are,

334
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:05,889
we would consider like emergent play,

335
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,530
is something that we have planned for.

336
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:11,473
Because we very carefully avoided creating friction

337
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:13,454
in the design, people are totally immersed

338
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:14,775
and everything is flowing easily.

339
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,244
They have no idea how much work has gone into making that experience fun,

340
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:22,948
because they have been totally transported and are able to live in that moment.

341
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:24,931
And I think that's something really special.

342
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:30,978
I think that The Greatest Sin is promising to deliver that gift of transportation.

343
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,762
You know, for an hour or however long you're engaging with the work.

344
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,373
and then doing something that causes reality

345
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:39,634
to come screeching back in.

346
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:42,275
Like if you think about the pattern recognition

347
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,376
with the face in the sink,

348
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,056
like it's natural human instinct

349
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,517
to want to peek behind the curtain.

350
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:49,278
So that's something that people, players,

351
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,019
look for without even thinking,

352
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:53,901
and it's our job as entertainers to keep that curtain drawn.

353
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,463
Friction can come from a lot of places.

354
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,717
and mostly it tends to do with accessibility

355
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:03,258
in escape room games.

356
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:07,180
Lots and lots of puzzles rely on color changes, for example,

357
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,762
but that totally eliminates the experience

358
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:12,983
of anybody who's colorblind or in any way sight limited.

359
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:16,225
Considering accessibility of motion,

360
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:19,266
of hearing, and of movement is also a big one.

361
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,103
So, experiences in games are a gift

362
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:26,105
that designers can give to our players.

363
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,647
You know, we've done a good job

364
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:31,129
if we can help those players enter the magic circle

365
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:32,771
and have fun in the worlds that we've built.

366
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:36,354
But if we can help them to not only experience the world

367
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:38,796
in a new way, to feel a bit of magic,

368
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,497
transportation, and heroism,

369
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,319
and then carry that new way of experience

370
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:43,620
in the world with them when they leave,

371
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,281
that is success to me.

372
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:47,583
Thank you.

373
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:04,194
We can take questions, I guess, at the mic.

374
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:05,976
We have about 10 minutes, yeah.

375
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:14,667
Hi.

376
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:21,856
I was wondering if you have any best practices for developing narratives that adapt to different

377
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:28,099
players' skill levels, like with the escape room, it could be a room full of 12-year-olds

378
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:30,080
or a room full of 32-year-olds.

379
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:30,560
Sure.

380
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:36,663
So, the question is about adapting the game dynamically for the level of the skill of

381
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:37,403
the players in it.

382
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,406
comes down to hinting generally.

383
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:43,329
Hinting is a very specific skill

384
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,132
because you want to point people in the right direction

385
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:48,995
but it's like having somebody scratch an itch for you,

386
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:49,916
like it just doesn't work.

387
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:51,879
They need to be able to scratch it themselves.

388
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,642
So it's just about providing enough information

389
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:55,783
to set them on the right path.

390
00:20:56,664 --> 00:21:01,845
But also generally, 12-year-olds are sort of in a gray area for

391
00:21:01,945 --> 00:21:03,766
being able to enjoy most escape rooms.

392
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:08,007
They don't tend to have the level of concentration necessary.

393
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:12,548
So part of that is just only allowing a certain age group to participate in

394
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:13,509
the first place.

395
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:20,924
I wanted to talk about time limits and escape rooms in virtual reality. I'm working on a

396
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:26,505
virtual reality escape room game right now. And having played other competing games in

397
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:31,786
that space, I actually personally feel like time limits don't make sense in that capacity

398
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:35,887
because it's inherently extremely unfun to play through again. Failure doesn't feel good.

399
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:39,408
And because there aren't real people or a real space that you need to kick people out

400
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:39,848
of that doesn't...

401
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:44,112
serve the player outside of creating that stress, which may be worthwhile in and of

402
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:44,593
itself.

403
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:46,074
So I kind of wanted your opinion on that.

404
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:46,675
Sure.

405
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:52,060
So in the games that we do, actually, this is kind of a secret, but I would be absolutely

406
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,665
happy if 100% of players got out, there were three minutes left on the clock, and they

407
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:59,248
also felt like they were the only players to ever escape.

408
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:01,830
But that's again, that's crafting that illusion.

409
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,752
It's an entertainment component, right?

410
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:08,344
I think that in VR in particular,

411
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:10,446
you have to watch out for the physical fatigue.

412
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:14,208
So having a timer in that situation might just be a way

413
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:16,810
to make sure that people aren't experiencing time dilation

414
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,412
and forgetting that time is passing.

415
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:24,876
But you're right, it could just be a totally untimed thing

416
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,176
as long as there's enough structure

417
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:27,597
to lead people through it.

418
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:28,578
Thanks very much.

419
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:29,198
Thank you.

420
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:34,080
Hi, wonderful talk.

421
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:39,706
Is there a resource for other disciplines?

422
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:42,048
We're all here to feed the narrative.

423
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:46,012
I'm an audio person, so it's part of my responsibility to support the narrative.

424
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:54,841
Is there a resource to learn better communication, whether it's a book or online, to learn more

425
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:55,862
about the vocabulary?

426
00:22:56,177 --> 00:23:02,881
Yeah, so No Proscenium is an amazing website and newsletter that is listing physical experiences

427
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:08,105
generally and they have a corresponding group on Facebook called Everything Immersive and

428
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,866
it really is for everything immersive and I would recommend starting there.

429
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:13,388
We actually have started an immersive book club,

430
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:14,249
which we're running.

431
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:17,152
If you look at immersivebook.club.

432
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:19,334
So that's one of our ways of attempting

433
00:23:19,374 --> 00:23:20,655
to break out of the silo.

434
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:23,917
Because yeah, there's best practices for UX

435
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:26,199
and there's best practices for theater

436
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,441
and then they don't ever really cross over.

437
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:31,404
So that's something that I think is really important

438
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,265
just as an industry and it's a new industry.

439
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,827
Cool, thank you.

440
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:35,127
Thanks.

441
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,061
You've made a lot of escape rooms.

442
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:39,102
Do you have advice for people who are new to that?

443
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:42,204
How much work does it take and how do you start small

444
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:43,645
so that you don't boil the ocean?

445
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:44,945
To make escape rooms?

446
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:45,145
Yeah.

447
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:46,306
Oh man.

448
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:48,568
In 30 seconds or less.

449
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:48,828
Sure.

450
00:23:50,944 --> 00:23:55,527
So, first of all, I would say escape rooms ultimately are a ticket selling business.

451
00:23:55,587 --> 00:23:58,209
The fun part of doing the design is over very quickly.

452
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,852
And there's a lot of real estate stuff involved in them.

453
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:04,673
So I would keep that in mind before sort of venturing down that path.

454
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:09,757
But if you're really determined, playtesting is by far the most important thing.

455
00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:12,658
And there is a skill that you have to develop

456
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:15,259
in watching people try and fail to solve puzzles

457
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:16,539
because if they're failing at it,

458
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,640
it's your fault as the designer

459
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,340
and not really their fault as a player.

460
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,841
So learning to be able to see that,

461
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:26,162
to hold yourself back from intervening and doing that

462
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:27,762
is really the best lesson.

463
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:32,424
And I'd say playtest like three to five times more

464
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:33,464
than you're doing the design.

465
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:37,112
I think he was next.

466
00:24:37,172 --> 00:24:38,933
Sure.

467
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:45,437
One of our talk, you spoke about world building and we authors love to world build and players

468
00:24:45,477 --> 00:24:52,442
never get it, but sometimes players, they will see these bits of lore and story and

469
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:57,385
they'll just gloss over them and this can bore them or disengage them and they in turn

470
00:24:57,845 --> 00:25:02,348
will disengage other players and it's like a negative feedback loop.

471
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:11,390
How do you best determine a dose of worldbuilding or story lore for players to avoid this?

472
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,831
I mean, I think it depends on the type of player you're creating the lore for, right?

473
00:25:16,871 --> 00:25:20,711
Because I'm somebody who wants to dig really deep into all of the secrets of something,

474
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:26,312
so I will read all of the material that a lot of people probably are just moving past.

475
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:27,913
So if you're designing that thing for me...

476
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,955
having it there and then making it easy to pass by totally makes sense.

477
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:35,357
But if it's something that's meant to benefit all of the players, I mean,

478
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:38,919
I would start asking like what is actually necessary.

479
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,201
If it is something that the players are deciding is not important to the experience,

480
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:47,464
then it might either be conveyed better in some other manner or just taken out.

481
00:25:47,484 --> 00:25:49,645
Okay, thank you so much.

482
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:55,968
I know it's in a sense almost the opposite of what you do, but I'm particularly interested

483
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:01,093
in meditative spaces, and I could also see how it's very similar in certain ways.

484
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:06,097
I wondered if you had any thoughts about engaging design for meditative spaces.

485
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:08,399
I mean, me, do you remember the game Myst?

486
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,002
Yes, I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for Myst.

487
00:26:12,622 --> 00:26:15,825
I used to peel off on the side of that little island and just hang out with the dappled

488
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,528
sun coming in, and finally the game would just say, are you going to do anything?

489
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:25,458
Yeah. So I would actually say like the sort of opposite coin of the work that I make is

490
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:32,499
untimed, like experience-based stuff. The Now Play, this thing that I highlighted at the beginning,

491
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:39,080
is situated in a desk and it's supposed to be the experience of reading other people's letters.

492
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,782
And I consider that a game. And it's something that you participate in, you feel everything,

493
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:48,082
you're looking at it, you're reading between the lines, but you personally decide.

494
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,382
when that experience ends, when you have enough information,

495
00:26:52,482 --> 00:26:53,463
or when you're satisfied.

496
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:56,385
It's something that her story used really well,

497
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:57,225
I think, as well.

498
00:26:57,686 --> 00:26:59,126
So there's definitely a place for it.

499
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:01,888
But yeah, for me, the opposite of the escape rooms

500
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:04,690
is stuff that's entirely reading, and is untimed,

501
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,152
and is deeply personal and not team-based.

502
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:10,454
So yeah, there's definitely space for meditation.

503
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:12,655
Just in your talk, I'm excited to see more of your work.

504
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:13,356
Thanks.

505
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:14,957
Hi.

506
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:20,801
Do you have any insights on how to make people not feel left out in some part of the games?

507
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:23,102
I always feel like that in escape room games.

508
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,004
Every single player, even on successful teams, says something like that.

509
00:27:27,184 --> 00:27:29,286
They say, oh, I didn't do anything.

510
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:32,728
And like when you're watching through the cameras, you're like, no, I saw when you picked

511
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:35,129
up that thing and you made this connection.

512
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:39,672
The way to do that, I think, is through a sort of debrief afterward, which is something

513
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:40,893
that LARPs really nail.

514
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:43,634
It's something where you walk players through

515
00:27:43,715 --> 00:27:45,216
and then you specifically call out,

516
00:27:45,256 --> 00:27:47,037
like you did this and you did this

517
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:48,157
and you ask somebody, you know,

518
00:27:48,178 --> 00:27:49,779
what did you do that with this thing?

519
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,480
There's also a thing from LARP called froth,

520
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:54,622
which is a collective myth making that occurs

521
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:55,242
when you're sort of,

522
00:27:56,463 --> 00:27:57,884
when the players are telling the story,

523
00:27:57,964 --> 00:28:00,206
so they're sort of world building after the fact.

524
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:02,387
So just making room to encourage that

525
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:04,148
I think would be really helpful with that feeling,

526
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:07,350
but everybody feels that way too, so yeah.

527
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:15,986
Yeah, that ties very much into my question, because I usually have a similar feeling after doing a room escape game,

528
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:22,369
and I feel like, man, I'd really enjoy doing this with one or maybe two other people, instead of five, six, seven, eight,

529
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:25,790
and we're all just looking at different corners and shouting at each other, like,

530
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:31,231
did anyone find that combination yet? And like, oh, you solved that? I didn't even see that part of the puzzle.

531
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:31,612
Yeah.

532
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:42,679
puzzles solved by groups where you don't necessarily get to see the whole picture,

533
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,504
like sit down with the letter and put the narrative together in your head quietly in your own time.

534
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:50,823
So that's kind of where the cinematic moment stuff comes in.

535
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:54,825
We usually try to have people branching off into different areas and spaces,

536
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:57,827
but when there's some sort of story thing that we need them to see,

537
00:28:58,187 --> 00:28:59,228
we drive them together.

538
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:03,370
That's something that you see in theater like Sleep No More, for example.

539
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,433
For the big major scenes, all of the actors all converge physically on the same space

540
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:09,374
and something plays out.

541
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:11,595
So you can choose to not participate in that,

542
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:14,036
but you're also missing a huge part of it.

543
00:29:14,997 --> 00:29:17,900
So, yeah, it's just very tightly structured in that way

544
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:20,103
to make sure that there is always something

545
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:20,784
for people to do.

546
00:29:21,164 --> 00:29:23,647
I'd say the sweet spot is generally eight people as well

547
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:25,409
for an hour long game, so.

548
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:26,109
Thank you.

549
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:31,279
You had mentioned wanting escape rooms to be taken as seriously as theater,

550
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,360
and I'm trying to figure out the intersections between theater and gaming.

551
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:40,543
And one of the things that even something like Sleep No More doesn't have,

552
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:43,724
that games have, is a fail state, which escape rooms have.

553
00:29:43,744 --> 00:29:45,265
And so I was just wondering your thoughts,

554
00:29:45,565 --> 00:29:47,425
as something that I've been trying to figure out myself, of like,

555
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:51,387
how do you make a fail state still narratively satisfying?

556
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,184
For our games, we try and get everybody

557
00:29:55,244 --> 00:29:57,005
to at least a particular part in the story,

558
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,126
which I'd say is about at the 80% mark.

559
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:01,227
So they've seen everything there is to see.

560
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:04,889
In Spark of Resistance, that's where the turn happens.

561
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:06,050
Like they've been betrayed,

562
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,392
and they're tasked with setting off an EMP device.

563
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:11,453
So whether they set that off or not

564
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:12,754
is sort of beside the point.

565
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:14,114
They've already absorbed everything.

566
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:17,536
And it is really a lot of work to get players to that point

567
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,858
if they're sort of not enjoying the rest of the game.

568
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:23,941
But I would say check out Strange Bird Immersive.

569
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:25,322
They're based in Houston, Texas,

570
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:28,625
and they do a seance theater experience

571
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:30,627
that's sort of built around an escape room.

572
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:33,749
So it's a literal integration of theater into a game.

573
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,612
So I think whether or not you succeed in that game

574
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:38,033
sort of doesn't matter to the story

575
00:30:38,073 --> 00:30:39,594
that's on either end of it as well.

576
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:41,856
So that is a potential structure to look at.

577
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:42,877
Awesome, thank you so much.

578
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,271
Hi, thank you for coming here.

579
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:49,774
I'm creating my own mixed reality game in immersive theater.

580
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:52,175
So I feel your talk is super helpful.

581
00:30:52,796 --> 00:30:55,958
I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the strategies

582
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:59,740
for how do we balance the player's free will

583
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,742
and the limitation our game rules set.

584
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:05,885
Because usually if a player wants to do things

585
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:09,667
the game designer doesn't intend to,

586
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:13,170
that will ruin or create distractions, that experience.

587
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,523
I mean, that's part of what the playtesting is that we do.

588
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:22,547
I would say in our rooms, players never do anything that we do not want them to do, even

589
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:24,428
if they believe that they are secretly.

590
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,591
Because at a certain point, doing what they want to do in a physical room means they're

591
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:30,132
going to get hurt.

592
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:34,554
It's probably different for mixed reality, I'm sure.

593
00:31:35,814 --> 00:31:37,935
But I would say, instead of trying to prevent them

594
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:40,216
to do that, to build space for that to happen,

595
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:46,398
sort of a side note, I took a trip to play Escape Rooms

596
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:49,439
for a full week in Malaysia, and the address for that

597
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:51,020
is up here, it's every game in this city.

598
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,661
And in one of the games, it was set in a classroom,

599
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:56,922
and we were each given name tags.

600
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:58,263
for each of the students.

601
00:31:58,443 --> 00:32:02,246
And so, the first group in our cluster that went through it

602
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,267
like role-played as these characters

603
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:05,348
that they were just making up.

604
00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:07,930
Then they created roles for the next group

605
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,751
to take on with secret roles

606
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:12,293
that we weren't allowed to communicate to the other players.

607
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:15,195
So like that emergent behavior that we came up with

608
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:18,097
made that game something really, really special.

609
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:20,939
So I think just like creating the opportunity for that

610
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,520
and then not stepping on people

611
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,462
when it's starting to happen as long as they're safe

612
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:26,783
is probably a good way to approach it.

613
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:27,716
Thank you.

614
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:34,142
Hi, so I am a narrative designer.

615
00:32:34,262 --> 00:32:37,525
I'm currently working on a couple of historical ARG projects

616
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:41,009
that are creating a story and a narrative game

617
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:42,490
around real world artifacts.

618
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,572
And I'm wondering if you have any advice

619
00:32:44,652 --> 00:32:46,674
for creating this sort of narrative space

620
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:50,657
when the boundary between what is part of the game

621
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:53,700
and what isn't is not as clear as a room.

622
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,803
For alternate reality game stuff,

623
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:58,704
I think probably players are gonna read

624
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,885
10 to 20 times more into it than you've intended,

625
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:04,726
which is kinda nice as the designer

626
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:06,146
to not have to do that work.

627
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:08,647
So I would just say, again,

628
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:10,448
it comes down to play testing.

629
00:33:10,828 --> 00:33:12,188
You're always gonna be surprised

630
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:13,529
by what is emerging from that,

631
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:15,669
but if you practice enough in advance,

632
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:17,130
and I know that's really difficult

633
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,190
for ARGs and live events in particular.

634
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:23,875
But the more that you can anticipate, the better it's going to be on the other side.

635
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,899
But also maybe don't worry about it too much because they will come up with all sorts of

636
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,540
like fun facts and connections.

637
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:34,265
Then I would work those into the game in a way that feels rewarding as if you had been

638
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:35,466
doing it on purpose the whole time.

639
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:36,247
Thank you.

640
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:36,988
Sure.

641
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:39,657
Hi, thank you for the great talk.

642
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:40,657
Oh, sorry.

643
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:44,800
We have to wrap it up, but I'm going to go to the lounge over

644
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,941
there if you two want to follow me over.

645
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,442
We can keep chatting.

646
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:49,503
Cool, thanks.
