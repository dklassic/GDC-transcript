00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:12,409
afternoon everyone. My name is Randy Hoyt. I'm an owner and game producer at Foxtrot Games.

2
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:16,653
Today we're going to be looking at tabletop games as cardboard interfaces. One thing they

3
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:21,377
asked me to remind you is to fill out your session survey, uh, evaluation after you, after

4
00:00:21,377 --> 00:00:26,021
this talk you should get that in email. Uh, they want to know how I do and I want to know how I

5
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:28,723
do so please feel free to give us any feedback.

6
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:35,497
As I mentioned, I'm the owner and game producer at Foxtrot Games. We're a small tabletop game

7
00:00:35,497 --> 00:00:40,300
company. We've put out six games so far with one more on the way. Four of those we funded

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,842
through Kickstarter campaigns. Three of those we put straight to retail. Our most recent

9
00:00:44,842 --> 00:00:49,265
game, Spy Club on Kickstarter, will be out this fall. This summer we'll have it available

10
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:49,585
in stores.

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,574
In my day job, I am a user interface engineer, software engineer. I work for marketing

12
00:00:56,574 --> 00:01:02,299
agencies and software companies, start-ups. One of the things we focus a lot on in our

13
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:08,264
software interfaces is usability. As I've studied usability for decades now, I find a lot of

14
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:14,329
the principles that you find in interfaces apply to tabletop games as well. They're of

15
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:16,191
course not identical, there's not

16
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:21,575
digital interfaces that perform functions behind on the back end, but both interfaces

17
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:27,679
and tabletop game components and graphic design both interact with abstract underlying systems

18
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:33,043
that humans, players, or users are interacting with. So a lot of the things in my work as

19
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:38,187
a game producer I find really studying usability and looking at the principles of usability

20
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:40,729
really help improve the tabletop gaming experience.

21
00:01:41,744 --> 00:01:47,369
Jacob Nielsen, a usability expert, has broken down usability into five main attributes.

22
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,591
We're going to be looking at these in tabletop games.

23
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:50,852
There's learnability.

24
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:56,818
How easy is it for a new player, a new user, to learn how to interact with an interface?

25
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:57,959
How memorable is it?

26
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,804
If they spend some time away and then come back, how easy is it for them to regain proficiency,

27
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:06,706
to remember what they had learned the first time they interacted with it?

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,664
efficiency. Once they've used the system, once they've used the interface or played the game,

29
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:16,929
how quickly can they perform the different tasks? If something takes too long in

30
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:22,715
tabletop, you'll often hear the adjectives clunky or fiddly applied to it. It's just not as

31
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:25,418
efficient to do the things that you know how to do already.

32
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:33,281
accuracy, how often do users make mistakes? And this is a big difference between tabletop

33
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:38,066
and digital type experiences. If you're using an interface and you believe a button will

34
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:41,990
do something when you click it, but you're wrong, when you click it, it will do the wrong

35
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,192
thing. It will do what it's been programmed to do.

36
00:02:44,793 --> 00:02:49,720
with a tabletop or analog experience, if you believe something costs less than it does,

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,447
there's nothing that will enforce the real costs. If you move a knight in chess illegally, the

38
00:02:55,447 --> 00:03:00,795
game won't stop you. It won't give you an alarm or a bonk or, you know, redo your move.

39
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:05,858
And if the other player doesn't know, you can just easily play games wrong.

40
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:09,560
I follow a lot of board game players and designers on Twitter and you see all kinds of posts

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,441
like, oh, I've been playing my favorite game wrong for five years.

42
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:17,004
That just happens a lot with tabletop because the game isn't enforcing it.

43
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:21,286
In fact, I hear many stories when people pick up a digital copy of a tabletop game, they

44
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:23,667
finally learn, oh, that's how that worked.

45
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:27,165
The last element is satisfaction.

46
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,046
Now, with a user interface, you think about if you're using

47
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:34,168
software to file an expense report, or book a flight, or

48
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:38,030
like a message on Facebook, you have a main utility of

49
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,730
that app.

50
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,711
You're trying to accomplish a task.

51
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,192
And how you feel about it is sort of secondary.

52
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,433
Obviously, if you enjoy your experience, you'll be more

53
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,913
likely to come back, and it's an important part of

54
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:47,374
usability.

55
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:49,394
But with games, especially.

56
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:52,635
there isn't exactly a task that you're trying to complete.

57
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:55,716
It's the satisfaction is the main utility.

58
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:57,596
You are trying to have an experience.

59
00:03:57,596 --> 00:03:59,577
There are a lot of other goals, but really,

60
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:00,677
are you having fun?

61
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:01,797
Is it enjoyment?

62
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:03,638
Are you feeling skilled?

63
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:05,298
Are you gaining mastery?

64
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:07,899
Is it providing context for social interaction?

65
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:10,139
All of those things relate very tightly to how

66
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,880
you feel about the experience.

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,320
So a lot of these things we're going to look at, usability,

68
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,341
really drive that satisfaction that you

69
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,241
have with the product, the game, and make

70
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:19,982
you want to come back.

71
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:24,243
to it. So we'll look at a number of examples from games, some I've worked on, just because

72
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:28,205
I have the behind the scenes insights on those, as well as some popular games that you're

73
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:33,887
probably familiar with. And we'll look at these games along these, some of these different

74
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:39,690
aspects. So we'll start with a pretty popular game, Catan. Catan has three types of wooden

75
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,192
pieces in the game, roads, settlements, and cities. One of the things you do on your turn

76
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:48,853
is you spend resources to place one of these wooden pieces on the board.

77
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,508
That's a pretty intuitive rule and when you learn the game and

78
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:55,714
someone's explaining it to you, they say turn in resources, put

79
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:56,415
the thing on the board.

80
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,850
It's pretty intuitive how to do it.

81
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,831
There are some rules, some restrictions.

82
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:03,013
But one of the things that's the hardest to remember or to

83
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:05,935
learn is what exactly each thing costs.

84
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:07,956
They've tried really hard with Catan to make

85
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:09,377
them feel thematic.

86
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:13,220
So it makes it a little bit easier to remember.

87
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,161
But when you come back to Catan after having not played

88
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:17,563
it for a month, you might be a little confused.

89
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:20,885
Now, what do I have to do to build a city exactly again?

90
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:23,986
And also these wooden pieces will generate resources.

91
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:24,786
That's part of the game.

92
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:27,947
You roll the dice and if you're built on a corner with a number,

93
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:31,388
it'll produce that given thing, that given resource.

94
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:33,168
Again, that's a rule that's pretty straightforward.

95
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:36,769
But the costs to help with learnability and memorability,

96
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,310
the game includes reference card.

97
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,070
This reference card includes the building costs.

98
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,371
It includes the victory points that you get for each one.

99
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:46,872
So it's very common to easily remember the rules for how you

100
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:50,233
build, but not remember exactly what those costs are.

101
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:51,895
So they provide this reference card.

102
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:54,499
After you've played a few times, maybe you don't even

103
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:57,003
need it, but it's there to help get players over that

104
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:59,166
learnability and memorability issues.

105
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:05,736
Another game that uses similar pieces, Terramistica, it actually has three of the same pieces plus

106
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:11,137
three others. These all have different costs. They have different benefits. The way that

107
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:15,719
you earn resources from your buildings in Terramistica is not as straightforward. Each

108
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:22,080
one produces a different thing. In a way, the resources are easier here because there's

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,162
only two. There's not five resources like in Catan. But then it makes it a little harder

110
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:29,683
to remember thematically. So there's workers and coins.

111
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:34,808
hard to remember what a trading post cost to build.

112
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:37,510
And so a simple reference card probably wouldn't

113
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,292
have been enough for Terra Mystica.

114
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:41,675
So what they did is they give you this really large

115
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:44,698
player board and you place all of your wooden pieces

116
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,019
on the player board.

117
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,202
So right next to them, it shows the costs to build them.

118
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:54,767
But the benefits that you get from building them are underneath the pieces.

119
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:58,149
So when you put a piece out on the board, it reveals the benefit.

120
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:03,674
So there's an income phase and all you have to do is there's no table, there's no reference

121
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:07,256
card, you don't have to count how many trading posts you have out on the board.

122
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:11,400
You just look at what you can see on your board that's visible.

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,261
That helps a lot with the accuracy.

124
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:16,123
If you had a table in the rule book and you had to count how many.

125
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:21,905
temples and how many trading posts you had, you'd be more likely to make a mistake. So to help

126
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:28,288
both with learnability, memorability and with accuracy, Terra Mystica comes with this player

127
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:33,590
board. Also, each faction now can have slightly different costs and slightly different

128
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,352
benefits because every player gets their own board and they do have some variability in them.

129
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:43,198
Many modern tabletop games have cards in them.

130
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:47,923
And cards have a few usability issues or considerations.

131
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:52,207
If you look at efficiency of playing cards, if you've got a

132
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:55,751
hand of cards, being able to see as much relevant

133
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:58,934
information to that card while you hold them in your hand is

134
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:01,256
really important for efficiency.

135
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:03,358
Playing cards didn't used to have.

136
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:08,101
the number and rank in the top left-hand corner if you look like 150 years ago, you'd have

137
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:12,263
to flip through all of your cards to sort of see which ones you had or fan them out

138
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:12,763
really far.

139
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:16,846
But here, a hand of nine cards, you can see all the information that you need.

140
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:20,688
Of course, in modern tabletop games, cards have a lot more...

141
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:25,610
information that you need on them. And so you really have to prioritize what goes in the top

142
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,672
left corner, what can go in different places. We've got a couple of different games to look at

143
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:35,594
here. Seven Wonders, one of my favorite games. You start the game with a hand of seven

144
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:40,616
cards and you can, if you have the resources, you can build one which is placed on the table

145
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:41,196
in front of you.

146
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:45,099
The building costs for these are all in the top left corner.

147
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,301
So you can, even with a hand of seven cards,

148
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:50,803
you can see all of the requirements for you to build.

149
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:52,705
You can quickly scan your hand and see,

150
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:54,026
oh, well, I can't build those five.

151
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,147
And at the beginning of the game,

152
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,648
there are many you can't buy.

153
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:58,730
So you can just focus on the two or three

154
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,971
that you may be able to build.

155
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:05,615
The benefits, what you get when you build them, is all in the top up there.

156
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:06,715
You can see a series of icons.

157
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:10,458
So as you play them on the table, you can stack the cards.

158
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,239
You don't have to have the whole thing visible.

159
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:16,335
Seven Wonders does not have any card text,

160
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:18,776
which is an interesting choice.

161
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:21,878
The Ahav has a really robust system of iconography

162
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:24,819
that could be a little tricky to learn,

163
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:26,400
but once you know it,

164
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,921
it makes the gameplay a lot more efficient.

165
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:32,263
You don't have to read all of the card text.

166
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:34,324
Just as an example, I taught my son,

167
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,286
who at the time was seven, I think, to play Seven Wonders,

168
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,446
and he could play it.

169
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:40,147
It's not a game for seven-year-olds, but.

170
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:44,111
I could teach him what all the icons meant, and he could learn.

171
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,874
And holding them all in his hand, he could process what they were.

172
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:50,838
We played some other games that had card text that were simpler, but he didn't read fast

173
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:51,358
enough.

174
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:55,262
He couldn't see them all at the same time, so he's flipping one card at a time, reading

175
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:55,843
the text.

176
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:59,846
And before he even got through his whole hand, he forgot what cards he had available.

177
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:01,969
So having that iconography makes it really efficient.

178
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,452
However, it does inhibit learnability to some degree.

179
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:06,714
Here's one example card.

180
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:10,498
This card, what this iconography means is when you

181
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:13,702
build this card, you gain two coins for every gray card you

182
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:15,203
have in your civilization.

183
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:18,387
Plus, at the end of the game, you gain two victory points

184
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:19,749
for every gray card that you have.

185
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:22,268
That's a nice long paragraph of text.

186
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:24,408
Could have had that.

187
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:26,569
You might not intuit that that's what that means from

188
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:29,070
looking at it, but once you learn the game, that's

189
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,570
something that you can then remember and

190
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,371
process efficiently.

191
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:36,072
They do include on the back of the rule book a giant list of

192
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:38,292
all the icon references.

193
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,933
Just about every game I play of Seven Wonders in the Third

194
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,874
Age, everyone picks up their hand and someone says, pass me

195
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:46,375
the reference book as a reminder.

196
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:46,535
Now.

197
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:53,759
Another popular game, Dominion, puts its building costs in a different place, in the bottom

198
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,940
left-hand corner.

199
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,465
Now the reason for that is in Dominion, the cards start out on the table and you can see

200
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,206
the cost to draft them into your deck.

201
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:05,649
Once you get them into your deck, that cost is irrelevant.

202
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,614
So when you draw the card and you hold them in your hand, you cannot see the building

203
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:11,855
cost anymore.

204
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:13,256
It's like where your thumb is.

205
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,158
It's hidden because it's no longer relevant.

206
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:19,942
In the top corners, they show when you play a card what it produces.

207
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:24,726
They use some color coding to show what types of cards you have.

208
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,749
Now the action cards, which are gray, you do have to read.

209
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:31,231
You can see the name of those when you're holding them in your hand.

210
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:34,714
They are thematically tied to what they do.

211
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:39,579
So the thief, unsurprisingly, lets you take cards that you wouldn't normally have access

212
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:40,119
to.

213
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,862
And so by driving home that theme, it can help you remember what they do.

214
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:47,245
They do have another type of action card, which is a reaction.

215
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:48,667
And those are coded in blue.

216
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,289
So you can play those on other people's turns.

217
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:55,452
Again, just using color as a slight nod so you know when you're holding them in your

218
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:57,214
hand and you can see that across the top.

219
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:00,660
A game that I've put out, Fox in the Forest,

220
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,381
it's a two-player trick-taking game.

221
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:06,483
The cards do have numbers or ranks and suits,

222
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:08,564
just like a typical playing card.

223
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,005
But all of the odd cards have special powers

224
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:14,387
and those are all written on the card themselves.

225
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:18,369
The special power is tied to a fairy tale character

226
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:19,690
that they represent.

227
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,111
And so, one of the things we found in playtesting

228
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:24,192
was that we could really help the learnability,

229
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:25,813
the memorability of the game.

230
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,826
by putting the name of the character,

231
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,989
at least in that top left corner.

232
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:33,112
So all the 11s are monarchs,

233
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:34,874
and they all have a certain power.

234
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:36,376
We included a reference card,

235
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:40,441
so that players can quickly reference what they do.

236
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:42,801
That's all pretty standard.

237
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:45,743
We went a little step further and we commissioned an author

238
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:49,404
to write us a custom fairy tale that really helped

239
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:51,846
kind of explain why the characters had that power.

240
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:54,527
So the rule book, we kind of sprinkled

241
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:55,907
these excerpts throughout.

242
00:12:55,907 --> 00:13:00,189
So from this fairy tale, you can see why the 11 and the one,

243
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:02,270
which is the monarch and the swan, interact.

244
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,872
Just as a little way to help, every little thing you can do

245
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,833
to help a character or a player remember,

246
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,634
what does the 11 do, why is the one related to it,

247
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:11,455
those kinds of things.

248
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:14,724
And really, as you're playtesting,

249
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:17,567
I strongly encourage you always to look at playtesting

250
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,249
as usability testing as well.

251
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:22,933
Of course, early on, you don't know if people

252
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:25,095
are gonna enjoy the mechanics that you have,

253
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,898
but as those mechanics start to get refined as...

254
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,001
players are consistently having fun with the game,

255
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,682
you can really start to take a look at the usability,

256
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:34,843
how players interact.

257
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:37,585
With Fox in the Forest, we asked players,

258
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:39,586
after they played, we'd quiz them a little bit.

259
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,587
Hey, what's the power on the three?

260
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,469
Which character lets you change the trumpsuit?

261
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,950
What number is the fox?

262
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,390
And as we play tested that,

263
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,312
especially once we put the character numbers

264
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:50,132
in the top corner.

265
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:54,155
that definitely improved. And so we were able to get players by

266
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:58,257
testing them as well as the game to see where was

267
00:13:58,257 --> 00:14:01,880
it starting to become easy to learn, easy to remember what they're doing.

268
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,703
Now just to give you some context on the work I do as a game producer,

269
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:10,225
if you're not familiar with the board game

270
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,447
process or how board games today get made, typically what happens is a game

271
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:18,630
designer will create a prototype and pitch it to a publisher.

272
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,771
It's a bit like an author.

273
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:27,316
submitting work to a publisher, looking, the author will write a manuscript, here the prototype will be fully playable,

274
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:33,941
it will have been tested, been found to be fun, it will even have some clean graphic design, probably maybe some clip art,

275
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:39,945
or some stock photos to help set the atmosphere of the game. But I won't have any of that artwork done yet.

276
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:43,948
They'll pitch it to a publisher, that will come in, and...

277
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:49,613
Someone at the publishing company will take on the role of game producer, which is continue

278
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:52,155
play testing, continue development.

279
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:56,099
On the board game side, we have a little bit different terminology for designer and development

280
00:14:56,099 --> 00:15:02,064
than you might find in the video game world, because a designer can, a game designer can

281
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:07,649
make a complete, fun, functioning game without any special programming skills, any of that.

282
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:10,532
So for development at a publishing house.

283
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,649
a bit like an editor in that book process.

284
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,190
So the author will write the book,

285
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,611
then they'll work with an editor to refine it.

286
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:20,353
And at that point, a developer is really

287
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:25,276
helping the designer refine the game, play test it.

288
00:15:25,276 --> 00:15:28,378
And then, of course, you're looking at artwork and layout.

289
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:31,520
So it'll commission the artist, commission a graphic designer

290
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,241
to kind of handle all that work and get it ready.

291
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:36,322
And so when the game producer's work is done,

292
00:15:36,322 --> 00:15:37,923
what you have is a product design

293
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:38,864
ready to go to the printer.

294
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:43,748
Usually a bunch of PDFs is the output of this process.

295
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:47,071
At each step of the way, you're continually checking for usability.

296
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:52,876
One of the biggest things I find in my work is a nice, clean prototype has very good graphic

297
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:53,657
design.

298
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:57,580
And when you start to add artwork and make it beautiful, that starts to interfere a little

299
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,601
bit with the usability.

300
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:01,043
And so there's a lot of work that has to be done.

301
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,145
I've got some examples of that that I'll cover as we go.

302
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:06,928
To dive in on some of the development, I'll start with

303
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:08,429
one of our games, World's Fair 1893.

304
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:12,089
This is the prototype that was pitched to me.

305
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:15,590
You can see there's some public domain paintings on

306
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,851
there, some tokens with icons from a site called

307
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:21,632
gameicons.net or the Noun Project.

308
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:24,432
Those are two popular places to find simple, clean icons.

309
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:27,113
And this was pitched to me.

310
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:29,433
I evaluated it, played it, and decided I

311
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:30,193
wanted to publish it.

312
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,772
One of the mechanisms that we changed in the game was the scoring.

313
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:39,798
So in the game there are five regions and it's, there's three rounds and you're going

314
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,180
to be trying to get the majority.

315
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:43,924
in an area, you want to have the most influence

316
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:44,865
in each of the areas.

317
00:16:44,865 --> 00:16:47,605
And at first, the areas all scored

318
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:49,285
with slightly different point values.

319
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:51,506
So here, this one, the one on the left

320
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:53,786
was five points for first, three points for second.

321
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:55,887
The other one was four points for first,

322
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:56,647
two points for second.

323
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:59,467
And one of the things that, the way that that tracked,

324
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:02,268
that scoring was tracked, was with

325
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:04,508
generic scoring tokens, variously denominated.

326
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:06,148
So there I think were one, three, and five.

327
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:07,409
So if you scored four points,

328
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,929
you'd take a one and a three point token.

329
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:16,530
There was a lot of back and forth making change. It was a bit too slow for that scoring round.

330
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:22,635
So we looked at adding a score track. We thought a game like Ticket to Ride has a scoring track and this is a similar weight.

331
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:28,320
But an important thing to know with Ticket to Ride is you're not scoring ten different things all at once in the middle of the game.

332
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,001
You're scoring...

333
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:30,902
Every time you build, you score.

334
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,642
And then at the end, there's a big scoring round.

335
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:35,243
So as we play tested this,

336
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:36,604
continued to do usability testing,

337
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:38,484
we found that in the scoring phases,

338
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:40,965
people would just start to check out a little bit.

339
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:42,866
And once one player starts to check out,

340
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:44,246
and everybody starts to check out,

341
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,767
then it takes longer to do the scoring.

342
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,268
And it makes it seem longer.

343
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,288
So the game was playing about 45 to 60 minutes.

344
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:51,309
People really enjoyed it,

345
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:53,670
but you could just tell watching them that.

346
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,622
we needed to keep them more engaged.

347
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:59,163
And so we looked at, and this was more trouble

348
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:00,784
than you might think to try to figure out

349
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,785
the best way to track the scoring.

350
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:04,526
So what we ended up doing was we changed

351
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:06,507
all of the regions to be worth four and two.

352
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:09,409
Then what we could do is just have a four point

353
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:12,250
first place token and a two point second place token.

354
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,211
It's much easier to just pass those out

355
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:16,713
than it is to count out who's blue,

356
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:18,854
let me count you four spaces on the scoring track.

357
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,616
Or even handout just varies to, oh, you need a three and a one.

358
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:22,057
Oh, you've got 10.

359
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,098
Let me make change.

360
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:26,320
So you can much more easily get through the scoring.

361
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,503
Around the game now plays in about 30 to 40 minutes.

362
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,327
And reviewers always talk about how great the game is for its

363
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:35,028
decisions versus the time.

364
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:36,850
And reviewers will always mention that.

365
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,951
They'll be like, man, for a 30 minute game, this has a lot

366
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,552
of decisions.

367
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,314
And we found in play testing that at 45 to 60 minutes, it

368
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:44,216
just wasn't quite delivering the

369
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:45,377
satisfaction that we wanted.

370
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,511
Another example of a fun component is from a game called Camel Up.

371
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:54,831
If you've ever played this game, it's hilarious.

372
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:57,432
You're watching a camel race.

373
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:59,352
You're betting on this camel race.

374
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:03,813
And the way the camels move is there's one die matching each color of the camel, and

375
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:05,914
they can move one, two, or three spaces each round.

376
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:08,294
Each camel will move one space.

377
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:12,955
Now to roll the dice, they have this pretty crazy pyramid contraption.

378
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:16,316
It comes in the box, has a piece of cardboard, you fold it up, wrap a rubber band around

379
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:16,356
it.

380
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:19,057
and it's got this little trigger.

381
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,578
So to roll a die, you flip it face up,

382
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,558
you push in the lever, pull it back,

383
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:25,899
one die falls out, and then you lift it up

384
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:29,160
and you reveal, oh, the white camel moves one space.

385
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,441
Now I hear a lot of people all the time say,

386
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:31,741
well, that's ridiculous, you didn't need

387
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:34,382
this crazy pyramid, right?

388
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,063
And that could be true, you could just put the dice

389
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:39,944
in a bag and pull them out, pull one out and then roll it.

390
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:41,825
But what's interesting there is that

391
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:42,925
when you're rooting for a camel,

392
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:44,346
you're like, I really need that blue camel

393
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:45,946
to move two or three spaces.

394
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:49,478
If they drew out a white die, you'd be like, oh, I don't care

395
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,219
about the number on the white die.

396
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:52,559
So you check out.

397
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,621
This way you reveal the color and the number at the same

398
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:59,482
time, keeps everyone engaged until it's revealed.

399
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:01,883
There's no partial revealing of information.

400
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:05,084
Again, silly, nice little touch, but it does, it keeps

401
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:06,524
the color and the number hidden until

402
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:07,545
the exact same moment.

403
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:13,669
One of the things in tabletop that we often do as publishers is re-theme games.

404
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:15,872
I don't know how common that is in the video game.

405
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:19,357
My understanding is that by the time you get into designing and

406
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:21,781
developing, you're pretty much committed to your theme.

407
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:25,506
But with tabletop games, the mechanics are abstract enough.

408
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:29,229
There's a lot that we have to abstract away.

409
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:33,733
You know, you play a card and that counts as building a resource or building a building.

410
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,357
And so publishers will at times re-theme games.

411
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:40,580
This is one of our games that I've re-themed.

412
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,842
It was pitched to us as a flower-themed game.

413
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:46,485
So you were planting flowers, harvesting flowers, and making bouquets.

414
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:49,647
Nothing wrong with flower themed games, there have been some that have done quite well,

415
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:51,607
but it wasn't particularly interesting to me.

416
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:55,129
But when I read the rules, I was really fascinated by the mechanics.

417
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,050
And the way the game works is you place a tile,

418
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,372
and there's four colors all on the different sides,

419
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:04,493
and whichever way you place it,

420
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:09,015
Everybody at the table will get a resource matching the color that's facing them

421
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:14,239
And I thought that sounded fascinating and wanted to play it. I played it loved it

422
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:19,482
But wanted to look at rechanging the theme so I made this theme list prototype

423
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:26,267
I use the paint shop or the photoshop paint bucket tool to color out all the flowers and just make a solid color

424
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:27,428
abstract version and

425
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:32,311
listen to what players, as they played, what they said about the game.

426
00:21:32,311 --> 00:21:35,173
So, the mechanics would give them these feelings,

427
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:37,955
simple and elegant, it's calming, it's delightful,

428
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:40,196
relaxing to play, and flowing.

429
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:41,617
And I sat back and thought,

430
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:45,679
what theme has all of those same attributes?

431
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,441
Now, the mechanics in your game will produce an atmosphere,

432
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:53,204
will produce a feeling independent of the theme.

433
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:56,226
And a lot of times people will feel a dissonance between the theme.

434
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:56,666
If you have a...

435
00:21:57,006 --> 00:22:01,493
cute theme but a heavy aggressive mechanics, players will just not quite feel right.

436
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:05,398
So what I wanted to do with this was give it a theme that matched the feelings of the

437
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:06,560
mechanics.

438
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,447
At the time I was talking to a number of other parents about why the movie Frozen had done

439
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:13,350
so well compared to the movie Tangled.

440
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,241
and I had, ah, that scene entangled with the lanterns

441
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:17,701
in the water.

442
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:21,262
I was like, that perfectly captures all of those feelings

443
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:23,043
that the mechanics capture.

444
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:25,423
And so we spent a good amount of time

445
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:28,925
working on re-theming that game to Lanterns the Harvest

446
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:29,405
Festival.

447
00:22:29,405 --> 00:22:31,605
This is probably our most popular game right now.

448
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:33,906
It was nominated for the, it was a finalist

449
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:37,347
in the South by Southwest Tabletop Game of the Year

450
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:37,787
a few years ago.

451
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:42,689
And we started working on the artwork for the game.

452
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:46,827
As you can see, I kept some flowers in there as a nice homage to the original theme.

453
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:52,530
This is one of the, the artwork for this is one of those times where you're looking at

454
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:58,732
the prototype was really usable, just solid colors, but you want to try to then add artwork

455
00:22:58,732 --> 00:22:59,653
and make it beautiful.

456
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,920
How do you still make it usable?

457
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,442
So I worked with the artist here, Beth Sobel.

458
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:08,245
She did a great job of sort of making sure that the design,

459
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:11,427
the layout, would still be able to communicate to players

460
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:15,711
what the gameplay was, which colors were on the sides.

461
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:18,453
She made the different lanterns a different shape to help

462
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:20,835
with colorblind friendliness and also just looking at it

463
00:23:20,835 --> 00:23:21,996
across the table.

464
00:23:21,996 --> 00:23:25,238
And they all have different arrangements as well.

465
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,122
You get a bonus in lanterns if you match two tiles of the same color side by side.

466
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:33,964
So she even made, if you do match them, they sort of complete a pattern.

467
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:39,128
If it's a white and a purple, it won't quite make the same nice symmetrical pattern as

468
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:41,029
the white ones do when you match them together.

469
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:44,412
I mentioned our most recent game, Spy Club.

470
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:47,734
This is a game where you're playing neighborhood detective

471
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,295
solving neighborhood mysteries.

472
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:53,417
And the prototype here was very simple, very clean.

473
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:56,399
Someone who has done graphic design for me

474
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:57,359
designed the game.

475
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,680
So of course, the graphic design of the prototype was

476
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,942
very clean, very solid colors.

477
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,162
So you're looking across the table.

478
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:05,584
What you're trying to do is get five yellow cards into the

479
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:08,405
center to solve the object, five blue ones to solve the

480
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:08,665
crime.

481
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:13,774
And you can look across the table and see what colors everybody else has.

482
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:18,421
We worried very much about when we add artwork, how easy is it going to be to tell?

483
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:20,435
that they go together.

484
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:23,416
So we worked with an artist and tried to figure out a way

485
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:26,277
to make all of the objects look yellow,

486
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:28,578
even though not with like a mask

487
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,699
or something to make them look washed out.

488
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:32,459
Before we commissioned all the artwork,

489
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:35,461
we wanted to see if something like this was possible.

490
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:39,442
Could we get photos that were sort of yellowish

491
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:40,783
and see if they would work together?

492
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:44,464
So what I did was I found a mobile wallpaper pack.

493
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:45,365
Mobile wallpapers are

494
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:49,886
more or less the same size as playing cards, at least the same shape.

495
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:52,007
And so I created a prototype like this.

496
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:54,187
You can see the flashlight, the stamp, and the lipstick.

497
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:58,608
They, of course, don't look anything like that, but those cards were all yellowish.

498
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:02,029
And for the motives, I got cards that all were kind of reddish.

499
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:02,690
The blue...

500
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,037
got cards that were all kind of bluish.

501
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:06,817
And then we played this.

502
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:08,458
Of course, I didn't play this with outside playtesters,

503
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:09,938
it was only internal team members,

504
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:11,659
because that's a little jarring

505
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,940
when you have a prank card and it's a mountain landscape.

506
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,261
But we played with this a number of times to just see,

507
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:20,543
before we commissioned thousands of dollars worth of artwork,

508
00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:22,524
if the photos, which were different,

509
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:24,345
but were still kind of bluish,

510
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:25,765
if they would be able to be played

511
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:27,146
and seen across the table.

512
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:30,388
So in the end, this is what the artwork looks like.

513
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:33,049
So you can see the objects are all yellowish,

514
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:36,211
the crimes are all bluish, the motives are all reddish.

515
00:25:36,211 --> 00:25:37,512
And it's worked really well.

516
00:25:37,512 --> 00:25:40,193
He did a great job making them all look natural.

517
00:25:40,193 --> 00:25:42,574
Kind of the only comment we had is,

518
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,116
why do all the people wear purple clothes in this town?

519
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:47,577
Because the suspects are purple.

520
00:25:47,577 --> 00:25:50,859
So that's always a challenge for us

521
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,280
in just about every one of our games

522
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,622
is trying to make the art just as playable as the,

523
00:25:56,976 --> 00:26:01,099
as the prototype and sometimes we have to get pretty creative with that.

524
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:05,415
We're about out of time, so just to wrap up, I want to remind you of the five elements

525
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:10,577
of usability. Learnability, how easy is it for people to learn for the first time? Memorability,

526
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:14,778
how easy is it for people to remember once they've already learned it? Efficiency, how

527
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:20,080
quickly can they perform the tasks once they know them? Accuracy, how likely or unlikely

528
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,242
are they to make mistakes with errors? There's a lot to be said about rule books in there.

529
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:28,423
I wish if I had another half hour we could talk about rule books and accuracy.

530
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:35,657
and then satisfaction. How do people enjoy the game? I want to leave you with a few tips

531
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:40,683
as you're testing. So when you go into a play test, have very specific things that you're

532
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:45,709
testing. You know, I mentioned we tested these weird photo versions of the Spy Club artwork.

533
00:26:47,217 --> 00:26:51,279
There will be things that come up, of course, that you can't anticipate, and that's also a big part of testing.

534
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,420
So write down, every time a player makes an error, every time they ask a question.

535
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,841
It's really easy when someone says, how much does this cost again?

536
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:00,202
To just say, oh, three wood, and move on.

537
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,442
But write that down.

538
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:05,143
And if you start to see the same questions over and over, say, why do people always ask this?

539
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:08,325
Is there something we can do to make them not ask it?

540
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:09,185
Is it not intuitive?

541
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:12,726
Is it not obvious that a city would be three ore and two wheat?

542
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:14,147
Will a reference card solve it?

543
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:18,992
Is there something we need to do to make it more thematic, more memorable?

544
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:22,919
If you're a game designer, I highly recommend you watch people play other games.

545
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,125
When you play Tess, you're going to be watching people play your game a lot.

546
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:29,350
But if you've never just sat and watched people play other games,

547
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,990
you won't quite know what you're observing.

548
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,290
You know, you ask people, did you like the game?

549
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,111
They say yes.

550
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,771
You could say, well, we're done then.

551
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:38,852
But if you've watched people play games that they love,

552
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:41,432
you'll know if they're responding to your game

553
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:43,092
like they respond to those games.

554
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:46,553
It can feel a little weird and creepy to watch people play games, of course.

555
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:48,333
Conventions are a great place to do it.

556
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,014
If somebody's started a game, just walk up and say,

557
00:27:50,014 --> 00:27:51,034
hey, I've been wanting to learn this.

558
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:53,434
Can I watch you play for a little while and see if I can learn it?

559
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:54,275
And then that's not creepy.

560
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:00,697
And also I'd recommend you study interfaces in other games.

561
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:03,620
So look at the graphic design in other games.

562
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,042
Look at the way they use score tracks, tokens, coins,

563
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,223
all these things.

564
00:28:07,223 --> 00:28:10,005
This one can be really tricky.

565
00:28:10,005 --> 00:28:12,126
As I was preparing for this, I saw an article

566
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:15,429
that criticized Dominion for putting the costs

567
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,591
in the bottom left instead of the top left

568
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:19,853
like other games, like Seven Wonders,

569
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:21,734
or like Magic, which is in the top right.

570
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,797
But of course, those are in very different contexts.

571
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:27,158
Again, in Dominion, the card is already on the table.

572
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:30,921
and you can see it, it's not in your hand at this time.

573
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:33,203
Again, we looked at World's Fair and a score track,

574
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:35,144
we said, well, other games use a score track,

575
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:36,385
but again, that was a different context.

576
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:40,529
So I do recommend that you study all these games,

577
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,290
other interfaces in games, but be careful

578
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,452
that your situation might be a little different

579
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:46,974
and be very careful to pay attention to those nuances.

580
00:28:48,464 --> 00:28:49,285
That's all I have for now.

581
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:52,169
We have time for probably one question, if there is one.

582
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:55,493
I'll be in the overflow room for more questions after this.

583
00:28:55,493 --> 00:28:58,758
So if anybody has one now, or if we want to just wait till

584
00:28:58,758 --> 00:28:59,799
the overflow, that's fine.
