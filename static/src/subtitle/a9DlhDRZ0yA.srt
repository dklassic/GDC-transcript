1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:11,643
Good evening! Welcome back to the lovely Civic Auditorium for the highlight of the 1999 Game Developers Conference.

2
00:00:12,904 --> 00:00:20,067
I'd like to ask you all to please turn off all your cell phones, pagers, anything digital right now.

3
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:26,290
This is going to be a special event, we'd like to have it be uninterrupted.

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,172
There's one! He's out! Go get him, yellow shirts!

5
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:31,716
No, just kidding.

6
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:33,177
But please, if you can turn that on and off.

7
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:35,339
And also, no laser pointers, please.

8
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,380
That's disruptive.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:36,781
Thank you.

10
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:41,825
This is really an historic moment for the Game Developers

11
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:43,747
Conference and for the community that it serves.

12
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:48,031
Four years ago, when Miller Freeman began working with

13
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,914
this event, we asked our conference advisory board,

14
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:53,816
what would the dream conference look like?

15
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:57,460
What would be the pinnacle of success for this event?

16
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:02,510
The answer, as voiced by one Ernest Adams, came in two

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,571
simple words, Shigeru Miyamoto.

18
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:17,157
Well, much has happened since then.

19
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:20,379
We've had four wonderful years, literally hundreds of

20
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,041
inspiring speakers, many great parties, and wonderful

21
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:25,981
connections have been made.

22
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,291
But this year, our dream of four years has come to fruition.

23
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:34,274
There is no greater validation of this community and this

24
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:37,776
event than the presence of the world master of game design.

25
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:42,119
I'm going to ask you all to help me answer the question

26
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:44,701
that's going to be bugging me as soon as this event is over,

27
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:47,563
which is, what are we going to do next year?

28
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,900
But focusing on the present for now, there's a number of people I'd like to thank.

29
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:59,843
Most importantly, Jim Merrick and Perrin Kaplan and many others at Nintendo for making the

30
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:02,225
case for the company's support of this event.

31
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,772
There's also many people on the Miller Freeman staff, including Alan Yu, our intrepid and

32
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:18,233
incredible program manager.

33
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:21,759
Go Allen!

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,161
Gabe Zickerman, Greg Kerwin, Kathy Schoback,

35
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:29,221
there are many, many others who've contributed to this.

36
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,782
I'd like to thank them all.

37
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:32,582
And particularly,

38
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:38,184
particularly, of course, to Mr. Miyamoto himself

39
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,005
for sharing his wisdom with us today.

40
00:02:50,357 --> 00:02:55,021
So I'd like to introduce to you the man who is responsible for third-party relations at Nintendo

41
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,103
and largely responsible for this event tonight.

42
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,926
Please join me in a warm welcome for Mr. Jim Merrick.

43
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:10,653
Thank you, Jennifer.

44
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:15,237
On behalf of Nintendo, I would like to thank and congratulate

45
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:18,039
the Game Developers Conference for another great conference.

46
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:29,899
Nintendo is fortunate to have one of the video game industry's greatest designers on staff.

47
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,281
A man whose legacy goes back to the very roots of this industry.

48
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:39,443
And yet, he is still, indisputably, on top of his game today.

49
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:44,865
Shigeru Miyamoto has turned many of our fantasies into realities.

50
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,626
Mario taught us determination.

51
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:50,067
Donkey Kong made us laugh.

52
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:54,529
And Link has touched our hearts and challenged our minds.

53
00:03:55,404 --> 00:04:01,685
Miyamoto has, in so many ways, shaped the industry that has brought us all together here today.

54
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:14,108
Let's take a moment to look at a little videotape that gives some background on this remarkable man.

55
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,809
At 24, he became the very first staff artist at Nintendo.

56
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:22,730
Here, he began the journey that would help create a whole new world of entertainment.

57
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:28,898
and build a flourishing industry that would rival the annual sales of the feature film business.

58
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:34,339
His work with his team at Nintendo has resulted in more than 60 game masterpieces

59
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:40,360
that have sold over 250 million game cartridges to passionate players around the world.

60
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:45,362
It was in video game arcades that the first memorable characters came to life.

61
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:57,535
In 1983, Nintendo introduced the Famicom in Japan,

62
00:04:57,835 --> 00:05:01,959
which soon became known as the Nintendo Entertainment System throughout the world.

63
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,245
This benchmark system brought the video game experience and Mario into millions of homes everywhere.

64
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:25,869
With the Zelda series, players were introduced to an enormous world of adventure

65
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,411
that provided hours of involving play.

66
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:42,160
In 1991, Nintendo introduced the Super Famicom and Super NES,

67
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,382
and Shigeru Miyamoto acquired a new set of tools.

68
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,984
His unforgettable characters now moved with the power of 16-bits.

69
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:09,708
The next evolution of Zelda immerse players even deeper into the classic legend.

70
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:31,095
Super Mario Kart combine Miyamoto's beloved characters with a finesse and interactivity

71
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:34,216
and two-player action not yet seen in racing games.

72
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:55,594
The Star Fox game brought to life wonderful new characters in a polygon-based 3D world

73
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:59,115
that used the Super FX chip to push the limits of 16-bit.

74
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:14,548
In 1996, Nintendo shook the video game world with the breakthrough N64.

75
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:21,477
Miyamoto's creativity now had free reign, and an exhilarating new era in interactive entertainment was born.

76
00:07:22,177 --> 00:07:25,802
N64's flagship game has been called his masterpiece.

77
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:27,304
It's-a me, Mario!

78
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:48,210
With N64, the Star Fox characters were given voices and a cinematic real-time 3D environment.

79
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:19,984
1998. Once again, Shigeru Miyamoto leads the way, redefining what a video game can be.

80
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:54,701
Shigeru Miyamoto, creator, teacher, visionary, leader.

81
00:08:55,803 --> 00:09:00,508
He rides his bicycle to work and plays bluegrass banjo.

82
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:04,352
He's as original and inventive as the games he creates.

83
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:10,599
His work with Nintendo will continue to blaze the trail in interactive entertainment.

84
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:18,204
Together they will inspire and delight, and keep the child within all of us alive.

85
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,909
People always ask, what is next from Miyamoto?

86
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:27,511
And to help answer that question, here is one of his newest personas,

87
00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:30,834
bound to compete with the likes and looks of Lara Croft.

88
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:49,654
Uh-oh.

89
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:04,819
It is my distinct honor and pleasure to introduce to you the first inductee to the Academy of

90
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,739
Interactive Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame.

91
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:11,280
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming, all the way from Japan, Mr. Shigeru Miyamoto.

92
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:22,671
Thank you.

93
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:32,478
Thank you very much.

94
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:44,987
Thank you.

95
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,902
I'm very honored. Thank you very much.

96
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:53,942
Good evening.

97
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:58,583
Thank you very much for your warm welcome.

98
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:01,524
I'm very happy to be here.

99
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:08,886
The video game industry has been through many crises,

100
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:14,288
has continued on as a strong and growing business.

101
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:18,669
Thanks to that, I'm still making games.

102
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:23,249
And I get to speak to you about them today.

103
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:29,810
I owe a lot to a number of people who have been involved

104
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,211
in this business.

105
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:37,612
And also to the newcomer in this industry who have been

106
00:11:37,652 --> 00:11:43,394
grown up playing Nintendo games and continue to buy

107
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,154
them today.

108
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:52,785
Making use of this opportunity, I'd like to speak about my own

109
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:57,367
experience in the past 20 years.

110
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:07,311
If what I tell you today can help games to consistently be

111
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:11,372
fun to play, it would make me happy.

112
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:16,414
In fact, I like making games so much.

113
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,570
that would like to do it for free.

114
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:23,152
But,

115
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,696
don't tell Mr. Yamauchi that.

116
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:39,700
And now, I hope you will do me a big favor

117
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,761
and allow me to speak in Japanese.

118
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:44,862
My friend.

119
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:52,751
My friend Bill Trinen will translate for me.

120
00:12:54,172 --> 00:13:02,119
Bill.

121
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,343
Thank you.

122
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,725
Today there are three main subjects

123
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,006
that I'd like to speak to you about.

124
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:12,668
One is about the history of game design.

125
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:15,931
I'd like to talk about the way I see game designers.

126
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:24,310
First, I'd like to take a look back at the history of game design and tell you about my ideas about what a game designer should be.

127
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:34,534
Second, I'd like to talk about some of the concepts behind the development of The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time.

128
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:39,757
And finally, I'd like to share with you my ideas about the future of game design.

129
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,468
Until the time of Donkey Kong, which was the first game that I directed,

130
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:55,730
programmers and engineers were responsible for game design.

131
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,351
In most cases, the music and the art were written by those people.

132
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:19,491
Those were the days when these engineers were even composing the music and drawing the pictures themselves.

133
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:21,973
They were terrible, weren't they?

134
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:35,384
When I designed Donkey Kong, I said that I was the best artist in the world.

135
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:43,786
When I, as an artist, first became involved in game design,

136
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:51,913
I boasted to myself that I was one of the five best designers in the world.

137
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:56,056
The reason for this is that there were very few artists involved in game design at that time.

138
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,463
With games like Donkey Kong, we saw the birth of a new trend in game design.

139
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:13,025
For the first time, we saw stories accompanying the games.

140
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:20,710
And writing the stories and drawing the pictures became the work of game designers.

141
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:24,793
And writing the stories and drawing the pictures became the work of game designers.

142
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:27,735
And this period lasted for almost ten years.

143
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,510
This trend continued for about 10 years.

144
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:43,158
And we saw many artists entering the industry as game designers,

145
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:46,620
and we also saw not a few music composers joining us as well.

146
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,284
And then, especially in Japan, with the success of Dragon Warriors and Legend of Zelda,

147
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:54,405
the era of scenario writers started.

148
00:15:57,852 --> 00:16:02,734
Then, due particularly to the success of Dragon Warrior and The Legend of Zelda in Japan,

149
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:07,315
there emerged a new trend in which scenario writers took a leading role in game design.

150
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:12,517
At that time, I started to get a lot of people who had such rich scenarios,

151
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:16,519
and a lot of people who wanted to make money by combining famous novelists and musicians.

152
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,232
It was at this time that I was inundated with designers-to-be,

153
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:28,334
bringing me their really thick scenarios, hoping to get a game whipped out.

154
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:32,777
We also saw a number of famous authors working together with music composers,

155
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:35,078
hoping to get a game out just for the sake of business.

156
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:37,919
Let us look back once again.

157
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:39,280
Another change was the way we played the game.

158
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,103
In the days since I have joined the industry, we have seen a qualitative change in the nature of gameplay.

159
00:16:53,123 --> 00:17:00,370
With arcade games, our objective was to see how many quarters we could get the users to drop into a machine at the arcade.

160
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:14,170
And while I was making the Donkey Kong series,

161
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:19,016
a game that was a bit different from that came along.

162
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:24,042
It was with this objective in mind that I created the Donkey Kong series,

163
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:28,987
and yet at the same time, we saw a new style of game emerge that contradicted this model.

164
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:34,111
One is to play a game of Q-inning like a baseball game.

165
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:34,891
You pay 25 cents per inning.

166
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:39,295
This is a very expensive game for the players.

167
00:17:39,315 --> 00:17:42,697
But if you play a game of Q-inning for 25 cents,

168
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:44,859
the store will not sell well if you play slowly.

169
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,685
One example is a baseball game in which you must play nine full innings in order to complete a game.

170
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,487
But at one quarter an inning, it's too expensive.

171
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:04,052
Whereas from the view of the arcade operator, players can play one inning much longer on the same quarter

172
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:06,435
than they could on, say, another game like Mario Brothers.

173
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:12,680
And another example is like Mario Brothers, where you play by making your opponent a Game Over.

174
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,383
And the more you get good at it, the shorter the playtime becomes.

175
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:24,641
Another example is our own Mario Brothers, where two players compete.

176
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:28,265
But with this game, the better you get, the shorter your playtime was.

177
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:32,448
It was these types of concepts that users simply could not accept.

178
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:45,629
It was at this time that I became involved in the development of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

179
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,651
This offered us an environment outside of the arcade for which to make games for.

180
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:52,533
We wanted to make a game with two controllers,

181
00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:54,053
rather than one expensive controller.

182
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:16,170
With cost in mind, we put a higher priority on two simple handheld controllers

183
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:18,392
rather than one ultra-functional controller,

184
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:21,215
opening the doors to games like baseball and Mario Brothers.

185
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:26,859
With NES, the business of selling gameplay time transformed completely and evolved

186
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,641
into the business of simply selling playtime.

187
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:45,110
There are many changes in the game, but I have maintained the same style of game design.

188
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,372
I am not a game designer, but when I make a game, I always include the same style in my game design.

189
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:08,615
Although I am not an engineer, I have always included in my designs

190
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:12,197
consideration for the technology that will make those designs a reality.

191
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:18,819
I have been praised for being a genius storyteller,

192
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,600
a genius animator, and so on.

193
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:27,302
People have paid me a lot of lip service, calling me a genius storyteller

194
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:28,822
or a talented animator.

195
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:43,016
They have even gone so far as to suggest that I try and make movies, because the work that I do now is already similar to movie making.

196
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,138
But I feel that I am not really a movie maker.

197
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:02,757
but rather that my strength lies in my pioneering spirit to make use of technology

198
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:05,960
to create the best interactive commodities possible

199
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,604
and use that interactivity to give users a game that they can enjoy and play comfortably.

200
00:21:10,624 --> 00:21:16,949
I feel that I've been very lucky to be a game designer since the dawn of the industry.

201
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:33,046
I'm not an engineer, but I've had the opportunity to learn the principles of game design from scratch, slowly, over a long period of time.

202
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:39,128
I've had the opportunity to learn the principles of game design from scratch, slowly, over a long period of time.

203
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:52,579
And because I am always trying to remain at the forefront,

204
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,501
I have grown accustomed to first creating the very tools

205
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,582
necessary for game design from scratch.

206
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:03,065
I have seen both the evolution of new hardware

207
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,606
in the advent of hit software titles.

208
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,384
But I have seen that not all the ideas for new hardware

209
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:33,252
come from hardware technologists and hardware professionals and engineers.

210
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:38,676
And I've seen more than a few examples in which the idea for a hit title

211
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:42,718
have popped out from the simple hint in a conversation with an ordinary person.

212
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,222
So, let me talk a little bit about the current game design.

213
00:22:56,163 --> 00:23:11,370
Next, I'd like to talk about something that game designers may or may not want to hear, but here we go.

214
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:18,354
Recently, I personally have encountered many instances in which we hit a brick wall in development, and we just can't quite finish the game.

215
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:21,635
I'm sure some of you have experienced this as well.

216
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:29,604
I think maybe perhaps some of you out there have maybe been in the same boat.

217
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:36,208
There may have even been some people who realized they had no choice but to actually release

218
00:23:36,268 --> 00:23:39,130
a game that wasn't totally complete, much to your own mortification.

219
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:56,558
The reason for this is that each case has different problems,

220
00:23:56,898 --> 00:24:00,602
but in most cases, the game designer and producer

221
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:02,724
don't understand the technology well,

222
00:24:02,784 --> 00:24:05,367
and then they make a plan,

223
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:08,069
and then the case is often seen as not being completed.

224
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:14,067
I'm sure that each case has its own unique cause.

225
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:18,030
But I know that oftentimes, when game designers and producers

226
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,152
make their plans without a sufficient grasp

227
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:23,435
of the technology and engineering necessary to make their game,

228
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:24,776
they will often fail.

229
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,738
Also, I think we may have all had experiences where

230
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:29,440
no matter how hard we try and work on a game,

231
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,141
it just, in the end, isn't that much fun.

232
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:50,238
Recently, the most common is that the interesting parts of the game are new technology,

233
00:24:50,698 --> 00:25:01,463
gorgeous images, and the degree of completion of the image and the degree of completion of the technology is the neck of the project.

234
00:25:01,863 --> 00:25:07,786
In this case, it is impossible to confirm whether the designer is interesting or not until the game is completely completed.

235
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:14,553
Recently, when new technology and exquisite graphics are regarded as the core of a game's element of fun,

236
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:18,115
it becomes difficult to evaluate a game before launch,

237
00:25:18,655 --> 00:25:23,217
because those fun aspects of it can only be judged after it has reached a certain degree of completion.

238
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:27,779
Of course, even if you ask me how long it will take to make something interesting,

239
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:32,641
I can't say for sure until the game design is completely finished.

240
00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:38,674
In these cases, the answer to the question of how many more months of tinkering

241
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:40,655
will produce a truly enjoyable game

242
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,396
depends upon a variety of new emerging technologies.

243
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:49,737
That is because the complexity of the game depends on the level of perfection of each technology.

244
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:54,579
Until the technology is complete, game designers are unable to evaluate how the game will be.

245
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:09,345
Now, in my understanding, in these cases, game designers are solely to blame. But on the other hand, since there has been no concrete definition of what a game designer's job entails, I cannot say that it really is the fault of the designers.

246
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,011
As I mentioned earlier, in the history of video games,

247
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:29,291
at one point, there were designers and artists.

248
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:32,793
And the designers didn't know much about technology.

249
00:26:32,913 --> 00:26:36,334
And the artists didn't know much about sound and video.

250
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,195
And in the next era,

251
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:43,196
there were scenario writers who created a lot of things,

252
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:45,937
but they didn't know much about technology.

253
00:26:45,998 --> 00:26:46,958
And that's what happened.

254
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,911
As I mentioned earlier in the history of game development,

255
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:58,912
there was a time when designers were engineers

256
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,854
who were less capable of composing and creating exquisite graphics.

257
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:04,995
Then we had designers who were painters,

258
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:07,336
but who could not understand the technology behind the games.

259
00:27:08,137 --> 00:27:09,918
They didn't know what they could and could not do.

260
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,719
How were they to express their ideas

261
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:15,761
so that they could be understood by programmers and realized by the CPU?

262
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:18,502
Later we saw scenario writers take the lead,

263
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:21,504
but they too had a low level of understanding of the technology involved.

264
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:26,888
And I became a game designer, just like a screenwriter, but I didn't know much about technology.

265
00:27:26,948 --> 00:27:36,517
As I mentioned earlier, I was lucky enough to be involved in games since my early years, so I learned a lot about technology.

266
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:40,200
I think I've been a game designer by combining what I've learned and my own image.

267
00:27:49,374 --> 00:27:52,517
Fortunately, because I've been a part of the industry since its dawn,

268
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:55,599
I've at last come to the conclusion that the role of a game designer

269
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,041
is to design a complete game system

270
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:02,105
by first comprehending the technologies that will enable and realize that system.

271
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,788
I believe that one of the jobs of the designer is design itself.

272
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:08,711
I believe that one of the jobs of the designer is design itself.

273
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:19,257
How will the ideas that I have in my mind be reproduced by the computer?

274
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:24,000
How can the power of the CPU be best allotted in order for the computer to convey those ideas to the user?

275
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:47,463
And in order for the player to always discover new fun and new fun,

276
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:53,107
they have to mix their own expression, composition, and latest technology

277
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:55,468
and create within a limited framework.

278
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:56,549
This is the design.

279
00:29:00,576 --> 00:29:03,738
How can I bring my own constructions and expression of ideas together

280
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:06,940
with the technology that creates that new level of enjoyment

281
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,522
within the hardware and budget limitations placed upon me?

282
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,944
This is what I mean by design.

283
00:29:11,964 --> 00:29:15,787
I consider games to be entertainment commodities

284
00:29:15,827 --> 00:29:18,669
and therefore I place great importance upon user reaction.

285
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:29,683
I realize that I am one of the users being monitored when I play a new game for the first time.

286
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:58,847
While we have this long process of development, we also have at the end when a variety of different ideas and opinions will appear.

287
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:03,611
It is important to design the whole game creation process,

288
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:08,715
so that users' needs will be reflected effectively and quickly in this last stage.

289
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:12,638
And this is why game directors must be deeply involved in the design process.

290
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:23,139
Mario's jump height is lowered by a few dots.

291
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:24,520
This can be fixed in a few minutes,

292
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,001
but the game becomes completely different.

293
00:30:27,362 --> 00:30:29,903
This is the interesting part of video games.

294
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,665
I think another aspect of video games that is very interesting

295
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:38,167
is, say for instance, trying to shorten the height of Mario's jump by just a few dots.

296
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:41,269
Now this is something that can be done very quickly and easily,

297
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:44,230
and yet it could affect the whole entire appearance of the game.

298
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:51,301
I think you can see that it is important for game designers to be deeply involved in the design process.

299
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:07,814
In Nintendo, game designers always do technical training.

300
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:14,079
We train graphic designers to understand ROM maps, memory maps, RAM maps,

301
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,382
and to make games while understanding them.

302
00:31:18,163 --> 00:31:22,206
Accordingly, at Nintendo, all designers must undergo technical training.

303
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:27,010
Graphic designers make games by comprehending the ROM and RAM memory maps.

304
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:36,517
I think the trend of what kind of game design experts will make the game will change.

305
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:40,079
But I think this training is necessary to continue game design.

306
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,641
Which specialists are taking the lead in game design depends upon the trends of the day.

307
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:50,463
But this technical training is a basic requisite in continued success in game design.

308
00:31:50,483 --> 00:31:53,645
Let me give you a concrete example.

309
00:31:53,665 --> 00:31:56,026
Let me offer you some basic examples.

310
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:12,186
In the case of an action game, for example, a designer will provide a specification like this to the programmer.

311
00:32:13,406 --> 00:32:17,528
The enemy will randomly search the actions of the player character.

312
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:24,572
It sounds like a very common way to search, but you can't set up a program like this.

313
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:30,960
Of course, randomly search sounds like it's an authentic specification.

314
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,781
But the programmer can't put something like this into code.

315
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:40,602
And later on in the game, the designer is not going to know where to begin tinkering

316
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:43,883
to try and get that game back towards its original concept.

317
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:57,057
What if the following specification was presented?

318
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:18,230
The enemy shall change course based on character movement once every 30 game frames.

319
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:23,654
And one in three times, it will randomly select a direction to progress in.

320
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:27,916
It's much easier to make a programmer than before.

321
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:32,379
And when it doesn't work, the game designer himself knows where to fix.

322
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:39,570
This second example should be more easily programmed

323
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,170
than the first.

324
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,072
And later on, when problems appear,

325
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:44,053
we have an idea of where to begin modifying it.

326
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,940
In the best case scenario, you may

327
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,561
be teamed up with talented programmers

328
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:57,382
who can go ahead and do this kind of thing on their own.

329
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:02,465
And even when they do it, it's still fun.

330
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:11,510
In those instances, who knows? Maybe I won't even be needed.

331
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:20,418
No, but honestly speaking, I've been very fortunate to be teamed

332
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,939
up with some very excellent programmers.

333
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:36,842
The next necessary element of design

334
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:38,823
is skillful management of the memory map

335
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:41,503
and accurate estimation of processing speed.

336
00:34:41,523 --> 00:34:44,444
As I'm sure many of you know, when

337
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:46,304
we make games for consumer console machines,

338
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:48,805
it is important to take into account

339
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:52,685
the limited ability of the console, the processing speed,

340
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:53,565
and the transfer rate.

341
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,774
player, or people who have strong skills,

342
00:35:08,294 --> 00:35:11,258
people who are that sort of producers,

343
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,901
when I show these samples to players in virtual world,

344
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:17,166
they would truly believe the samples are made up of all elements.

345
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:26,923
And of course, players, and even company management and producers

346
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:29,544
who do not have a very deep technical grounding,

347
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:32,405
make the mistake of thinking that the world that we have created

348
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:37,206
in the game is the same as the natural world.

349
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:43,168
This is a matter of course.

350
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:45,369
For example, when people are running,

351
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:47,970
they think that if there is a slope, they can climb it.

352
00:35:49,907 --> 00:35:51,788
If a car is driving in front of you, you might think that you might hit a car.

353
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:57,451
It's natural that the tires are spinning, and it's strange that the tires are spinning even after the car has stopped.

354
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,203
And when the car is moving, of course the wheels should be spinning.

355
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:20,445
But if the wheels are spinning when it's stopped, well, something's wrong.

356
00:36:21,366 --> 00:36:24,028
We're the ones who make all of this.

357
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:28,371
And they don't understand that.

358
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:32,474
But what these users and even company management may not understand

359
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:38,206
is that these so-called laws of nature is something that we've created in this virtual world.

360
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:41,228
And as we get into the later stages of development,

361
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:43,349
we often hear complaints about...

362
00:36:58,358 --> 00:36:59,878
Why do I have to wait so long here?

363
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:01,919
What's with this processing speed?

364
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,919
And why is this taking so long?

365
00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:07,240
But at that point in time, at that stage in development,

366
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,660
we can't fix it.

367
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,822
Before we could make a sound for the NES,

368
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:29,825
we used the sound of the old games to check the processing time.

369
00:37:53,311 --> 00:38:02,275
And I recall back in the day when I was playing Super Mario Bros. with the background music

370
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:04,316
of Excitebike.

371
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:16,521
And Mario's jump did not have its characteristic boing, but instead it had the rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

372
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:17,201
of Excitebike.

373
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:26,802
But this kind of consideration is necessary for taking the interface into account in order

374
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:32,206
for us to focus our attention on those areas of the games that we would like to put our

375
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:32,846
creative priority on.

376
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:58,312
And another thing that people often overlook is that we often miscalculate the time to prepare parts of the game that are often taken for granted.

377
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,253
There are many new game designers who make this mistake.

378
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:14,738
In the game, the program that is really necessary for the game,

379
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:16,300
the sequence that is necessary for the game,

380
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,962
and the sequence that is necessary for the game alone,

381
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:19,604
is only about a quarter of the sequence.

382
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:27,177
And of course, the less experience a designer has,

383
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,758
the more apt he is to make this mistake.

384
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,281
But when we think about it, the amount

385
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:34,063
of programs and sequences which are unique to any given game

386
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:36,665
are actually limited and represent usually

387
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,967
less than a third or a quarter of the total.

388
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:49,045
For example, if you make a role-playing game, the title screen will appear, and you have to register your name,

389
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:53,909
talk to people, exchange items, and do a lot of window processing.

390
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:57,972
This processing is so beautiful that it's natural for games to have it.

391
00:39:58,873 --> 00:40:02,776
Taking the example of an RPG, there are countless features that are taken for granted,

392
00:40:03,157 --> 00:40:08,101
such as the title and name registration screens, the dialog system, item select windows, and so on.

393
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:16,021
I call these parts of the game labor.

394
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:26,549
I'm always trying to design games which feature as few of these as possible.

395
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:29,852
But I have to make them.

396
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:34,095
And recently, many people have brought me a lot of manuals with a lot of these elements.

397
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:37,018
But when I make them, I always...

398
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:47,326
Unfortunately, we can't get around making them.

399
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:51,369
And many game blueprints contain a number of these elements.

400
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:56,273
It is often work on these labor elements that exceed our time estimations

401
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:58,654
that lead to the troubles of games not reaching completion.

402
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:00,616
So with this in mind,

403
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:14,624
We can all reduce this labor by just creating an entirely new genre of games that no one has ever thought of before.

404
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:23,493
Although I've talked mostly about technical matters, I would now kind of like to talk about something that's at the other end of the spectrum.

405
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:35,210
We must not forget the importance of human ingenuity and creativity in game design.

406
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,831
In the past, people with unique ideas and new ideas have created games.

407
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:39,431
This is a natural process.

408
00:41:57,271 --> 00:42:00,532
Naturally, it is new and unique expression of ideas

409
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,492
that gives birth to new games.

410
00:42:02,512 --> 00:42:07,673
On the other hand, when I look at many recent games,

411
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:13,034
I feel sad that the character of the game is determined

412
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:18,535
by the ability of the hardware and the characteristics of the tools.

413
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:21,176
Recently, I've been very sorry to see

414
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,334
that for a number of titles, the technology and the specialty development tools

415
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:28,755
have taken on the lead role in the game uniqueness,

416
00:42:30,177 --> 00:42:32,839
and the personalities of the designers has been diluted.

417
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:40,004
For me, game creation is a lot like expression through music or poetry.

418
00:42:42,787 --> 00:42:46,510
For me, game creation is a lot like expression through music or poetry.

419
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:50,067
When I work as a director, I think about the structure of the game.

420
00:42:50,187 --> 00:42:54,350
I think that the game is a success because it has a good tempo, rhythm, and sound.

421
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:12,306
While I'm always trying to hit upon new ideas when I'm designing or working as a game director,

422
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:15,847
I place great importance on the tempo of the game and the sound effects.

423
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:31,372
I feel that those directors who have been able to incorporate rhythm and emotional stimuli in their game

424
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,733
have been most successful.

425
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:35,294
When I am holding the controller and setting the tempo,

426
00:43:35,815 --> 00:43:38,176
I feel that my own personal game is in the midst of creation.

427
00:43:38,196 --> 00:43:42,199
But in order to reach this level of expression,

428
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:47,402
you have to have that basic understanding of technology that I talked about before.

429
00:43:56,806 --> 00:44:01,210
I also fall into a trap.

430
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:06,315
Game designers are often proud of their technical skills.

431
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:11,119
Game designers are apt to boast of the technical aspects of their games,

432
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:12,981
and I too have sometimes fallen into this trap.

433
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:17,725
I do this when I have little sales points for my games.

434
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:25,439
Speaking of my own case, I tend to highlight new technologies when I am less confident

435
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:27,460
about the new ideas I am putting forward in the game.

436
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,744
Of course I always regret it when I do this.

437
00:44:31,784 --> 00:44:35,847
I think it is important for us to remember that technology can inspire new ideas

438
00:44:35,887 --> 00:44:39,070
and help us realize those ideas, but it should do so from the background.

439
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:54,923
So, I'd like to talk about a game I've been working on recently.

440
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:18,146
Thank you.

441
00:46:20,328 --> 00:46:24,773
We started development with about 4 or 5 different teams, each working on basic experiments related to game design.

442
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:47,892
The first was a scenario and planning team, both very necessary.

443
00:46:48,332 --> 00:46:51,195
The team discussed primarily the position of this title in the whole series.

444
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,617
It included myself and a dedicated script writer.

445
00:46:54,605 --> 00:47:06,049
And now, for the second part, I will be working on the movement of Link and the 3Dization of the items from the previous game.

446
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:13,711
And for that part, I will be working with my partner Koizumi, who has been making players for Mario for a long time, and my main programmer.

447
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:21,233
The next team was related to Link's action and the 3D improvements of items found previously in the Zelda series.

448
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:29,638
This included myself and Mr. Yoshiaki Koizumi, who has worked on player characters since the days of Mario, as well as our head programmer.

449
00:47:30,678 --> 00:47:34,841
We are very lucky today to have Mr. Koizumi here in the audience. I think he's here somewhere.

450
00:47:35,301 --> 00:47:36,102
Mr. Koizumi, where are you?

451
00:47:56,662 --> 00:47:57,183
Thank you.

452
00:47:58,744 --> 00:47:59,124
Thank you.

453
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:04,928
If you happen to see him at the conference, please say hello to him.

454
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,749
He may have something important to tell you.

455
00:48:16,244 --> 00:48:20,547
And also, these two members, plus a programmer and a designer,

456
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:23,410
we did experiments with different camera modes.

457
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:23,990
We also did...

458
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,390
Oh, sorry.

459
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:26,913
We did experiments with virtual boxes that Mario doesn't use,

460
00:48:26,953 --> 00:48:32,377
and also with fixed cameras that are used in castles.

461
00:48:43,355 --> 00:48:46,316
We also had another team working on a variety of camera experiments.

462
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:48,736
These were conducted by myself, Mr. Koizumi,

463
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:51,237
and several designers and programmers.

464
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:53,637
We worked on incorporating new methods,

465
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:56,938
such as background virtual boxes, which we did not use in Mario,

466
00:48:57,298 --> 00:49:00,358
as well as fixed camera modes, like we used in the castle scenes.

467
00:49:01,778 --> 00:49:04,639
Fourth, we set up the basic object and program

468
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:06,339
for the game's basic links and collisions.

469
00:49:13,649 --> 00:49:16,650
Another team worked on bringing the items that Link touches and uses

470
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:19,772
that lay at the basis of the game into the 3D world.

471
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:41,444
We also had an entirely different team, which was working on motion capture production

472
00:49:41,864 --> 00:49:45,826
and tests for the creation for the converter used in Zelda's animation.

473
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:51,030
So as we conducted these various experiments, we brought them into the entire game design.

474
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,672
And we also formed new teams according to our needs.

475
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:09,590
For instance, we also had our sound team which worked on ocarina play and 3D sound throughout

476
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:09,830
the game.

477
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:12,072
We also had a team working exclusively on special effects.

478
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:29,059
So it's a little bit more complicated.

479
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:30,580
So we're going to talk about the background,

480
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,221
and then we're going to talk about the flow of time.

481
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:34,222
And then, this is important,

482
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:36,503
we're going to talk about how to cull the background

483
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:38,424
that's most appropriate for a game like Zelda.

484
00:50:39,685 --> 00:50:41,787
Another team worked on the flow of time in the background,

485
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:43,888
and background culling appropriate for Zelda.

486
00:50:43,928 --> 00:50:47,710
And what's special about this is that

487
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:49,331
the background doesn't just have

488
00:50:49,351 --> 00:50:51,012
the data you can see with your eyes,

489
00:50:51,032 --> 00:50:52,393
but it also has the data that you can see

490
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:54,354
with your eyes,

491
00:50:54,374 --> 00:50:54,655
for example...

492
00:50:56,283 --> 00:50:58,144
You can change the player's movement,

493
00:50:58,164 --> 00:51:00,326
you can add effects,

494
00:51:00,346 --> 00:51:01,927
you can control the camera's movement,

495
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:04,169
and all kinds of information are stored in the background.

496
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:05,751
As we continue to experiment with this,

497
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,832
we will be able to use this data

498
00:51:07,852 --> 00:51:10,454
to make a tool that will be useful in the future.

499
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:28,529
but progressing with design and integration

500
00:51:28,569 --> 00:51:30,790
of terrain-specific sound and movement,

501
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,451
camera moves, and enemy data,

502
00:51:32,952 --> 00:51:34,073
as well as developing the tools

503
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:35,674
effective for manipulating this data.

504
00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:40,437
We will move a lot of small groups like this

505
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:43,659
and check the size of each memory

506
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:44,280
in each experiment,

507
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,701
and the processing time,

508
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:46,902
and then design the final product.

509
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,881
We designed the entire game by organizing these small teams

510
00:51:56,961 --> 00:52:00,722
and conducting tests to confirm memory size and processing

511
00:52:00,802 --> 00:52:01,162
speed.

512
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:03,943
Let us recall Hyrule Field, the great plane

513
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:04,663
in The Legend of Zelda.

514
00:52:04,723 --> 00:52:05,823
The characters that appear in the field

515
00:52:05,863 --> 00:52:07,163
actually share their RAM.

516
00:52:23,395 --> 00:52:27,857
In other words, there is a big bird called the Kepora Gebola in the scenario,

517
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:28,838
and there is a skeleton.

518
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:29,779
When the Kepora Gebola is gone,

519
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:31,640
the Marathon Man enters.

520
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:55,588
So in this instance, we actually wrote the scenario to match these design specifications.

521
00:52:56,889 --> 00:53:01,251
And when Link becomes an adult, then the horse comes into play and he begins riding the horse.

522
00:53:01,951 --> 00:53:04,172
And at this time, only ghosts appear.

523
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:16,018
So in this instance, we actually wrote the scenario to match these design specifications.

524
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:32,328
I'd like to add that depending on the type of game, we may not necessarily start with so many teams, but rather focus on character movement.

525
00:53:32,348 --> 00:53:37,031
And of course, not all the experiments we conduct are going to be adopted in the final game.

526
00:53:45,782 --> 00:53:48,305
These are the technical aspects behind Zelda's development.

527
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:52,530
But I would now like to talk about the concepts behind the development of Zelda.

528
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:12,010
As you all know, we've been making video games as an interactive media.

529
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:16,571
We've found a lot of ways to move the player's mind in the game.

530
00:54:17,711 --> 00:54:21,792
Through our experience making this interactive media called video games,

531
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:25,893
we have uncovered a number of methods to stimulate a player's emotion.

532
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:31,454
One of those methods is to use cinematic sequences.

533
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:35,395
One of those methods is to use cinematic sequences.

534
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:42,243
This effect is more effective when you see it than when you think about it.

535
00:54:42,704 --> 00:54:45,366
Let's take a look at a scene from Zelda.

536
00:54:46,186 --> 00:54:49,869
As you know, seeing with one's own eye can often give a more pronounced effect

537
00:54:50,449 --> 00:54:51,530
than the player's imagination.

538
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,192
And with that, let's take a look at some of Zelda's cinema scenes.

539
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:45,334
Ah...

540
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:32,306
To be continued.

541
00:58:23,342 --> 00:58:34,631
Thank you.

542
00:58:34,651 --> 00:58:37,714
Thank you.

543
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,837
As you can see,

544
00:58:42,038 --> 00:58:44,019
we have seen several examples of these cinema scenes,

545
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,862
but it's important to know that we position these sequences

546
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,244
as only one part of development.

547
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:59,322
In Zelda, there's over one hour and thirty minutes of these cinema sequences.

548
00:59:00,063 --> 00:59:03,247
But most of the staff involved in the production are three people.

549
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:07,931
So, in the second half of the production, we had six or seven people in total.

550
00:59:11,645 --> 00:59:15,288
But the staff involved in creating these sequences was kept at a bare minimum,

551
00:59:15,629 --> 00:59:18,651
with only three individuals for the most part of the development process,

552
00:59:19,032 --> 00:59:20,993
and in the latter stages, only six or seven.

553
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:24,556
The reason why we used such a simple method is that,

554
00:59:24,576 --> 00:59:26,178
as you can see from the actual experience,

555
00:59:26,198 --> 00:59:28,860
the total amount of energy of the team is determined.

556
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,943
Of course, there is a limit to the amount of energy I have.

557
00:59:36,688 --> 00:59:39,289
The reason behind using such a simple process is,

558
00:59:39,729 --> 00:59:41,710
as I'm sure many of you have experienced in the workshop,

559
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,311
there is a total limit on team energy.

560
00:59:44,851 --> 00:59:46,391
There's a limit to the work a team can do,

561
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:48,232
and there's a limit to my own energy.

562
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:51,893
If we use the limited time and energy

563
00:59:52,353 --> 00:59:53,614
to make movies like Pre-Render,

564
00:59:53,654 --> 00:59:57,115
we would like to use it for other interactive elements.

565
01:00:02,105 --> 01:00:06,068
We opted not to use that limited time and energy

566
01:00:06,588 --> 01:00:09,270
on pre-rendered images for use in cinematic sequences.

567
01:00:11,392 --> 01:00:13,754
And we decided to use them for polishing

568
01:00:13,774 --> 01:00:16,076
so that users can play with them comfortably.

569
01:00:17,317 --> 01:00:21,941
We opted instead to use them on other interactive elements

570
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:25,363
and polishing up the game to create a product that players

571
01:00:25,403 --> 01:00:27,285
can enjoy and play more comfortably.

572
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:42,559
Actually, I changed the scenario just a few months before completion.

573
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:46,181
And although the staff was rather unhappy about taking apart something that we had already

574
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:49,664
created, there was no problem with the time.

575
01:00:49,684 --> 01:00:53,226
The problem was that the changes were made in a very short amount of time, and there

576
01:00:53,246 --> 01:00:54,227
was no problem with the time.

577
01:00:58,251 --> 01:01:01,293
Although the staff was unhappy about taking apart something they'd already created,

578
01:01:01,593 --> 01:01:03,894
we were able to make the fixes in a short time,

579
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:06,436
so it did not cause any problems in scheduling.

580
01:01:07,236 --> 01:01:09,938
This may sound like an excuse,

581
01:01:10,998 --> 01:01:16,301
but we didn't try to cheat the movie with real-time processing

582
01:01:16,321 --> 01:01:19,203
because Nintendo 64 didn't have a CD-ROM.

583
01:01:19,223 --> 01:01:20,824
Some people may think it's possibly an excuse,

584
01:01:20,864 --> 01:01:24,446
but it's not because the Nintendo 64 doesn't have a CD-ROM

585
01:01:24,466 --> 01:01:26,847
that we opted for real-time movie processing.

586
01:01:28,924 --> 01:01:35,211
On the other hand, we decided to use a lot of expressions that are not related to the data.

587
01:01:51,765 --> 01:01:57,208
Our president at Nintendo, Mr. Yamauchi, says that each product has its own mission. We

588
01:01:57,329 --> 01:01:58,950
set interactivity as the mission for our products.

589
01:02:17,118 --> 01:02:22,221
Thanks to that, we have been able to experience development that no one had experienced before.

590
01:02:40,328 --> 01:02:44,709
I've talked about a number of different topics this evening, but since everyone is always asking me about the future,

591
01:02:44,729 --> 01:02:47,750
I'd like to talk about the future of game design right now.

592
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:52,591
Shall I begin making Zelda for our next generation hardware?

593
01:02:52,631 --> 01:02:53,171
At this point in time...

594
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:13,878
I'm sorry to say, but at this point in time the answer to that question is no.

595
01:03:37,442 --> 01:03:42,692
The reason for my saying this is that the majority of the elements for which Zelda has been praised so much

596
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:46,940
were already incorporated in the game more than one year before it was completed,

597
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,086
at a time when I personally thought the game wasn't very fun to play.

598
01:03:51,568 --> 01:03:52,608
I think that the real reason

599
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:22,285
that Zelda has been so praised does not lie in the N64's level of experience, of expression,

600
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:25,408
does not lie in the unique camera systems and auto-jump system,

601
01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:29,072
nor in the gorgeous cinematic sequences and spectacular boss fights.

602
01:04:42,928 --> 01:04:47,192
It is true that some other team may realize the level of expression that we achieve with Zelda,

603
01:04:47,712 --> 01:04:49,914
but of course it will not be the exact same as Zelda.

604
01:05:09,985 --> 01:05:12,746
Even if we were to get a very high-tech hardware system,

605
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:16,007
of course, Zelda would have a quicker response time

606
01:05:16,027 --> 01:05:17,648
and it would have more highly refined graphics.

607
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:20,809
But at this point in time, just because of the hardware,

608
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:22,870
I can't guarantee that the game's going to be fun.

609
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:28,432
And this is something that I think we as designers

610
01:05:28,452 --> 01:05:29,912
must all consider at this point in time.

611
01:05:38,884 --> 01:05:41,706
We will continue to create new games.

612
01:05:41,746 --> 01:05:49,032
And Super farmers will face more and more problems in product manufacturing costs

613
01:05:49,092 --> 01:05:51,414
so we have to suggest new games that aren't yet in the market.

614
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,974
Also, I want to constantly make efforts to create new ideas.

615
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:06,818
I want to propose new game ideas without worrying about the headaches of management,

616
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,420
such as inflated development costs.

617
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:21,013
The game has spread much more widely than before,

618
01:06:21,133 --> 01:06:29,641
but there are still a lot of cases in this special market

619
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:33,625
that are just repeating small incidents.

620
01:06:34,826 --> 01:06:37,088
Of course, video games have become far more popular

621
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:39,370
amongst the general public than they were in the past,

622
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:43,233
but I'm afraid that we've just been repeating much of the same experiments

623
01:06:43,753 --> 01:06:44,914
in this small and unique market.

624
01:06:46,358 --> 01:06:51,680
Even with the latest installment of Zelda, I didn't feel that sense of freshness that I had with the original Super Mario Brothers.

625
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,901
I believe that we should make an effort to bring a new charm to the people of the world.

626
01:07:13,949 --> 01:07:17,671
I would like to make efforts to convey the charm of video games to the general public

627
01:07:18,012 --> 01:07:21,074
that is currently outside the reach of the industry in which we do business.

628
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:25,978
I really want to feel the unique zest of the entertainment industry

629
01:07:26,518 --> 01:07:30,381
where one simple idea can create an unexpected social phenomenon.

630
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:33,844
I really want to feel the unique zest of the entertainment industry

631
01:07:34,204 --> 01:07:38,588
where one simple idea can create an unexpected social phenomenon.

632
01:07:46,493 --> 01:07:56,079
Let's take a look at a game I'm not sure if you can really call it a game that I'm working on now called Talent Maker.

633
01:08:20,103 --> 01:08:25,265
Well, what you are seeing now, you also saw one shot I think in the introduction, is a

634
01:08:25,285 --> 01:08:28,387
new game called Talent Maker in which you can create your own characters by utilizing

635
01:08:28,407 --> 01:08:29,487
the Game Boy camera.

636
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:50,198
And of course you can make all these characters dance.

637
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:55,859
And all these scenes that you've seen here, including the one of me in the beginning,

638
01:08:55,879 --> 01:08:58,340
were all made very quickly and easily by my staff using this talent maker game and the N64.

639
01:09:12,487 --> 01:09:18,372
Nintendo is also going to be making efforts to create new types of commodities by combining

640
01:09:18,432 --> 01:09:21,955
the Game Boy, the Game Boy Camera, the Rumble Pak, and others with the N64.

641
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:37,841
In Japan, we have already launched the N64 title, Pokémon Stadium, which makes use of

642
01:09:37,921 --> 01:09:39,142
the Game Boy Pokémon games.

643
01:09:55,959 --> 01:10:03,661
We are also selling Pikachu Genkidechu, a game which makes use of voice recognition technology.

644
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:10,302
We are also selling Pikachu Genkidechu, a game which makes use of voice recognition technology.

645
01:10:20,519 --> 01:10:25,263
Soon, we will introduce a system in which the Game Boy can actually be used as a controller for the N64.

646
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,240
We have expanded this industry to its current market size

647
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:48,401
by welcoming new users with innovative products that

648
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:50,762
continue to surprise and impact the masses.

698
01:11:13,098 --> 01:11:19,905
Although we are only one of the mediators in the Mario 64 and other racing games about the luxurious virtual pixels,

699
01:11:19,925 --> 01:11:22,508
the KPK that we were only able to bring with us,

700
01:11:22,568 --> 01:11:25,591
using the feature of small keychains,

701
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:29,195
all of a sudden, just halfway across the so-called small square-ranging platform,

702
01:11:29,435 --> 01:11:30,036
everyone succeeded.

703
01:11:35,411 --> 01:11:40,415
And when we at Nintendo were stuck on talk of the spectacular 3D graphics of Mario 64 and racing games,

704
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:43,658
we saw a huge hit in the form of Tamagotchi,

705
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:47,942
a tiny keychain boasting pictures made up of no more than 10 or so dots.

706
01:11:49,283 --> 01:11:51,445
At that time, I thought that Mario 64 had lost to Tamagotchi.

707
01:11:51,465 --> 01:11:53,807
At that time, I thought that Mario 64 had lost to Tamagotchi.

708
01:11:53,847 --> 01:11:54,047
Yeah.

709
01:12:04,752 --> 01:12:05,292
I'm serious!

710
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:39,681
I want game designers to be the designers who make technology their tools and use it to express their own individuality, their own uniqueness, and their own rhythm.

711
01:12:52,263 --> 01:12:55,765
And I want them to be the entertainers who make this world a more enjoyable one.

712
01:12:56,146 --> 01:12:58,848
It is with this extravagant hope that I wish to end my speech tonight. 皆さん本当に個性的で、新しい魅力の面白いソフトを設計しましょう。

713
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:04,352
My friends, let us design truly unique, fun software that boasts new appeal. この世界がごく一部の閉鎖的な世界に取り残されないように、新しいチャレンジを続けていきましょう。

714
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:25,446
Let us take on new challenges so that the world of gaming is not left behind, a separate, closed-off world.

715
01:13:28,047 --> 01:13:30,448
And in the process, let's see if we can't make some money.

716
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:45,876
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
