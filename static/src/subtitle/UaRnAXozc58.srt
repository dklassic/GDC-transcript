1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,380
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,941
Wow, a lot of people in for 9 o'clock.

3
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:10,761
I didn't expect that.

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:12,241
Thank you.

5
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:14,542
I got 30 minutes.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,202
So I'm going to begin now.

7
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:17,402
It's a lot to cover.

8
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:20,883
Basically, I'm going to talk about, and I kind of did this

9
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:24,944
presentation for people not wanting to get into the games

10
00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:25,304
business.

11
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:26,905
That's not what I'm going to focus on.

12
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:29,065
I'm focusing on once you get there, how to survive.

13
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,646
How many people are working for R&Ds?

14
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:34,568
OK.

15
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:36,588
How many people are working for game companies?

16
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:37,629
OK.

17
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:39,009
Good old mix.

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,911
I started out as an indie with a group of guys in our early 20s.

19
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:48,552
We formed a studio, lasted for about five years.

20
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:52,373
And then after that, I started working for game companies.

21
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:53,433
Now I'm back at an indie.

22
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:55,659
I'm kind of circular here.

23
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,181
I've created three studios from the ground up

24
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,862
in Austin, Texas.

25
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:07,806
Vioware Austin, Sony Austin, and Battlecry Studios now,

26
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:11,028
Bethesda Game Studios, from scratch.

27
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:12,368
And it's been a lot of fun.

28
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:14,069
And I learned a lot by doing that.

29
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,831
And so what I learned is kind of like what

30
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:21,914
I look for in the games industry and how to survive.

31
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:23,975
Because one of the things that you're going to notice

32
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:29,224
There's a 90% chance of the demon, I call it,

33
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:33,070
the layoff demon, will hit you.

34
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:35,373
And by the way, don't feel bad about that,

35
00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:38,478
it's kind of a rite of passage in the games business.

36
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:42,530
It will happen probably within the first five years

37
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:45,273
of your career, if you're with a game company

38
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,233
or even with an indie.

39
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:50,697
Average lifespan in the company is about four years,

40
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:52,278
I found, just kind of looking around.

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,801
Change is inevitable.

42
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,644
Our industry changes so much.

43
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:00,846
You look at all the disruptions that

44
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:03,628
have happened in the past 10 years in our game industry

45
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:05,730
and what's coming with streaming.

46
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:10,813
and other things like that VR, AR, it's a new,

47
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:14,295
this particularly I think in the next 10 years

48
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,536
will be totally different than what you see today

49
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:19,738
as far as entertainment or as far as what we develop.

50
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:23,936
And one of the things I noticed too,

51
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:25,577
and every game company I've worked for,

52
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:29,640
is there really isn't any onboarding to say.

53
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,120
There are some at places.

54
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:34,482
Training is non-existent in a lot of places.

55
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,345
And mentoring and career growth, secondary.

56
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:40,726
And that's unfortunate.

57
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:44,348
And a lot of things I've done for training

58
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:49,691
has just gone on on my own or come here to GDC.

59
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,723
One of the observations too is there's a delicate balance,

60
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:57,163
and it's actually getting better now,

61
00:02:57,203 --> 00:03:01,004
but when I started it wasn't, between work life.

62
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:03,745
This industry can chew you up.

63
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:09,046
You work long hours, a lot of times with no rest.

64
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:13,107
Again, it has gotten a lot better today

65
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,427
than it was 10 years ago.

66
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,248
But something to, you know,

67
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,668
these are things you need to be aware of.

68
00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:22,489
There's a hierarchy in our business.

69
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,690
And these are just kind of observations right now

70
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,910
I'm going over to you and then I'll tell you,

71
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,050
get into the meat of this.

72
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,111
Programmers are king, secondary design,

73
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,172
third is artist, fourth is QA on the ladder.

74
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:38,053
And it's bizarre because if a game isn't fun,

75
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:39,674
it's not gonna do anything.

76
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:42,775
And designers are, in my opinion,

77
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:47,236
are not as high as programmers are.

78
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:51,067
And I think that in our industry is just screwed up.

79
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:56,790
And QA is not respected, which I totally are against.

80
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,272
And by the way, a lot of really good people

81
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:03,995
came out of QA in gaming.

82
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:08,750
One thing I'm going to talk about is culture.

83
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:10,712
So wherever you go, whether you're an indie studio,

84
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:11,693
you're going to have a culture.

85
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,915
Whether you're going for a game company,

86
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:14,996
they're going to have a culture.

87
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:18,839
And it's really important to learn what that culture is.

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,820
And if you're looking for a job,

89
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,182
to make sure you see if you're compatible with that culture.

90
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:25,985
A lot of cultures are top-down.

91
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,126
When you see a top-down culture,

92
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,488
you see you walk into the place and it's very quiet.

93
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,190
Easily an indicator.

94
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:34,272
And groups are separated.

95
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,403
And then there's bottoms up.

96
00:04:38,463 --> 00:04:42,567
And how you fit on that will be something you need to learn.

97
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,549
So in a top-down, you're taking orders.

98
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:48,671
In a bottom-up, it's kind of a more collaborative type

99
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:49,272
of development.

100
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:54,436
So if people don't like the top-down approach,

101
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:56,598
then maybe that's not a good cultural fit for you.

102
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,601
There is places I've seen, and even indies are like this,

103
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:04,063
they're either design-heavy or tech-heavy.

104
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,000
And so you need to see how you fit in in that kind of place.

105
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,626
Because it all goes into how, what kind of voice you'll have.

106
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:16,988
And again, it's like DNA matching.

107
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:20,091
So as you're forming your indie studios,

108
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,612
make sure that you form something

109
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:23,434
that you all will appreciate and like,

110
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:26,136
and as you grow, can bring people into it.

111
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:29,219
I always had, when I started a studio,

112
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,263
any size studio is my core values

113
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:35,125
and what our mission statement is.

114
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,767
If you're indie, that's the first thing you should do,

115
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:39,009
is figure that out.

116
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:44,183
And that's something you abide by as you grow and as you are

117
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,564
successful and as you hire people.

118
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:49,966
Because when you're hiring when everyone goes for an interview

119
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:53,767
for a job they're looking at number one your hard skills

120
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:54,788
what you're good at.

121
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:57,929
Number two is can you be a cultural fit.

122
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:01,830
That's what a lot of people use because if you're not you're

123
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,891
going to be swimming upstream.

124
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,139
And sometimes that happens.

125
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,001
And it's not all against you,

126
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,523
you just don't fit within that culture,

127
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:10,483
don't take it personally.

128
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:16,629
And what I'm gonna talk about is soft skills now.

129
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:18,050
Because soft skills is something

130
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,752
that people don't really talk a lot about in our industry.

131
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:23,094
But it really is,

132
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:27,715
important. In fact, I think it's more important than your hard skills, because you can learn

133
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:33,480
hard skills really easily. There's so many great gaming schools out there today teaching

134
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:39,624
stuff you can go learn on or come here. You're going to be working with a variety of different

135
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:46,029
weird people in our industry, and you're going to have tons of personalities to deal with

136
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:50,672
here. I see it all the time, and I just accept it.

137
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:56,795
Artists have their personalities, designers have their personalities,

138
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,257
programmers have their personalities.

139
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:01,319
And so you're going to have to learn how to adjust and fit to that.

140
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,661
And that's where soft skills come in.

141
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:07,725
One of the most important soft skills is what I call emotional intelligence.

142
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:10,988
And some people are not self-aware on that front.

143
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,410
Self-awareness is really critical.

144
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,332
If I had to say anything about one of the biggest things about emotional

145
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:17,554
intelligence,

146
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:21,797
Egos have got to be left aside in our industry.

147
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:24,899
I've seen so many people not be self-aware.

148
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,921
If you're not self-aware, you're not gonna learn,

149
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:28,362
and you're not gonna grow,

150
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:30,704
and you're not gonna be able to succeed

151
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:33,146
in an entertainment-type company.

152
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:37,449
So being self-aware is really at all this,

153
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:38,790
and that's why it's on the top.

154
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,971
It's the most important thing.

155
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,089
and self-management too.

156
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,775
Understanding how to deal with your time,

157
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:50,102
how to deal with others, and social awareness.

158
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:53,808
Social awareness is really, really important.

159
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:57,668
Where, and when you go to work for a company,

160
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:59,649
you kind of like see, what I always do

161
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:00,630
is I don't say anything.

162
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,472
And when I came to my last job, which I work out today,

163
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:04,853
I only knew one person.

164
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,334
That was terrifying to me.

165
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:09,816
Because I've always started up studios and formed them,

166
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:14,039
and grew it, and went with the people I know to start them.

167
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,460
So this was really important for me

168
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,442
to figure out how the social structure exists in a studio.

169
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,384
And relationship management is another one.

170
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:24,606
These people you work with a lot.

171
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:28,187
And it's really important to make sure, and by the way,

172
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,549
there's a one degree separation in our gains business.

173
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,793
So if you piss someone off, likelihood you'll maybe be

174
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,935
seeing them again and they may be your hiring manager.

175
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,918
And that goes for anybody in this room that are really

176
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:42,959
young and starting too.

177
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,382
Because one day, I may be looking for a job, right?

178
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:51,066
Another skill I think is really important in this

179
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,088
business is called adaptability.

180
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,532
You really have to learn how to be adaptable.

181
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:00,353
You can't be rigid in our business.

182
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,214
Our business changes way too fast, way too much,

183
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:05,455
versus any other business.

184
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:06,595
By the way, it's chaotic.

185
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:08,876
And I'll tell you what, I like chaos.

186
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:10,757
And I think anybody that does games

187
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:12,237
and thinks games are easy to make,

188
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:14,078
they ought to not be in gaming.

189
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:16,399
Games are probably one of the hardest things to build,

190
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,399
in my opinion.

191
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:20,120
They require so much multidisciplinary talent.

192
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:22,825
Lots of people working together to make it happen.

193
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:24,988
And it's magic.

194
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,351
It's lightning in a bottle whether you hit it or not.

195
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:31,958
Another one, in my opinion, is being collaborative.

196
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,343
You have to learn to work well with each other.

197
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:38,673
I told, someone asked me, well, what did you learn?

198
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:40,974
What are the skills you learned to manage a studio?

199
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:43,016
Well, I said, I learned everything

200
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:44,577
when I went to first grade.

201
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,899
And I said, draw between the lines, play well with others.

202
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,181
These are things that are really, really important

203
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:53,942
as you grow, even if you're indie.

204
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:56,283
Collaboration is sometimes hard,

205
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:58,705
because as a smaller studio you are,

206
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:01,927
sometimes you have bigger conflicts, believe it or not,

207
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,628
because they're amplified because of your size.

208
00:10:06,262 --> 00:10:09,762
Learning how to get people to be collaborative is an art.

209
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:12,683
And it comes with this.

210
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:18,424
Ego doesn't really work well in our business.

211
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:20,964
There are a lot of egos in our business.

212
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,025
I'll tell you that right now.

213
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:23,045
And I'll tell you what.

214
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:28,026
Some of them are very good at damping that down and not

215
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:30,366
exposing it to a lot of people.

216
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:31,546
Some are not.

217
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,947
And ego in our business can lead to bad decisions.

218
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:39,689
And you need a little humility mixed into that.

219
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:42,689
So humility, in my opinion, is one of the best things

220
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:43,950
to have as a soft skill.

221
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,410
You need to be confident.

222
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,451
This is real important.

223
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:51,951
If you're an indie, if you're going to a publisher

224
00:10:52,091 --> 00:10:54,012
or going to get finance, you need

225
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:58,093
to show them that you can do the job that you

226
00:10:58,233 --> 00:10:58,933
said you're going to do.

227
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:04,378
that I'm going to give you money and the likelihood of me getting my investment back is high.

228
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:09,219
If you go in there not confident, you're not going to get anything from a publisher or

229
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:09,759
an investor.

230
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,140
As a developer, people look at you and you say, yes, I can do this.

231
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,421
Confidence, being insecure, is something you don't want.

232
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:22,382
If you are, a lot of people are.

233
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:24,822
I've been insecure at times, but I don't show it.

234
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,501
I try to have a persona of confidence.

235
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,422
That's really important as you're successful.

236
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:34,063
But another side of that,

237
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:35,803
if you don't know how to do something,

238
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:37,004
there's nothing wrong with saying,

239
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:39,164
I don't know how to do that, help me.

240
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:40,425
Ask for help.

241
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:46,387
This is another one I think that in our industry is hard.

242
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,308
Some people are really good at it, and I've seen,

243
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,429
and some people are really, really bad at it.

244
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:53,990
Learn how to listen.

245
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:59,343
Understand, look through the lens of other people, their perspective,

246
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:05,064
and then communicate concisely, not a thesis.

247
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,285
I think one of the biggest things I've seen people do

248
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:10,406
in communications is write a thesis.

249
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:11,926
Get to the point.

250
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:17,288
But be delicate if it's something that is a delicate situation, but get to the point.

251
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:22,213
One of the things that I think there's the other side of this

252
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,174
is called a nonverbal communications.

253
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:26,814
The way you stand up, the way you act,

254
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:29,875
this is very important in a game company

255
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,356
as well as an indie company.

256
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:35,477
Because again, indies, if you go for a publisher or investment

257
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:38,238
and you have bad body language, you're not going to get it.

258
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:41,859
Make sure that you look at the way you're acting.

259
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:43,859
Because even when you're in a meeting,

260
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,600
you put your head down when someone's saying that,

261
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,340
that's not a good thing all the time.

262
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:53,496
It's learn how to have both verbal and nonverbal

263
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,657
communication skills are really important.

264
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:01,298
There are many types of people you're gonna deal with

265
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:02,159
in the games business.

266
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:04,820
Even in small teams, it's really there.

267
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,280
You have the rational people.

268
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,301
I call them the engineers.

269
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:10,682
They're the rational people.

270
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:13,142
The producers are trying to be rational as well.

271
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,903
You have the extroverts and you have the introverts.

272
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,872
And I'm kind of like an introvert myself a little bit,

273
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:22,473
more so than extrovert.

274
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:26,175
And it's hard to push yourself out of that.

275
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:29,438
And some people are extremely emotional.

276
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:32,259
And I will tell you, you're going to have bosses

277
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,960
that cover this spectrum.

278
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:37,603
I had an emotional boss once, and he

279
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:38,884
was a very abusive person.

280
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:41,285
And it was an awful situation to be in.

281
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:43,307
It's really hard to deal with.

282
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:44,467
And so.

283
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,732
Having soft skills is why I think it's important.

284
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:50,953
You have to deal with all these three or four different types.

285
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:55,736
And sometimes when you're an introvert,

286
00:13:56,316 --> 00:14:01,219
the best way as a producer I am to get an introvert to talk

287
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,300
is I ask them specific questions in a meeting.

288
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:06,562
Extroverts you don't have to worry about.

289
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:09,704
Emotional people, you just talk to facts.

290
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:11,885
You don't get emotional yourself.

291
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:15,926
You talk about facts, and if it's not working, you just say,

292
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,727
OK, I think we need to take a break for a minute.

293
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,850
Rational people are a lot easier to deal with,

294
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:24,552
a lot easier to deal with.

295
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:27,294
But sometimes they can get too rational about things,

296
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,316
and you say, well, look, take a leap of faith.

297
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:32,538
So those are things about, again,

298
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:34,139
what I saw about building confidence.

299
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:37,582
Why are these important?

300
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:41,905
Because I will tell you, if you do get reviews.

301
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:45,767
The people who have the best soft skills by the way and hard

302
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:51,231
skills get the outstanding or the excellent people who don't

303
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:57,997
get satisfactory or below satisfactory a game company.

304
00:14:58,017 --> 00:15:02,821
So if you want to advance your careers go out and look for

305
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:04,743
good books on soft skills.

306
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,677
There are many times in our game industry

307
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:13,119
that you're going to have these moments.

308
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,441
We're all familiar with them.

309
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:17,603
And they happen.

310
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,286
And the way that I deal with those moments

311
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:22,787
is I take a breath.

312
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:24,869
I go outside and walk around.

313
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,651
I don't respond in email.

314
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:28,612
Please don't do that.

315
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:30,994
Take time.

316
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:36,058
Walk around outside or do something different.

317
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:37,219
Get away.

318
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:42,538
think about it, come back, and then deal with it at that particular moment.

319
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:49,203
But I will tell you, I've seen people respond very quickly to those moments that they regret later.

320
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:55,067
And so I always kind of like, I say, I need a pause, and I need to go think for a minute.

321
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:59,089
A lot of times when you do that, you can look through the lens of whatever's happening and

322
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:03,472
figure out how to get around it. But our game industry is full of these moments, by the way.

323
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:10,813
Stress is something that we deal with a lot.

324
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,475
It's very stressful to do games.

325
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:17,100
I have not been in a situation that hasn't been stressful.

326
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:20,224
It always comes down to you have this passionate thing

327
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:23,307
you worked on, this baby, and someone says it's ugly.

328
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:26,271
And that's the worst thing you can hear,

329
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:27,752
is your baby is ugly.

330
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,384
And you have to sit down and go, I'm going to kill that guy.

331
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:34,447
And you get very passionate about it.

332
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,029
All the reviewers say, your baby's baby.

333
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,090
Your baby's ugly.

334
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:37,770
No.

335
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:43,676
And so you have this fear when you launch that things

336
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:44,557
aren't going to go right.

337
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:46,518
You have this fear that you're not

338
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,880
going to get money from your publisher

339
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,261
because you're missing deadlines and they're

340
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:50,302
going to cancel your project.

341
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,064
We have a fear of losing our jobs.

342
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:55,486
That's stressful.

343
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:59,249
And the way I deal with stress is yoga and workout.

344
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:05,054
But seriously, one of the things I do

345
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:08,496
is I always kind of look forward.

346
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:09,918
I don't look back.

347
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,621
I look at the situation I have on hand.

348
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:15,642
It's not life and death.

349
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:20,305
here. There are many moments in your lives that be a much

350
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:24,708
dealing with much force worse things than this. But it's

351
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:28,369
about everyone's passionate about it. So what I learned is

352
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:30,631
to kind of like deal with stress is to kind of put it in

353
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:35,333
perspective and immediately try to look for ways of dealing

354
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:38,175
with the stress to look for solutions or the way out.

355
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:41,185
Look forward, not look back.

356
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:45,586
Don't sit down and just go into a loop, what I call it,

357
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:49,687
of always saying, and I call this the abused puppy syndrome.

358
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,268
Some people may come from a very bad place

359
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:54,649
and they start working in a new place,

360
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,750
but they got that abused puppy syndrome.

361
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,450
So anything you do, they're gonna look at it

362
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,551
from their lens of where they were, not where they are.

363
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:04,853
It's real important to know that you're here.

364
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:06,273
It's not like where you are.

365
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:08,894
Leave your luggage behind, your baggage behind.

366
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:09,274
Leave it.

367
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,290
That's my advice.

368
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:15,494
Always look forward.

369
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:18,958
One of the things I do is even when I schedule or everything,

370
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:20,039
I don't look in front of me.

371
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:20,920
I look where I'm going.

372
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:22,903
Everyone should look where they're going.

373
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:25,926
And for that, for advice to everyone here,

374
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:27,588
and this is kind of harsh a little bit,

375
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:30,491
but what I've learned is no one's going

376
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,173
to stand up for you but you.

377
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:36,499
And in our, and it goes for any business,

378
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,879
but in particularly our business,

379
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:39,560
you could get laid off any day, they don't care.

380
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,921
Loyalty in my opinion is something that I have not seen

381
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:44,702
or earned from any game company yet.

382
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:46,863
Because if things go bad, they'll get rid of you.

383
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:48,704
If you have a great opportunity,

384
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:51,485
if you love the people you work with

385
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:53,206
and you love your job, fantastic.

386
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:57,367
If things don't work, or if you get a greater opportunity,

387
00:18:57,868 --> 00:18:59,768
always look for the greater opportunity at times.

388
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:04,123
Because you never know what that opportunity is,

389
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:06,184
and it may be something that the place

390
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:09,225
that you currently have doesn't offer you.

391
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:11,446
Or you think you're worth more than what you're getting.

392
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,627
Always look out for yourself.

393
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,569
But be careful about being careful what to ask for.

394
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:20,830
You always have to look at the situation

395
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,830
that you're currently in.

396
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:24,427
The company may not be doing well,

397
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:27,728
or the average salaries of that company

398
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:28,828
are a little lower than most.

399
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:31,009
But if you like, my opinion is,

400
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:32,570
my most important criteria is,

401
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,910
do I like the people I work with?

402
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,472
Is the company culture something I enjoy and like?

403
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,712
And is there a work-life balance?

404
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:41,973
And that what we're working on is cool.

405
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,235
And if I meet those criteria, I'm fine.

406
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:47,295
I am fine.

407
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,897
So, I have some time.

408
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,514
Like 10 minutes for questions.

409
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,694
Anybody want to ask questions?

410
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:56,754
Yes.

411
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:58,495
Go to the mic.

412
00:19:59,575 --> 00:19:59,775
Sorry.

413
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:01,956
Go up to the mics, please.

414
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:02,276
Thank you.

415
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:03,756
That way we can hear the recordings.

416
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:05,176
Testing.

417
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:05,496
OK.

418
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:08,717
Do you have any soft skill books that come to mind?

419
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:09,818
What do you recommend?

420
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:11,838
Yeah.

421
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:15,039
I'm trying to think about some good ones out there.

422
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:18,796
that I've seen.

423
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,799
You know what there is?

424
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,121
There's nothing on the gaming industry.

425
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:22,782
I wish there was.

426
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:25,707
I'll tell you what.

427
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:26,548
You email me.

428
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:27,269
I'll give you some books.

429
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:28,891
Thank you.

430
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:29,352
That'll do.

431
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,356
I have some at home, and I can just pick out.

432
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:33,298
Yeah, go ahead.

433
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:41,433
Hi, so you mentioned that you had an abusive boss that was emotional at times.

434
00:20:42,815 --> 00:20:46,761
When you're asked the question of what was the context of the problem and how did you

435
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,744
manage it, how do you talk about that experience?

436
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:55,130
When you get an emotional boss, the best thing to do is to ask questions versus anything

437
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,832
else because that makes them respond.

438
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,393
And don't be defensive.

439
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:05,796
Ask questions at why, why do you see this, or what do you think are the issues that you're

440
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:06,877
upset about, right?

441
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:08,798
Always ask questions.

442
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,901
Don't make statements because they always end to be bad.

443
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:16,823
Because when you ask questions, you actually can get the viewpoint or the lens that person

444
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:17,403
is looking for.

445
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:24,075
I also kind of like if he's really hot right now or very emotional, I wait.

446
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:25,837
Come back later.

447
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,861
Also be careful about the group thing.

448
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:33,647
If you're going to ask something that's kind of, should you ask that with a group of people

449
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:34,829
or should you do that one on one?

450
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:39,408
That's a really important one, because a person one-on-one

451
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:40,789
will talk to you a lot differently

452
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:43,110
than a person in a group, right?

453
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,172
And trust me, there are certain things you ask in a group,

454
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:48,113
and there are certain things you don't ask in a group.

455
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:51,094
And I've been there where I had some of my people

456
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:53,095
in my studio go up to a CEO of a company

457
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:54,056
and ask this question.

458
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,137
I said, oh my God, I can't believe he just asked

459
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:57,498
that question in front of the company.

460
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:02,981
But yeah, that's the other criteria.

461
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:03,361
Yes.

462
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:07,398
So you mentioned having both humility and confidence.

463
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:09,199
How do you sort of balance those,

464
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,522
and I guess in an outward way to be a bit of both?

465
00:22:14,062 --> 00:22:16,183
Yeah, I mean, I like confidence, right?

466
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:17,924
Confidence doesn't mean,

467
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:20,786
if you're confident in what you're doing,

468
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:21,826
you believe what you're doing.

469
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:24,128
Now, sometimes a good game designer

470
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,148
is stubborn a little bit.

471
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:32,134
and confident that's OK if they believe in what they believe in and they have a good

472
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:36,998
rationale for it and the data is showing that they're moving in the right direction.

473
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:37,258
Yeah.

474
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:38,018
I'm on.

475
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:42,782
There's nothing wrong with a good argument but if you're wrong and the data showing you're

476
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:44,963
wrong you need to have humility to recognize that right.

477
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:46,164
OK.

478
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:46,524
Thank you.

479
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:46,905
Yeah.

480
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:52,498
In one slide you mentioned that programmers are on top and designers are below.

481
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:56,881
So I'm a programmer myself and I'm thinking, OK, how does that affect, in your view, the situation?

482
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,503
What can I do as a programmer to remedy this?

483
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:02,064
You know what? This is just a hierarchy I've seen.

484
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:07,848
A lot of companies value technical people over design, which is crazy.

485
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:09,870
And I don't get it.

486
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,012
Every studio I have, I balance that. I don't do that.

487
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:15,695
And I have pressure from above telling me,

488
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,776
no, you need to give this person this amount

489
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:19,337
for bonuses and this person.

490
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:21,878
I said, no, this person is the reason

491
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:25,420
this game got an 87 Metacritic, right?

492
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,701
Or these people are.

493
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:31,503
And to me, that's messed up in our industry.

494
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:32,884
I've just seen it so much.

495
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:36,066
And to me, designers are king,

496
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:39,068
because a game isn't fun, it's not gonna be played.

497
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:42,049
And fun, by the way, so here's another thing.

498
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:43,951
Programming is measurable.

499
00:23:44,872 --> 00:23:46,974
Design is this magic black box.

500
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:48,255
It really is.

501
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:49,296
It's hard to test for.

502
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:52,299
It's hard to hire for, because you

503
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,221
don't know if someone's a walker or a talker

504
00:23:54,782 --> 00:23:55,502
when they're a designer.

505
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:57,124
We do have tests.

506
00:23:57,364 --> 00:23:58,325
They help call it out.

507
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:00,648
But tests don't catch everything.

508
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:08,385
So it is and I think design and art are not the black boxes as well as I think QA is also

509
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:11,627
that way but design is this little, it's magic.

510
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,849
It really is what design skills are.

511
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:17,352
There's several different versions of what designers are and there's several types of

512
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:22,596
designers, but it is and I think that's the reason because they don't know how to quantify

513
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:23,656
a good designer, right?

514
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:28,080
They only quantify a good designer by what they've worked on, right?

515
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:35,405
Go ahead. Is that. I hope that answers your question. I don't know how to deal with that. It's really the culture. Right.

516
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:43,574
Whatever company you have has a good culture where design is king. That's that's awesome. That's a culture that I like because

517
00:24:43,674 --> 00:24:52,243
usually a culture that we're design is really appreciated and respected. Blizzard. It's that's where you get good games.

518
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,062
Yeah, so with those problems that you mentioned before,

519
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:00,963
like the top-down culture and the weird sort of hierarchy

520
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:03,844
that he just brought up, what do you

521
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:06,845
think about unions and co-ops helping with that a little bit

522
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:07,465
with the culture?

523
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:09,866
So I'm not a big fan of unions.

524
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:10,446
I don't know.

525
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:13,107
I heard all this going on.

526
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:15,527
Do you know how the film and I came out of,

527
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:17,208
I went to USC film school.

528
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:18,929
I came out of the film business to go into games.

529
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:22,451
You're hired freelancers.

530
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:23,272
That's all you are.

531
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:26,615
And basically, they make a, they have,

532
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:29,018
the studios have staff, right?

533
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,080
And they have executive producers and things like that.

534
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,363
But directors, DPs, all that's hired to make a film.

535
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:37,406
So if we go to that model,

536
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,229
that's exactly what may happen is we're all freelancers.

537
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:43,800
So we're getting paycheck to paycheck on games.

538
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,301
And by the way, getting in clicks

539
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:50,783
of where the good people are in Hollywood is hard, real hard.

540
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:53,524
So if they're making a blockbuster AAA movie,

541
00:25:53,544 --> 00:25:54,724
they know the group they're going to get.

542
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,465
They know the group of people they're going to hire.

543
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:59,787
And if you're not on that group, you may not get hired.

544
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,788
So there may be a lot of content that

545
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,729
needs to be done in the games business, but I don't know.

546
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:11,295
In my opinion, yes, there are good positive things about unions, about work-life balance

547
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:13,477
and things like that, that forces that.

548
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:18,401
But again, how is the publisher going to deal with that, I don't know.

549
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:20,002
I really don't.

550
00:26:24,277 --> 00:26:29,058
pushing publishers to do good work like balance by having by

551
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:32,479
companies that promote that and get the good talent there I

552
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,760
think is a good indicator about how to push that forward where I

553
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,541
seen work like balance happen to be honest with you just as a

554
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:40,682
long answer your question.

555
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:45,583
I see crunch happen because schedules are top down not

556
00:26:45,643 --> 00:26:46,103
bottoms up.

557
00:26:46,883 --> 00:26:48,904
That's the number one cause of crunch in my opinion.

558
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:54,670
in our industry that I've seen in the past 20 years is top down schedules versus bottom

559
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:54,790
up.

560
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,773
And the realities, by the way, of a business, meaning you have to get a title done by a

561
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:04,115
certain time, but there are casualties with that too if it's not successful due to an

562
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:05,075
unrealistic schedule.

563
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:10,813
But again, I don't know how the industry is going to handle

564
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:11,473
unions or anything.

565
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:15,434
But I know how it happened in the film business is it just

566
00:27:15,454 --> 00:27:17,155
basically, it's all freelancers.

567
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:21,456
So I don't know if that's going to happen or not.

568
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:23,256
But that's what happened in the film and

569
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:24,357
video industry.

570
00:27:26,797 --> 00:27:28,078
Yes, go ahead.

571
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:30,478
So on your hierarchy, it was very interesting.

572
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,139
But I did not notice writers anywhere.

573
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,079
Are they so low value that they wouldn't even be on the

574
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:34,219
people?

575
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:34,359
No.

576
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,751
No, writers are, where I worked at Bioware,

577
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:39,992
writers are designers, right?

578
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:42,073
We call them narrative designers.

579
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:45,734
That's what writers are in that field.

580
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:48,396
They're not anywhere off the charts,

581
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,876
just because you're a writer, you know what I'm saying?

582
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,098
They're narrative designers, that's what we call writers.

583
00:27:53,478 --> 00:27:54,158
Cool, thanks.

584
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:55,699
So don't worry about that.

585
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:56,660
I love writers.

586
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,461
Story's important.

587
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:07,057
So you talked a lot about culture and sort of the work life balance at a company can vary from company to company.

588
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:17,188
Do you have any tips or suggestions on how best to assess that before you're in the position of like during the interview or something to ask for something like that?

589
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:20,612
I always ask to go to the bathroom and then get lost.

590
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:26,308
There's a reason I do that, because I want to see how people are interacting.

591
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:28,450
I watch a lot.

592
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,811
I watch the people's faces.

593
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:31,853
I watch the people, the way they communicate with each other.

594
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:34,355
I see how they're working around their desk.

595
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,278
It's that kind of thing.

596
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:39,200
How quiet it is, is another one.

597
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:45,606
And then, the second thing I do is, there's a time you take a break.

598
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,709
There's always a smokers area.

599
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,291
That's a great area to kind of walk to.

600
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:55,133
Usually you can find it and just ask questions.

601
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,515
You know, that's my other tip for that.

602
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:00,536
But yeah, just look, watch, and listen.

603
00:29:00,676 --> 00:29:03,558
And I also would go to LinkedIn

604
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:05,819
and look for other people who work there

605
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,641
and maybe ask directly, hey, I'm looking at there,

606
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:09,302
what's it like?

607
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:14,370
That's another, that's second degree versus first degree

608
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,651
trying to get that information because the people are gonna

609
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:19,512
interview you, are gonna give you a different perspective

610
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:22,053
than going out and trying to get it yourself, right?

611
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:22,933
Yeah.

612
00:29:23,634 --> 00:29:25,534
And I would also, at LinkedIn, look for people

613
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:26,475
who worked there before.

614
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:28,035
Maybe they don't work there now.

615
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:29,236
That's another one.

616
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:30,876
That's good.

617
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,077
Go, we'll have one over here sometime.

618
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,317
Go ahead.

619
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:35,978
Hi, my name's Anna.

620
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:39,839
So you kind of covered like many things

621
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:40,640
that are kind of like.

622
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:42,945
issues in the game industry.

623
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:48,610
You talked about how it's come far along since, like you said,

624
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,270
10 years.

625
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,254
What are some things that, what's

626
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:57,217
some advice you can give to us that we

627
00:29:57,237 --> 00:30:01,220
can help to move along in improving the things

628
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,581
that we still have issues with?

629
00:30:03,098 --> 00:30:06,860
Yeah, I mean, basically, if you see work-life balance problems,

630
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,544
make a big issue out of that, talk about it, and bring it up.

631
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:16,626
And if it's that way, and you're not liking it,

632
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:17,867
look for another job.

633
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:19,508
Look for another place in the industry.

634
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:23,010
Because it's not worth it that way.

635
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,912
And if you see chaos in a game, games are chaotic.

636
00:30:26,072 --> 00:30:26,913
I'll tell you that right now.

637
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:28,694
No matter where you go, they're always chaotic.

638
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:33,315
And no matter where you go, I will tell you, you always put in a little extra effort.

639
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,616
It's a matter of what the duration of that extra effort is.

640
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:43,598
A lot of times when I ask, when we go into deadlines, I ask people to move, put some

641
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:44,398
extra effort in.

642
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:47,979
I ask, I first of all give them goals so they know what they need to do.

643
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,101
It's all voluntary and there are guidelines for it, meaning duration, other things like

644
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:53,321
that.

645
00:30:53,901 --> 00:30:55,422
And I don't continue it.

646
00:30:55,502 --> 00:30:58,585
It's like a basically accelerate release,

647
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:01,147
accelerate release, it's not constant.

648
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,970
But anything entertainment wise,

649
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,571
and even in film and video,

650
00:31:06,091 --> 00:31:08,593
everyone puts in extra effort when the release comes in.

651
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:09,614
It always happens.

652
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:12,397
I'd be honest with you, no matter where you go on that,

653
00:31:12,677 --> 00:31:15,259
that's always the case in the entertainment industry, right?

654
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,321
Yeah, sounds about right.

655
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:21,074
So I mean just that's what I'd say just push it forward and be

656
00:31:21,094 --> 00:31:25,177
a voice in it right. Yeah. You look at E.A. E.A. had the E.A.

657
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:29,460
wives got a huge issue with them right along 10 years ago I think

658
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,382
it was and they they changed the way he operated for a while. So

659
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:36,824
that was good. I actually have a spouse I think he a spouse. Yes.

660
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:37,145
Was that.

661
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:38,882
Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt.

662
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:39,882
That's all right.

663
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,664
I kind of have another question, actually.

664
00:31:42,844 --> 00:31:49,247
Do they advocate for certain issues?

665
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:54,189
Do they have any, I don't know, I don't want to say social

666
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,511
justice kind of?

667
00:31:56,571 --> 00:31:59,292
You know, any company, the problem is just

668
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:00,353
bringing awareness.

669
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:03,294
If people start leaving, that builds awareness, OK?

670
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:06,676
Next question and then I think I have.

671
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:07,832
Yes.

672
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:15,040
For someone who is a programmer who also has interest in being a designer, what do you

673
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,864
say about programmers who also have design skills?

674
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:20,205
Oh, that's awesome.

675
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:21,166
No, that's where I came from.

676
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,770
So I was a programmer, then I became a designer, and then I became a producer.

677
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,548
But yes, and when I started, by the way,

678
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:29,370
most producers were designers.

679
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:33,374
And sorry, most programmers were designers, by the way.

680
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:36,077
So in the 90s, when I was started,

681
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,100
you would not see a lot of designers.

682
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,182
You'd see programmers that were designers.

683
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:47,287
that are designers and that's the way the industry was for a long time in the 90s and

684
00:32:47,307 --> 00:32:52,031
the 80s too, but from what I heard, but in the 90s for sure and then probably in around

685
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:56,234
2000 and beyond it started, you started fractioning off the different disciplines.

686
00:32:56,554 --> 00:33:01,438
But nothing wrong with being a, going to design track, being a pro, in fact that's a good

687
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:01,638
thing.

688
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:07,082
It's good to have programming and design skills together in that case.

689
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:07,943
Yes, it is.

690
00:33:07,983 --> 00:33:08,703
It's very, very good.

691
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:11,265
Yes.

692
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:11,545
Thank you.

693
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:15,503
Is it time?

694
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:16,690
