1
00:00:06,194 --> 00:00:07,797
Welcome, amazing game designers.

2
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:09,800
So psyched you decided to show up,

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,486
even though this is just about as late in GDC as you can get.

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,870
I am honored by your presence and attention.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,411
Thank you.

6
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:19,356
Welcome to Stop Shouting, Collaboration

7
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:20,678
Through Candid Conversation.

8
00:00:22,343 --> 00:00:25,725
You all know how challenging it is to lead in video game

9
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:26,305
development.

10
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:28,946
You're leading multidisciplinary teams

11
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:33,628
of people that maybe enjoy games more than they

12
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:35,588
enjoy other people occasionally.

13
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:38,309
It's not an easy role that you have.

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,670
For those who were not at my talk the other day,

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,311
long story short, I have been a producer and leader

16
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,532
in game development and made many games.

17
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:48,353
So I like to think I know what I'm talking about when I say,

18
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,754
leading video game development is hard.

19
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:57,357
Problem we're here to focus on this hour is that difficult conversations make it harder.

20
00:00:58,018 --> 00:01:03,525
Quick definition of difficult conversations, people disagree and emotions run high.

21
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:08,051
I'm going to talk throughout this workshop as if it's two people disagreeing for simplicity,

22
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:10,655
but of course it may be a group involved.

23
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:14,779
Non-rhetorical question, I'm hoping you will shout out

24
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:17,321
answers loud enough for my drumming

25
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,502
and trumpet damaged ears to hear.

26
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:23,005
Why do you care if you're good at difficult conversations?

27
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:27,688
You wanna make them easier, yes.

28
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:28,209
And?

29
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,771
You wanna make decisions, absolutely.

30
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:32,111
And?

31
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,730
They're usually really important.

32
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,751
Yes, that is fundamentally why I started

33
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,932
paying more attention to this.

34
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:44,454
These are the moments where you fire the person or you don't.

35
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:46,895
You hire the person or you don't.

36
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:48,976
You get the publishing deal or you don't.

37
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:51,977
The feature you love gets in the game or it doesn't.

38
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,438
Often, these difficult moments are

39
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,580
the most important moments of our careers, if not our lives.

40
00:01:59,241 --> 00:01:59,381
So.

41
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:03,468
That's why I, like you, want to be better at these.

42
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:10,110
Fortunately, data and experience tell us why and how we can do a better job of collaborating.

43
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,191
As always, I'm trying to give you as little of my opinion as possible.

44
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:19,793
I typically try to ground what I'm presenting in as much science as possible.

45
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:24,595
Some of these are quite scientific sources, a couple of journals on the bottom, Crucial

46
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:26,415
Conversations and Emotional Intelligence.

47
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:28,136
based on good science.

48
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,098
But I want to be completely candid with you all.

49
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:34,980
There are also books here that are not as science-based.

50
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,501
Creativity, Inc., upper right, for example,

51
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:39,162
is Ed Catmull's book.

52
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,142
For those who don't know,

53
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:42,083
he runs Pixar and Disney Animation

54
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:43,844
and knows something about helping

55
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:45,945
creative technical teams produce greatness.

56
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,947
Candor is a central theme of his book

57
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,628
and that's why it's included among my sources.

58
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:54,670
What does all that data and experience tell us?

59
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,112
That it is possible to more intelligently conduct

60
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:02,054
candid conversations in order to reach collaboration

61
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:04,055
through those difficult conversations.

62
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:07,757
A lot to do if you want to achieve that,

63
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:10,719
so breaking down into three sections for today.

64
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,540
First, examine your beliefs,

65
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,422
and if you don't already value conflict,

66
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:16,863
see if you can take the next step

67
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:19,344
in understanding the value in conflict

68
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,205
and maybe embracing it a bit more.

69
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:25,256
That should set you up to better collaborate

70
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:26,398
through that conflict.

71
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,811
If you're going to collaborate, you need to be thinking win-win.

72
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:32,472
You need to bring all of your cooperation

73
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:36,173
and then all of your assertion to reach collaboration.

74
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:40,554
That is roughly one gazillion times easier said than done,

75
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,895
which is why the third and final section

76
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:46,076
is boost emotional intelligence to boost success.

77
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:48,637
EI here is emotional intelligence.

78
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,418
We're going to walk through each of those sections.

79
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,219
I will ask you to participate with me and various things.

80
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,263
that ScienceSay will help you learn and remember and act on this long term.

81
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:03,246
I do have a handout for you.

82
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:04,987
Here's how you can get it.

83
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:10,952
If you have a US-based phone, you can text HappyBrain with no spaces to 444-999.

84
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:15,036
I want to be crystal clear because I hate disappointing people.

85
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:18,198
This will add you to my HappyBrain science mailing list.

86
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,323
We send out roughly monthly tips on applying the science of happiness to work.

87
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,345
It is one click to unsubscribe.

88
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:29,952
If you don't have a US-based phone, this texting system probably won't work for you,

89
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:32,935
in which case you can just email me.

90
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,978
I am scott at happybrainscience.com.

91
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,480
Or if you want the handout but you don't want to get on my mailing list,

92
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,721
email me and say, don't add me to your list,

93
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:44,263
you spamming jerk, just give me the handout.

94
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:47,165
I will show you this information again at the end of the talk,

95
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:49,826
if you're not sure whether or not you want the handout yet.

96
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:54,148
Lots more detail in the handout than we'll have time to go over today.

97
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,938
So intelligently conducting candid conversations

98
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,080
in order to collaborate begins by examining your beliefs

99
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,921
and perhaps taking the next step

100
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:04,362
in learning to value conflict.

101
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:07,904
So here is where I would like you to talk to each other,

102
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:12,507
ideally in pairs, but I don't want anybody to be left out.

103
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:14,269
So let's not leave anyone out

104
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:15,750
unless they wanna be left out.

105
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,951
So groups of three are just fine,

106
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:21,113
but ideally pairs for the next two minutes,

107
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:22,954
you are talking about two questions.

108
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:26,876
First one is, how do you personally feel about conflict?

109
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,597
When someone says, Greg, I need to talk to you

110
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:32,959
later in my office, do you go woohoo or oh God?

111
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,000
How do you personally relate to conflict?

112
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,742
And then the second question I want you to discuss

113
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:41,543
is how does your studio relate to conflict

114
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:43,544
or whatever organization you're with?

115
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,645
What's the culture of conflict in your organization?

116
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:50,207
Please pair and share, discuss for the next two minutes

117
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,247
those two questions.

118
00:05:56,134 --> 00:06:00,059
That's my way of letting you all know it's time to stop talking, please, and come back

119
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,821
to one group conversation.

120
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,725
Thanks so much for choosing to participate.

121
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:11,553
Regardless how you feel about conflict, science says it is coming your way.

122
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,524
This is the Tuckman model of team building,

123
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:18,965
first published in an academic journal in the 60s,

124
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:23,126
and has had a number of supporting studies published since then.

125
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,387
This is a model.

126
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:26,867
I learned a quote recently.

127
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:28,268
I think it's by George Box.

128
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:31,749
The quote is, all models are flawed.

129
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:33,290
Some models are useful.

130
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,276
Love that quote.

131
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:38,058
What it means is anytime you're dealing with a model,

132
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,720
you're dealing with an imperfect representation of reality.

133
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,282
Does team dynamics always work this way?

134
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,183
No, of course not.

135
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,325
But it's a useful model.

136
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:49,428
It helps us understand some of what's happening to us

137
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,149
in game development teams.

138
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,831
This science has stood the test of time.

139
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:55,833
Everybody starting at Intel,

140
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:59,036
at least when I started there, oh, 10 years ago or so,

141
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:01,338
we're all trained in the Tuckman model

142
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:02,339
because it's so useful.

143
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:04,573
Tuckman Model says,

144
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:07,935
when you get together a game development team

145
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,357
in the first place, you are forming.

146
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:14,140
Forming means you are very polite to each other,

147
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,262
it is very pleasant, and it is not very real,

148
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:18,603
nor is it very productive.

149
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:22,205
If someone irks you or says something you think is stupid

150
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:23,486
in a meeting, you're likely to go.

151
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:32,789
So that's forming, that's polite, but not terribly real.

152
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,251
Once you get to know each other a little more,

153
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:37,033
you start storming.

154
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:39,956
This is the conflict stage of team building.

155
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,198
That's not your job, that's my job.

156
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:44,259
Hey, you don't tell me what to do, yes I do.

157
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,941
We don't do it that way around here.

158
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:47,703
Well, you should do it that way around here.

159
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,905
Conflict comes in storming.

160
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:53,508
It's not bad, it's inevitable.

161
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:58,447
If you want to move through it, you cannot skip over it,

162
00:07:58,467 --> 00:07:59,468
according to this model.

163
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,892
And all of my game development and other team experiences

164
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,413
have confirmed this model for me.

165
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:07,376
It is impossible to go from forming to norming.

166
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,958
You have to go through storming.

167
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:10,378
to get to norming.

168
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,460
In norming, you're starting to know

169
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,800
what to expect from each other.

170
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:17,423
Oh yeah, that's your job to do that part of the code base,

171
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,163
not mine.

172
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,204
Oh yeah, that's how Kevin works.

173
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:22,806
You know, Stephanie, you need to ask her ahead of time

174
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:24,467
because she likes lots of warnings.

175
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:25,988
You're getting used to each other,

176
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:27,368
you're working better together,

177
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,730
but you're still not a well-oiled machine.

178
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,271
There's effort in working better together.

179
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:36,793
If you stay together long enough without a reorg, by the way,

180
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:41,255
any time a new team member comes or some significant change comes,

181
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:43,736
you go back to forming, and it's called reforming,

182
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:46,657
and then you can more quickly move through these stages.

183
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:50,378
But it's only when you move through all these stages

184
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:51,619
you get to the promised land.

185
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:55,810
performing. If you've ever been on a team where everything is clicking,

186
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,516
everybody knows who's going to do what and how, and the baton passes smoothly

187
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:05,102
without a lot of effort, it is a dream come true, especially in game development.

188
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:08,526
You only get there by working through the conflict.

189
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:13,568
If you're willing, I would like to ask you to stand up

190
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,489
to show me which stage you think you

191
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,191
and your colleagues are at now.

192
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,054
Those who saw my talk the other day, forgive the repetition.

193
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,535
Why am I asking you to stand up

194
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:23,755
and not just raise your hands?

195
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,678
Because science suggests when your body's active,

196
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:30,220
your brain produces more of what scientists call BDNF,

197
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,901
brain-derived neurotrophic factor,

198
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:33,943
which long scientific story short

199
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,104
you can think of as learning aid.

200
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:37,132
So, what you do is up to you.

201
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,274
You can raise your hand or nod your head or whatever you want.

202
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:41,795
But if you're willing, please on your feet

203
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,237
if you are currently forming in your game development.

204
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:47,498
Thank you.

205
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:49,179
A few of you.

206
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:49,880
Thank you.

207
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,602
If you are currently storming on your feet, please.

208
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:58,660
I would expect a high number of people given the topic of this session.

209
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,220
Thank you.

210
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,521
You can sit down.

211
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,183
Who has reached norming?

212
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:05,404
The storming is starting to die down.

213
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:07,185
You're doing pretty well.

214
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:08,326
Good.

215
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:08,986
Good on you.

216
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:09,567
Well done.

217
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:09,987
Thank you.

218
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:10,907
You can sit down.

219
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:14,450
And I'm guessing the few, the proud, the performing teams.

220
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,771
All of you.

221
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:17,371
Yes.

222
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,352
Good job, people.

223
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:22,087
Awesome, thank you, you can sit down.

224
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:23,928
If you stood up during forming or storming,

225
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:25,469
go talk to those performing people

226
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,090
and ask them how they got there.

227
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,791
What the science suggests is you get there

228
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:32,293
by working through conflict,

229
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,834
not skipping it, not placating it,

230
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:38,256
but working through it, which is what this session is about.

231
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:42,198
So when that inevitable conflict comes,

232
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:44,812
you will react.

233
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:47,194
I want you to imagine for a minute

234
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,115
that you are not at your best.

235
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,157
Somebody didn't tell you in a very skillful,

236
00:10:52,257 --> 00:10:55,739
polite way that your design sucked, let's say.

237
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:58,441
They told you in a really rude way that triggered you.

238
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:01,683
If you're not at your best,

239
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:04,124
you tend to bring one of these styles.

240
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,707
These styles very roughly correspond

241
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:10,128
with the fight or flight response.

242
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,691
Fight or flight response is our built-in innate fast,

243
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,553
much faster than our logical brains.

244
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,936
Our limbic system and brain stem respond with fight or flight.

245
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:22,078
It's not a switch, it's a continuum.

246
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,701
You can be a little stressed out or full-on panicked.

247
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:27,323
And when you're towards fight or flight,

248
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:29,285
your brain figuratively shrinks.

249
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:35,071
so that your limbic system and brainstem, the parts of your brain that look very much like the brains of all other mammals,

250
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:37,253
come to the front burner and they say,

251
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:38,574
Hey, I've got the answers!

252
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:40,837
The answers are fight, run,

253
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:43,359
or, although you hear about it less because it doesn't rhyme,

254
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,981
your third option is just...

255
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:48,268
Because if you shut up and stay still,

256
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,488
the mountain lion might not see you

257
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:50,709
and you might get away that way.

258
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:53,029
Awesome for dealing with mountain lions

259
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:55,750
and not so helpful for dealing with each other

260
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,911
and problems in game development.

261
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,452
So very roughly, those correspond to fighting.

262
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:03,092
Some people get very aggressive.

263
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:04,852
Oh yeah, well I'll tell you what to do

264
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:06,253
with your stupid feedback, right?

265
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:09,974
And some people get super cooperative, essentially.

266
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:13,803
running, I'll give you whatever you want.

267
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:15,163
Hey, dude, whatever, that's fine.

268
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,204
We can do it your way.

269
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:21,187
And some of us just want to avoid conflict altogether.

270
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:24,469
These are very natural human responses.

271
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:30,252
Conflict only until very recent, well, still to present day,

272
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:32,253
really, if I think about it in a depressing way.

273
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:35,675
conflict can be dangerous or deadly for human beings.

274
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,516
So you're wired to survive,

275
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:42,257
and so this fight-or-flight response is a natural way

276
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:44,638
to stay alive and avoid conflict,

277
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:47,699
because you tend not to win conflicts with mountain lions.

278
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,681
But in the studio, you're not dealing with mountain lions,

279
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:54,022
but your brain is wired to deal with mountain lions.

280
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:57,886
If you're willing, I know I'm putting these nasty labels

281
00:12:57,926 --> 00:12:59,407
and you would never describe yourself

282
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:01,128
as aggressive or acquiescing,

283
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:04,769
but if you're willing to map yourself to one of these three,

284
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:07,910
let's do a quick second round of standing up.

285
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,892
If you wanna fight when conflict comes on your feet, please.

286
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,392
The aggressors.

287
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,153
Again, you're not at your best.

288
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:16,474
You're being pushed into this.

289
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:17,454
Thank you, fighters.

290
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:18,054
You can sit down.

291
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:19,695
I said sit down, fighter!

292
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,935
Sorry, bad joke.

293
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:25,001
If you acquiesce, hey dude, whatever you want, that's fine.

294
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,262
I'll adjust the schedule.

295
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:27,623
I'll do the feature your way.

296
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:29,084
On your feet, please.

297
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:32,166
All the fighters are like, ooh, can I hire that guy?

298
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:33,947
Thank you, you can sit down.

299
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:37,008
And if you're just like, I'm running, I'm avoiding,

300
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,649
I'm not talking to you, I gotta go home.

301
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:43,132
If you just tend to avoid conflict, please, on your feet.

302
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,720
and see how we have different styles

303
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,380
and part of your job as a leader

304
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,241
is to understand your own natural style,

305
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:54,162
your teammates natural style, and how to work with it.

306
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:59,444
There are better versions of these responses, right?

307
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,625
Aggression can just be asserting.

308
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:05,846
How do you get calmer and more logical

309
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,047
so you can bring a more constructive response?

310
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:11,988
You learn to value conflict as not being so threatening.

311
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:17,233
I hope you'll all forgive me for doing what I virtually never do, putting a ton of text

312
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:17,793
on screen.

313
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,595
I think it's terrible in presentations.

314
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:23,878
But I wanted to be sure to get this quote right, because it's from a person who's way

315
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:28,823
smarter than I am, who published this article, The Conflict-Positive Organization.

316
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:32,706
It depends on us in the Journal of Organizational Behavior.

317
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:34,647
Dean says, as you can see.

318
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:41,414
By developing cooperative relationships and the skills to discuss diverse views open-mindedly,

319
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:47,981
organizations can empower managers and employees to use conflict to probe problems,

320
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:53,506
create innovative solutions, learn from their experience, and enliven their relationships.

321
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,532
It does indeed depend on us,

322
00:14:56,612 --> 00:15:00,614
and if we can embrace conflict a bit more as a useful tool,

323
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:02,995
we might respond a bit better to it

324
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,196
and not be so fight or flighty about conflict.

325
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:11,319
Conflict makes the unseen visible.

326
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:14,438
Your job as a leader in game development

327
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:17,680
is to find and fix problems and make things better, right?

328
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,841
That is impossible if you don't know a problem exists.

329
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:24,563
When conflict arises, you know there's a problem there.

330
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:28,084
Anyone had conflict bring an issue to their attention

331
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:30,205
that they did not know was there before the conflict?

332
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:32,426
See all the hands.

333
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:35,749
So this is one of the many values in conflict.

334
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:37,971
It makes the unseen visible.

335
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:41,093
I apologize, I don't have much time for stories today,

336
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:43,735
but Ed Catmull's book is filled with great stories.

337
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:46,717
Creativity Inc., if you want inspiration and stories

338
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,419
around some of these key points I'm making here

339
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:50,960
on valuing conflict.

340
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,665
Conflict can also solve those problems that they raise

341
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:58,226
and bring balance, right?

342
00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:01,589
You might have a pair of people that's way out of balance.

343
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:06,192
John feels fantastic, he thinks the project's going great,

344
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,474
and Julie thinks, why is John such a fucking asshole

345
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,616
and making my life miserable all the time at work?

346
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,258
Conflict can actually make that

347
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:16,420
a little more balanced for people.

348
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,542
Conflict is part of the creative process.

349
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,824
It's how you make great games.

350
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:25,589
Given the short amount of time we have, I will leave it there.

351
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,472
Now, beliefs don't change with a snap of a fingers, right?

352
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,795
But maybe, just maybe, your brain has heard something

353
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:34,895
that has made sense to you.

354
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:38,164
and beliefs are starting to shift for you.

355
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,888
So I invite and encourage you to take a minute or so

356
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,552
in silence and think, what have you heard so far?

357
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:47,333
What's relevant for you?

358
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,996
And what, if anything, is starting to shift

359
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,497
in your beliefs around conflict?

360
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:54,320
Please think or write for a minute of silence.

361
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:58,945
Wrap up, please.

362
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,253
We have time for maybe one quick question.

363
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:05,075
Ideally at one of these mics,

364
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,677
but if you're trapped in the middle of a row,

365
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:07,918
just shout it out to me.

366
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:10,121
Please tell me what questions you have so far.

367
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:15,808
You should know, I'll spare you my little lecture.

368
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:18,050
If I ask you for questions and you don't give me any,

369
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,792
I assume it means you've completely understood

370
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,094
and agreed with everything I've said.

371
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:21,334
Sir.

372
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,610
I heard you except for the very first few words.

373
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:45,058
So for the recording and those who couldn't hear, how can you define conflict in a way

374
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,901
that it stays away from toxicity and damage?

375
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:49,702
I don't actually.

376
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:55,467
I think conflict is conflict and it runs this full spectrum from incredibly damaging.

377
00:17:56,028 --> 00:18:01,009
I mean, who here is still really pissed off at someone that they have been pissed off

378
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:05,211
at for over a year because of something that happened over a year ago in game development,

379
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:05,511
right?

380
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:06,871
I mean, a ton of us are.

381
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:11,252
By the way, quick aside, science of happiness says those who forgive end up happier.

382
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,293
Happier brains fundamentally work better.

383
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:17,154
So not my topic, but if you can find your way to forgiveness, you'll be happier and

384
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:17,654
work better.

385
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:18,734
Now...

386
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:19,175
Um...

387
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,920
But it is the full spectrum, right?

388
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,780
And I've had people shouting at me,

389
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,441
and I have not been at my best,

390
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,861
and I have damaged relationships when I'm down here.

391
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,342
And I've also gone into a disagreement thinking,

392
00:18:31,562 --> 00:18:33,422
oh God, this is gonna suck so much,

393
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:36,783
and come out literally crying tears of joy

394
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:38,783
because we had the most amazing breakthrough,

395
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:40,544
and our relationship is much better now.

396
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:44,724
My job in this hour is to try to move you up that line

397
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:46,245
as far as we can together.

398
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,085
Fair enough, does that answer the question?

399
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:49,545
Awesome, thank you.

400
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,399
All right, so quick repetition,

401
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,721
because science says repetition causes learning.

402
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:55,902
Repetition causes learning.

403
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:57,003
Repetition causes learning.

404
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:58,124
So I'm telling you again,

405
00:18:58,244 --> 00:19:00,106
even though you smart people just heard this,

406
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:02,648
to consider examining your beliefs

407
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,610
and seeing if you can take the next step

408
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,791
in valuing conflict.

409
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:09,494
Know yourself and your style when you're not at your best

410
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:10,896
and when you are at your best.

411
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:14,057
Know how your team tends to respond to conflict

412
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:15,018
and relate to conflict,

413
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:17,079
and see if you can take the next step

414
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,701
in seeing at least the potential for value in conflict,

415
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,902
even collaboration through conflict,

416
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:24,923
so that you can show up at your best

417
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,124
and not like, God damn it,

418
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,665
I have to fight with this guy now.

419
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:32,107
Examine your beliefs and learn to value conflict.

420
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:36,390
Then, to collaborate in a difficult conversation,

421
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,531
you have to be thinking win-win.

422
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,671
You're gonna get there by cooperating and then asserting.

423
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:46,693
If you come at conflict with a positive frame of mind,

424
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:51,314
you might achieve one of these nicer labels, right?

425
00:19:51,414 --> 00:19:53,195
Aggression turns to assertion.

426
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,895
Assertiveness is good, right?

427
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:57,196
Acquiescing to somebody all the time

428
00:19:57,256 --> 00:19:58,716
turns into just being cooperative.

429
00:19:59,417 --> 00:19:59,637
Right?

430
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:03,018
And avoiding things means you let some stuff go.

431
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:07,101
These are the more positive versions of all this, and there are upsides to all of these,

432
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:07,421
right?

433
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:09,442
Let's take let it go as one example.

434
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:14,744
If I don't like the way you style your hair, it is literally none of my goddamn business.

435
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,567
I should let it go and not talk to you about it in game development.

436
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:24,151
So there are advantages to all these things, styles, but the science and the evidence suggests

437
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,734
that none of these styles by themselves can get you to collaboration.

438
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:33,878
You don't get to collaboration if you're just awesome at asserting, nor do you get to collaboration

439
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,879
if you're just awesome at cooperating.

440
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,463
You get there by being awesome at both and bringing all of both.

441
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,152
Bring all of your assertiveness and all of your cooperation,

442
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,133
and then you're combining ideas, which

443
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,694
is largely how creativity and innovation happen.

444
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:54,056
How do you do that?

445
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:55,956
Well, you've got to be thinking win-win.

446
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:58,958
I don't have time for a full story,

447
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:00,578
but I'll tell you a story of a colleague who

448
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:03,159
was going in to have a discussion with somebody else.

449
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,140
And I said, I hope it goes well.

450
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,841
And she said, it's going to go well.

451
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:08,241
She just needs to apologize.

452
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,324
That is not a win-win mindset, and I would have bet multiple years of salary that conversation

453
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:18,925
went badly, and it did.

454
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,767
It wasn't my role to alter it or stop it.

455
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:23,249
By the way, you might be thinking, dude, you're up here talking about that.

456
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:24,249
Why didn't you tell her what to do?

457
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,971
It wasn't my role to tell her what to do.

458
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,492
But you've got to be thinking win-win.

459
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:32,395
So see if you can think that way before you're in the confrontation with somebody else.

460
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,957
What's an ideal outcome for both of you?

461
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:41,097
Then cooperate first, because cooperation earns your ability

462
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:44,618
to assert and earns cooperation from the other side.

463
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,898
Some quick ideas about cooperating.

464
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:51,319
Starts by seeking first to understand, then be understood.

465
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:54,080
Who's read The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People?

466
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,501
Fantastic book, decades old, but a classic

467
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,181
with millions of copies sold because it is so useful.

468
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:03,502
One of The Seven Habits is simply this.

469
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:06,403
Seek first to understand, then to be understood.

470
00:22:07,303 --> 00:22:11,485
You should be able to state your opponent's position,

471
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,946
if I can use that phrase for quick clarity.

472
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,147
I should be able to state my opponent's position

473
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,568
to his or her satisfaction.

474
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:23,249
You should be able to say what the other person believes

475
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,870
until they say, yep, that's it.

476
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:30,272
How many of us have gone into a conversation thinking,

477
00:22:30,712 --> 00:22:32,293
oh boy, this is gonna really suck,

478
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,474
and then realized there was a misunderstanding

479
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:35,434
and things weren't so bad?

480
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:39,753
It happens all the time, but we still forget to do this.

481
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:43,674
We go in and say, you know, when you rip me a new one

482
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:45,534
in a code review, it's just,

483
00:22:46,194 --> 00:22:47,535
oh, that wasn't what you were trying to do.

484
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,495
You were trying to point out the code could be much better.

485
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:51,156
I'm sorry, maybe I was a little oversensitive.

486
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:54,537
So seek first to understand, tell the other person

487
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:56,377
their position to their satisfaction.

488
00:22:57,698 --> 00:23:00,438
With feeling, show them you understand.

489
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,219
Get them to feel that you understand.

490
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:05,965
There's something known as the fast food rule.

491
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:09,208
Actually comes from a doctor who wrote a parenting

492
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:12,331
book of all things, but parenting books and books

493
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,953
for managing teams in game development,

494
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:15,835
surprising amount of overlap.

495
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:19,238
The fast food rules comes from the fact

496
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,240
that when you go to a fast food restaurant,

497
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:23,122
you drive up to the drive-thru, and you're like,

498
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:23,943
I'll take a hamburger.

499
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:27,624
a veggie burger and some fries.

500
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:28,764
And what do they do?

501
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:30,965
Immediately, you want a hamburger,

502
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:32,725
veggie burger and some fries, is that right?

503
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:34,225
That's what you should do

504
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,086
in a difficult conversation as well.

505
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:39,807
Somebody tells you, now, you gotta be careful about this

506
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:42,667
because if you exactly parrot back what somebody says

507
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,328
the way a fast food person would,

508
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:46,928
you might feel irritated and annoyed,

509
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,828
like you're mocking me, you a-hole, right?

510
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:51,209
This can go very badly, very quickly.

511
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:54,632
But if you paraphrase back to people

512
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:57,254
and let some emotion come into it

513
00:23:57,294 --> 00:23:59,977
at about 2 thirds of their emotional intensity.

514
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:02,828
It's amazing how well this works.

515
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:06,711
So if somebody comes at you and they just seem really frustrated,

516
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:09,974
nine out of 10 frustrated, again, you

517
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:11,675
don't want to tell people how you want to feel,

518
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,317
but you want to show them that you get it.

519
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:15,458
You sound really frustrated.

520
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,900
I can hear how frustrated you are, and I can

521
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:19,482
understand how frustrated you are.

522
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:22,144
If I were dealing with a really buggy animation tool,

523
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,565
I'd be frustrated too.

524
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,648
You're just trying to say, I feel you.

525
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:31,090
Feeling felt is a primary human need,

526
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,391
according to psychologists.

527
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:34,993
And so what many of us do,

528
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:38,876
I don't want to indict a whole gender at once,

529
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:42,419
but many of us want to go directly to fixing the problem.

530
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,980
Oh, you don't need to be frustrated

531
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,762
because I've got Julie on re-architecting the anamnesis.

532
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:49,444
You don't need to feel, skip right past the validation.

533
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:53,828
That validation is cooperation and it opens the door

534
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,050
for the other person hearing what else you have to say.

535
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,994
When you start not with fixing the problem, but validating what you've heard and how they feel,

536
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:09,240
they will relax. Oh, you get it. You get my frustration. Now I'm receptive to hearing

537
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:15,565
what you have to say. So, particle operation is reflecting back what you've heard, stating

538
00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:22,731
the other person's position, and showing that you feel it. You get their emotions in this context.

539
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:27,684
Be willing to change your mind.

540
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:31,066
One of the favorite quotes I have learned

541
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:33,528
in my multiple decades of career is this one.

542
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:36,030
It's better to be effective than right.

543
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:39,353
We get hung up on being right.

544
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:42,675
It's better to be effective.

545
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:44,677
If you're not willing to change your mind,

546
00:25:44,697 --> 00:25:46,118
you're not willing to collaborate,

547
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:48,299
and you shouldn't be in that difficult conversation

548
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,280
with someone.

549
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,801
Those are a few tips for cooperating.

550
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,704
Only after you've exhibited some cooperation

551
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:01,827
and after you've seen the other person's shoulders drop

552
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:06,430
or brow unfurrow or jaw relax a little bit,

553
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:10,093
that is your window to bring some assertion.

554
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,410
How do I want you to assert?

555
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,051
If you're willing and able and you wanna participate,

556
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:18,613
please on your feet and pose like a superhero.

557
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:20,954
I'm gonna ask you to hold this for two minutes.

558
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:23,255
So take a pose you can hold for two minutes.

559
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,916
You just need to take up a wide amount of physical space.

560
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:28,777
Awesome power posing, thank you.

561
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:32,078
Now hand up if you've seen Amy Cuddy's TED Talk.

562
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:35,160
Ted is a conference, produces videos.

563
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,700
Amy Cuddy is a Harvard professor

564
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,521
with the number one TED Talk in the world

565
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,482
that basically says this.

566
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,870
You're all Harvard students now.

567
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:43,751
Congratulations.

568
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,672
I knew I had a room full of smart-looking people.

569
00:26:46,152 --> 00:26:49,153
Now, you're all randomly divided in two.

570
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:51,835
You're each asked to spit into a vial before this begins.

571
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:53,135
Sorry, that's a little gross, but we

572
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,076
need to measure a couple things in your bloodstream.

573
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:58,038
Testosterone, present in women and men

574
00:26:58,098 --> 00:26:59,518
and associated with assertiveness,

575
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,719
and cortisol, which is a hormone that

576
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,341
indicates you're stressed out and reactive to stress.

577
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:07,142
And then half of you are told, without any language

578
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:10,284
about power or superheroes or anything else, half of you

579
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:12,105
are told, would you please take a wide body

580
00:27:12,145 --> 00:27:13,426
posture for a couple of minutes.

581
00:27:13,886 --> 00:27:15,507
The other half of you, please don't do this,

582
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:19,389
are told, get small, fold up on yourself, maybe touch your neck.

583
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,514
and in just two minutes your testosterone assertiveness goes down

584
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:28,199
and your cortisol stress reactivity goes up and the opposite happens over here.

585
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,163
Testosterone assertiveness comes up, cortisol stress reactivity

586
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:35,687
goes down. If you want to be calm and assertive...

587
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,630
Stand like this for two minutes before you go in to have that difficult conversation

588
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,752
Now science is not perfect. Science is a conversation and some studies are not finding as

589
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:53,715
Strongly those physical effects, but there are a number of studies here and they consistently are showing some psychological effects

590
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:59,778
We feel better when we take up more space. Amy Cuddy's further studies have actually found

591
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:02,380
We are least assertive on our smartphones,

592
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,541
see where my hands are,

593
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:05,522
more assertive on our tablets,

594
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:07,523
and most assertive on our PCs.

595
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:12,665
No lie, tricky, I love science, it's so awesome.

596
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:15,827
So if you have to give someone some difficult feedback

597
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:17,467
and you're in Chicago and they're in Florida

598
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,888
and it's midnight and you gotta do it over email,

599
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:21,929
get one of those ergonomic keyboards

600
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:24,371
where you can spread the halves out and be like,

601
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:28,813
hi Kevin, I would like to discuss this with you.

602
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,554
By the way, works for games,

603
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,155
if you like strategy games like I do,

604
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:33,555
and enemy troops are coming at your base,

605
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:34,736
put your keyboard way over here,

606
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:35,837
your mouse way over here,

607
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,838
and you're like, it's cool, I got walls,

608
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:39,439
I got troops, everything's fine.

609
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:41,380
Instead of, ah!

610
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,642
Okay, thank you, superheroes, you can sit down.

611
00:28:46,203 --> 00:28:49,905
If you adopt that wide posture before or during a conflict,

612
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:53,928
your brain seems to follow what your body is doing,

613
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:56,209
and you stay calmer and more assertive.

614
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:02,685
To begin this conversation, you wanna ask permission

615
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:06,287
and then address directly, privately, and respectfully.

616
00:29:07,187 --> 00:29:08,708
Very quickly, let me go over those.

617
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:09,388
Permission.

618
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:11,609
I'm trained as an executive coach,

619
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:14,350
and coaches are trained to ask lots of questions,

620
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,672
including, may I ask you a question?

621
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:18,773
I know I just did, but we're trained to say,

622
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:19,813
may I ask you a question?

623
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:21,494
May I provide some feedback?

624
00:29:21,614 --> 00:29:23,635
Is it okay if I reflect back what I'm hearing?

625
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:25,296
What does that permission do?

626
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:26,956
It gets buy-in from the other side.

627
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:30,186
You are gonna get somewhere if you have permission.

628
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:31,807
Now this might feel silly.

629
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:33,047
Well, who's gonna say no to that?

630
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:35,248
Try it and see how often you get no.

631
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:38,529
I swear this has made me a better manager,

632
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:41,190
a better father, a better husband.

633
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,011
Because often I start a conversation thinking,

634
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,352
oh, my wife really needs a pep talk right now.

635
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:49,573
And I say, honey, can I share a few thoughts with you?

636
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:51,814
And she's like, not yet, I'm still processing.

637
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,475
It's like, oh, I wouldn't have asked that a year ago

638
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:56,416
and this conversation would have gone a lot worse.

639
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,994
Get permission before you have a difficult conversation.

640
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:03,376
And if I say, hey, do you have a few minutes?

641
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,237
I wanna talk to you about the animation pipeline.

642
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:07,519
And you're like, hmm, not a good time right now.

643
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,579
Go away.

644
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,681
Don't set yourself up for failure.

645
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:13,383
Some of us run hangry.

646
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:14,784
You know this word?

647
00:30:14,824 --> 00:30:15,964
If you're not from the US, you might,

648
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:17,205
it's hungry and angry.

649
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:19,027
I try to be a nice guy.

650
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:22,049
If it's 4.40 and I'm hungry, I will be an,

651
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:23,289
it's all to you.

652
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:26,729
So please, if you come and say, hey, I've got to talk to you,

653
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:28,850
and I say, I'm low blood sugar.

654
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,890
Could you please come back later?

655
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,991
Do yourself a favor and come back later.

656
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:33,971
That's permission.

657
00:30:34,011 --> 00:30:35,232
Then address directly.

658
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:38,693
When I do coaching and when I manage people, often I hear,

659
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:41,373
Joe is such a jerk, man.

660
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:42,754
Joe is so unprofessional.

661
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:45,575
Joe repeatedly does these insulting things in meetings.

662
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:46,675
Joe does this.

663
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:47,655
Joe never does that.

664
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:48,575
He's supposed to do this.

665
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:49,456
He's not doing it.

666
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:50,856
Me.

667
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:52,477
Have you talked to Joe?

668
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:54,264
No?

669
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:58,846
Okay, let's go directly to the source of the problem.

670
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,488
Now some of us think issues through

671
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,109
by talking with a trusted friend

672
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:04,409
who's gonna keep it confidential.

673
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,891
That might be okay, but please don't be the person

674
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:10,473
who talks to everybody in your studio

675
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:12,414
except the person you have the issue with.

676
00:31:12,934 --> 00:31:15,376
Please go directly to the person you have the issue with.

677
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:19,018
Then address them privately with nobody watching

678
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:23,500
if at all possible, and bring as much respect as possible.

679
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,142
Respect is the key to getting collaboration

680
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:29,642
into difficult conversation.

681
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,944
Challenge behaviors and ideas, not people.

682
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:38,106
I know this sounds basic and easy,

683
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:41,247
but most of us screw this up on a regular basis.

684
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:44,508
So much so that psychology has a phrase for it,

685
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,709
fundamental attribution error.

686
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:52,845
The fundamental attribution error is whenever we see ourselves behaving badly, we know it's

687
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:54,086
because of circumstances.

688
00:31:54,587 --> 00:32:00,592
When we see other people behaving badly, it's because of their character.

689
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:06,817
That is, if I cut you off on I-5, it's because my wife's in the hospital in premature labor

690
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:09,039
and I really need to get there quickly.

691
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:12,201
If you cut me off on I-5, it's because you are a jerk.

692
00:32:13,355 --> 00:32:15,136
That's the fundamental attribution error.

693
00:32:15,236 --> 00:32:18,999
I invite you to stop making it by stop assuming

694
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:22,141
that people's behavior is because of their character.

695
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:24,583
It's almost never due to their character

696
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:27,185
and almost always due to their circumstances.

697
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,086
They're under pressure.

698
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:31,728
You don't know it, but their manager has told them

699
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,551
they're on probation because their performance isn't great.

700
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:36,892
Or you don't know it, but their mom is...

701
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:44,015
Sick with some horrible disease. I'm not trying to get all depressing on people. I'm trying to say we all need a break

702
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:46,636
Let's give each other a break and address

703
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:50,558
behavior and ideas not people's character

704
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:58,181
If you do that you're on a healthy path towards calm assertion and you're on a path towards

705
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:01,042
collaborating through cooperation then

706
00:33:01,503 --> 00:33:01,923
assertion

707
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:05,075
If you have a question, please go to a mic,

708
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:06,115
I'll take them in a minute.

709
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:09,097
A minute of small group discussion, pairs or threes.

710
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:10,297
What are you hearing?

711
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:12,278
How can you use this in your jobs, please?

712
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:15,139
Discuss.

713
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:20,642
Thank you, wrap up please.

714
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:22,362
Time for one question, sir.

715
00:33:23,723 --> 00:33:24,223
You are on.

716
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:30,884
Hi, I was just curious how much of what you've said depends on the cultural values of the

717
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:32,205
people in the conflict?

718
00:33:32,826 --> 00:33:36,328
What a fantastic question I know almost nothing about.

719
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:41,131
It is a great question and I apologize for my ignorance.

720
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:45,873
I should have, I mean I asked in my first session, please stand up if you didn't grow

721
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,535
up speaking English and over the half the room stood up.

722
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:50,856
So that's a fantastic question.

723
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:55,960
And really, I'm embarrassed I don't have more information about culture here.

724
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,243
I think briefly from the ignorant standpoint, culture matters.

725
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:01,664
Know the culture.

726
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:04,767
If it's not your culture, it's especially important to know the culture.

727
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:08,870
Lots of resources out there on cultural training, cultural sensitivity.

728
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,271
Just not me, sorry.

729
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:10,511
Okay.

730
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:12,515
Fair enough, dodge of the question.

731
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:13,877
I can't really answer it.

732
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:15,699
It's a great question though.

733
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:17,782
You're gonna get me to go learn more about that

734
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:19,244
so I can answer that better next time.

735
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,886
Thank you for a great question.

736
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:21,907
Sorry I couldn't answer it.

737
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:24,250
Anyone here able to answer that question better?

738
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:27,594
Smart people in the room?

739
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,576
No, all right, well.

740
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:31,297
Ask people what their culture is, right?

741
00:34:31,957 --> 00:34:35,539
I know certain cultures thrive on disagreement

742
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:38,761
much more than others, so certainly factor that in.

743
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:41,023
Quick repetition for the sake of learning.

744
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:43,885
To collaborate, you need to bring all of your assertion

745
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:46,346
and all of your cooperation, but not in that order.

746
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:47,887
Cooperate first.

747
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,568
Define the win-win.

748
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,510
Go in with a win-win mindset.

749
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,211
Then cooperate first.

750
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,752
Seek first to understand.

751
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:55,892
Listen.

752
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,694
Be willing to give or flex or change your mind.

753
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:03,476
Then you're in a position to assert early, calmly,

754
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:05,177
and with compelling communication.

755
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:10,020
Sounds easy, and as you all know, it is not easy,

756
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,941
which is why third and final section

757
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:14,062
is on boosting emotional intelligence

758
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:15,643
in order to boost success.

759
00:35:16,844 --> 00:35:19,565
Emotional intelligence is real effectiveness.

760
00:35:20,658 --> 00:35:22,418
We have a very male industry.

761
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:24,619
I'm guessing I'm preaching to the choir here,

762
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:28,920
but sometimes our very male industry mocks the soft skills

763
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:32,181
and things like emotional intelligence, ooh.

764
00:35:32,802 --> 00:35:36,083
Emotional intelligence is power and effectiveness.

765
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:37,983
And if you think you don't need it,

766
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:40,644
you should not be leading in game development.

767
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:43,065
Emotional intelligence is the ability

768
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:46,226
to understand other people's emotions and your own

769
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:49,627
and work effectively in that context of emotions.

770
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:52,949
quick tour of emotional intelligence.

771
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,530
Starts by being aware of other people's emotions.

772
00:35:57,451 --> 00:36:01,573
I never, ever go outside of my slides

773
00:36:01,753 --> 00:36:03,754
except for this moment in this workshop

774
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:06,816
because I love this emotional intelligence quiz so much.

775
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,397
This resource is in the handout.

776
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:13,339
This is from Greater Good Science Center at Berkeley.

777
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:16,320
They have this wonderful emotional intelligence quiz.

778
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:19,462
I am just going to whet your appetite with it.

779
00:36:20,182 --> 00:36:23,944
This woman is one, embarrassed, two, afraid,

780
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:26,645
three, sad, or four, surprised.

781
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:28,686
I don't want you to influence each other,

782
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:30,526
so I'm gonna say one, two, three, throw,

783
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:32,707
and then I want you to put up a number of fingers.

784
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,328
If you think she's embarrassed, show me one finger.

785
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:36,288
If you show me one finger,

786
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:37,689
I'd appreciate it if it's this one.

787
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:43,011
Up two, fear, three, sadness, four, surprise.

788
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:44,972
Anyone not clear what I'm asking you to do?

789
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:47,373
One, two, three, throw.

790
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:48,831
Show me fingers.

791
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:50,332
Now, first, look around the room.

792
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:53,594
Many of you are wrong, because you don't have the same number

793
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:55,736
up, right?

794
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:58,338
Non-scientific survey says, oh, it's

795
00:36:58,558 --> 00:37:00,860
kind of a toss-up between one and two.

796
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,961
I will go with one.

797
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:03,962
She's embarrassed.

798
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:04,602
Wrong.

799
00:37:04,662 --> 00:37:06,724
If you showed one, not trying to make you feel bad,

800
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:07,645
but trying to get you to.

801
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:11,630
recognize how difficult it is to recognize emotions.

802
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:15,615
Part of what I love about this quiz is it doesn't just tell you you're wrong but

803
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:18,559
exactly how you're wrong and how you could be right next time.

804
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,604
So they tell you that she has a fearful face and they show you what

805
00:37:22,945 --> 00:37:25,588
happens when somebody is afraid in their face.

806
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:30,777
Let's do at least one more, because it's just fun.

807
00:37:31,637 --> 00:37:33,898
This guy is one, flirting with you.

808
00:37:34,178 --> 00:37:35,478
Two, interested.

809
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:36,718
Three, happy.

810
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:37,898
Four, polite.

811
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,719
One finger for flirting, two for interested,

812
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,539
three for happy, four for polite.

813
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,900
One, two, three, show please.

814
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,861
Lots of fours, some threes.

815
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:53,541
I may have primed you by being the chief happiness officer

816
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:54,741
of happy brain science.

817
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:55,941
Oh, you said four.

818
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,172
Polite, sorry, three.

819
00:37:58,232 --> 00:37:59,853
I thought I primed you for the right answer.

820
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:00,614
I guess I didn't.

821
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:03,596
The difference between politeness and happiness

822
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:07,098
is whether the eyes are smiling and his eyes are smiling,

823
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:09,659
so he is really happy.

824
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,460
Fun, right?

825
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,061
You'd like to do all of them, right?

826
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:16,023
Great, that's an exercise for you after this workshop.

827
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,634
By the way, if you get good at that one,

828
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:21,515
I encourage you to find,

829
00:38:22,335 --> 00:38:23,896
there's a pointer to it from the handout

830
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:24,796
if you want the handout.

831
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:28,078
New York Times has emotional intelligence quiz

832
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,038
where you get this much of the face.

833
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:31,699
It is awesome.

834
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,541
You can understand a lot of somebody's emotional state

835
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:37,301
just by seeing their eyes.

836
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,943
If you are ever in a difficult conversation,

837
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:43,143
make lots of eye contact.

838
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:46,740
Depends on your culture, of course, how much eye contact is appropriate.

839
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,043
And if you overdo eye contact, it can feel threatening.

840
00:38:50,143 --> 00:38:54,046
So please be human and normal about it.

841
00:38:54,146 --> 00:38:59,091
But if you're not sometimes making eye contact, you're missing an opportunity to understand

842
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:00,512
how the other person is feeling.

843
00:39:02,932 --> 00:39:06,315
That's emotional intelligence of other people's emotions.

844
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,358
The next step is to be more aware of your own emotions.

845
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:13,701
And as psychologists say, name it to tame it.

846
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:16,063
Why do they say name it to tame it?

847
00:39:16,803 --> 00:39:19,966
Because the part of your brain that has access to language

848
00:39:20,106 --> 00:39:21,607
and can label your emotions

849
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:24,229
is different than that limbic system.

850
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:27,621
that's in the driver's seat when you're feeling emotions.

851
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:31,524
So just saying, what's the word for this,

852
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:36,747
shifts some of your brain activity

853
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:38,428
to a calmer, more logical,

854
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:40,189
more uniquely human part of the brain.

855
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,631
More glucose, oxygen, et cetera,

856
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,972
go to your prefrontal cortex

857
00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:45,813
and other more logical parts of your brain

858
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,194
when you think, what is this that I'm feeling?

859
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:52,117
Feelings are really feelings in your body.

860
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:57,160
If you practice what is called a body scan meditation,

861
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,188
you get better at recognizing your own emotions.

862
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:03,661
Hands up, please, if you have ever meditated in your life.

863
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:05,783
According to surveys, it's about half of us.

864
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:08,145
Looks like more than that here.

865
00:40:08,265 --> 00:40:10,607
Coincidence that you all who ended up as leaders

866
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:12,188
practice meditation?

867
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:13,129
I think not.

868
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:14,270
Science suggests not.

869
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,171
Not here to talk about mindfulness,

870
00:40:16,231 --> 00:40:18,213
but growing mountain of evidence says

871
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,195
it does awesome things for us,

872
00:40:20,815 --> 00:40:23,918
including boosts self-awareness,

873
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:28,241
self-control, quality of relationships, and happiness.

874
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,318
So if you choose to practice mindfulness,

875
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:33,399
you'll get better at those things

876
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:34,760
and probably be a better leader.

877
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:38,323
So body scan meditation, all you're doing

878
00:40:38,363 --> 00:40:41,205
is focusing your attention on how one part of your body

879
00:40:41,245 --> 00:40:42,246
at a time feels.

880
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,108
For emotional intelligence, you're

881
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:46,229
typically working with this part of the body, right?

882
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:48,411
Is my forehead all furrowed up or not?

883
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:50,352
Am I clenching my teeth or not?

884
00:40:50,372 --> 00:40:51,934
Are my shoulders up or not?

885
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:53,975
Does my chest feel tight or not?

886
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:55,696
Is there a pit in my stomach or not?

887
00:40:56,828 --> 00:41:03,151
Practice makes progress at more quickly recognizing and more accurately labeling

888
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:06,433
those feelings in your body, those emotions that you have.

889
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:13,556
Then when you go to label that emotion, what many of us do is we go with the big three.

890
00:41:14,277 --> 00:41:20,420
The big three are I'm mad, I'm sad, I'm afraid. Those are the big three because they're very common.

891
00:41:20,963 --> 00:41:25,387
But part of emotional intelligence is boosting your ability to accurately label your emotions.

892
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:30,410
And there are hundreds of different words that describe emotion in addition to mad,

893
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,012
sad and afraid.

894
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:35,174
Let's see how many of them we can get in about 15 seconds.

895
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:39,577
Don't raise your hands, just shout out any emotion, any word that describes a human emotion.

896
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:40,658
Disgust.

897
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:41,078
Disgust.

898
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:41,459
And?

899
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:43,040
Frustration.

900
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,440
And?

901
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:45,322
Terror.

902
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:45,502
Terror.

903
00:41:45,842 --> 00:41:45,962
And?

904
00:41:47,335 --> 00:41:48,916
Embarrassment, I'm going to say.

905
00:41:48,936 --> 00:41:51,078
I heard eight words at once, so I made up my own.

906
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:51,859
What else?

907
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,021
Good, I'm glad you're saying words.

908
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:55,882
I can't hear them.

909
00:41:55,962 --> 00:41:57,603
I play a lot of drums and trumpet.

910
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:58,084
What else?

911
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:00,225
Yeah, awesome, good.

912
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:01,847
I'm sure you were saying smart things.

913
00:42:01,947 --> 00:42:03,308
Sorry I couldn't hear you better.

914
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,290
Keep practicing with that, right?

915
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,374
If you're actually humiliated, don't say mad.

916
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:13,559
Might be a mix of anger with the humiliation,

917
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:15,800
but see if you can refine your vocabulary.

918
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:19,062
And then again, try this with other people too,

919
00:42:19,102 --> 00:42:20,742
but don't tell them how they're feeling.

920
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:22,803
Nobody wants to be told how they're feeling, right?

921
00:42:22,863 --> 00:42:25,104
It's not, you're clearly embarrassed, right?

922
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:27,905
It's not that, it's I'm getting the sense

923
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,506
that maybe you've got some embarrassment around what I did.

924
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:31,366
Is that accurate?

925
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:33,267
Test your assumptions on people.

926
00:42:33,307 --> 00:42:35,248
Let them tell you how they're feeling.

927
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,289
More to the point on this slide,

928
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:39,630
be self-aware and name it to tame it.

929
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:48,279
When you know what your discussion partner's emotional state is and your emotional state

930
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:55,402
is, it is then your job to use emotional intelligence to help yourself and others feel safe in conflict.

931
00:42:57,722 --> 00:43:02,844
You all know Google down the road does lots and lots of data gathering about what makes

932
00:43:02,904 --> 00:43:04,504
teams work and not work.

933
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:08,430
And the reading that I've done recently

934
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:12,415
suggests that of the many factors that Google has found,

935
00:43:13,136 --> 00:43:15,940
they believe that psychological safety

936
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,961
is at the top of the list.

937
00:43:17,021 --> 00:43:18,443
Anyone here from Google, by chance?

938
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,341
Just want to give you the chance to correct me

939
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:24,242
if I've got this wrong, but I believe that Google's data

940
00:43:24,322 --> 00:43:27,763
is suggesting psychological safety leads to thriving teams

941
00:43:27,843 --> 00:43:29,504
more than any other factor they've found.

942
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:30,804
What does that mean?

943
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:33,946
It means you can be yourself, bring your emotions,

944
00:43:34,186 --> 00:43:36,106
bring your ideas, bring your thoughts,

945
00:43:36,326 --> 00:43:37,667
and you're not gonna be treated meanly.

946
00:43:38,547 --> 00:43:40,148
Right, you're gonna be treated with respect.

947
00:43:40,548 --> 00:43:42,229
Doesn't mean everyone's gonna love your idea,

948
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:44,890
but they're gonna treat you in a respectful way.

949
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:48,745
You need to keep yourself and your discussion partner

950
00:43:48,805 --> 00:43:51,526
feeling safe at all times if you're in disagreement.

951
00:43:52,106 --> 00:43:55,407
And if either one of you is moving towards fight or flight,

952
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:58,408
it is immediately stop, time out,

953
00:43:58,948 --> 00:44:00,809
both get back to psychological safety,

954
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:04,050
or you cannot be constructive.

955
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,970
If I go to give you your performance review

956
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,651
and I start off with, well, your performance has been horrible,

957
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:10,732
and you go, and plod starts.

958
00:44:11,076 --> 00:44:16,038
pumping all over your face and you're sweating and I go, let me explain the reasons that we were giving you.

959
00:44:16,478 --> 00:44:18,959
It's like, no, you're not gonna hear me anymore, right?

960
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,821
I have to get you back to some sort of psychological safety before you can hear me.

961
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:29,663
We might even need to call a timeout and say, you know what? I'm tired. I'm hungry. I can't do this right now.

962
00:44:30,063 --> 00:44:33,685
I know we need to work this through. Let's pick up tomorrow at 1030. Is that cool?

963
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:39,183
Even if you need to take a time out, you need to take that time out because it's only when

964
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:44,909
you and your discussion partner or partners are feeling psychologically safe that you

965
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:49,073
can be constructive about it and not just damaging about it.

966
00:44:50,635 --> 00:44:57,001
So be aware of emotions, use that information to keep yourself and others feeling safe in

967
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:57,582
conflict.

968
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:03,311
One way to keep the other person feeling safer

969
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,132
is to move past blame.

970
00:45:06,192 --> 00:45:10,215
Might sound obvious, but again, you're wired to blame

971
00:45:10,255 --> 00:45:11,755
because it's a defense mechanism

972
00:45:11,895 --> 00:45:14,417
and we're wired to defend ourselves against threats, right?

973
00:45:14,457 --> 00:45:17,198
It's not my fault, it's the stupid coding standards

974
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:20,120
that made that code end up ugly, right?

975
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,381
Or it's Julie's fault or Jose's fault.

976
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:26,303
When you're pointing the blame at somebody else,

977
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:28,324
you are giving away all of your power.

978
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:31,698
Right, if it's all Mike's fault,

979
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:33,279
then there's nothing you can do about it.

980
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,880
So you just made yourself powerless.

981
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:38,742
Not a very emotionally intelligent thing to do.

982
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:42,844
There's a guy out there named Christopher Avery

983
00:45:43,264 --> 00:45:45,225
who has a program called The Leadership Gift

984
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:47,767
that's all about moving from blame

985
00:45:47,807 --> 00:45:51,208
and other defensive stages towards true responsibility.

986
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:53,310
Highly recommend it if you wanna check it out.

987
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,828
For the moment, you just want to keep in mind part of being emotionally intelligent is not

988
00:45:58,888 --> 00:46:02,253
making the foolish mistake of just casting blame everywhere else.

989
00:46:03,014 --> 00:46:04,736
It's almost always a system.

990
00:46:05,397 --> 00:46:07,861
It's no one particular person's fault.

991
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:09,844
It's the circumstances you're in.

992
00:46:10,384 --> 00:46:11,925
It's the deadline you're under.

993
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:14,046
It's the fact that the engine is buggy.

994
00:46:14,387 --> 00:46:16,088
There's other factors at play here.

995
00:46:16,448 --> 00:46:19,890
Move past blame so that you can get to real responsibility.

996
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,932
That is boosting emotional intelligence to boost success.

997
00:46:24,592 --> 00:46:27,014
Again, a quick minute or two of conversation

998
00:46:27,174 --> 00:46:28,835
and then questions at the mics.

999
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:33,718
But let's first start with 30 seconds of testing yourself.

1000
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:34,158
Why?

1001
00:46:34,178 --> 00:46:35,839
Because testing causes learning.

1002
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:38,160
It signals your brain that information's gonna get used,

1003
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,281
therefore should be retained.

1004
00:46:39,921 --> 00:46:42,304
So question is, what have you heard,

1005
00:46:42,324 --> 00:46:43,865
and how can you apply it?

1006
00:46:44,026 --> 00:46:45,848
First, 30 seconds of silence, please.

1007
00:47:06,962 --> 00:47:07,863
Thank you so much.

1008
00:47:08,103 --> 00:47:10,905
Now I would encourage you to find a new discussion partner.

1009
00:47:10,985 --> 00:47:11,445
Why?

1010
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:12,966
Because I can't do it here,

1011
00:47:13,026 --> 00:47:14,827
but every time I pass out feedback forms

1012
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:16,608
and ask for suggestions for improvement,

1013
00:47:16,988 --> 00:47:18,069
lots of people always write,

1014
00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:20,010
if I don't suggest new partners, lots of people write,

1015
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,431
shoulda had us pick a new partner.

1016
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,793
So I'm gonna recommend that you pick a new partner.

1017
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:25,394
I'm also gonna recommend that you get up

1018
00:47:25,454 --> 00:47:26,815
and walk around while you do this,

1019
00:47:27,155 --> 00:47:28,656
but what you do is up to you, of course.

1020
00:47:28,716 --> 00:47:30,217
Discuss for the next couple of minutes,

1021
00:47:30,577 --> 00:47:31,698
in pairs or small groups.

1022
00:47:31,778 --> 00:47:32,438
What have you heard?

1023
00:47:32,758 --> 00:47:33,659
How can you apply this?

1024
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,124
Please wrap up those conversations.

1025
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:47,486
And I would love it if you had a question or a comment

1026
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:50,787
at the mic starting right there, please, sir.

1027
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,589
So something you said that stood out for me a lot

1028
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:57,391
was that you should try to match their intensity

1029
00:47:57,411 --> 00:47:58,331
at like a 2 3rds.

1030
00:47:58,471 --> 00:47:58,711
Yep.

1031
00:47:59,412 --> 00:48:03,094
And something, and this is more outside of work, but just a.

1032
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:09,931
like sometimes with somebody, they'll be angry and I'll be calm and I take kind of pride

1033
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:13,434
in staying in a very calm state, but they'll be mad at me for being calm.

1034
00:48:13,954 --> 00:48:14,435
Uh-huh.

1035
00:48:14,495 --> 00:48:14,715
Exactly.

1036
00:48:14,755 --> 00:48:15,496
And not getting angry.

1037
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:16,196
Exactly.

1038
00:48:17,537 --> 00:48:18,358
How do you find that?

1039
00:48:18,378 --> 00:48:21,600
I mean, the two-thirds thing is interesting, but if you could speak to that.

1040
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,401
Yeah.

1041
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:30,240
Essentially it boils down to this, a bunch of communication at the emotional level is

1042
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,621
non-verbal, right?

1043
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:37,164
In fact, there are studies that suggest we can understand each other's emotional state

1044
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:39,806
better through sounds than words.

1045
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:42,664
So let's just try it as an experiment.

1046
00:48:42,684 --> 00:48:43,945
I'm gonna say one, two, three,

1047
00:48:43,985 --> 00:48:45,186
and then I want you to make a sound

1048
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:46,787
that just represents how you're feeling.

1049
00:48:47,187 --> 00:48:49,488
Might be tired, might be psyched, might be whatever.

1050
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:52,190
If you're willing, here it comes.

1051
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,871
I'm gonna say one, two, three, just make a noise.

1052
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:54,171
Ready?

1053
00:48:54,591 --> 00:48:55,572
One, two, three.

1054
00:48:55,592 --> 00:48:57,033
Ah!

1055
00:48:57,773 --> 00:48:58,974
You're psyched, I'm tired.

1056
00:48:59,054 --> 00:48:59,494
All right, good.

1057
00:49:01,075 --> 00:49:03,397
So anyway, a bunch of emotional communication

1058
00:49:03,437 --> 00:49:05,198
is at a nonverbal level, right?

1059
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,680
So if somebody comes at you nine out of 10 angry,

1060
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:11,108
and you stay zero out of 10 angry.

1061
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:14,551
I can see how upset you are.

1062
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:17,314
They might think, well, this is,

1063
00:49:17,934 --> 00:49:20,336
they might logically think it's good he's staying calm,

1064
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:22,698
but emotionally he's like, goddammit, you don't get it.

1065
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:25,341
This is a really big problem.

1066
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:28,003
I understand it's a really big problem.

1067
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:29,344
I want you to stay calm.

1068
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,602
Emotionally, they know you get it when you say,

1069
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:35,305
now you don't have to be angry, right?

1070
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,928
But you want to feed a representation of their emotion

1071
00:49:38,968 --> 00:49:40,710
back to them in an emotional way.

1072
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,092
So instead of saying, you know,

1073
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,193
goddammit, this sucks so much, that's them.

1074
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:49,337
And you say, I can see that you are really upset.

1075
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:50,098
I'm not doing that.

1076
00:49:50,118 --> 00:49:50,818
I didn't do anything.

1077
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:50,979
I don't.

1078
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:54,542
I cringed when you cringed.

1079
00:49:54,582 --> 00:49:56,603
We feel emotionally synchronous now, right?

1080
00:49:57,574 --> 00:49:59,955
So if they come at you nine out of 10, like,

1081
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:03,718
God damn it, this is so bad, and you stay calm,

1082
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:06,961
but you say, ooh, I can really hear that you are upset,

1083
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,002
see if you don't see their shoulders drop.

1084
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:11,765
We need to feel felt, right?

1085
00:50:11,785 --> 00:50:13,406
We need to know that our message got through.

1086
00:50:14,087 --> 00:50:15,990
Here's another analogy, if you will.

1087
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:19,054
Imagine going to your executive producer and saying,

1088
00:50:19,074 --> 00:50:22,319
hey dude, I think the animation and audio systems

1089
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,544
are really badly passing messages to each other.

1090
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,407
There's lots of bugs coming out in there,

1091
00:50:27,447 --> 00:50:28,809
and they're like, get out.

1092
00:50:30,154 --> 00:50:31,014
They don't respond at all.

1093
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:31,535
What do you do?

1094
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,836
Like, dude, I don't think you've heard me.

1095
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:35,096
Like, there's a real problem

1096
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,337
in how the messages are getting back.

1097
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:38,638
You speak up until you've been heard, right?

1098
00:50:39,018 --> 00:50:40,739
That's what they wanna hear is that you get it.

1099
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,441
And emotionally getting it may be more important

1100
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:47,562
in a difficult conversation than a logical one.

1101
00:50:47,763 --> 00:50:48,443
Does that make sense?

1102
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:50,024
Thanks for a great question.

1103
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:50,684
Over here, please.

1104
00:50:53,269 --> 00:51:00,832
Are there situations where unfortunately the best ultimate resolution is to no longer work together?

1105
00:51:01,373 --> 00:51:01,653
Yes.

1106
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:05,515
And how do you get to that resolution in the least painful way?

1107
00:51:05,955 --> 00:51:07,996
Did you see me try to dodge the rest of that question?

1108
00:51:08,496 --> 00:51:11,097
How do you get to that resolution in the least painful way?

1109
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:17,223
So, first of all, what you're getting at in a way is,

1110
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,464
don't you need somebody cooperative on the other side?

1111
00:51:19,524 --> 00:51:21,606
And heck yeah, you do.

1112
00:51:21,726 --> 00:51:22,787
One of my favorite jokes,

1113
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:25,168
how many psychologists does it take to change a light bulb?

1114
00:51:25,928 --> 00:51:27,610
One, but the light bulb has to want to change.

1115
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:31,205
How many discussion partners does it take

1116
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:33,025
to collaborate through candid conversation?

1117
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:35,886
One, but they have to want to work it through with you,

1118
00:51:35,946 --> 00:51:38,866
and if they just don't wanna talk to you,

1119
00:51:39,286 --> 00:51:41,947
you will not succeed at anything I have shared with you today.

1120
00:51:42,347 --> 00:51:44,528
Sorry, we're still dealing with human beings.

1121
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:45,508
Human beings are hard.

1122
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:50,149
It is often the right solution to just end the relationship.

1123
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:53,330
I say often because I think most of us

1124
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,610
hold onto people too long.

1125
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,671
Hands up if you should have fired somebody

1126
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:57,471
sooner than you did.

1127
00:51:59,007 --> 00:52:01,509
Hands up if you fired somebody too soon.

1128
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:06,654
Okay, we have two hands compared to like 50, right?

1129
00:52:06,714 --> 00:52:08,815
Because we tend to hold on to people too long.

1130
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:12,018
I'm almost out of time, so I can't tell you a great story,

1131
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:14,600
but maybe afterwards I have a fantastic story

1132
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,623
about trying not to fire someone out of taking care of them,

1133
00:52:18,043 --> 00:52:19,364
and when we finally fired him,

1134
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:23,308
he vaulted to an awesome job at a different game company.

1135
00:52:23,328 --> 00:52:24,268
It was just a bad fit.

1136
00:52:26,249 --> 00:52:28,892
I want to take more questions, but I should not.

1137
00:52:29,052 --> 00:52:31,255
I so apologize, because you've been in line for a while.

1138
00:52:31,755 --> 00:52:32,656
I will be right here.

1139
00:52:32,737 --> 00:52:34,619
I've got cards down here and a couple of cards

1140
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:35,480
back by the camera.

1141
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,603
I'm happy to take the question over email or right afterwards.

1142
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:39,084
Sorry.

1143
00:52:40,165 --> 00:52:41,166
Thank you for understanding.

1144
00:52:41,306 --> 00:52:42,348
Quick repetition.

1145
00:52:43,217 --> 00:52:48,000
Boost emotional intelligence to boost success means recognizing emotions in others and yourself

1146
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:54,245
too, moving past blame, communicating in a way that keeps both people feeling safe and

1147
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:56,027
respected even when you disagree.

1148
00:52:58,449 --> 00:53:01,591
Intelligently conduct candid conversations in order to collaborate.

1149
00:53:01,831 --> 00:53:03,913
How will you apply what you have learned?

1150
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:08,972
If you don't apply this, this hour has largely been a waste of your time.

1151
00:53:09,512 --> 00:53:14,276
So I hope you will think about this, get very specific in your answers.

1152
00:53:14,336 --> 00:53:17,318
The handout has a place for you to get very specific.

1153
00:53:17,378 --> 00:53:19,780
Say when and where you're going to handle it,

1154
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,361
and you're going to follow through, and you're more likely to follow through.

1155
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,927
Quick summary, and we will wrap up.

1156
00:53:27,387 --> 00:53:30,269
Difficult conversations make your hard work harder.

1157
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:32,851
These difficult conversations are often

1158
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:35,052
where the project gets back on track

1159
00:53:35,452 --> 00:53:36,973
or really goes off the rails.

1160
00:53:38,194 --> 00:53:41,215
So I want you to draw on data and experience

1161
00:53:41,235 --> 00:53:43,977
to better handle these difficult conversations

1162
00:53:44,117 --> 00:53:45,298
and reach collaboration.

1163
00:53:46,058 --> 00:53:49,380
All recommended reading, recommended reading starts here,

1164
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,082
continues in the handout, full recommended reading list.

1165
00:53:52,575 --> 00:53:54,638
on my site happybrainscience.com.

1166
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,783
What does all that data and experience tell us?

1167
00:53:58,304 --> 00:54:00,567
It is possible to intelligently conduct

1168
00:54:00,648 --> 00:54:04,994
candid conversations in order to reach true collaboration

1169
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,256
even through difficulty.

1170
00:54:07,168 --> 00:54:09,530
Easier said than done, so examine your beliefs,

1171
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:13,511
see if you can keep learning to see the value in conflict

1172
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:17,553
so that you can be a bit better state for that conflict.

1173
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:21,415
Then to reach collaboration, bring all of your cooperation,

1174
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:24,696
then all of your assertion to reach collaboration

1175
00:54:24,736 --> 00:54:25,716
and break through ideas.

1176
00:54:26,217 --> 00:54:28,258
Continue to boost your emotional intelligence

1177
00:54:28,678 --> 00:54:31,279
in order to boost success, and here again

1178
00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:33,940
is how to get the handout if you'd like a lot more detail.

1179
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,961
Thank you so much for your time and attention.
