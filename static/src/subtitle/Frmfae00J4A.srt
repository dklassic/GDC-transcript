00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:08,958
Hi there, my name's Ben Lee.

2
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:12,402
I'm the art director on Void Bastards, made by Blue Manchu.

3
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:15,706
Today we're gonna be talking about

4
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:18,148
the origin stories of Void Bastards,

5
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,031
which is to say, I'm gonna try and give you some insight

6
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:24,055
into what happened before we made the game

7
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,818
in pre-production and how things changed

8
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,019
while we were making the game.

9
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:35,392
So the first thing we've got is a three page comic I did early in production.

10
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,394
It wasn't the first thing we did, but it was done quite early in production

11
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:41,697
to help everyone in our team, which is distributed

12
00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:45,300
or certainly was distributed for most of most of production.

13
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,882
In I was in the UK.

14
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,184
A lot of the team was in Canberra,

15
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:54,848
but we also had team members in Canada and Scotland.

16
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:56,590
So we were sort of all over the place.

17
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:03,985
So in order to communicate to everybody the general look and feel of the game,

18
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:10,386
I find this sort of brief comic book is very useful. It's a bit more narrative than just a

19
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:16,648
bunch of dry stills, but in this case it was very important because we decided early on that we

20
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:23,310
wanted to pursue a comic book aesthetic. And I'm not someone who really likes half measures,

21
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,371
so when we went for the comic book aesthetic we all bought into the idea of

22
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:31,735
we were going to try and make every part of this game look like a comic book,

23
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,799
not just a theme or a front end or a combat section.

24
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,723
Everything was going to look like it was taking place in the pages of a comic book.

25
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:45,007
How successful that was is up to you as an audience,

26
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:50,051
but I was doing my best to try and make everything as comic book-like as possible.

27
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:54,455
So you can see in these pages that the original idea...

28
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:56,776
for the narrative side at least,

29
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:59,499
because the gameplay didn't really change very much

30
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,601
from what we intended from day one.

31
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:06,806
However, the world and the feel of Void Bastards

32
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,388
actually changed quite radically.

33
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,390
So in these pages, you can see that

34
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:15,376
the initial player character wasn't a series of prisoners.

35
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:16,597
It was a single person.

36
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,900
And the idea was that this person, when they died, would actually die,

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,421
but would be replicated back on what has become the Steve in Void Bastards.

38
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:27,802
But we called it the Pod at the time.

39
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,002
And every time this person was reincarnated,

40
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:34,563
they would pick up photocopier-style errors.

41
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,364
So a gauge of how successful you'd been at the end of the game

42
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:42,145
was how genetically messed up this character had become over,

43
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:45,966
you know, in between zero and hundreds of times of being resurrected.

44
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:57,580
So you can see in these pages that it was a little more hard science fiction, a little more near future astronaut than what we ended up with in Void Bastards.

45
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:03,205
And that was something that only really changed, I would say, about the midpoint of the project.

46
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:05,166
I've talked about this in other interviews.

47
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:09,586
which was when we brought Kara Ellison on, a very talented writer,

48
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:13,468
and we all committed to the idea of trying to make it into a black comedy

49
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:16,849
as opposed to what was done in these pages, which is

50
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,671
just a really, really desperate sad tale of someone who was alone in space.

51
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:38,861
Okay, what we've got here is a very early mock-up of how we might try and do a cutscene

52
00:03:39,682 --> 00:03:43,726
in a comic book form, and this is the one that would sort of set up and open the game

53
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:46,368
that Kara and I worked on together.

54
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:53,635
We did decide at the end that it was far too long, and consequently, we re-approached how

55
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:58,039
we did these, and we made them much more brief, and sort of much more to the point.

56
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:02,921
but I think this is a fascinating thing to look at, especially if you're a fan.

57
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:05,864
Like, I've actually really enjoyed looking at all this stuff myself this week.

58
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,648
And you can see just how different even the tone was.

59
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:15,734
It's got elements of Kara's jokes and the Douglas Adams influence and everything else,

60
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:18,316
but it isn't quite the same as what we wound up with.

61
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,907
I love you all.

62
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:19,544
So, to just finish off the topic of the comic book look I was talking about, how everything

63
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:20,365
needed to be a comic.

64
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:26,781
These are early concepts of how the campaign map, the loadout screen, and the machine map might look.

65
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:30,844
We didn't know at this point. This was all just done in Photoshop. We didn't have anything really

66
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:36,989
working in the game at this time. And I think you can see here that I was really pushing,

67
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:42,272
maybe beyond, what was reasonable for how the interface would look like comic book panels.

68
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:48,297
I wanted to have panels themselves be sort of part interface and part storytelling,

69
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:49,377
so it was all mixed together.

70
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:57,785
um that never really works very well it's always confusing for people so like a lot of things i was

71
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:02,346
trying to start out pushing as hard as i could to get it as comic booky as possible and then

72
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:09,208
gradually make concessions to you know useful user interface so uh i really actually kind of

73
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:14,470
missed some of these little touches where there was a character's inner monologue mixed in amongst

74
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,551
the ui elements to kind of guide you through it but i find it really interesting to look back

75
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,792
back at these with some fondness

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,361
And it's interesting that the colours were very different in these as well.

77
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:30,782
We hadn't come up with the idea of orgs yet, the organisations which are on the different

78
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:37,083
spaceships, so all of the wild colours that you see in the different ships, I was just

79
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:40,884
using all at once, rather than trying to match them to particular things.

80
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,005
So the next thing I would like to talk about is the way we develop the environments, which

81
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:49,466
were very, very important, obviously, in the sort of game that Void Bastards is.

82
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:53,542
We needed to make a lot of levels, but we needed to keep the scope very manageable,

83
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:55,605
much as everything else in the game.

84
00:06:56,506 --> 00:07:00,571
Now, this is an area we couldn't economize quite as much as in other places,

85
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:06,297
where, for example, the cutscenes, we decided to do them as largely still comic book images

86
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:09,941
because it would fit with the theme, but also wouldn't require a lot of animation.

87
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,980
With environments, we couldn't really do that.

88
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,283
So we had to come up with a way to make the task manageable.

89
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:21,228
And from my point of view, it felt to me to design an art style

90
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:24,631
which didn't include tons and tons of detail

91
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,873
that would be expensive or time consuming,

92
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,615
which is the same thing, to create.

93
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:34,980
So early on, we decided on a very open, thin line look.

94
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:41,045
And I found the easiest way for me to pre-visualize this stuff was actually to use SketchUp,

95
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:42,967
which is what you're seeing right now.

96
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:48,490
And this had the advantage of being able to do little walkthrough animations for team members

97
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,455
who weren't in the room with me that I could post and they could look at when they woke up in their time zone.

98
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:59,538
And I found it very useful to be able to virtually walk around inside a space

99
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:03,981
when it was still being concepted before anyone attempted to 3D model it.

100
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:10,432
This is actually the first test that I could find that we did when we were still trying to decide

101
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:16,537
whether or not we could make a 3D environment game with sprites, you know, in the old school

102
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:23,083
manner of Outlaws and Duke Nukem that I'm very fond of. Concept being though that we could do

103
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:27,006
that with high resolution textures that would look more like illustrations and less like

104
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:28,788
pixelated 90s video games.

105
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:33,360
And it was this clip that gave us the confidence to move forward.

106
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:39,124
It's interesting to me here that you can see that the, already, the technology level and

107
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,707
the look and feel was very different to what we wound up with in Void Bastards.

108
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:50,212
We've got a very clean looking futuristic handgun, the enemies are very contemporary looking.

109
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:55,896
The next step was to take this rough model and to do some paint over mock-ups of

110
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,997
how the game might look when you were really playing it.

111
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,924
Now these images are really interesting to me because it takes me back to when we hadn't

112
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:09,166
really established a unique, what I would call a unique look for Void Bastards.

113
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:14,670
A lot of this really does look like animation, which is, it is my background before getting

114
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,290
into games.

115
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:21,134
And it's sort of funny to see how quickly I fall back to that when I'm pushed into a

116
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:21,474
corner.

117
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:28,079
So I liked all of this stuff and we thought it looked cool, but our main concern was that

118
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,440
it didn't look particularly unique.

119
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:34,703
at best it would look like good animation, and at worst it would just look like, I don't know,

120
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:40,265
bad animation. You can see here too the enemy design was really nothing like what we ended up

121
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:45,927
with, but at this stage in the project I was kind of just stabbing in the dark at what possibilities

122
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:53,030
could we have, and stay tuned later on for the development of the monsters, which is in itself

123
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:58,111
a topic. Okay, here is probably the first proper mock-up that I did.

124
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:04,068
when we decided to move forward with this idea. And at this stage I was still kind of drawing

125
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:10,390
this stuff like anime and not really like a comic book, or at least it felt that way. I was trying

126
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,451
to make it look like a comic book but it kept coming out like anime. And the biggest difference

127
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:21,092
here really is that you can see that the enemies are alien creatures, they're not mutated citizens

128
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:23,013
like we wound up with in the full game.

129
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:26,168
and none of us were really that happy with them.

130
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:30,250
We knew that we needed some enemies that I could animate reasonably easily.

131
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:34,433
All of the enemies we already knew were going to be hand animated by myself,

132
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,595
which limited the amount of detail I could really put into them.

133
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:41,018
So we were going for very organic, squashy-looking monsters.

134
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:44,780
The problem with that was they didn't particularly have a lot of character,

135
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:49,223
and that was something that we couldn't really get past.

136
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,245
And the solution to that will be coming up later in the talk.

137
00:10:53,548 --> 00:11:02,251
So now we've got a video of the first real 3D in-engine mock-up that we did to kind of test

138
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:06,892
these ideas out further and make sure we're heading in the right direction. And you can

139
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:13,795
see in this that there's a lot more traditional, like sort of Jack Kirby influence in the way we

140
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:14,895
rendered space.

141
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:18,308
The monsters are very serious.

142
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:23,754
It's still got, it was still in that kind of system shock to horror sci-fi region.

143
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:27,839
And while it's really fun for me to look at this, it's, it's interesting as well,

144
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,683
because we really hadn't figured out really what the direction was for the game yet.

145
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:33,705
We would, we were really just working through ideas.

146
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,515
Although a lot of these did survive.

147
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:39,717
We didn't throw everything out at every stage.

148
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:41,518
That's not really the way we work.

149
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:43,720
But yeah, there's a whole lot of stuff here

150
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,181
that really isn't in the final game.

151
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,423
And especially the color and lighting

152
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:49,525
is nothing like what we ended up with.

153
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:51,987
So one of our takeaways from these experiments

154
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,509
was that the ships that we'd made

155
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:55,349
and the art that we'd done,

156
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,311
it didn't really look like derelict spaceships.

157
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:58,912
They looked like functioning spaceships.

158
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:03,570
and that didn't really fit with the gameplay we were looking for, which was very much supposed

159
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,954
to feel like scavenging. So here are concepts of the more derelict, beat up, already looted

160
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:13,717
shipwrecks that the player would be looting and raiding throughout the course of the game.

161
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:20,121
And lastly, here's some concepts of the door switches, which we revised many, many, many times

162
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:25,545
and had dozens of discussions about. It's funny to see this now, considering how much time we did

163
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:26,165
spend on it.

164
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:31,493
tweaking the way doors worked and which side of the door the handle was and whether or not it had a

165
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:37,454
handle and a million other things. But let's move on to something more interesting. So we approached

166
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:43,755
the spaceships in Void Bastards, which the game is primarily composed of, from the inside out.

167
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:49,376
So after spending a lot of time trying to design and explore the sorts of layouts that would be

168
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,997
fun for the player, we made the deliberate decision to do that before we bothered worrying

169
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:55,618
about what they looked like on the outside.

170
00:12:56,697 --> 00:13:00,140
So once we'd gone through that process,

171
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:03,644
I started trying to design sort of exterior skins

172
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:06,967
to these modular Lego-like constructions

173
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:07,748
that we were going to do.

174
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,413
Very early on, we considered procedurally generating the ships,

175
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:14,695
and sometimes people report the ships

176
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,817
as being procedurally generated, but they aren't.

177
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:19,820
They're all hand-designed so that they feel like a spaceship.

178
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:24,459
with procedural elements inside them like doors that may or may not be broken

179
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,261
or at least have furniture that is there sometimes and other times not.

180
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,923
But the ship's always the same actual layout they're all designed by Jay

181
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:36,005
and this early on though we weren't sure if we were going to do that so

182
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:39,367
the exteriors were also designed to be modular so

183
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:43,189
it was possible that we could build these ships out of pieces that just

184
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:45,610
lock together and different combinations would be

185
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,530
different sorts of ship.

186
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:51,371
This wasn't something that ended up happening, but it drove a lot of the early design.

187
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,914
And it's interesting to look at these because they don't really look anything like the ships

188
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:59,796
that you might see on the star map now in Void Bastards, which wound up just being

189
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:04,919
hand-drawn to look distinct from one another as the most important aspect of the design.

190
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:08,361
Not so much how well they mirrored what the actual layout was.

191
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:13,564
And in this final image you can see I was still clinging to this idea of a sea ship.

192
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,274
with exposed ribs and dangling guts.

193
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:20,615
And I was trying to reintroduce that

194
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:23,796
into these very dry CGI based models that I've been doing.

195
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:25,796
Once again, diddleies in SketchUp,

196
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:28,236
primarily because it was just the fastest way

197
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:29,377
for me to get this stuff done.

198
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,917
So I've managed to dig up some really old concepts

199
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:36,498
from very early of what the player character

200
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:38,519
and also what the crew of the ships might look like.

201
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,099
In fact, I think at this point,

202
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,664
We hadn't even decided that the enemies wouldn't be human. There was a possibility they might just

203
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:50,510
be people or they might be robots. And you can see in all of these designs there's a strong,

204
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:56,337
it's a much more of a near future International Space Station look that we were going for.

205
00:14:57,252 --> 00:15:02,253
and I found that quite difficult to do in a comic book style because it was very dry.

206
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:05,713
But I persevered with it and you can see we got some interesting,

207
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:09,194
kind of more familiar Hollywood designs I guess I'd say.

208
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:13,715
Which as you can see really didn't make it into the final game at all,

209
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:19,836
where we decided to push much harder on improvised, handmade, bodged together weapons

210
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:23,917
rather than slick things that you'd find down the ship that someone else had designed perfectly.

211
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:30,920
Here's a fun one. This is the original handgun that we designed. It actually had full animations

212
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:37,341
for reloads and for firing and it looked cool but it also took so long that we decided to use

213
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:42,883
physical animation spring systems for a lot of those things rather than hand animate every frame

214
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:49,985
of each gun being reloaded or firing. But this is the instructions for our first stab at that.

215
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:55,026
So these pictures are... a lot of these actually made it more or less intact into the game.

216
00:15:55,066 --> 00:16:00,291
This was... these were done a lot later, but they were when we were... we decided what we were doing

217
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:05,895
and I was just forging ahead with trying to get interesting looking handmade weapons

218
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,498
or hand modified weapons that look different to each other.

219
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,042
And it's kind of cool to see some of them almost didn't change at all.

220
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,395
Some of them are no longer in the game, like the bomb, which was a thing that you threw into a room

221
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:24,359
and made all the monsters run out before it exploded. Which was just nowhere near as much

222
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,984
fun as the clusterflak, which is my second favorite name that I came up with for a thing

223
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:35,470
in a video game ever. So these are really old. This is stuff, this is like really early high

224
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,012
concept. What possible monsters could we have?

225
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:44,656
in this spooky haunted spaceship graveyard, which we stuck with all the way through the game.

226
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:50,298
These really, we decided, they were too much like a horror game and that wasn't really what

227
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,500
we were going for. I think I still had a lot of System Shock 2 rattling around in my head,

228
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,922
which is the sort of game we were trying to make.

229
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:04,632
but you know we weren't trying to remake it we were trying to do our own thing and a big part

230
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:10,518
of that is having your own visual distinctive style so here's some ideas for aliens the reason

231
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:16,143
they're sort of chitinous is because i still wanted to sort of push this sargasso nebula

232
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:18,566
deep sea but in space feel

233
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:24,372
which we really moved away from completely, but that's where the barnacle-faced man,

234
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:30,779
and all the biomimic, and all the tentacle-y stuff, and the carapaces came from in these pictures.

235
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,524
But I don't think much of this really survived at all into the full version of the game.

236
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:40,429
So staying in the deep sea vein, this was an idea where all of the enemies

237
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:48,215
were a form of space jellyfish and that took over host human beings and gradually morphed

238
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:52,858
them into something else. I quite like these but by the same token they were kind of just

239
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:57,762
squidgy monsters and we knew we hadn't really quite got there yet with them.

240
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:04,039
These guys are an example of me deciding that I was on the wrong track, so I'd throw a very, very hard left turn,

241
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:12,529
and tried to do a bunch of 1950s sort of rubber suit enemies that you might find in an old low budget movie,

242
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,796
and try and use interchangeable parts to sort of extend the variety.

243
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:23,497
And by the same token, maybe some really throwback looking...

244
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:25,838
Although it actually doesn't look that throwback...

245
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:30,581
That spaceship looks more like a void bastard spaceship than anything else we've seen in this video already, but...

246
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:33,382
I guess that's what comes out when I try and do that.

247
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:36,464
Here's a suite of aliens that I designed,

248
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:39,466
pretty much none of which made it into the game in any form.

249
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:41,587
I don't think they got any further than this drawing.

250
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,089
The soldier grub we did make a model of, but...

251
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,831
I don't think it had all of its full suite of animations.

252
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:48,991
I think it just sort of stood there.

253
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:53,079
The idea here was the enemies were some sort of technological race

254
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,561
that utilized bioengineering and had advanced, I don't know, rubbery technology.

255
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:03,362
Uh, the gun was kind of cool but I didn't, yeah, we used nothing else from this.

256
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:09,543
So this is a test frame from the first time I animated a monster to try out in the game,

257
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:14,545
and you might remember it from one of the early bridge concepts earlier in this video.

258
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:19,939
It was designed to be animatable and to be stretchy and be able to change shape and to

259
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:26,682
take advantage of the medium, but for me once I finished doing it I really didn't like it anymore.

260
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:32,384
It lost its feeling of elasticity and it was very difficult for me to to animate this well

261
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:36,345
because although it's supposed to be simple it's actually quite complicated.

262
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:40,667
It has far too many lines in it which is a real problem when you have to draw

263
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,088
lots and lots and lots of frames.

264
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:47,585
So here you begin to see the first inklings of what would become the Void Bastard citizens,

265
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:54,608
which is human crew members who've been warped by the Sargasso Nebula into horrible abominations.

266
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,110
The brain-headed guy actually was in the game for quite a long time.

267
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:05,192
He would become the sniper, which is the sort of upside-down backwards person that we have in the game now.

268
00:20:06,353 --> 00:20:08,053
This big guy was the original Ogre.

269
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,554
I don't really know what Tentacle Guy was.

270
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:12,955
He didn't end up in the game because he's a bad drawing.

271
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,426
So this little style guide sketch was when I felt like I'd kind of actually cracked a good look for the game.

272
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:23,250
It doesn't have the heavy black shadows that would become a big part of the style yet,

273
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,495
but I felt like this was the point at which I'd arrived at the right amount of detail

274
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:33,519
and the right amount of line work that I'd want to put into a monster.

275
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,623
It was kind of complex, but the shapes were easy to draw.

276
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:45,427
and the inking style was much, much faster than the really smooth, clean TV style that I'd used

277
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:51,071
in the earlier monsters. So after a lot of design back and forth, we'd kind of, we ended up settling

278
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:56,815
on the suite of monsters that we can see here pretty much made it into the game entirely.

279
00:20:57,595 --> 00:21:02,478
First one didn't. The Rocketeer is what eventually would become the Zek. These names were all of

280
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:07,262
their, our development names for them, so they described more what the creature did than anything

281
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:07,802
flavourful.

282
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:13,869
Ghosts, pretty similar. In fact, it's almost identical, but this was pre-organization,

283
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,150
so none of these were corporate. These were just citizens who turned into monsters.

284
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:21,652
As time went on, we decided to bring in the idea of the corporation, so the ghost

285
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:26,974
was a notorious monster, so we tried to make him look a lot more like an espionage sort of character,

286
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,915
which really just meant putting a hat on him, actually,

287
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,696
and drawing more of the mechanical guts that were hidden in the shadows.

288
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:41,693
The swarm always worked this way, but this current swarm was just kind of... I don't even know what this is.

289
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:43,153
It's like robot heads or something.

290
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:49,516
The swarm that we ended up going with is meant to be out these patients heads,

291
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:52,798
disembodied heads floating around that have somehow become

292
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:54,098
motile.

293
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:58,180
So that we didn't... we kept the idea of the swarm, but we didn't keep the art.

294
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,351
The sniper, as you can see, had this idea of his head turning into a big brain,

295
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:05,773
and it actually just didn't look great when it happened.

296
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:10,416
So he got scrapped and turned into the upside down floater.

297
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:15,140
Works exactly the same way, but doesn't have a complicated brain animation.

298
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,643
Also, a brain is complicated and time-consuming to draw hundreds of times.

299
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,306
The blaster is what we would call a janitor now,

300
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:26,288
and he's pretty much the same as when he was designed.

301
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:32,152
I say he actually, it's meant to be a he or she and indistinguishable.

302
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:37,996
The ogre we have here is a little smaller than the final ogre. We needed to make him look a lot

303
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:43,119
more bulky and threatening. Then this ogre is actually kind of dainty looking, but he's got

304
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,104
the same outfit and he does the same thing. Gremlins, pretty much unchanged. And the bomb

305
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:55,828
slug, this was the old horror style bomb slug which had kind of guts and skulls and eyeballs in it.

306
00:22:56,982 --> 00:23:03,505
and I'm so much happier with the fedora-wearing, no-eyes, exploiting tourist that we got.

307
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:06,947
Tourist's actually probably my favourite monster in the game.

308
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:12,090
So leaping all the way back to the beginning again, here are some robot designs that I did

309
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:16,613
when we were thinking of having humanoid robots walking around on the ships,

310
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:20,915
possibly oblivious to the player, and sometimes becoming hostile.

311
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:28,688
This isn't something that really made it into the game at all, but we did have robots and

312
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:33,212
this robot design was one of the very few early designs that actually made it all the

313
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:35,714
way through and is pretty much unchanged.

314
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:42,180
So to finish up, it's a lot of fun to show you this early concept for a comic book cover,

315
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,982
the fictional comic book cover for a comic that has never existed.

316
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,872
where we were attempting to pull together all of the ideas that we'd come up with in the story,

317
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:53,773
which was something that we hadn't even really written yet. We were trying to capture a feel.

318
00:23:54,694 --> 00:24:00,457
From my point of view, I was trying to do a very, almost a tribute to the old pulp novel and pulp

319
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:05,739
science fiction comics, while trying to get across the idea that the player was in command of an

320
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:12,182
endless parade of prisoners who, every time they died, would be replaced by another. I'm not sure

321
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:14,323
how successful that really was in one illustration.

322
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:19,472
it at least showed that you'd be playing a lot of different types of person in this game,

323
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:25,219
that it was unmistakably a comic book and there was an evil computer of some kind,

324
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,846
which if you look at this thing looks absolutely nothing like Bax, which is a character Kara

325
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:35,131
invented once she started writing, which was after this drawing was done, I should add.

326
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:40,512
And I think there's a, yeah, there's a screw there giving a guy a hug, turning him into a monster,

327
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:43,735
which is something that obviously doesn't happen in the game anymore, but...

328
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:50,141
So that's going to wrap it up. That's all I've got time for today. Thanks for watching. I'm really

329
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:55,346
disappointed that I didn't get to meet you all in person at GDC and have a chat and take some

330
00:24:55,386 --> 00:25:03,273
questions. Maybe next year there'll be less disasters and we can all hang out then.

331
00:25:04,707 --> 00:25:10,133
So looking forward to then. Thanks very much. I'm Ben Lee. This has been Voidbastard's Origin Stories.

332
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:11,855
Be excellent to each other.
