1
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:07,869
Okay.

2
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,210
So, thank you everyone for coming today.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,690
My name's Joshua Boggs,

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,211
and I'm the designer and director of Framed.

5
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:19,872
We've got a lot to get through, so we'll just

6
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,633
run through it as quickly as possible.

7
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:24,073
We don't have heaps of time.

8
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:26,254
So, let's do it.

9
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:30,295
So, as I said, I'm Joshua Boggs.

10
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:31,756
I'm a game designer and director.

11
00:00:33,256 --> 00:00:36,177
Prior to Framed, I've been in the industry for about 8 years now.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,801
Some of that time was spent at EA and various other studios,

13
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:42,102
and I've been independent for about four of them.

14
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:47,864
I've also been pretty fortunate to have won some awards.

15
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:52,046
And this talk is a bit about how we did that.

16
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:55,412
That's obviously not the rules to me.

17
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,374
One thing that's going to become clear in the talk is

18
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:02,036
I have a talent for, I guess, reading people,

19
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:05,377
but reading them inside a social system.

20
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:07,939
Some may call that sociopathic.

21
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,720
I just call it being aware of others and their motives.

22
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:15,043
So, in case you don't know what Framed is,

23
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:16,443
Framed is a noir puzzle game

24
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,424
where you rearrange panels of a comic book

25
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:19,785
to change the outcome of the story.

26
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:23,964
As you can see, we've done pretty well.

27
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:25,725
And let's go.

28
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:29,608
So it all starts with a choice, right?

29
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:32,711
Every project you make is just a series of choices.

30
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:34,692
This isn't rocket science.

31
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:37,214
Those of us that make games know this well.

32
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:40,357
We make choices that impact the game and its development

33
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:41,438
every single day.

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,101
Things like, what is this game about?

35
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:48,543
How will people find my game?

36
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:52,311
how I make money from my game, and something that

37
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,892
Bruce talked about a couple years ago.

38
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:55,574
What makes my game remarkable?

39
00:01:56,935 --> 00:01:59,617
These are all very valid and important questions.

40
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:02,880
However, there is one question, one choice, that developers

41
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,121
often don't ask themselves.

42
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:05,522
And it is this.

43
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:09,205
How do I want my game to be perceived?

44
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:13,248
This is an important distinction, because as we know

45
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:15,730
in game development, we have a large control over many things.

46
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:18,613
But not necessarily what happens once it's out in the wild.

47
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:21,932
But that's not entirely true, because

48
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:25,953
every choice you make about your game during development,

49
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,154
during release, during pre-production,

50
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,635
is you subtly speaking to the public,

51
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:32,835
to curators, app store editors,

52
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:35,076
about how they should perceive your game.

53
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:38,377
This is the essence of what PR and marketing is, right?

54
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:40,238
Hundreds of billions of dollars are spent every year

55
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:42,439
to try and create a favorable message,

56
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,219
a favorable reaction to a product.

57
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,480
And your game is no different, obviously.

58
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:48,701
Sorry.

59
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:51,834
This talk is about taking control of what you say.

60
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:54,998
You'll hear me speak a lot about the decisions we made during development

61
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:57,321
and the particular tactics we used.

62
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:59,583
But if you pay attention, you'll notice that

63
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,866
even among those development-focused choices

64
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,027
is a common theme.

65
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:05,430
And that theme is that every choice we made

66
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,133
was deliberately focused on tailoring

67
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:10,536
the public perception of frames prior to release.

68
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,146
So, what choices did we make?

69
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:18,089
Well, firstly, we were going to make a very different kind of game, obviously.

70
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,891
Something that could be recognized in a single screenshot.

71
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:23,754
Something incredibly striking and carefully designed.

72
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:27,037
It needed to be recognizable at a pub,

73
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:29,619
on the tram, or on the subway.

74
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,021
It had to get people to come up to you and ask you,

75
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:33,542
what is that game you're playing, in public?

76
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,286
Secondly, we were going to distinguish ourselves

77
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,268
from the kind of lo-fi fad going on at the time

78
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:40,328
by...

79
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,743
hand crafting every part of, every piece of art,

80
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:48,523
every piece of animation for every panel and level.

81
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:50,764
We felt that this would send a message

82
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:52,845
that this was a really high quality product

83
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:53,945
and a really high quality game.

84
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,146
And we doubled down on this by actually focusing

85
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:58,426
on Apple rather than PC.

86
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,607
PC was the dominant platform at the time,

87
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,868
but we felt that kind of pairing of the interface

88
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:08,750
and the careful design and just the kind of experience

89
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,910
of using an Apple product would be a great pairing.

90
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:17,643
And most importantly, we're going to focus our PR efforts on winning awards on the festival circuit.

91
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:23,198
So, for anyone who's not aware, real quick, what is the Festival Circuit?

92
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:28,480
Put simply, the Festival Circuit is a season of exhibitions, conferences, and award shows

93
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,520
that you can submit your game to.

94
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:33,822
These shows take place all around the world, and if you are successful in being picked

95
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:38,924
as a finalist or a showcase game, you get free booth space and the opportunities to

96
00:04:38,984 --> 00:04:43,986
network with distributors, app store editors, publishers, fans, and obviously journalists.

97
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,983
But that's not the only goal of pursuing this route.

98
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:51,428
Or I should say, that's not the real goal of committing to the festival circuit.

99
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:55,373
Because the festival circuit is really about shaping the perception of your game.

100
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,199
By being at festivals, award shows, and official selections,

101
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,541
you do two things.

102
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:06,420
First, you add that coveted award wreath to your marketing materials.

103
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,064
This further enhances that perception of quality and hypeness around your game.

104
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:12,505
There it is.

105
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:14,227
Look at it.

106
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:15,868
How lovely.

107
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:22,694
Two, you're marketing directly to tastemakers.

108
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:25,717
These are your curators, the connoisseurs, YouTubers,

109
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:27,338
and journalists.

110
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:30,720
They're at these shows. It's their job to be at these shows.

111
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,781
And their voices are bigger than yours can ever be.

112
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:37,244
You just don't have the same time and resources as someone like EA or Ubisoft.

113
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:39,985
So you need to spend your time as effectively as possible.

114
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:43,127
Everything you're doing needs to be hitting two birds with one stone.

115
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:47,330
And this is the one-two punch of the festival circuit.

116
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:50,712
You increase hype and expectations around your game

117
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:53,453
by frequently appearing at shows as a successful title.

118
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:57,801
This allows you to bring in those with larger influence

119
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:00,043
in you to market your game for you to the rest of the world.

120
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:03,566
But this in turn helps build more hype around your game,

121
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,828
which means that when you do submit to the next show,

122
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,951
chances are that those judges and show curators

123
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,393
have heard about your game and are a lot more

124
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:12,254
likely to check it out.

125
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,937
This positive PR feedback loop is

126
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:17,699
pivotal to cutting through the noise

127
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,601
and shaping the perception of your game

128
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,023
as something that is a must-have quality title.

129
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:27,238
So for those that aren't aware, this is just a quick

130
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:30,600
run-through of a bunch of events in the festival circuit.

131
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:33,742
These are the ones that we kind of focused on, but

132
00:06:34,502 --> 00:06:37,324
there's more festivals every year that are opening up.

133
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:43,708
And I could not recommend more the two URLs at the bottom,

134
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:48,050
gameconfs.com and promoterapp.com.

135
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,289
uh... promoter app without it

136
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,792
we probably would have missed a lot of this and

137
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:55,456
we probably wouldn't have done as well as we did

138
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:59,941
uh... it sends you like really awesome reminders, it's great, really check it out

139
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:04,827
aside from the main goal of shaping the perception around your game

140
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:07,671
festival circuits also provide a number of other great benefits

141
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,916
The first one that lets you gauge the public perception of your game.

142
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:14,896
Have people already heard about the game?

143
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:18,078
What are people saying about it when they see your logo, your banner?

144
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:21,479
Do they turn to their friend and say, oh, this is that game framed,

145
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,500
or this is, you know, Hyperlite,

146
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,161
or this is whatever game you're working on?

147
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,522
If they do, then you're on the right track.

148
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:30,383
Free interviews, obviously.

149
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:32,144
If you're selected, you're given a free booth,

150
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:34,165
and that lets journalists and media outlets

151
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,685
just vox pop you right at your booth.

152
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,961
And pretty important is free playtesting.

153
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:44,542
If you're going to be maintaining that perception of value and quality,

154
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:47,423
you need to be taking in as much feedback as possible.

155
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:49,844
This doesn't mean hounding people afterward.

156
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,425
Oftentimes it's just about listening to their faces,

157
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:54,745
their body language,

158
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:57,446
and others around them watching them as they play.

159
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,687
Reading these cues and matching them with what's going on

160
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:03,128
is normally a service you pay a fair amount of money for.

161
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,966
Attending as many shows as possible also allows you to test it among different audiences.

162
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:11,892
For example, the PAX crowd is very, very different to the SXSW crowd.

163
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:18,101
SXSW is more like a general mainstream or public event, whereas PAX is clearly PAX.

164
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:24,970
So, talking about the benefits of the festival circuit,

165
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,693
it's all well and good, but with the bar always rising,

166
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:30,456
particularly the competition inside the festival circuit,

167
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,939
your game really needs to stand out and cut through the noise.

168
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,881
It needs to be very, very polished.

169
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:37,824
This means that people often don't start submitting

170
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,206
to shows and competitions

171
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:41,108
till the game is either finished or in beta.

172
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,791
However, it is possible.

173
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,131
Sorry, so it is possible to maintain that quality throughout development.

174
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,512
Remember, you want to shape that perception of quality

175
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:52,992
and the best way to do that over a long period of time

176
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:55,233
is to submit to as many festivals as possible.

177
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:59,173
So, here are the development strategies that we employed

178
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:02,954
to allow us to continuously submit frames to competitions

179
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:06,215
and award shows, allowing us to shape that perception

180
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:07,695
throughout the entire development.

181
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:18,613
So, the core tenet we've upheld is to ensure that you're developing your game to a timeline that adheres to the festival circuit's award show.

182
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:21,533
So, their submissions and their showings.

183
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:25,955
That means you need to always have a submission quality build on hand, no matter what.

184
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:28,936
Here are some of the ways we did that.

185
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:31,985
So, number one.

186
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:34,306
Your imagination is the best prototype.

187
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:37,848
Playtest your entire game on paper or Lego

188
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,489
or anything faster than a computer.

189
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,371
You want that turnaround between design and experience

190
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,813
to be as immediate as writing or painting.

191
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:47,515
Video game creation has a long turnaround time

192
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:49,236
between creation and experience,

193
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,397
but game design doesn't really need to be.

194
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:53,519
Simulate it in your mind if possible.

195
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,521
You need to make that turnaround between inception and execution

196
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:57,841
as fast as physically possible.

197
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,247
Then, once you've done that, playtest it on others.

198
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:03,247
Let them imagine the world you've left out.

199
00:10:03,507 --> 00:10:05,128
Because you'll be surprised by the results,

200
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:07,008
and it will force you to ensure that your designs

201
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,429
are very readable and very intuitive.

202
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,251
Number two, this one's a bit controversial,

203
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:15,771
but assume everything is final

204
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:17,372
and don't create placeholder assets.

205
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:21,213
By not using placeholder assets,

206
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:24,094
the idea is that, sorry.

207
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,798
And surely you're not just using placeholder assets.

208
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,939
The idea is more than the mechanic.

209
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,940
The idea is about how the aesthetics, the themes,

210
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,081
the mechanics all come together.

211
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,143
The magic that happens when they all interplay,

212
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:37,064
that is the feeling that you have in your imagination.

213
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,725
That is the core idea of your game oftentimes.

214
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:43,288
So doing work in progress, placeholders often

215
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,628
doesn't give that feeling.

216
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:49,301
Identify which parts are not essential, and leave them till later.

217
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,243
But make sure you do not discard the feeling that you're trying to capture.

218
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:55,885
Many people throw out everything except the system of mechanics when they do this,

219
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:58,447
but doing that is just throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

220
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:01,929
The game is the feeling you're trying to capture.

221
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,271
For example, The Witness, right?

222
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,653
Is it just a series of puzzles with nice art?

223
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:11,156
It's more than that. It's a feeling of both mystery and zen,

224
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:14,338
an idea that logic and spirituality are one and the same thing.

225
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:16,743
And all the mechanics and things are trying to

226
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,506
give you, you know, a general grasp of that idea.

227
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:27,048
Number three, the only milestones are submission deadlines.

228
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,991
There's usually about ten weeks between each major expo and award show.

229
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:34,112
This is how long it should take you to make significant improvements

230
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:35,253
and add additional content.

231
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,194
If it takes longer, your pipeline's a bit too slow.

232
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:41,416
You'd be submitting your polished build to as many festivals as possible

233
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,617
while maintaining the trajectory of your project.

234
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:48,507
The only way to do that is obviously to treat award submissions as your major milestones.

235
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,648
And 10 weeks is the magic number.

236
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:56,169
It's not some arbitrary, random, optimal time I've plucked out.

237
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:00,370
It is literally the time between the biggest and most important award shows that you can get into.

238
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,651
And they're all in different parts of the world.

239
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:05,292
You'll often find them seasonal as well.

240
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,272
IGF, GDC, we are here now.

241
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:12,613
South by Southwest, PAX East are all in this, you know, earlier part of the year.

242
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,560
and in the middle you've got Gamescom, Eurogamer,

243
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,382
Tokyo Game Show as well, I think, unless it's moved out.

244
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:20,604
They're all seasonal,

245
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,247
and you usually have about 10 weeks between each major one.

246
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,711
And the other one is to develop the game episodically, if you can,

247
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:30,433
regardless of if it really is.

248
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:34,977
What you're really doing here, so for Frame, for example, 30% of our 10-week

249
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:38,260
turnarounds were spent carefully and quickly designing everything that would happen.

250
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,122
the feeling we were trying to capture.

251
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:43,503
Mechanics and aesthetics are mechanisms to achieve that feeling,

252
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,824
but not the end goal themselves.

253
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:46,845
So focus on that higher feeling.

254
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:51,227
Equality title is really carefully and deliberately designed.

255
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:53,588
We spent our 10-week deadline as follows.

256
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:56,329
Three weeks carefully designing all content,

257
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:58,930
six weeks creating final assets,

258
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,411
and then one week for review and polish.

259
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:04,532
This allowed us to build in final chunks,

260
00:13:04,832 --> 00:13:07,053
or mini polished prototypes over and over and over again.

261
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:10,103
By adopting this method, you give yourself the ability

262
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:12,646
to submit continuously throughout development

263
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,048
whilst building the entirety of your game.

264
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,751
Not only that, it means that when you hit the end,

265
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:18,892
you're either A, done,

266
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,354
or B, have just one more sprint to do,

267
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:22,495
one more 10-week turnaround

268
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:24,657
to bring everything together.

269
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,981
So make a game episodically, regardless of if it is.

270
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:30,463
Your goal is to finish as many vertical slices

271
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:31,464
as quickly as possible.

272
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:36,227
This one's kind of obvious, but everyone's a hipster.

273
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,888
Bring everyone in, bring others in early.

274
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:41,009
Your goal here isn't just for feedback,

275
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,751
it's to bring in influential people to talk about your game for you,

276
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,513
and for them to become familiar with the game.

277
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:51,915
For Frame, this actually started back in 2011 or 2012

278
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:55,416
when we first submitted this super rough prototype to IGF.

279
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,802
it obviously didn't get accepted.

280
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:01,107
But the point was so that there were a few people,

281
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,634
there were judges or jurors would see the game

282
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:08,078
and then in future would recognize the game

283
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:10,642
and that would help us further down the path

284
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:11,583
of the festival circuit.

285
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:14,716
This one's a little hack I like.

286
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:19,298
It's visual polish is important, but not as important as audio.

287
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:22,139
So the thing with aesthetics is it creates atmosphere

288
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,079
and emotional target.

289
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:26,040
And great audio design will lift every single aspect

290
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,540
of your game.

291
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:28,481
So if you have great audio early,

292
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,082
not only does it lift the entire experience,

293
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:33,183
but the game feels more polished and finished

294
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:35,423
since audio is usually left at the end of a project.

295
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:41,605
So once you've nailed your strategies and submission

296
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:43,086
processes to shows and awards.

297
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:46,274
Excuse me.

298
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,657
It's time to manage your show floor presence.

299
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:51,919
Again, this is about shaping that perception of quality.

300
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,702
So the first thing you want to do is control your crowd.

301
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,745
Nothing draws people in like a crowd.

302
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:02,008
So the first piece of advice is to cycle your devices.

303
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:04,950
This is so important, particularly if you are

304
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,813
showing a mobile game.

305
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,975
It gives you the unique ability to vary the number of devices

306
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:10,875
you have out on your booth.

307
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,137
Nothing draws people in like a crowd, like I said.

308
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,148
Start with a device or two out on the table,

309
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:19,070
then only add more as the crowd becomes too large to manage.

310
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:21,592
Importantly, you should only remove a device, though,

311
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:23,994
if the crowd is sort of lessening to a degree

312
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:25,715
that it's unable to sustain itself.

313
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:27,897
You always want a little bit of crowd,

314
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:30,279
and you want players to actually wait a turn

315
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,521
so that they draw in more viewers and more people.

316
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:35,003
Doing this during the circuit means that when

317
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:37,585
editors or journalists or anyone comes by,

318
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:39,747
they'll see the crowd and are a lot more likely

319
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:40,527
to check your game out.

320
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:51,225
Always have one more spare build. So, all that said, you never know when someone from developer relations or an editor or anyone or the media will come around.

321
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,347
You want to make sure that you make the most of your time at your booth.

322
00:15:56,248 --> 00:16:00,151
So you want to always make sure that you have a spare device on hand.

323
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:02,793
And you never hand this out to the public.

324
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,805
This way you can jump in and begin the interview

325
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,246
or begin pitching a game immediately.

326
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,227
One time we were at PAX event,

327
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:12,749
showing Framed, and Jerry from Penny Arcade walked past.

328
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,452
So knowing that the Comet crossover would work well,

329
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:18,833
I grabbed our spare device, ran over to him.

330
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:22,595
That resulted in coverage on the front of Penny Arcade the next day,

331
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,636
and him kind of telling everyone

332
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,358
to go check out Framed the following day.

333
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,319
So, always have a spare build down.

334
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,920
And know who's on the show floor.

335
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:35,153
but also treat everyone like they could be a tastemaker

336
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:38,635
because there are a number of people who do walk around without their badges

337
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:40,357
just so that they don't get hounded.

338
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,661
This is my favorite one, is be a member of the crowd.

339
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:48,984
It's often really hard to get honest feedback about your game

340
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,867
and some people even carefully manage their facial expressions not to offend you.

341
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,730
So infiltrate the crowd, remove your badge or hide it

342
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,712
and move to the rear or the side of the crowd.

343
00:16:59,527 --> 00:17:01,748
watch them, see how the players react to your game,

344
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:04,610
and listen to the conversations that bystanders have as well.

345
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,712
You can gain a lot of really, really valuable insight this way.

346
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:12,995
This one's a bit controversial, but

347
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,457
open dialogue where they can critique the game.

348
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,398
Obviously if you ask someone their opinion,

349
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:23,221
people like that, and they like to feel smart, so

350
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:24,661
they'll often tell you what you want.

351
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:26,002
But if that doesn't work,

352
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:29,510
you can call them out nicely on their frustration you observed

353
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,391
when you were masquerading as a member of the crowd.

354
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:34,653
The emotional desire in people to defend themselves

355
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:37,275
will always kind of outweigh the cognitive practice

356
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:39,076
of masking their emotions or desires.

357
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:41,097
So you can use that to your advantage,

358
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,779
but only if you do it in a really nice way that's not confrontational.

359
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,636
So, this process, this systematic approach to the festival circuit was what we employed for Framed.

360
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:54,719
So, how did it turn out for us?

361
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,902
Well, as you saw before, it went pretty well.

362
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:02,448
But it's important to remember that the festival circuit, or award circuit, is a system.

363
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:08,515
And like any system, if you understand how it works, it can be gamed and bent to your advantage.

364
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:14,512
So, bearing all that in mind, our launch must have been pretty successful, right?

365
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,716
Well, we launched Framed in November 2014,

366
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:19,478
had significant critical acclaim.

367
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,461
By the time we released, everything seemed to be on track.

368
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:23,262
Apple were ready.

369
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,244
They wanted to know our release date.

370
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:28,088
We had translated the game to 14 languages.

371
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:32,505
And it did go all right.

372
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:36,088
We got some feature spots in China and Japan and Australia

373
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:38,770
and sort of just above the fold.

374
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,872
So you know, those first four that you normally

375
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:41,953
see on the App Store.

376
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:47,277
We moved 20,000 units in the first weekend.

377
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:50,340
And by the end of the first week, we'd moved 35,000.

378
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,763
So at $5 a pop for a premium indie title, we

379
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:55,704
weren't doing half bad.

380
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:58,687
But we were really underperforming our

381
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,048
expectations quite seriously.

382
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:04,180
And with a budget of almost half a million Australian dollars,

383
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:09,223
half of it being salary sacrificed, so it wasn't really that much spent.

384
00:19:10,764 --> 00:19:12,305
Cost and budget are different.

385
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:15,027
We were looking at only breaking even at cost.

386
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,890
We had a team of four to six people, we had investors to pay back.

387
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:22,593
And with a game so hyped and so critically acclaimed,

388
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,315
with expectations of success so high,

389
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:27,016
this was bad news for us.

390
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:30,137
So, what went wrong with our launch?

391
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:31,818
Why was our launch internally a failure?

392
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,200
Well, the thing with releasing anything is

393
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,341
there is always a huge amount of luck involved.

394
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,262
Anyone who tells you otherwise,

395
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:42,263
or who says that they succeeded in launching

396
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:45,224
because they did x, y, z in a very specific order,

397
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,105
is glossing over a huge fact that they likely don't want to admit.

398
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:50,306
That they also got extremely lucky.

399
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,431
We don't like to talk about it because it sounds hopeless, right?

400
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:56,053
If it's all just a gamble, what's the point?

401
00:19:57,194 --> 00:19:59,916
What's the use of shaping that message of quality,

402
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,999
of pouring blood, sweat and tears into your project?

403
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,161
Excuse me, into your baby,

404
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,923
if it's all just a roll of the dice anyway?

405
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:10,105
And there's certainly one way to look at it.

406
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:12,868
You are literally taking your entire game budget,

407
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:14,309
walking into the casino,

408
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,073
and dumping the two, three, even four years of your life onto the table.

409
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,101
But there's a huge element of luck, because in any release,

410
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:28,522
there are a huge amount of variables that are completely out of your control.

411
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,043
You've done all the preparations,

412
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:33,004
but you can't really predict the weather.

413
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,184
Now you've just got to hope no storm rolls in.

414
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:39,385
That a large game franchise doesn't unexpectedly drop on that day,

415
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:40,646
or make a huge announcement.

416
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,447
Or that the media in general aren't consumed by some other scandal at the time,

417
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:47,828
or that tastes have changed.

418
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:50,528
Or that your App Store editor, who's championing your game, suddenly leaves their job.

419
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:53,326
So, just don't make games.

420
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:56,306
Honestly, it's not worth it.

421
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:58,287
OK, jokes aside though.

422
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:01,428
PR is not a silver bullet.

423
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:04,689
It's about tipping the odds of success in your favor.

424
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:07,730
Your goal isn't to have fine-grained control over your release.

425
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,190
It's impossible to do that.

426
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,271
Your goal is to tip those odds of the house in your favor.

427
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:14,152
Every release is a gamble,

428
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:16,772
and all the work that you've been doing to make your game great,

429
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:18,533
to shape that perception of value,

430
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:22,014
bringing in those tastemakers will help tip the odds further in your favor.

431
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:25,023
You want to walk into that metaphorical casino

432
00:21:25,604 --> 00:21:28,045
and have all the dealers wanting you to win.

433
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,906
Still a high stakes gamble,

434
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:34,508
but your end goal is to slowly but surely tip those odds in your favor.

435
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:38,470
So if everything goes well and you've managed to luck it out,

436
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,452
congratulations.

437
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:44,774
But what if it doesn't?

438
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:48,055
What do you do if the odds don't go your way?

439
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:54,474
Well, the reason I've talked so much about shaping that perception of quality, of value,

440
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:58,616
is that by doing so, not only do you create a great game, but it's also insurance.

441
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,497
A quality game is the best defense against a bad launch.

442
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:05,819
Because the long tail of your game will continue to bring in people seeking quality experiences.

443
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,602
For those that aren't aware, just real quick, the long tail is this part in the typical sales graph.

444
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:18,906
It largely stays steady, and you can earn just as much money from it as your launch, if not more.

445
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,210
And this is, and pricing helps with this,

446
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,312
along with all the messaging and work that you've done prior to release on the circuit.

447
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:29,993
Trailers, interviews, streams,

448
00:22:30,454 --> 00:22:31,874
and importantly, those award reads.

449
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,297
How many times have you been looking for a quality movie to watch

450
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:38,558
and made a decision based off of the critical acclaim it has?

451
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,980
I do it all the time. I'm sure many of you do as well.

452
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:46,403
We make judgments based off the reputation of respected people, of tastemakers.

453
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:50,782
The festival circuit not only helps in pre-release type,

454
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:55,944
it's also an essential ingredient in maintaining a sustainable long tail after release.

455
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,424
So if your launch doesn't go your way,

456
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:01,085
you still have a decent long tail to look forward to.

457
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,966
While we had certain things not go our way during launch,

458
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,387
we also had a lot of things that did go our way.

459
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:10,128
That's kind of just the nature of luck, right?

460
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:17,058
Kojima's Game of the Year endorsement was a great example of influential tastemakers weighing in.

461
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:19,400
It was lucky that he saw it at that point in time.

462
00:23:21,102 --> 00:23:24,345
Apple continually re-feature-framed in smaller features, sales, and bundles.

463
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:27,228
We're not the only title that has done pretty well in the long tail.

464
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,193
Our friends at Comobius have done similarly well for Duet,

465
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:35,697
and I'm sure that there's many others who've done well in the long tail.

466
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:44,343
So the theory of the long tail is obviously that our culture and economy is shifting away from that big spike and towards niches.

467
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:48,086
And due to how our games are largely digitally distributed,

468
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:51,529
and how widely accessible our games have become through our phones,

469
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:55,713
we and many others have made more on our long tail than our launch period spike,

470
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,454
almost 10 times as much.

471
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:00,737
Currently, we're now sitting at almost 400,000 paid units,

472
00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:02,318
almost 18 months after release.

473
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:07,289
We get featured regularly in minor feature bundles and sales.

474
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:09,629
China is actually our top performing country.

475
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:10,649
Why?

476
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:13,090
Because we're filling gaps where others don't try to.

477
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,911
We ensure that the design stage of the game

478
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:17,111
was intuitive and readable.

479
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,892
On the festival circuit, another great thing about it

480
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:23,633
is that we did travel to many countries, China included,

481
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:25,953
Japan, and being able to gauge how

482
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:28,134
people can play a game with their language barrier

483
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:28,914
or culture barrier.

484
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:34,058
So premium pricing does still work on iOS, but it's not easy.

485
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:36,599
To make it work, you need to invest heavily in shaping your

486
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:39,260
game as a premium experience and ensure it's

487
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,420
accessible to everyone.

488
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,621
You're seeking to fill gaps.

489
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:44,582
Our audience are connoisseurs.

490
00:24:45,322 --> 00:24:48,123
They want well-crafted, carefully designed experiences.

491
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:50,223
The premium market does work.

492
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,544
You just need to shift your perspective away from what

493
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:53,364
everyone else is doing.

494
00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:56,946
You won't get the same numbers as free-to-play, but we're

495
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:57,766
playing a different game.

496
00:24:58,426 --> 00:24:59,627
We have a different scale of measurement.

497
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,252
For those of us crafting premium titles on mobile,

498
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:06,514
it's not about quantity, it's about quality.

499
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:08,035
Thank you.

500
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,984
I'm not sure if we have time for questions.

501
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:20,605
I think we do.

502
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,727
I think you have five minutes, yeah.

503
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:25,949
I think you have to line up at the thingy.

504
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:33,119
Hey, considering the long tail, I'm curious if the festival

505
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,620
circle is relevant after a launch of the game.

506
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,922
I mean, you launched, and then do you still

507
00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:40,562
try to go to these events?

508
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,943
Yeah, that's a really good question.

509
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:47,966
So the question was, is the festival circuit still

510
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,947
valid after you've released?

511
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,667
Good question. I know a lot of people who have still done it a lot.

512
00:25:55,648 --> 00:26:00,294
Like NecroDancer still go on the circuit and continually do well, it shows well.

513
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:06,822
We particularly haven't done it, but I can only imagine that it helps bolster that long tail, yeah.

00:26:10,372 --> 00:26:20,134
Hey there Joshua, so my question relates to anyone who's interested in making games but maybe doesn't actually have the capital to get to the stage that you are at.

515
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:30,577
How does the festival circuit enable those type of game designers? Because obviously at GDC we get to see a lot of like Games Jam games and smaller sort of stands.

516
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:37,458
But is there any way that games like that in your experience have ever achieved those accreditations and should they even be seeking those kind of...

517
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:45,551
Yeah, so the question was, for people with less money, is the festival circuit still

518
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,172
something that they should pursue?

519
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:53,136
I'd argue yes, because the goal of the festival circuit is to be submitting these things,

520
00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:56,418
and if you are accepted...

521
00:26:57,595 --> 00:27:00,097
as you know, like a showcase game, or they're gonna give you,

522
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:01,978
they usually give you a free booth.

523
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,901
So it's a really good way to get free playtesting and free booths.

524
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:09,004
You still have the problem of travel and everything,

525
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:11,005
but I guess

526
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:12,947
that's kind of one of the

527
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,548
you know,

528
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:19,112
facts about making games, I guess, is that it costs money, or time, and time is money.

529
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:22,395
But you wouldn't say there's a glass ceiling in the sense that you could come here and...

530
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:23,736
No, I don't think, yeah, I don't feel there is, no.

531
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:29,270
Hey, so thanks for a great talk.

532
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:34,253
So even despite all the hard work

533
00:27:34,393 --> 00:27:36,234
you went into putting the festival circuit

534
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:38,596
and getting awarded on there, the initial launch

535
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,237
was a little underwhelming, as you said.

536
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:41,958
And it was only the long-term quality

537
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,779
that helped create the awesome long tail.

538
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,561
Looking back on that, was there something

539
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,923
you misjudged with the initial festival response

540
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,764
that might have contributed to that?

541
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:55,145
And if so, are you trying to work

542
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:56,386
on that for your next project?

543
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:59,828
The question was, was there something wrong I had done?

544
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:04,252
Or not wrong, but misjudged during the circuit, right?

545
00:28:04,272 --> 00:28:05,032
To contribute to the launch.

546
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:07,434
It's a good question.

547
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:09,416
I mean, you can always look back and say,

548
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:11,998
I wish I did X, Y, or Z better.

549
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,222
But to be honest, I think that we did as well as we could do.

550
00:28:17,622 --> 00:28:21,505
We did do pretty well, but I think sometimes,

551
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:23,947
like I was saying, when you release something,

552
00:28:23,987 --> 00:28:25,328
there's a huge amount of luck involved.

553
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:31,056
It's not a nice thing to hear or talk about because it sounds hopeless, but I don't really believe it is

554
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:32,657
You're just trying to tip the odds in your favor

555
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:37,323
Sometimes it doesn't go exactly the way you want and that's just kind of a fact of life

556
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:38,765
Thank you

557
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:45,753
Cool I think that's it. Thanks for coming everyone
