1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,640
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:08,701
Hi.

3
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:12,603
I'm Adam DeGrandis.

4
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:13,424
This is my beard.

5
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:13,964
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,847
Today, I was the art director on a game that's about to be

7
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:20,628
released called Tooth and Tail.

8
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:24,171
And I'm going to be talking about a major art overhaul

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:28,153
that happened in what we naively thought was maybe not

10
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:30,114
like the 11th hour, but like the 9th or 10th.

11
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:32,756
It turned out to be more like the second.

12
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:35,498
I'll talk about that chestnut later.

13
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:38,159
So this is gonna be broken up into four parts.

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,580
The first part, I'm gonna be talking about

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,021
the analysis of the old art, how we kind of broke it down.

16
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:45,222
Then I'm gonna move on to kind of

17
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:47,223
the initial corrective measures we took.

18
00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:50,044
Then I'm going to talk about production.

19
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:53,646
And then the fourth part is kind of

20
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:57,788
the ramifications of all this and the results of it.

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:00:58,949
So.

22
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,753
Probably I'm not a big name in games.

23
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:06,077
Little bit of info about me before I start is probably helpful.

24
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:11,303
This is the picture I use across all my social media.

25
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:15,248
And it's jokey, but it is.

26
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:20,451
a pretty genuine thing that the the small handful of people in here who

27
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:21,231
really know me

28
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:24,992
know that this is like yeah okay that's sure that's adam

29
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:26,052
uh...

30
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,714
uh... but that doesn't really tell you uh... anything about

31
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:32,995
uh... my professional history just kind of where my head space is so let's do

32
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:33,935
some professional history

33
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:34,675
uh...

34
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:40,897
I currently run a visual design in an art production studio called Chickadee with my

35
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:41,498
wife Sarah.

36
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:45,042
I'm also a part-time educator at Maine College of Art in Portland, Maine.

37
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:48,946
And I've been making games professionally since about 2004.

38
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:53,451
Now when I got started, I didn't realize that people specialized.

39
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:58,556
I thought if you were going to make games, if you're going to be an artist in games,

40
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:04,382
you had to be a concept artist and a technical artist and a visual effects artist.

41
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:07,164
I didn't realize that there were distinctions between those things.

42
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:13,711
And I'm self-taught, so I took a very long time learning how to do all of that stuff,

43
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,312
and it was very, very sweaty.

44
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,115
It turns out that someone who understands

45
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:23,476
that whole tapestry of game art

46
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:26,277
is really, really valuable to small teams.

47
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:30,498
Small teams like Pocket Watch Games,

48
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,078
who make Tooth & Tail.

49
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,239
And that brings us to Tooth & Tail.

50
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,839
So what is Tooth & Tail?

51
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:41,440
Tooth & Tail is an arcade real-time strategy game

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,101
that tries to take the big, broad pillars of the genre.

53
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:46,501
So, you know.

54
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:51,643
fielding armies and building bases and all that kind of stuff.

55
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:58,625
And it cuts out all like the micro bloat that's crept into the genre since its heyday in the 90s.

56
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:06,968
It's designed to be a strategy game as much for fans of the genre as like people who think they don't like strategy games.

57
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:09,108
It's meant to be really approachable.

58
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:15,070
For a really long time we were using Starcraft meets Mario Kart as the elevator pitch,

59
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,391
and I still think that's pretty apt.

60
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:19,778
So here's just a quick video.

61
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,561
This is just from a few weeks ago,

62
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:25,044
just to kind of ground everyone.

63
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:30,570
So the player plays a rat commander,

64
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:33,534
rallies various units to them.

65
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,816
It's designed to be played with a controller.

66
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,738
Oh, and that's the end of the video.

67
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,330
And here's where it looked like when I joined the team.

68
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,752
Now, you may be thinking like, oh yeah, no big deal.

69
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:48,054
Early artwork looks rough, and that is true.

70
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:51,516
One of my very favorite one-sentence lessons

71
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:53,577
for my students is games look terrible

72
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:54,517
until they look great.

73
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,223
But these shots are from about like 18 months into development.

74
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,425
They were considered full production.

75
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:03,887
This is what would ship.

76
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,289
So they're pretty rough in that regard.

77
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,393
The kicker was that the game played great.

78
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:10,734
It was really, really fun.

79
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,837
And it was absolutely a delivery on the promise

80
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,060
of accessible strategy.

81
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,405
But these rough visuals were kind of a barrier that stopped players and press from ever discovering

82
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:21,605
that.

83
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:29,674
So in early 2015, Andy Schatz, the kind of main pocket watch guy, got in touch with me

84
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:35,700
and said that the project needed a dedicated art person to kind of help write this ship.

85
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:39,323
But there were a couple really critical wrinkles.

86
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:44,207
A lot of money had already been spent on the project, so this isn't a problem that could

87
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,588
be solved with money.

88
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:51,113
And related to that, the game needed to be shippable by the end of the year, so about

89
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:51,673
ten months.

90
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,241
I've worked with Pocket Watch on and off for about 12 years,

91
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:57,702
and it's always a really, really good time.

92
00:04:57,742 --> 00:05:01,804
Plus, I myself am most happy trying to work through

93
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,026
like a really meaty creative challenge,

94
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:05,227
and this was definitely one of those.

95
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:09,209
So I joined the team in February of 2015.

96
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,691
So the very first thing I did was a big analysis

97
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:14,292
of all that preexisting art,

98
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:16,394
and I tried to articulate in objective terms

99
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:19,496
why I thought it was coming up short.

100
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:20,576
Here's some of that stuff.

101
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:22,643
Art fundamentals.

102
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:25,184
So basically the stuff that you would learn in art class.

103
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:27,686
They weren't being used to communicate

104
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,567
important information to the player.

105
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:34,209
So value, the artists in the room know what that is.

106
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:37,271
It's how light and dark something is, basically.

107
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,392
It's great for making things stand out.

108
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,814
So what's the important stuff in an RTS?

109
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,935
Well, that's going to be your units, or your buildings,

110
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:48,176
or in the case of tooth and tail, your commander.

111
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:52,038
You want those things to be higher contrast, so darker

112
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:54,039
darks and brighter brights all in the same area.

113
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,360
And you want the less critical stuff.

114
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,342
random terrain and whatever you want that to be a little bit more right in

115
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:05,083
the middle. Little bit more even if we if we look at one of these old images

116
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:08,245
in grayscale we can kind of see that that that rat commander right in the

117
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:10,706
middle kind of those grays are kind of following.

118
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:15,489
falling right along the same level of gray as the rest of the image.

119
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,952
That rat's not really popping out because of value.

120
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:21,936
In the terrain itself, there's these kind of like undulating darks and lights, but there's

121
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:23,257
no real rhyme or reason to it.

122
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:27,881
The one effective bit going on is those pigs, which are an important part of the game, those

123
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,304
are really popping off that dark terrain.

124
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,527
But overall, this is just not a very effective use of value.

125
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:36,957
color wasn't really being used effectively either.

126
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:39,857
So we have one smart bit going on.

127
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:42,698
We've got this kind of orange, red rat

128
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:44,458
on top of mostly green terrain,

129
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:46,259
and that's a pretty classic example

130
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,219
of complementary colors,

131
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,920
which is similar to how there's a joke

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,340
about how all movie posters are blue and orange.

133
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,382
Kind of funny to see all of these spread out.

134
00:06:58,422 --> 00:06:59,422
They all kind of look the same,

135
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,502
but the fact of the matter is,

136
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,963
is complementary colors can be pretty striking

137
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:04,563
when used skillfully.

138
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:06,224
But in the case of Tooth and Tail,

139
00:07:06,244 --> 00:07:08,324
it wasn't really pushed far enough and it wasn't consistent.

140
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:11,985
For instance, if I played as any other commander,

141
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:13,986
my faction color would change

142
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:16,567
and I would lose that complementary color relationship.

143
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,749
Additionally, speaking of faction color,

144
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,771
if we look at the faction color of the units,

145
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:26,434
it's red, but those reds are really dark

146
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:28,435
and kind of under saturated.

147
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,517
The saturation is lower than the terrain,

148
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,318
so they don't really pop off the terrain.

149
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,920
Overall, the color palette kind of felt

150
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,882
a little subdued and sleepy,

151
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:38,984
and definitely didn't prime the player

152
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:42,086
for the kind of like fast, quick action

153
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,268
that the game is kind of made of.

154
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:49,933
Related to those art fundamentals, character designs were overly complex.

155
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:57,321
Now, I'm a big believer that all design, character design, game design, industrial design, graphic design, all of it,

156
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,983
it's not really about what you can add but what you can take away.

157
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:06,176
The units in Tooth and Tail when I joined the team were like detailed little paintings

158
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,079
which made them really, really cool paintings, but kind of poor character designs.

159
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:14,782
When you got a bunch of them in a mob, which is a pretty common occurrence in the game,

160
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:19,626
all that detail kind of just became this undulating block of noise.

161
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,328
It made it really hard to see what was actually going on.

162
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,550
One of the biggest issues here was that silhouette.

163
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,534
wasn't consciously considered when designing the units.

164
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:31,456
All the units had kind of a similar posture,

165
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:33,858
similar volume, a lot of them carried

166
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:35,820
kind of similarly sized weapons.

167
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,245
Now, this maybe seems insignificant or even silly,

168
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:42,767
talking about silhouette, but it's actually

169
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:45,350
one of the most powerful tools in a character designer's.

170
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,514
Toolkit, it helps maybe more than anything, that five second read.

171
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:51,776
Something to kind of think about.

172
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:57,301
It's not an accident that there are no background characters in The Simpsons that have the same

173
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:59,863
like head shape as Lisa or Bart or Marge.

174
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:03,826
If you want something to stand out in a crowd, give it a unique silhouette.

175
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:07,910
And even better, put some useful information into that silhouette.

176
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,012
Another problem, the visual design of the environment

177
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,493
was straddling between organic and board game-like

178
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,033
in a way that undermined the narrative.

179
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:18,614
What is the narrative?

180
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,115
In the world of Tooth and Tail,

181
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:24,856
an unspecified calamity wipes out all the crops,

182
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:26,736
causes a massive food shortage,

183
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,957
and all animals, even herbivores,

184
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:31,577
they're forced to eat meat to survive.

185
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:35,178
But then they all kind of decide they like to eat meat.

186
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:35,978
They prefer it.

187
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:37,659
So this...

188
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,145
War is ultimately about who gets to be the people and who has to be the meat.

189
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:50,731
It's modeled loosely around conflicts, the dawn of mechanized warfare, so World War I,

190
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:53,214
but I think more specifically the Russian Revolution.

191
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,736
So this is not a happy place.

192
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,453
But the tile approach that was being used

193
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:01,694
when I joined the project kind of undermined all that.

194
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:04,616
We're saying it's about terrible social upheaval

195
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:07,017
and this kind of unprecedented carnage

196
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:09,018
and a genie that's been let out of the bottle,

197
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:12,660
but what we're showing you is like

198
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,381
Marble Madness special edition re-release.

199
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:18,743
If you're too young to know what that is,

200
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:20,804
that's a game that like cavemen played

201
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,046
going to dinosaur school.

202
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:28,217
just look it up it looks just like that uh...

203
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:31,862
okay so another problem there is no uh... achievable and goal defined

204
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:34,446
basically there is no like actionable mock-up

205
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:38,876
The mockups that were made looked super nice,

206
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:42,379
but these were really paintings and not proper mockups.

207
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,461
Given the tech that the game was built on,

208
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:47,303
there's really no way of recreating this in game,

209
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:50,125
so you're still left with this big open question

210
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:52,867
of like, okay, well, this is great,

211
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:55,369
but what does the game actually look like?

212
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:59,051
The arc lacked a solid direction to head in.

213
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:05,358
Another problem was that there were a few thoroughly tested ARP pipelines in place.

214
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:10,804
Now, PocketWatch likes rolling their own engine, and the engine had all the support for like

215
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,465
the major features you would expect.

216
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,310
It had actors, and it had objects, and it had a bunch of environmental stuff, and it

217
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,052
had particle effects, and all this kind of stuff.

218
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:26,143
But nothing was really documented and an experienced artist never really put all of that stuff

219
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:27,184
through its paces.

220
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:31,170
So there were big questions about where the weak points in the tech were.

221
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:35,175
And then finally, the last little bit of critique,

222
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,156
there was no art director.

223
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:40,477
So IndieShots, again, the main pocket watch guy,

224
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:44,319
he was playing art director while he was also

225
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,579
being a designer and running a business

226
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,800
and being a programmer, and even in the indie space,

227
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,801
which is kind of known for people wearing multiple hats,

228
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:54,202
I think that was one hat too many.

229
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:57,763
I think another thing, though, was

230
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:02,591
Andy does have some experience as an artist.

231
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:04,292
He actually has an art degree,

232
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,952
and he paints and a bunch of stuff.

233
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:08,153
He's actually a pretty decent painter.

234
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:12,694
But he hasn't spent years solving visual problems.

235
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,075
And if you've got a stack of visual problems to solve,

236
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,375
it's gonna be most efficient to have someone

237
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:20,955
who does have experience doing that,

238
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:22,536
trying to work through that stack.

239
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,679
Another thing I did was I took stock of the things Pocket Watch had going for them.

240
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,861
And the top of that list was the painter in the project, Jerome Jacinto.

241
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:37,965
Jerome is awesome. All the art that I just spent 10 minutes critiquing was made by Jerome.

242
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:43,929
But Jerome is an incredible painter. He can paint circles around me all day before I even get out of bed.

243
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,290
And he's just awesome to work with.

244
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:51,353
But at the time I came on board, I think he was still pretty green in terms of being a game artist.

245
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:55,061
he knew how to make a still image that would blow you away

246
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:59,046
but uh... hadn't yet developed a ton of experience kind of wrestling with the

247
00:12:59,106 --> 00:12:59,747
complex

248
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:03,573
uh... changing informational landscape that is a game

249
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:07,378
but it was pretty clear that with uh... just even a little bit of direction he

250
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:10,061
was going to be like a super weapon and that that was the case

251
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:14,344
So lessons, I'm gonna be calling out key lessons

252
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,066
at regular intervals and I'm hoping,

253
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,011
my aim is that these lessons are broader

254
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:23,153
than the talk itself.

255
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:26,136
They're things that you can apply to all kinds of art making

256
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:27,497
not just like 2D stuff,

257
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,399
but even hopefully other disciplines.

258
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,280
So here's the first batch.

259
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,401
Even if you are crunched for time,

260
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:38,762
allowing yourself to stop and think

261
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:40,443
kind of about what you're doing

262
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,264
usually ends up paying dividends

263
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:45,846
in the form of, in productivity.

264
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,866
You end up working faster

265
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,207
after you have that time to think

266
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:50,848
and you end up making less mistakes.

267
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:54,129
I know it's super stressful, potentially,

268
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,391
because stopping to think does not feel

269
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:58,611
as much like work.

270
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:02,914
as like trying to just like brute force your way through an asset list.

271
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:06,176
But in my experience, it has always been worth it.

272
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,579
Another one. Fancy tools are awesome.

273
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,662
And we have tons and tons of fancy tools in 2017.

274
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:16,762
But...

275
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,188
I won't say they're useless, but they're not as useful as they could be if you don't understand

276
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:29,012
visual design basics.

277
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:33,178
If you want to develop these skills, skip the...

278
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:38,203
how to model a soldier in Blender tutorial

279
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,206
and go for like basic color theory

280
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:44,289
or understanding anatomy or something like that.

281
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:45,670
And even if you aren't an artist,

282
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,471
checking out something like that,

283
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:49,033
you're gonna be able to talk to artists

284
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:50,154
way more effectively.

285
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:53,497
And maybe prototyping even goes better.

286
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:55,118
So I think it's a good exercise.

287
00:14:56,232 --> 00:15:00,516
And then three, it may seem like semantics at first blush,

288
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:03,859
but I think there is a really important distinction

289
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,602
between being a game artist and being an animator

290
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,763
or a 3D modeler.

291
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:11,845
The artwork in games is, I think,

292
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:17,399
in its purest form, visual communication of the gameplay.

293
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,540
Yes, it's also there to kind of get people amped

294
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:23,322
and keep people there once they're there,

295
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:27,084
but you can kind of take those things away.

296
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:30,686
And the art still works as long

297
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:32,807
as it's communicating the design.

298
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,435
There's another discipline that is primarily concerned

299
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:39,617
with visual communication of information,

300
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,058
and that's just graphic design.

301
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,761
So besides those art fundamentals

302
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:44,842
that I was just talking about,

303
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:47,544
you know, learn about branding and typography.

304
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,746
Like, dive down into this kind of stuff.

305
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:50,647
Do research about.

306
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:54,471
subway maps or signs in like tourist areas

307
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,933
and then try and draw the connections between

308
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:59,255
what makes that stuff successful

309
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:02,238
and what makes an interesting character design

310
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,000
or an interesting, the design of a locale

311
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,821
or something like that.

312
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:10,758
Okay, so we knew what the problems were,

313
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:13,840
and now it was time to start addressing them.

314
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,121
The very first thing I did was I made a new mock-up

315
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:19,322
that addressed those formal issues I just talked about

316
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,604
while also trying to reinforce the game's narrative.

317
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:28,872
I kept it super simple at the beginning because I wanted to be sure we could easily talk about

318
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,254
everything that was there.

319
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:33,559
I wanted all of these early ideas to be properly critiqued.

320
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:35,923
I wanted nothing to be lost in the mix.

321
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:37,525
And I wanted everyone to understand like...

322
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:39,386
uh... why

323
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:42,248
we wanted to do each one of these things basically

324
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,309
uh... metaphor that we can kind of think of

325
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:48,650
i'm trying to like lay a really solid foundation here

326
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:53,912
uh... and maybe like sketch out a floor plan but in no way am i

327
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:55,353
trying to show a finished house

328
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:57,796
I think there's a lesson in that.

329
00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:59,738
Baby steps, I'm gonna come back to baby steps

330
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:01,761
again and again throughout this career.

331
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:04,725
It ensures an entire team, especially a remote team.

332
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,909
I was remote, Pocket Watch Games is in San Diego,

333
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:08,610
I live in Maine.

334
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:14,173
It ensures that an entire team can kind of keep up

335
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:16,594
and it stops problems, like small problems,

336
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:17,935
from becoming compounded.

337
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:22,177
I think also if you ensure an entire team

338
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:24,818
is moving together, you're kind of sharing the experience

339
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:27,439
of making that game and I think you're more likely

340
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:30,481
to be on the same wavelength in terms of communication.

341
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:34,957
So this mockup was made with actionability in mind.

342
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:37,578
It only included artwork or features

343
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:38,999
that I knew we could add.

344
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,020
There wasn't any bit of art here that made me say like,

345
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,980
oh, well this is cool,

346
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,801
but I don't know how we're gonna do this yet.

347
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,882
No new questions, only answers.

348
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:51,323
Let's go through some of these things bit by bit.

349
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:55,066
So one suggestion was instead of those like grid blocks,

350
00:17:55,166 --> 00:18:00,210
then the checkerboard that the game was using before,

351
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:04,374
I suggested we do a fill of like much larger textures

352
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:05,915
at the base level of the world,

353
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:07,376
kind of underneath the cliffs

354
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:08,657
and underneath the units and stuff.

355
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:10,539
And that was to help reduce patterning,

356
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:12,541
make the world feel a little bit more organic

357
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:13,922
and get rid of that checkerboard effect.

358
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:21,324
I suggested we use a shader, even just like an old-fashioned overlay image, to shift the

359
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:25,426
color of the terrain so as to get a little bit more color variation, make it feel a little

360
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:26,186
bit more organic.

361
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:34,950
And I suggested some simple atmospheric overlays, so cloud shadows that scroll across the ground

362
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,011
and animated sun rays on a post-process tint.

363
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:42,573
This was to help push the value range and make the whole scene feel a little bit more

364
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:43,013
dramatic.

365
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:53,001
There's also some changes here meant to solve some like mundane but critical

366
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:57,963
problems. So an example Z fighting or like bad sorting was a problem with the

367
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:03,546
way the the old terrain work sometimes units would render behind squares that

368
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:09,089
they were in front of and vice versa. So I suggested we paint terrain are we

369
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:13,431
rather pink cliffs and ramps in such a way that you can never actually get

370
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:14,151
behind them.

371
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:18,598
A lesson for junior artists, or really actually all artists,

372
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:22,286
that if you can reduce like bugs for coders,

373
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:24,330
they will love you forever, and do that.

374
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:25,553
Just do that.

375
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,403
So the mock-up was well-received,

376
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:31,405
and I don't want to put words into anybody's mouth,

377
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:33,908
but I think everyone kind of felt reinvigorated a little bit.

378
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:37,472
And it was around this time that Andy said,

379
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:38,913
like paraphrased,

380
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:42,818
I always imagine this as a pixel art game.

381
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:43,799
Can we do pixel art?

382
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,180
Is that even a good idea?

383
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,881
Would that work?

384
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:47,443
How does that change the schedule?

385
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:48,244
Can we do it?

386
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:57,019
I loved that suggestion because Command and Conquer 1, the very first one, was the game

387
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:02,025
I was obsessively playing when I realized it was like someone's job to make games and

388
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:04,248
like holy shit I could be one of those guys.

389
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:10,201
to make a strategy game with big chunky pixels was like a pilgrimage for me.

390
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:14,445
But more important than that personal excitement

391
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:20,290
was the fact that moving tooth and tail to a pixel style kind of spoke to the game's soul better.

392
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:24,554
After all, it's a bit of a love letter to those classic 90s strategy games,

393
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:29,278
while also being a little bit of a love letter to some classic arcade games and like arcade culture.

394
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:33,636
It also simplified animation production tremendously.

395
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:36,097
Before, it was a bit of an open question

396
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:37,457
of how we would actually produce

397
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:38,818
all of the animation in the game.

398
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:42,679
It would probably require a new tech or be expensive.

399
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,300
Would we use like a 2D rig system?

400
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,001
Would we model and animate everything in 3D?

401
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,023
Would we do like high-res hand-painted animation?

402
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:54,143
Nope.

403
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:57,363
we would use good old-fashioned hand-drawn pixely sprites.

404
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:01,064
We could focus entirely on broad gesture

405
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:03,285
without getting caught in expensive details.

406
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:07,986
Relatively nice and easy compared to those other options,

407
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:10,266
and it works with our existing tech, great.

408
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:13,427
So the first pixel mock-up was a hit,

409
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:16,487
and again, while it was a little bit thin at the start,

410
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:20,368
it proved to be the perfect foundation on which to build,

411
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:22,569
but I will get to that in just a second,

412
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:24,269
because let's do some lessons first.

413
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:34,583
If you pick an art style that plays to your team's strengths and speaks to your core experience,

414
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:37,825
you reduce the number of visual problems that you actually have to solve.

415
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:44,731
It makes you and your team saner because you're not trying to figure out a way to say X.

416
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:51,373
with the visual language that just isn't well-equipped to say x

417
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:55,999
in our case pixels spoke to the soul of the game

418
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:59,403
uh... really nicely it it's all the bunch of technical problems

419
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:02,107
and it was faster produce so is a plus for us

420
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,772
And two, a mock-up is a tool, and I think in some cases,

421
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:11,714
in my experience, maybe even most cases,

422
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:14,555
it's the most valuable tool you have.

423
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:17,277
It's not just a painting or a fancy render.

424
00:22:18,197 --> 00:22:20,739
It can often give you a leg up on production too,

425
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,060
because the assets you make in the mock-up

426
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,581
can just be moved into a build.

427
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:26,402
So in my experience, it's always been good

428
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:30,184
to spend real time on it and not think of it as like,

429
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:31,465
oh, we just have to get this done

430
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:32,886
and then we can start making the real art.

431
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:36,113
Okay, let's keep going.

432
00:22:36,293 --> 00:22:39,335
So we had a mock-up, we had total team buy-in,

433
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:42,418
we were all excited about pixels, there we go.

434
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:45,580
At this point, we started pushing forward

435
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,401
on multiple fronts.

436
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,362
So Jerome and I dove into character design,

437
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:52,125
we did just iteration after iteration of line art.

438
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:55,787
This is like the tiniest tip of the iceberg,

439
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:59,610
I would need all of the walls to show everything we did,

440
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,491
it was exhaustive.

441
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:08,461
Jerome himself did a bunch of like paintings exploring a bunch of different fun, none of these are fun,

442
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:12,527
but different, but fun potential scenarios and emotional themes.

443
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:15,791
I want to make a game just about this dog getting his hat shot.

444
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:19,256
That doesn't show up in the game, but it should probably.

445
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:27,325
So the end result of all this work was a nice set of guidelines that dictated the visual design of our units.

446
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:30,307
So units in a given tier, we've got these three tiers.

447
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:38,092
Units in a given tier all stand in different poses or have drastically different equipment or weapons

448
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:40,914
so as to help the silhouette be as informative as possible.

449
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:46,597
Reptiles are primitive. They have less clothing and they generally have melee attacks.

450
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:50,860
Mammals wear more clothing and are generally ranged.

451
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:54,983
Scale clearly denotes combat effectiveness.

452
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,984
One thing that I've learned

453
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,688
is that my job as a visual designer,

454
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:05,210
it's not just to design stuff that looks cool,

455
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,071
it's to design stuff that allows

456
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:08,552
for a suspension of disbelief.

457
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:12,295
And creating a consistent visual language,

458
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:16,718
something that has order and patterns and stuff,

459
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:18,359
really helps do that.

460
00:24:20,578 --> 00:24:23,079
The mockup itself became something of a living document.

461
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,401
So if anyone had any idea for art,

462
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:29,442
it was iterated a half dozen times in the mockup

463
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:31,943
before we ever actually put anything in the build.

464
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:34,544
One of the best pieces of advice I ever got

465
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:35,924
from my first art director was,

466
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:38,045
it's cheaper to iterate on paper,

467
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,506
and I think this is a version of that.

468
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:42,647
It's maybe also worth mentioning that all of this work

469
00:24:42,707 --> 00:24:44,648
I've described so far happened pretty quickly,

470
00:24:44,688 --> 00:24:45,868
about the first two months.

471
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:49,406
One thing that helped us a great deal

472
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,688
as we were doing all of this was

473
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,171
a slightly exhaustive visual communication among the team.

474
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,393
Little storyboards, if you will,

475
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:59,775
that kind of describe tech needs

476
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:01,917
or how a sequence of events should work.

477
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:03,818
Since we didn't have

478
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,462
a lot of time we couldn't afford to lose time due to miscommunication.

479
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:16,349
So if we're ever kind of talking about a complex topic, we would do something up like this

480
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:20,613
to make sure that all of these ideas were like completely thoroughly understood.

481
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:28,891
I came to understand the value of this though through the context of my wider career.

482
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:33,873
I've worked with a lot of different kinds of people in a lot of different spaces.

483
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:41,417
Certainly teams like Pocket Watch, but also teams in academia, research teams, marketing

484
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:45,780
teams, and I've learned that everybody communicates a little bit differently.

485
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:53,844
So, working to convey a single idea in multiple different ways helps ensure that that idea

486
00:25:53,904 --> 00:25:58,026
is going to be understood regardless of what kind of communicator is on the other end.

487
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:05,911
Taking a little bit of time to communicate clearly, in my experience, helps prevent miscommunication

488
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:08,232
which can be super costly sometimes.

489
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:13,999
But we eventually had to move from these nice looking mockups

490
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,522
and start putting the stuff in the game

491
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,766
and wrestle with the two or three weeks

492
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,610
where the game looked like an awkward teenager,

493
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,513
which is what this is right here.

494
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:30,971
So at this point I proceeded to create at least one of every major asset type in the

495
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:31,231
game.

496
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:35,093
So at least one commander, at least one unit, at least one building.

497
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,434
And the goal was twofold.

498
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,996
one, to get like a first-hand,

499
00:26:42,857 --> 00:26:44,619
a little bit of first-hand experience

500
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:47,081
and understanding of like the assumed art pipelines.

501
00:26:48,582 --> 00:26:50,604
So we could identify the weak points in that tech,

502
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:52,726
but also I needed to know how long

503
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:57,330
it was gonna take to make each one of these things

504
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,812
because we needed to build a schedule

505
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:04,196
that was based on something besides just like gut estimates.

506
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,737
And there's a lesson in that.

507
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,801
Uncertainty is, in my experience,

508
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:10,802
just about your worst enemy.

509
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:15,448
Experience is always better than an educated guess.

510
00:27:15,608 --> 00:27:18,031
And the longer I have let blind spots live,

511
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:20,233
the more time they've cost me in the end.

512
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:22,636
So again, in my experience,

513
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,900
it's best to remove those blind spots as early as possible.

514
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:30,734
So at the onset of these tests, I was thinking like,

515
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:32,795
okay, great, this is a pixel art game.

516
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:34,716
I can do everything in Photoshop.

517
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,276
I can have a nice, neat,

518
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:38,817
like single piece of software tool chain.

519
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:41,278
And since we're dealing with tiny resolutions,

520
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:44,900
I can basically just make like a super small PSD,

521
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,780
like 480 by 270 pixels,

522
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,082
and just paint all the environmental assets right in there

523
00:27:50,122 --> 00:27:51,902
without worrying about blowing through memory.

524
00:27:52,863 --> 00:27:54,243
Everything would look consistent.

525
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:57,766
because it's all like just painted right there

526
00:27:57,866 --> 00:27:58,666
in the same scene.

527
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,649
And in the end, that is how we produced

528
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,791
all the environmental assets in the game.

529
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:08,374
I have a PSD with no joke between two and 3,000 layers

530
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:11,996
that just has, bam, every environmental asset

531
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:12,997
that's in the game.

532
00:28:14,638 --> 00:28:16,860
But these early pipeline tests showed us that

533
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:20,142
animation was still going to kill us.

534
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:21,744
Even after the move to pixels,

535
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:22,805
it was still going to kill us.

536
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:25,827
Now it's worth mentioning that one of my goals for the animation

537
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:29,830
was that I wanted really lively, kind of organic, nuanced

538
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:32,993
animation and not like the limited frames,

539
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:34,634
no in-between.

540
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:40,400
approach usually associated with traditional pixel art, and the reason I wanted to do that

541
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,566
was because one of the conditions of moving to pixels was that we had to be sure we did

542
00:28:46,606 --> 00:28:49,789
it in a way where we couldn't be written off as just another indie pixel game.

543
00:28:51,852 --> 00:28:52,793
I hate this animation.

544
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:55,896
So in theory...

545
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:01,706
The move to pixels actually made that goal of like really nice animation more achievable.

546
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,549
Like I said before, we could focus entirely on big broad gesture.

547
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:06,091
We didn't have to get caught in details.

548
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:09,554
We could have all the in-betweens I wanted.

549
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:10,876
We could do it right at chickity.

550
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,980
We didn't have to like hire an army of French animators.

551
00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:21,622
But animating in Photoshop for me is like so cumbersome.

552
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:24,866
And I know it is a bad artist that blames his tools.

553
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:30,332
But there's no way to like quickly move between frames

554
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:31,634
and like, and I'm talking about like.

555
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:35,237
like the rough animation, not painting frames.

556
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:37,859
It just feels like everything takes more than one click.

557
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:40,201
It's really hard to nail that initial gesture,

558
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,963
and that makes the final results suffer.

559
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:46,466
So I need to figure out a new tool chain at this point,

560
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:50,129
and realistically I needed to find a way to cut scope too

561
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:53,231
because there was just so much animation in the game.

562
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:58,840
So just like before, I made time to think about the problem before me.

563
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,666
I allowed myself to consider ideas that seemed bad.

564
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,168
This isn't actually me thinking.

565
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,632
I accidentally deleted four hours of work,

566
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,295
and then I just laid on the floor for five minutes.

567
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:19,110
So around this time, though, while I was trying to solve these problems, an insane opportunity,

568
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,474
insane fell into Pocket Watch Games' collective laps.

569
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:24,915
Hold on, water.

570
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:34,501
So I got the call while I was at lunch with my wife

571
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,362
at the bar underneath our studio,

572
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,165
and Andy asked, this is crazy,

573
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:41,847
but do you wanna be in a Coors Light commercial?

574
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:44,409
So.

575
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:55,190
Evidently, Coors was producing a new marketing campaign based on makers and artists and musicians

576
00:30:55,611 --> 00:31:01,159
and I guess how the cool, crisp taste of the Rockies inspired them to make cool stuff.

577
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,061
I swear this is true.

578
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:10,785
The premise of this commercial was that there's this team of like young dudes in a bar and

579
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:14,968
they're like scrolling on napkins and getting all excited and then it shows them like I

580
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:18,090
guess in their office and there's like big character drawings and stuff and they're like

581
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:23,373
oh wow I'm making the game and then there's like a launch party in a bar and like they're

582
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:28,356
showing the game up on a TV and it's like whoa we made the game and just everybody's

583
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:29,717
drinking Coors Light.

584
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,542
because that's like a very realistic thing that happens to all of us.

585
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:36,723
But here's the kicker.

586
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:41,086
We only had a fraction of the art in the game.

587
00:31:41,186 --> 00:31:44,428
We still had awkward teenager art going on.

588
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:51,333
So I had to do like a little mini crunch to make like a fake gameplay loop and a fake

589
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:52,234
title sequence.

590
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:56,076
So here's the title sequence.

591
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,160
It looks pretty good, right?

592
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,101
And then here's a gameplay loop.

593
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:08,264
So this is like squirrel D-Day, basically, and it never gets better.

594
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,898
So the commercial is actually shot,

595
00:32:14,118 --> 00:32:16,160
and then Coors decided to change direction,

596
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,600
the direction of the whole campaign,

597
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,001
and the whole thing was scrapped.

598
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:21,423
And because you need closure,

599
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,085
I'll tell you that I declined to be in the commercial,

600
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:28,027
because, and this may be shocking to all of you,

601
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,508
I don't drink a lot of light beer,

602
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:33,970
and it felt really dishonest to like, you know, promote it.

603
00:32:36,285 --> 00:32:43,608
But the gameplay loop was like the most perfect, albeit like super random, task to be required

604
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:44,328
at that moment.

605
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:49,730
It was a great proof of concept for a few ideas that I was kicking around in my own

606
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,652
head and they turned out to be game changers, utter game changers for the rest of production.

607
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:58,475
So the big one was the unit animation pipeline.

608
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:01,578
Given that I only had a week to get this done,

609
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:04,280
I went with a pipeline that I knew worked.

610
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:06,823
It was a little long and a little clumsy,

611
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:07,763
but I knew it worked.

612
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:11,847
What I would do is I'd do the rough animation in Flash.

613
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,609
I'd export it out without anti-aliasing.

614
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,112
I'd rebuild the sequence in Photoshop,

615
00:33:17,132 --> 00:33:18,453
and then I would just paint the frames.

616
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:24,028
This was the same pipeline I developed to create a trailer of a little unreleased

617
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:28,430
game that Chickadee was making in-house. It was clumsy for that

618
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:32,733
because the characters were bigger, the sequences were longer,

619
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:36,615
the shading was a little bit more complex and had to be tracked. Basically

620
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:38,396
there's just like more of everything.

621
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,017
If I got to Photoshop and I realized like

622
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:47,021
I wanted a core change. I would kind of try and make it happen right there, but usually

623
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:50,563
I'd have to go back to flash and that means any painting I had already done would be scrapped

624
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:54,545
and it was this like really cumbersome back and forth thing that just took a lot of time.

625
00:33:55,846 --> 00:34:00,028
But for the characters of Tooth and Tail, like the squirrel comes in at like 10 by 10

626
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:04,711
pixels. It's tiny. This whole thing was lightning fast for this stuff. There wasn't really a

627
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,372
need to ever go back and forth.

628
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:10,642
uh... as long as i i really tried to capture like the gestalt of the

629
00:34:10,722 --> 00:34:14,712
animation in flash any changes i need to make i could just make in photoshop

630
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:19,002
So on the surface, it seemed like this was gonna be clumsy,

631
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,203
but it turned out to be pretty efficient.

632
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:22,823
And then once we took it to production,

633
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:24,064
I added a few steps that again,

634
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,664
it made it seem like it was gonna be slower,

635
00:34:26,504 --> 00:34:28,245
but it turned out to be even more efficient.

636
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:30,746
So in production, I would create the rough lines in Flash,

637
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:32,426
and then I would test those in game.

638
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,748
And then I would clean them up a little bit in Photoshop,

639
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,528
I'd do some like simple color fills,

640
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:38,929
and I would test those in game.

641
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:40,689
And then I would bring them back,

642
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:42,070
I'd do my final shading passes,

643
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,550
and I'd be left with my final artwork.

644
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:48,011
so i mentioned before about the benefit of uh...

645
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:50,333
baby steps at this uh... stop

646
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:54,516
like small problems from becoming compound and and turn into a much bigger

647
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:54,836
problems

648
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:56,217
uh... richard williams

649
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,959
who is like a master animator he wrote this book

650
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,480
animator survival kit

651
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:02,122
and talks about the long shortcut

652
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:07,567
He says, the long way turns out to be shorter because something usually goes wrong with

653
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:11,471
some clever rabbit's idea for a shortcut and it turns out to take even longer trying to

654
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:13,032
fix everything when it goes wrong.

655
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:15,555
This is some of my absolute favorite advice.

656
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,416
I love sharing it.

657
00:35:17,377 --> 00:35:21,020
In my own creative life, I've taken it to mean important stuff usually takes time to

658
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,222
do so don't make it go even longer by half-assing it.

659
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,044
So in the case of the animation pipeline,

660
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:28,986
baby steps maybe took more time up front,

661
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:31,367
but I no doubt saved tons of time

662
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:32,928
that reshoots would have taken

663
00:35:32,948 --> 00:35:34,189
had I not been so cautious.

664
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,472
We had another win for the unit animation

665
00:35:38,593 --> 00:35:40,154
in terms of a scope cut.

666
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:42,716
So originally Andy envisioned four directions

667
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:44,038
of movement for the unit.

668
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:46,300
So diagonally, up, down, left, and right.

669
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:49,122
I suggested keeping them in profile

670
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:52,926
would help the silhouette read more clearly and consistently

671
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:56,089
while also reducing the amount of animation we had to do.

672
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:57,490
But there was a little bit of a concern

673
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,312
that maybe that would just look wonky like a...

674
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:05,617
unit staying in perfect profile walking around a more 3D world.

675
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:10,140
But the commercial proved that this approach was going to work just fine.

676
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:15,705
Additionally, I myself discovered that I really didn't need as many in-betweens as I initially anticipated.

677
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:20,649
So, you know, again, test your assumptions. I was wrong. I'm happy I did my test.

678
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:28,183
Another big gain from the commercial was the discovery that we could use 3D models to create

679
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:29,983
pretty decent pixel work.

680
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:37,745
Now when I first thought of this idea, I laughed at how bad it was, because it is a bad idea.

681
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:45,787
Certainly we could use 3D models and render sprites, but trying to use 3D models to render

682
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:50,648
that looked like they were hand-painted seemed like a really roundabout way to get a good

683
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:51,088
result.

684
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:53,570
of getting a result, right?

685
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,931
Just paint the sprite.

686
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:00,895
But just like with the character animation,

687
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:03,597
there's a little bit of experience from my past

688
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:04,338
that I could draw on.

689
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,281
So one evening, many years ago,

690
00:37:08,301 --> 00:37:11,563
I was fooling around and I made these little 3D shapes

691
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:14,165
and I rendered them at a super low resolution

692
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,666
and I thought like, oh, that's kind of funny,

693
00:37:15,686 --> 00:37:17,467
they look like pixel art, but I made them in Max

694
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:19,529
and I toss them on my Tumblr and that was that.

695
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:24,702
But because I had this tiny bit of experience

696
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,103
in my back pocket, I thought, okay,

697
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,003
well, this is probably gonna be a waste of time.

698
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:33,204
But the fact is I need to figure out a way to render,

699
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:37,285
or to get, like, 60 or 70 frames

700
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:39,986
of slow, windmill rotation animation.

701
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:42,226
And I need to get it quickly.

702
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:44,987
So a proof of concept will probably only take me an hour,

703
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,868
and then once I fail at that,

704
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:49,728
I can kind of just get it out of my head

705
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,628
and figure out, like, the right way to do it.

706
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:55,871
But in an hour, not only did I have my proof of concept,

707
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:56,551
it was just done.

708
00:37:56,772 --> 00:37:58,273
That's all it took, which was awesome.

709
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:03,376
So I'll walk you through the setup real quickly,

710
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:04,597
just in case anyone's interested.

711
00:38:04,637 --> 00:38:07,038
So first I made a camera that was angled

712
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:08,779
to match the in-game camera.

713
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,102
Then I tossed the windmill tower, which wasn't animated.

714
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:15,844
That's just on a plane in the background,

715
00:38:15,884 --> 00:38:17,645
and the plane is aligned to the camera.

716
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:23,309
I created two versions of the windmill blades.

717
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:26,851
One is aligned to the camera, which kind of gives it a weird angle.

718
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:27,832
It makes it hard to work with.

719
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:32,315
But then I had an instance proxy off screen or off camera.

720
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:35,757
And that was aligned to the world, which was a lot easier to work with.

721
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:39,879
I unwrapped it, I gave it a tiny, tiny resolution texture.

722
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:42,200
I turned off filtering on all the maps

723
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:45,402
to maintain those chunky pixels.

724
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:47,003
And then when it was time to render,

725
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,524
I just turned off antialiasing

726
00:38:49,484 --> 00:38:52,206
and set it to a really tiny resolution,

727
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:52,886
and that was that.

728
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:54,987
I got my 70 frames of animation,

729
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,128
and it only took an hour, which was awesome, again.

730
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:00,610
The process actually worked so good

731
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,071
that we just kept it around for the final windmill.

732
00:39:03,111 --> 00:39:04,692
This is the windmill that's actually in the game.

733
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:10,697
I'm going to jump ahead a little bit, but this is all related.

734
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:17,483
This workflow found an even more important use down the road, which is for the commander

735
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:17,843
flag.

736
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:19,084
Now, there are four commanders.

737
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:23,487
Each one has a different flag, and each commander has about 80 frames of animation, and that

738
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:27,010
flag is moving around in all different ways for each of those frames.

739
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,452
There's no duplicates.

740
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:33,976
In the original commander test, which is what this is, I hand-painted...

741
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:36,517
those flags and it took forever.

742
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:43,380
In fact, how we were going to get this done was the only open question we had left going

743
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,361
into production.

744
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:51,324
I just kind of assumed I'm going to have to hire someone to do this part of it because

745
00:39:51,464 --> 00:39:54,866
I can't be tied up for like four weeks just painting fabric.

746
00:39:57,279 --> 00:40:00,063
But I was also a little bit concerned about the fragility of it, right?

747
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:06,493
If we went ahead and did all that work and then we realized we needed a core change to the animation,

748
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:09,978
that is a ton of time just tossed out the window.

749
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:13,123
And again, we're working on a really tight schedule.

750
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:17,456
But the 3D pipeline saved us here.

751
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,257
So again, at first blush, I thought this probably won't work.

752
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:24,120
The commanders are way more complex than the windmill.

753
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,341
They're moving around in all different ways.

754
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:30,283
But I decided, again, it's worth a proof of concept.

755
00:40:30,523 --> 00:40:31,824
I can probably get something going.

756
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,046
Maybe not even something that looks good,

757
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:38,028
but I could figure out in about an hour or two,

758
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:40,309
is this worth pursuing?

759
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:43,666
And after about an hour, I discovered that, yes,

760
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:45,187
despite that extra complexity,

761
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:48,830
we could get a 3D flag to track with the original 2D flag.

762
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,271
At this point, all the commanders had

763
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:54,634
just like a flat shaded flag in place

764
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:56,156
that was properly animated.

765
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:58,778
And you can see here, it's like super simple.

766
00:40:59,878 --> 00:41:01,920
It's like just kind of a low density mesh.

767
00:41:03,181 --> 00:41:04,602
The bones don't even have controls.

768
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:08,045
I'm sorry, animators, I know that's super, super bad.

769
00:41:10,116 --> 00:41:12,437
And after a couple more hours, I figured out a material setup

770
00:41:12,998 --> 00:41:14,258
that yielded pretty good results.

771
00:41:14,298 --> 00:41:16,059
So I had two UV sets on the flag.

772
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,902
The first one held a static texture, the chunky pixels,

773
00:41:20,942 --> 00:41:21,983
kind of just like the windmill.

774
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:23,724
And the second one had a static texture.

775
00:41:24,564 --> 00:41:30,648
a bump map on it that was animated to scroll from the flagpole out to the end of the fabric.

776
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:34,990
And that was used to kind of create these like tiny undulations that would have been

777
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,352
time-consuming to do like in a rig.

778
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:44,396
You combine the physical animation of the flag with that texture animation and you get

779
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:48,038
the final composite, which you know, that works pretty good.

780
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:49,979
Here it is in-game.

781
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:50,299
Now.

782
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:57,087
After a couple more hours of lighting and tweaking values here and there,

783
00:41:57,107 --> 00:41:59,729
kind of trying to fine tune it, this is what we got.

784
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:05,612
So because we're all kind of used to looking at a lot of game art

785
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:07,454
and working with this kind of stuff,

786
00:42:09,295 --> 00:42:11,316
I'm sure you can all look at this and say,

787
00:42:11,336 --> 00:42:12,797
I mean, that's pretty cool,

788
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:16,499
but it doesn't like perfectly match the hand-painted artwork.

789
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:18,720
And that is true.

790
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:18,800
But.

791
00:42:22,421 --> 00:42:35,031
I am a pragmatist and I believe in the admittedly unromantic but I think still powerful and

792
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:38,694
human and kind of poetic notion of good enough.

793
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,093
Good enough has a bad reputation, I think.

794
00:42:45,435 --> 00:42:48,999
When I say good enough, I think maybe a lot of you

795
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,162
can imagine a time when you've had to say,

796
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,805
like, okay, well, this is, we have to ship,

797
00:42:54,845 --> 00:42:55,846
so whatever, good enough.

798
00:42:57,348 --> 00:42:59,250
But I think good enough is like more measured

799
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,431
and powerful than that.

800
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:05,602
So as I said before, I'm a college educator.

801
00:43:06,723 --> 00:43:08,545
And one of the things I tell my students

802
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:11,889
is not to stress out too badly about finding a job.

803
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:14,331
In order to get a job, you really only need two things.

804
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:15,753
You need to have the base level of skill

805
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:16,714
and just don't be an asshole.

806
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,093
You're gonna enter the industry as a junior artist,

807
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:23,235
and people know when they hire a junior artist,

808
00:43:24,196 --> 00:43:26,379
there's gonna be some education that needs to happen.

809
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:28,781
You're not expected to do the work

810
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:30,883
of a lead artist right out of the gate.

811
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,725
Maybe as a student, you don't even realize

812
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:34,367
there's a difference between those two things.

813
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:39,806
You know, but don't worry, because if you try hard,

814
00:43:40,046 --> 00:43:43,369
if you put the hours in learning those core skills,

815
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:47,651
you try and develop your ability to solve visual problems,

816
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,552
you get out and do some networking,

817
00:43:50,513 --> 00:43:52,054
and you try and be a good person, don't worry,

818
00:43:52,074 --> 00:43:52,835
you're gonna be good enough.

819
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:58,093
So what's the real philosophy of good enough then?

820
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:00,674
Good enough is about looking at the whole package

821
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:01,995
and weighing all options.

822
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:05,776
I tell my students, I've never hired the best person

823
00:44:05,816 --> 00:44:07,777
who applied for a job when I've been in a studio

824
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:09,017
and in charge of hiring artists.

825
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:11,598
I've never hired the best artist,

826
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:13,439
but I've always hired the best fit.

827
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,780
Certainly, how well someone can practice their craft,

828
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,081
that is a huge part of it.

829
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:21,742
I don't want to mislead anyone,

830
00:44:21,802 --> 00:44:23,682
but also what kind of person are they?

831
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:25,683
Are they nice to be around?

832
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,963
Do they express their ideas clearly?

833
00:44:29,204 --> 00:44:31,524
Are they a good problem solver?

834
00:44:31,604 --> 00:44:32,965
Are they self-reliant?

835
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:33,625
Are they funny?

836
00:44:34,725 --> 00:44:35,626
Are they nurturing?

837
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:36,966
Are they responsible?

838
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:39,207
Or are they just an asshole?

839
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:41,407
So back to the Fleck.

840
00:44:43,235 --> 00:44:48,139
uh... this process turns uh... five weeks of painting by hand intellect just

841
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:50,081
a week of work to get all of them done

842
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:54,404
uh... we can do it all it should be in spending instead of spending money on an

843
00:44:54,464 --> 00:44:55,364
outside contractor

844
00:44:55,925 --> 00:45:00,068
uh... we can if we need to do a retake we can build off of what's already there

845
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:04,111
uh... if we need to add more animations in the future again we have our base

846
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:05,952
so the slight mismatch

847
00:45:06,753 --> 00:45:11,594
in visual style is totally fine when weighed against those gains.

848
00:45:11,994 --> 00:45:16,335
And what's more, the 3D flags actually made an awesome feature possible

849
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:18,515
that would have been totally impossible otherwise.

850
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,356
Using this approach gave us a really easy way to do decals,

851
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:24,716
custom decals on the flag.

852
00:45:25,176 --> 00:45:26,857
Because we have a 3D model and a camera,

853
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:28,357
we know where things are sitting in space.

854
00:45:29,657 --> 00:45:31,557
So I could render out a sprite sheet of a flag

855
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:33,598
that was basically just a screen space normal map.

856
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:39,759
and he was able to use the sprite sheet to dynamically place any random image

857
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,081
uh... on the flag in real time here we have a little monaco guy

858
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:45,903
uh... so players now have like a way

859
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,345
to make like custom banners for themselves

860
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:51,587
for their clans i don't know if plans are still a thing they were when i was

861
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:54,349
younger just going to be used for means probably

862
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:58,572
is still it's pretty cool

863
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:00,073
uh... and just think

864
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:05,887
the decals on the flag, the whole 3D pipeline,

865
00:46:06,188 --> 00:46:10,869
the 2D animation pipeline, all of these beautiful trees

866
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:15,591
grew from seedlings nourished by the crisp, cool taste

867
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:17,291
of the Rockies light.

868
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:20,132
My talk should be sponsored by Coors and it's not.

869
00:46:21,273 --> 00:46:22,293
Okay, but let's do some lessons.

870
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:22,993
So,

871
00:46:24,222 --> 00:46:30,587
I won't say that bad ideas don't exist, but I do think that most ideas probably aren't

872
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:31,047
bad.

873
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:33,469
They're just ideas.

874
00:46:33,629 --> 00:46:39,173
They're maybe not widely considered, and therefore maybe they're a little scary, but I think

875
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:43,917
that also means that they're not obvious, and therefore they're loaded with potential.

876
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:50,402
So when looking at an unconventional idea, resist the urge to say, we've...

877
00:46:51,754 --> 00:46:56,623
we're under too tight a deadline to consider that crazy, stupid idea.

878
00:46:57,124 --> 00:47:01,693
If you can do proof of concept in a short amount of time, I think you're crazy not to

879
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:02,014
do that.

880
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:08,286
And make time for random experiments

881
00:47:08,346 --> 00:47:09,428
outside of your main work.

882
00:47:09,668 --> 00:47:12,932
I am admittedly terrible at this.

883
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:15,735
I have an iron work ethic

884
00:47:15,856 --> 00:47:18,359
and a crippling sense of responsibility.

885
00:47:18,939 --> 00:47:20,441
I'm really fun to be around.

886
00:47:22,003 --> 00:47:23,344
So I have a hard time to just,

887
00:47:23,764 --> 00:47:25,345
allowing myself to just sit and make art.

888
00:47:26,326 --> 00:47:29,949
But if I hadn't been just fooling around in Macs

889
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:32,511
all those years making stupid little primitives,

890
00:47:32,751 --> 00:47:35,073
render as pixel art, while my wife watched,

891
00:47:35,233 --> 00:47:39,876
I don't know, Pretty Little Liars or something else

892
00:47:40,017 --> 00:47:44,080
that's great, I probably would never have considered

893
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,661
the 3D for the windmill.

894
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,503
And the ramifications of that would have been

895
00:47:48,943 --> 00:47:49,664
astronomical.

896
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:54,635
So on to the last leg.

897
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,038
It was early summer of 2015.

898
00:47:57,098 --> 00:47:58,119
We had our pipelines.

899
00:47:58,159 --> 00:47:58,900
We were on schedule.

900
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,681
We pushed ahead.

901
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:03,386
We announced the art style Switch along with the name

902
00:48:03,466 --> 00:48:04,367
Switch in the August of 2015.

903
00:48:05,288 --> 00:48:07,531
The game used to be called Led to Fire.

904
00:48:07,591 --> 00:48:08,873
Now it's called Tooth and Tail.

905
00:48:09,774 --> 00:48:10,755
Here was a game.

906
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:14,138
that was a visual homage to the greats of the past,

907
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,219
but I think was also a bit of a fresh take

908
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,320
and had some new ideas in terms of gameplay.

909
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,981
I suppose it's ultimately a subjective thing,

910
00:48:21,762 --> 00:48:23,563
but I do think we made a pretty good case

911
00:48:23,603 --> 00:48:26,604
for why we weren't just like another indie pixel game.

912
00:48:27,752 --> 00:48:32,777
The clouds and sun rays and water were all dynamic and shader driven.

913
00:48:32,797 --> 00:48:36,400
The water actually was basically a 3D water shader crammed down into 2D.

914
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,562
And the waves were driven by dynamic wind forces.

915
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:44,126
And props to Andy for making all that stuff happen, because I originally said, oh, just

916
00:48:44,146 --> 00:48:44,707
bake it in art.

917
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:46,148
And he was like, no, it has to be real.

918
00:48:47,709 --> 00:48:48,490
And it looks dazzier.

919
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,452
It looks dazzier than if we tried to bake it in art.

920
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:55,251
uh... so as i said before the game was always about the blast to play but the

921
00:48:55,291 --> 00:48:57,072
kind of an inconsistency of the old art

922
00:48:57,452 --> 00:48:58,672
i'm gotten away of that

923
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:02,214
uh... ever gotten away of people discovering that rather so with that

924
00:49:02,254 --> 00:49:05,715
barrier removed on the press was more interested in more people started

925
00:49:05,815 --> 00:49:06,875
joining our alpha community

926
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:09,234
This is my favorite slide.

927
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:13,094
In the fall of 2015, Chickadee picked up a couple interns

928
00:49:13,134 --> 00:49:15,175
that were like instrumental in helping us

929
00:49:15,195 --> 00:49:17,395
hit our art target, Harrison Brown and Samar Makhuk.

930
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,176
So together, along with Jerome,

931
00:49:20,236 --> 00:49:21,996
we all pushed ahead on the art.

932
00:49:22,016 --> 00:49:24,216
So let's just take a look at some shots

933
00:49:24,256 --> 00:49:25,217
in no particular order.

934
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,537
We iterated the environment artwork.

935
00:49:28,857 --> 00:49:30,938
So we're using color and value here

936
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:34,298
to indicate collidables and elevation.

937
00:49:36,437 --> 00:49:37,817
We animated all the units.

938
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:40,978
This is just what I could fit into a single slide.

939
00:49:41,018 --> 00:49:42,839
There's about twice as many.

940
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,741
Units are points of high contrast and vivid colors,

941
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:49,382
so they pop off that terrain.

942
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:55,585
We had time for some winding iteration on a few units.

943
00:49:55,765 --> 00:49:57,165
I've learned that it's always good

944
00:49:57,565 --> 00:49:59,506
to plan dead space into any schedule

945
00:49:59,566 --> 00:50:01,587
because not everything is gonna go perfectly.

946
00:50:01,627 --> 00:50:03,868
You're gonna need a place for those mistakes

947
00:50:03,888 --> 00:50:04,888
to kind of fill into.

948
00:50:08,344 --> 00:50:09,484
We animated all the buildings.

949
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:11,884
This windmill right in the center

950
00:50:11,924 --> 00:50:13,225
is like my favorite thing from the game.

951
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:17,126
I made a point to Pocket Watch.

952
00:50:17,926 --> 00:50:19,646
Well, it's worth saying that all of this animation

953
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,207
was done pretty late in production.

954
00:50:21,247 --> 00:50:23,507
I made a point to Pocket Watch that we should live

955
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:25,628
with the static versions of the units in the buildings

956
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:30,329
as long as possible so that the inevitable ebb and flow

957
00:50:30,509 --> 00:50:32,650
of the design wouldn't relegate a bunch of...

958
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,671
animation to the trash.

959
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:39,352
We wanted to wait until the design was more or less settled

960
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,093
before diving into this stuff,

961
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:42,653
again, because we had such a tight deadline.

962
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:48,456
Jerome painted amazing portraits for each unit

963
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:51,137
and each commander also did a bunch of marketing shots

964
00:50:51,197 --> 00:50:52,097
that aren't shown here.

965
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,160
We lost a chunk of time to UI iteration,

966
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,981
and that's kind of a pretty common thing.

967
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:01,361
UI always takes a long time.

968
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:04,741
But I don't think we did ourselves any favors,

969
00:51:05,742 --> 00:51:08,842
because we never really had a solid plan

970
00:51:08,862 --> 00:51:10,303
or took time to think long term.

971
00:51:10,603 --> 00:51:12,483
As we were doing this stuff, it was kind of like,

972
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:14,623
oh, okay, well, once we make this change,

973
00:51:14,683 --> 00:51:15,804
then it's gonna be perfect.

974
00:51:16,484 --> 00:51:19,584
And then compounding that poor mentality was,

975
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:23,505
The fact that our tools were a little cumbersome,

976
00:51:23,765 --> 00:51:26,726
they didn't really allow for rapid iteration.

977
00:51:26,886 --> 00:51:31,368
So because we were worried about taking too much time,

978
00:51:31,428 --> 00:51:33,008
we really didn't do the proper legwork.

979
00:51:33,848 --> 00:51:36,689
And it ended up taking way more time in the end.

980
00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:41,070
We should have done the long shortcut, right?

981
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:41,631
And we didn't.

982
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:43,391
And I think it cost us.

983
00:51:45,112 --> 00:51:46,792
But hey, look at this, particle effects.

984
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:49,101
that was kinda like a downer slide

985
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:51,766
and now we have like a really zazzy slide right here.

986
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:57,056
So there's tons of, it's a game about battle,

987
00:51:57,076 --> 00:51:58,258
there's tons and tons of effects

988
00:51:58,299 --> 00:51:59,200
and they were a lot of fun to do.

989
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:03,207
So Art slept a little bit.

990
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,509
We didn't hit the end of the year,

991
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:09,515
but we did hit like the second or third week in January.

992
00:52:10,035 --> 00:52:11,657
And then we shipped shortly thereafter,

993
00:52:11,697 --> 00:52:13,540
just kidding, we worked on the game another year.

994
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:18,526
And we did that because game development.

995
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:21,229
So.

996
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:27,834
Before I go any further, I should be like absolutely clear from this point on this is like personal reflection

997
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:31,196
This isn't pocket watch. It's not even really chickadee

998
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:34,837
It's just you know one guy who makes games kind of reflecting on that stuff

999
00:52:34,878 --> 00:52:40,220
It's a little bit like a like a personal post-mortem except the games not out yet, so it's like a pre post-mortem

1000
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,301
I guess I don't know

1001
00:52:43,513 --> 00:52:47,335
So the extended development was seeded, I think,

1002
00:52:48,116 --> 00:52:50,758
by our improved standing with gamers and press.

1003
00:52:51,818 --> 00:52:54,740
When I started on the project,

1004
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,222
I think there was a little bit of a fear among the team

1005
00:52:57,262 --> 00:53:00,404
that this was maybe a niche game and it might bomb.

1006
00:53:01,365 --> 00:53:03,646
The increased visibility and excitement

1007
00:53:03,907 --> 00:53:06,889
reduced those concerns, but replaced them

1008
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:09,190
with the worry that maybe a minimum viable product

1009
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,271
wasn't gonna be enough.

1010
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,485
And then this guy joined the team,

1011
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:17,107
and he began wagging his jaw.

1012
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,071
Some of that wagging was pretty decent.

1013
00:53:22,512 --> 00:53:23,893
It made decent sense, right?

1014
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:26,775
It felt logical.

1015
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:31,519
Some of it was a little more superfluous.

1016
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:39,252
If you've been in games, if you've made a game even as a student, you kind of know about

1017
00:53:39,752 --> 00:53:40,813
the feature creep.

1018
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:46,758
A lot, maybe most of his ideas are cool, but he talks in box bullet points.

1019
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:53,264
He doesn't really consider objective merit or time, but he appeals to emotion like a

1020
00:53:53,344 --> 00:53:56,507
great salesman, and it's really hard to not listen.

1021
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,529
Let's take a look at the weather system.

1022
00:54:00,652 --> 00:54:05,435
As an example, the weather system allows us to do surprise different kinds of weather,

1023
00:54:05,455 --> 00:54:07,716
but also different times of day.

1024
00:54:07,736 --> 00:54:09,557
And it makes the screenshots look super zazzy.

1025
00:54:09,577 --> 00:54:10,718
They look really, really nice.

1026
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:14,788
But it dismantles the visual hierarchy a bit.

1027
00:54:15,189 --> 00:54:17,950
It flattens values and homogenizes color.

1028
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,851
It actually makes the game harder to play.

1029
00:54:20,931 --> 00:54:23,753
As a visual purist, I lament that loss of clarity,

1030
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:27,695
but at the same time, it makes for a more marketable product

1031
00:54:27,775 --> 00:54:30,236
as far as screenshots and video are concerned.

1032
00:54:30,336 --> 00:54:31,337
It looks fancier.

1033
00:54:32,777 --> 00:54:33,698
So was it worth it?

1034
00:54:35,054 --> 00:54:35,534
I don't know.

1035
00:54:35,594 --> 00:54:37,776
I suppose it depends on what metric you're measuring.

1036
00:54:38,697 --> 00:54:41,459
But our process, I think, was undeniably messy.

1037
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,142
We took an idea suggested by FeatureCreep.

1038
00:54:45,302 --> 00:54:47,905
We didn't do our homework beforehand

1039
00:54:47,945 --> 00:54:49,606
to figure out the true scope of it.

1040
00:54:50,647 --> 00:54:52,849
And we implemented it before we had a mock-up.

1041
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:56,512
We basically tossed aside a bunch of the very practices

1042
00:54:56,812 --> 00:54:58,654
that led to our previous success.

1043
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:08,243
This wasn't a brick laid in surface to a carefully considered long-term plan or even really a poorly considered long-term plan.

1044
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,926
It was just a brick that we kind of like the shape of.

1045
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:14,870
So who knows if we actually needed it to finish our house?

1046
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:20,756
It may be made for a better product, but did it make for a better game?

1047
00:55:23,724 --> 00:55:25,606
I don't want to give the wrong impression either.

1048
00:55:25,886 --> 00:55:28,989
We were all working really hard during this time.

1049
00:55:29,049 --> 00:55:35,695
We were adding new features, we were showing the game off at conventions, we were considering

1050
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:37,797
publishing and platform possibilities.

1051
00:55:38,258 --> 00:55:39,299
Seasons passed.

1052
00:55:41,196 --> 00:55:45,879
I think we're all just, you know, like trying to make the game better bit by bit, and that's

1053
00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:50,542
cool, that's a very organic way to approach game development, and I think there are times

1054
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:53,624
when that's exactly how you want to approach your craft.

1055
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:59,628
But in comparing the first year I was on Tooth and Tail to the second, I think all evidence

1056
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:03,910
points to the fact that we did our best work when we were under a deadline.

1057
00:56:05,735 --> 00:56:09,137
uh... the initial you know get this done by the end of the year deadline was

1058
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:10,337
self-imposed but

1059
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:14,398
uh... we stuck to it and help focus our decision-making we didn't have time to

1060
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:15,439
be wishy-washy

1061
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:18,060
the week-long crunch for the course commercial

1062
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,181
uh... forced me to quickly test a few ideas that turned out to be game

1063
00:56:22,221 --> 00:56:22,621
changers

1064
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:25,602
now

1065
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,984
Obviously, the reality of game development is that it's time consuming.

1066
00:56:33,305 --> 00:56:33,686
I get it.

1067
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:39,471
And I'm not trying to argue that through the magic of project management, you can find

1068
00:56:39,531 --> 00:56:43,334
a secret shortcut from the kitchen to the study.

1069
00:56:44,295 --> 00:56:45,256
That was about Clue.

1070
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,098
A little esoteric, I know, but I really wanted to put it in there.

1071
00:56:50,104 --> 00:56:53,488
But I will say that smart, consistent project management,

1072
00:56:53,608 --> 00:56:55,570
in this case, you know, slowing down to think

1073
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:58,934
about our approach, having a clear goal in mind,

1074
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:01,476
tossing dead time into a schedule

1075
00:57:01,516 --> 00:57:02,497
for when things don't work out,

1076
00:57:02,517 --> 00:57:04,460
basically all the stuff that I just spent 45 minutes

1077
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:08,724
talking about, it allowed us to get about 12 months

1078
00:57:08,744 --> 00:57:10,126
of artwork done in about 10.

1079
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:12,408
We were like art machines that first year.

1080
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:16,725
In the second year, we were way less efficient.

1081
00:57:17,766 --> 00:57:18,746
We wasted time.

1082
00:57:18,946 --> 00:57:21,208
Now, I'm sure many of you can think

1083
00:57:21,248 --> 00:57:23,549
of inefficient development cycles

1084
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:25,810
and think of how expensive it is,

1085
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,651
like, oh, that's extra monthly burn.

1086
00:57:28,651 --> 00:57:30,092
And that's true, but I think that's a very

1087
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:32,753
business-oriented way to view

1088
00:57:33,914 --> 00:57:35,275
the downside of poor planning.

1089
00:57:35,915 --> 00:57:39,056
I think the steeper cost is far more human.

1090
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:45,897
The monetary costs of your development are recoupable, but your time is not.

1091
00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:49,640
So something to think about.

1092
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:57,425
If through thoughtful planning and disciplined management, you were able to release a game

1093
00:57:57,565 --> 00:57:59,867
three months earlier than you would have otherwise.

1094
00:58:00,723 --> 00:58:02,044
That's effectively free time.

1095
00:58:02,664 --> 00:58:04,005
What would you do with that time?

1096
00:58:04,585 --> 00:58:06,866
Would you prototype a new game?

1097
00:58:06,886 --> 00:58:08,007
Would you dive back into it?

1098
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:11,529
Would you learn a new skill or gain an experience

1099
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:13,950
that would inform your future game making?

1100
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:17,921
or maybe you would just go outside once in a while

1101
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:19,402
and spend time with loved ones.

1102
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:21,984
Again, I get it.

1103
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,047
Development is just hard and it takes a lot of time,

1104
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:28,850
but poor planning is just about the dumbest,

1105
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,273
most pointless, most avoidable,

1106
00:58:32,393 --> 00:58:36,637
just shittiest excuse for wasting time.

1107
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,641
you're not getting it back, none of us are.

1108
00:58:42,222 --> 00:58:44,784
The time we spend on our games comes from someplace,

1109
00:58:44,844 --> 00:58:47,746
it comes from every other experience we might gain

1110
00:58:47,866 --> 00:58:49,006
if we weren't doing that.

1111
00:58:50,968 --> 00:58:54,470
Simply put, to borrow a phrase from Andy Nguyen,

1112
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,431
one of the other pocket watch folks,

1113
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:58,913
he talks about maximizing value,

1114
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,433
the man likes to find a good deal.

1115
00:59:02,735 --> 00:59:05,036
I think simply put, it's tragic to not maximize

1116
00:59:05,076 --> 00:59:06,117
the value of your life.

1117
00:59:08,557 --> 00:59:11,258
But I'll tell you what, this is heavy, right?

1118
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:13,479
We thought we were learning about pipelines and stuff,

1119
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:15,020
and it's like, what's this guy talking about now?

1120
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,201
I don't wanna come off as a bummer,

1121
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:19,162
or defeatist or anything like that,

1122
00:59:19,202 --> 00:59:21,323
because Tooth & Tail, actually, in my eyes,

1123
00:59:22,203 --> 00:59:23,924
is already an incredible success,

1124
00:59:24,424 --> 00:59:25,324
and we haven't launched yet.

1125
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:28,826
But it's a success, not for any of the reasons

1126
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:30,767
I've talked about in the last hour.

1127
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:33,428
It's successful because it brought people,

1128
00:59:33,468 --> 00:59:35,889
it brought other human beings, it brought them together.

1129
00:59:38,101 --> 00:59:42,022
Even before launch, Tooth & Tail has had an astounding community.

1130
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:47,283
And this is largely thanks to the cultivation efforts of Andy Nguyen,

1131
00:59:47,303 --> 00:59:48,964
the guy that I just mentioned.

1132
00:59:49,984 --> 00:59:52,285
This is a community that's hundreds and hundreds of people

1133
00:59:52,905 --> 00:59:54,385
before we ever launched. Active players.

1134
00:59:54,405 --> 00:59:55,965
And I don't say this like, oh, it's a stats thing.

1135
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:59,706
It's, it's, this is, these are people all over the world

1136
01:00:00,407 --> 01:00:03,687
sharing their excitement and happiness and they're learning together.

1137
01:00:04,488 --> 01:00:06,808
Old players help new players learn the game.

1138
01:00:08,389 --> 01:00:11,853
They invent new strategies and record them and put them online.

1139
01:00:11,913 --> 01:00:13,554
It's like, oh my God, do you see what that guy did?

1140
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:17,638
There are people who modded the game before it's ever been released.

1141
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:23,945
There are people who are learning how to make games by modding our little unreleased game.

1142
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,386
That is mind-blowing to me.

1143
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:31,593
One community member, CapnFog, that's him right on the second third of the image right

1144
01:00:31,613 --> 01:00:33,876
there, he came out to help us at PAX East.

1145
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:35,838
He was a local there in Massachusetts.

1146
01:00:35,858 --> 01:00:41,705
He did all the grunt work, like grabbing waters and grabbing sandwiches and stuff like that,

1147
01:00:41,765 --> 01:00:42,806
and he demoed like a pro.

1148
01:00:42,846 --> 01:00:43,307
He was awesome.

1149
01:00:43,327 --> 01:00:44,588
He was my MVP of the week.

1150
01:00:47,215 --> 01:00:50,957
We made a thing that was a force of good in the world.

1151
01:00:52,138 --> 01:00:55,220
And that is my personal best case scenario

1152
01:00:55,601 --> 01:00:57,562
for what defines a successful game.

1153
01:00:57,962 --> 01:01:00,884
Weighed against that, I feel pretty comfortable saying

1154
01:01:01,205 --> 01:01:03,226
that all of our development practices,

1155
01:01:03,306 --> 01:01:05,688
warts and all, were probably good enough.

1156
01:01:07,089 --> 01:01:07,969
That's my talk, thank you.

1157
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:09,250
Um.

1158
01:01:16,055 --> 01:01:16,495
You have any?

1159
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,898
All right, well, thanks for attending, everybody.

1160
01:01:25,158 --> 01:01:26,338
Fill out the thing,

1161
01:01:26,379 --> 01:01:28,240
because it helps this whole thing go better.

1162
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,280
Oh wait, do we have a question?

1163
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:30,141
Thank you.

1164
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:32,883
I just had a quick question about the flag stuff.

1165
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:34,624
Yeah, sure.

1166
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,286
How dynamic did you have to make the flags

1167
01:01:37,366 --> 01:01:39,687
as far as how they moved around with the characters?

1168
01:01:39,747 --> 01:01:40,888
Are they like separate sprite sheets

1169
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:43,190
that are oriented around the characters?

1170
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:45,030
So that's a good question.

1171
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:50,411
So the question is, are the flags different sprite sheets from the rats?

1172
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:58,353
No, the rats and the flags are all the same sprite sheet, although when I rendered the

1173
01:01:58,453 --> 01:02:01,614
flags, the rats weren't included in that render.

1174
01:02:01,794 --> 01:02:06,915
So I basically did a pass of the flags, and then I had the original rat animation with

1175
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:10,776
the flag pull and stuff, and I just smashed them together in Photoshop and saved out the

1176
01:02:10,816 --> 01:02:13,237
final image, the final sprite sheet.

1177
01:02:14,237 --> 01:02:14,417
Yeah.

1178
01:02:14,877 --> 01:02:15,098
Thanks.

1179
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:15,478
Yeah.

1180
01:02:18,419 --> 01:02:20,621
Hi, my name is Chris and I'm from Indonesia.

1181
01:02:20,781 --> 01:02:24,423
Actually I saw your game on PAX East and it's amazing.

1182
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:25,163
Oh, thank you.

1183
01:02:26,064 --> 01:02:32,447
And my question is, you seem, when you change the art style, it seems like there's some

1184
01:02:32,507 --> 01:02:35,809
changes in the code as well, like in the grid system and everything.

1185
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:40,392
And because I think, I see that you have some technical knowledge.

1186
01:02:40,972 --> 01:02:43,255
But what if there's, for example, an indie team,

1187
01:02:43,915 --> 01:02:46,358
and the artist basically wants to change the art style,

1188
01:02:46,418 --> 01:02:49,081
but he doesn't know the technical side of it?

1189
01:02:50,222 --> 01:02:52,144
How do they communicate with the programmer,

1190
01:02:52,184 --> 01:02:53,285
and how do they convince that?

1191
01:02:53,906 --> 01:02:54,967
That's a really good question,

1192
01:02:55,127 --> 01:02:56,488
and that's maybe a big question.

1193
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,693
So, the question is,

1194
01:03:03,669 --> 01:03:08,471
How do you make these big broad changes if the artists themselves don't possess that

1195
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,673
broad technical knowledge?

1196
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:17,316
In Tooth and Tail, Andy Schatz is an amazing graphics programmer.

1197
01:03:17,356 --> 01:03:18,877
That was one of the team's strengths.

1198
01:03:18,917 --> 01:03:23,659
I knew that I could make requests that were moderate and he would be able to get them

1199
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:25,160
done in a reasonable amount of time.

1200
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:30,242
If you don't have that, or...

1201
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,400
I don't possess those skills myself.

1202
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,941
I can't code up shaders.

1203
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:40,421
That's something I can't do.

1204
01:03:43,002 --> 01:03:51,245
All of these requests that I made, I did those storyboard images of like, okay, here is exactly

1205
01:03:51,305 --> 01:03:51,906
what I want.

1206
01:03:52,206 --> 01:03:57,728
A lot of those images were just, here's how I made it in Photoshop, step by step.

1207
01:03:58,228 --> 01:04:02,972
like oh I blocked out like this black portion and then I blurred it and then I

1208
01:04:03,652 --> 01:04:09,237
did like a weird distort thing and then we use that as a mask and fill in a

1209
01:04:09,297 --> 01:04:14,381
different texture and that's enough that was enough for Andy to say like okay

1210
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:19,265
cool I see what you're doing here and I know how to translate that to code I

1211
01:04:19,305 --> 01:04:19,806
think really

1212
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:22,600
I don't know if it would work for every team,

1213
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,622
but the way we did it was just being really

1214
01:04:24,682 --> 01:04:27,925
exhaustive with communication and basically

1215
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:30,587
drawing little pictures to aid that.

1216
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:33,769
I'm not sure how it would work with other teams, though.

1217
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:36,632
It really, I think, depends on the dynamics of your own team.

1218
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:39,594
All right.

1219
01:04:39,995 --> 01:04:40,575
Thank you, everybody.
