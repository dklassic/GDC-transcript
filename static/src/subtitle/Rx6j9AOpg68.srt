1
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,575
OK, I'll get started.

2
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:09,556
Firstly, hello.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,476
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:11,496 --> 00:00:13,357
My name is James Svensson, and I'm

5
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:16,318
a producer at a wonderful British studio, Criterion

6
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:16,638
Games.

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,820
Over the past decade, these are some of the games

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,400
that we've made.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,541
You might have played a Burnout game, or even Black,

10
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:29,642
or then more recently, some of our Need for Speed games.

11
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:32,443
I joined Criterion.

12
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:36,254
Just after the launch of Burnout Paradise back in 2008,

13
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:39,596
where I cut my teeth as an online engineer,

14
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:41,897
working on that year of Paradise,

15
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:44,999
where we just kept on adding new content to the game

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,019
after its initial release.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,161
Since our most recent game, we've

18
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:52,162
been keeping busy working on a huge new and exciting

19
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:52,982
multi-vehicle game.

20
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:54,783
This one's going to be the biggest game

21
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:57,485
that Criterion's ever built. And it's not something

22
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:58,705
I'm going to talk more about today,

23
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:00,206
but I will promise one thing.

24
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,310
And that's that it's going to share something with all these previous titles.

25
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:07,272
And that is our Criterion DNA.

26
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:09,053
So these are our core pillars.

27
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,474
These are the values that we hold up to ourselves.

28
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:14,256
They define the games we've made and all the games that we want to make.

29
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:16,977
So first up, accessibility.

30
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:19,839
Criterion's a studio that makes arcade games.

31
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,402
We want our games to be easy to pick up but difficult to master with a depth of mastery.

32
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,503
Then there's intensity.

33
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:29,485
And that's best real experiences define our games.

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,921
We really want to get the player's adrenaline pumping.

35
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:34,403
And then quality.

36
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:36,604
We hold ourselves as a AAA studio,

37
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:39,086
and we want to be up there at the forefront of technology,

38
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:41,668
making great games and great software

39
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:45,430
that our players will love and be free of frustrations.

40
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:49,173
Then there's this idea of connected.

41
00:01:50,214 --> 00:01:52,936
So what we've always been trying to do with our games

42
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:54,357
is push the connected experience,

43
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:55,998
because we think playing with your friends,

44
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:58,400
that's the best gaming experiences that you can have.

45
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:00,519
That one's quite simple.

46
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,440
And then there's innovation.

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,081
We always like to do things differently.

48
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:07,443
Each game we make, there's always something that we're

49
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,204
trying to do differently and new and not

50
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:09,944
rest on our laurels.

51
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:19,170
So today, I'm here to talk about our 2010 title, Need

52
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,070
for Speed Hot Pursuit.

53
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:23,032
And I want to talk about Autolog specifically.

54
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:27,034
I really want to drill into Autolog, partly because that's

55
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:27,775
the part that I made.

56
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:33,752
And here's the Autolog team back in 2010, with me looking a

57
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:38,155
little bit more fresh-faced and floppy-haired than I am now.

58
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:42,277
I suppose that's what becoming a dad does to you.

59
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:46,760
But then, so 2010, that's quite a long time ago.

60
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,302
Most of the time, we see postmortems on games that have

61
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:53,765
just come out, or these games that are fed by nostalgia.

62
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:58,152
But I think it's really important that we take time to actually recognize our history

63
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:02,773
and keep looking back at games throughout so that we can spot those trends and spot those changes.

64
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:07,675
But also, Hot Pursuit, it's one of countless Need for Speed games,

65
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:11,596
but it's really important to talk about Hot Pursuit because this is the point for Criterion

66
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:15,777
where we really recognize what it means to be constantly connected with your friends

67
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,038
and it really changed our way that we think about making our games.

68
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,060
Also, it's a great core game experience.

69
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:29,401
I think there's a lot of big AAA development happening today where the ambition and the

70
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:35,485
huge sprawling scope is contending against the ultimate quality that they can achieve

71
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:39,148
with such split and segregated development.

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,850
Whereas with Hot Pursuit, that's a title that...

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,342
The game experience, it's really well honed.

74
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:47,024
It's really simple, it's really straightforward,

75
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,165
and it's a great core game.

76
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,307
And I still think that the actual experience

77
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:53,709
of playing that game is still one of the highest quality,

78
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,071
funnest experiences that you can have in an arcade racer.

79
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:58,594
Then there's autolog.

80
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:02,517
So at first glance, it might be thought

81
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,299
of as just friends leaderboards and some mechanics

82
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,061
to sort of push that rivalry.

83
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,539
It really came to define the game.

84
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,440
It made a genuinely social experience

85
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,281
where friends could play together and against each other

86
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:19,222
even when they're not online at the same time.

87
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,383
And those lessons still apply today.

88
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:25,244
But before diving into the making of Autolog,

89
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:28,266
let's have a look at a trailer from the game

90
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:32,207
just before it shipped, just to refresh everyone's memories

91
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:33,368
as to what that game was.

92
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,294
Put on your seatbelt as this will take a few minutes to reboot...

93
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:02,594
Grab

94
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:04,856
Put on your seatbelt as this will take a few minutes to reboot...

95
00:42:39,220 --> 00:43:08,549
...

96
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:18,507
So that was Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. Exotic cars, epic drives, cops. The name Hot Pursuit,

97
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:22,310
it's about the thrill of the chase. This was a game of two halves. It had two separate

98
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,453
progressions, two sets of super cars to unlock. A player could choose to play as the racers,

99
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:30,635
completing races, trying to set records.

100
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:34,523
or you could play as the cops. Now the cops, their super cars

101
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:37,704
were tuned and upgraded and they had cool tech and weaponry so

102
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:41,386
that they could give chase and catch those races and then take

103
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:44,428
them down. But ultimately whether you're playing as the

104
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:47,070
cops or whether you're playing as the racers, it's a game about

105
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,992
speed. And at its heart, it's a pure arcade racer. So throughout

106
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,994
the whole game, it was really pure and simple. The motivation

107
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:58,216
was to be the fastest and that competition, like any good

108
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:00,557
racing game, defines that core experience.

109
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:04,346
And because we nailed it down to this very, very tight core

110
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:07,309
experience and didn't diverge from that, it meant that

111
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:10,031
Autolog could be there to amplify that core experience.

112
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:13,054
And it focused it directly on competing between you and your

113
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:13,314
friends.

114
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,199
The development of it started a little over six years ago.

115
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,543
So jumping back to 2009, which in the world of tech feels

116
00:07:23,563 --> 00:07:27,286
like a lifetime ago, this was Criterion's first

117
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,087
need for speed game.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,661
And we wanted to keep it simple, so we drew inspiration from the

119
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:36,182
original 3DO Need for Speeds. Exotic cars. This was the first

120
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,143
time we had licensed cars, and we really wanted to celebrate

121
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:42,764
the heritage of those cars. And also, it was the first time we

122
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:45,805
were working with the data from manufacturers, and we kept true

123
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:49,586
to that. So we redid our physics model, we redid our handling

124
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,727
model. We did it again and again and again until we had it

125
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:54,327
perfect so we could take all of those torque curves, take all of

126
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:56,588
those aerodynamic coefficients and all that good physics-y

127
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:56,748
stuff.

128
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,217
and have the accurate, not 60 times, have the accurate top speeds.

129
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,078
In fact, when we were making the game,

130
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,259
there was a point in development where I think it was the Mercedes SLS,

131
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,720
it was sort of five miles an hour above

132
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,161
the actual quoted top speed.

133
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,662
And we were scratching our heads a bit and then we realized that

134
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:21,063
the CAD model, the tires on it, were slightly wrong, they were the wrong wheels.

135
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:25,444
And just that tiny little difference made that difference in the simulation.

136
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:30,893
It's good to just have that data and be true to that because it's a really nice physical

137
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:31,814
underpinning to your cars.

138
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,734
And then the next was Epic Drives.

139
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:40,616
So our ambition was to make a world that was stitched together from all the best of the

140
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,817
epic West Coast drives that there are here in the US.

141
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:49,038
So that was stitched together with these huge big vistas and every time you came around

142
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,659
a corner we tried to put as many big vistas in the game as possible.

143
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,280
Whether it be a mountain vista.

144
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:59,777
A big open stretch of desert, these gorgeous stretches of coastal highway where you suddenly

145
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:00,937
see a big bridge or something.

146
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:07,819
But then also stretches of rural areas and farmland, and then giant redwood forest.

147
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,180
Then our third pillar players the cops.

148
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,041
Advanced weaponry, battling, high speed pursuits felt like this was a great opportunity for

149
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:18,022
us to get our Criterion spectacle into the game.

150
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:23,353
When we had these things, we just slather over the top of it,

151
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:24,594
Criterion Special Source.

152
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:26,915
This is what Criterion's known for.

153
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:31,217
As I said before, we're an arcade racing game studio,

154
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:34,778
and we've got a great heritage of arcade races through Burnout.

155
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:37,539
And these are underpinned by spectacular physics,

156
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,547
But also we always try and have accessible handling over the top of this.

157
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,710
So as well as boost, we've got responsive controls.

158
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,092
And the world was made with these long sweeping turns.

159
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:52,197
So actually that road network, a lot of time goes into the angle of those turns,

160
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,298
the angle of all those corners.

161
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,419
And, um...

162
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:58,692
In terms of having intuitive drift, it's not a drift button.

163
00:09:59,072 --> 00:10:01,052
You can either tap the brake, you can hold the brake,

164
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:03,193
you can tap the e-brake, all of these different ways

165
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,393
so that whatever the player's intent is,

166
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,474
we can pick that up in the game

167
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:10,154
and translate that into the drift that you want to see.

168
00:10:11,715 --> 00:10:14,555
Then, crashing, sense of speed, intensity.

169
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,656
Cinematic spectacle is where Criterion really feels at home.

170
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:21,717
And from our previous games, from Burnout, from Black,

171
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:23,657
we know how to craft these experiences.

172
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:31,026
The other thing we hold really dear to us is friends and putting friends at the heart

173
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:31,446
of the game.

174
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:35,568
So Burnout 3 was when we started experimenting with this.

175
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,349
It was EA's first online title.

176
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:44,331
And then Burnout Paradise, this is where we really pushed our open world to be able to

177
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:46,692
have that seamless online.

178
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:50,334
So you could jump into a game, jump into a friends game, then matchmake into a public

179
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:53,315
game all without leaving the world and constantly driving around.

180
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:57,539
And we started really beginning to experiment in that year of Paradise when we were developing

181
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,849
Free Burn Challenges, which for our Burnout Paradise fans, that still stands as some of

182
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,031
the best card play you can have.

183
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:15,732
But this friends at the heart of the game, it's not a solved problem, but we know that it's really important to us because when you're playing a game with friends, then that makes the game endless.

184
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:24,094
Your game becomes a vehicle for your friends to get together and hang out and interact together and just have those interactions between real people and real people.

185
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:28,656
Gamers are social people and having those interactions with friends that you can attribute.

186
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:34,235
that you can attribute those actions to a real person

187
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:37,878
just makes it a lot more interesting, a lot more meaningful

188
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:39,559
and it makes it more memorable.

189
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,961
And then those interactions and that fun that you have in the game

190
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:45,662
that can spill over into your real world conversations.

191
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:48,144
And in that way the game just grows and grows

192
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:50,846
and becomes a really great experience to share.

193
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:56,609
But then the problem with trying to get real friends into a game together

194
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:57,310
especially back in 2009

195
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,478
Real friends lead real lives.

196
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,299
And it's really hard to coordinate

197
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,640
to get online at the same time.

198
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:08,604
It's hard enough to get colleagues out to the pub

199
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:11,246
after work on a Friday night, let alone everyone

200
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:14,448
online at the same time with the same game when they're at home.

201
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,372
And so this is something we actually

202
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:22,613
knew from our telemetry on Burnout Paradise.

203
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:26,256
A really great part of being.

204
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:30,018
part of EA is that we have access to all this great data

205
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:32,259
across EA's portfolio.

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,861
And so what we saw here, this is looking at the average peak

207
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:40,124
simultaneous users, weekly peak simultaneous users, back from

208
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:43,906
2010 across a representative set of EA titles.

209
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:47,147
And we were seeing that more and more players were now

210
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:50,409
connecting to our servers, but then only a smaller proportion

211
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,410
of those people were playing in online multiplayer.

212
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:56,673
So while we were having more players connected.

213
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:01,477
There aren't as many people as we wanted getting in to have that connected experience to have

214
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:04,559
fun with their friends because they're just not going into online multiplayer.

215
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,122
And I know from my own personal experience, online multiplayer, it's not always the most

216
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:12,885
welcoming thing, especially as you start getting older, your reactions are slowing down, and

217
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,167
there's only so many times I can get schooled by 17-year-olds.

218
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:15,547
So then...

219
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:23,447
We really thought rather than trying to push players into online multiplayer, how can we

220
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:27,608
create these meaningful and ongoing social play experiences for those millions of players

221
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:30,450
that are connected but don't want to play online against others.

222
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,692
So this felt like a really great opportunity to create play with friends using asynchronous

223
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,152
interaction.

224
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:43,896
So just to recap, synchronous, that's a phone call, asynchronous, that's a text message.

225
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:47,883
But the thing that's great about asynchronous,

226
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:50,123
it's things like broadcasting.

227
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:51,444
You know, you get notifications.

228
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:54,445
Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp, these

229
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,907
are communication tools that allow people to share much more

230
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:01,888
with more friends, regardless of living different lives.

231
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,009
And this felt like a real opportunity for the game,

232
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,370
the space in which we could innovate and bring friends

233
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,712
together by focusing on those asynchronous interactions.

234
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:13,693
And then we could really make it about real friends.

235
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:26,234
So just to put your minds back to 2009, this was when we started making the game.

236
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:36,744
So in 2009, there's a picture of Xbox Live at that point, or of the dashboard, and it

237
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:37,785
was a very different place.

238
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:44,948
So we knew from other EA titles, we had telemetry showing us that the majority of players, so

239
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:49,089
on Skate 2, 54% of players had only one friend or zero friends.

240
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:55,111
So friends, it was just a very early time in how people were using the social features

241
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,812
of Xbox and PSN.

242
00:14:57,392 --> 00:14:58,732
They were just really getting off the ground.

243
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:01,939
But at the same time, we had social networks.

244
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,621
And they were now mature, because Facebook had been

245
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:04,802
around for a few years at that point.

246
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:08,185
And so we wanted all of these things that you had on

247
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:10,066
Facebook and on other social networks.

248
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,069
So we wanted to be able to find friends of friends, to be

249
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:15,911
able to grow our friends network by seeing what friends

250
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,774
of friends had got up to, and also to just have those things

251
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:21,876
like sharing, like commenting, like profile pictures, which

252
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:23,498
we now just have built into our consoles

253
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:24,178
and take for granted.

254
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:28,159
So that was step one.

255
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,943
Step one for our social play for Hot Pursuit,

256
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:34,785
we didn't quite know what we were making.

257
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,967
But the first thing was, hey, let's build a website.

258
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:39,128
And then we're going to build a web browser

259
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:40,349
and put that into our game.

260
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,732
And that website in the game, that was our game front end.

261
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:48,216
And then, hey, that was the year I got a smartphone

262
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:48,836
for the first time.

263
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:50,137
And that felt really cool and exciting.

264
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:51,919
I could put that website on my smartphone.

265
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,241
It was the same website in the game as out of the game.

266
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:55,161
So.

267
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:58,425
It felt very new and exciting and different.

268
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,588
But the other thing that we learned very quickly was that

269
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,352
actually working in web for a front end is really powerful

270
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:08,815
because that rapid iteration speed that you get with web is

271
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:11,017
just worlds ahead because there's no build time.

272
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:12,419
You're not waiting for anything.

273
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:15,662
It's just you make a change and you see it straight away.

274
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,465
So we could try out lots of ideas very, very quickly.

275
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,047
So it meant it was great for discovery.

276
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:27,039
But then the problem with this is this is not a console UX

277
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:27,600
experience.

278
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,662
And text entry, that's a problem for trying

279
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:32,823
to make these social features.

280
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:35,365
So writing out comments and posts

281
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,787
using an on-screen keyboard, that's

282
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:39,568
no way to spend precious console time.

283
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,252
So version 2, this is what we really got to.

284
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:47,413
This was the exciting part.

285
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:49,715
We automatically generated stories.

286
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:50,876
We did the work for the player.

287
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:54,418
and it worked. It gave people a real sense of playing with other people.

288
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:59,542
The game had to track everything, and all of these actions became human stories,

289
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:02,865
and they were then shared back to me and my friends,

290
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,789
and it became the way you played the game.

291
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,798
there was a feed for every game mode.

292
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:11,079
And so there was no longer an event list,

293
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:14,400
there was no set way of playing through the events.

294
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,560
You just played the events that were based

295
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,541
on what your friends played.

296
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:19,361
And so you got a sense of what was popular.

297
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,382
And playing the events became this sort of

298
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:23,183
back and forth conversation with your friends.

299
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:26,244
But the real promise there came from

300
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,145
when we started tracking leaderboard changes.

301
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:30,425
And then we could build these stories

302
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:31,666
from those leaderboard changes

303
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:32,946
to make them as rich as possible.

304
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:35,547
And also, it's that point of

305
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:39,790
Rather than just showing a leaderboard, you really, by writing a story about it, you're

306
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,071
really focusing in on where that player is on the leaderboard and what they need to do

307
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:44,292
to take that next position.

308
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:47,973
So just break down that task of getting to the top of the leaderboard into one step at

309
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:48,313
a time.

310
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,095
The other thing we had was a call to action.

311
00:17:54,235 --> 00:18:00,758
So at every single opportunity throughout this website front end that was the first

312
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:01,478
version of Autolog.

313
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:05,498
We gave people the opportunity to jump straight into the game,

314
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:06,859
to play what was being talked about,

315
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:08,720
to play what was posted to a photo feed,

316
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,862
to play what was talked about on the wall.

317
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:15,044
And we put these call-to-actions at all points.

318
00:18:16,064 --> 00:18:17,405
So wherever you were in the game,

319
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:19,186
you could just jump straight to the event and play it.

320
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,888
And that, to us, felt really, really interesting at the time

321
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:25,570
because it meant that it was totally dynamic.

322
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,391
Whatever I was playing, whatever I was being fed

323
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:30,253
was what the game told me about through this social network,

324
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:31,494
through what my friends were doing.

325
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:38,237
To show an example of that, here was our rapid response feed at the time.

326
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:45,562
So those events were recorded and every action was tracked and then a comparison was made

327
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:48,684
for every single time one of your friends attempted the event.

328
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:53,868
And so yeah, as I said, there was a feed per event type split by cop or racer.

329
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:56,870
And that was the main way to play the game.

330
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,732
So if your friend tried an event, it was in your feed ready for you to try.

331
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:04,959
And at that point, we were like, excellent.

332
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,400
Now you're really feeling like you're

333
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,523
playing with your friends whenever you played the game.

334
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:15,210
But the problem with this was need for speed social.

335
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,833
That doesn't sound like it might have been engaging.

336
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:19,234
It was interesting.

337
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:21,216
You got a real sense of what your friends were doing.

338
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:23,979
And you could have taken that further to start.

339
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:31,204
If you got into it, then you could really choose how you played and sort of set up your own progression with your friends.

340
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:37,411
But ultimately it wasn't fun. It hadn't honed in on this on this core experience and.

341
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,112
There was also this other problem of we've been building in web for a while now

342
00:19:42,552 --> 00:19:43,913
and we had really bad feature creep.

343
00:19:43,993 --> 00:19:46,635
We were writing checks that we wouldn't be able to cache in production

344
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:48,636
because we had all these features.

345
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:54,459
We had a timeline feature where all of your actions got amalgamated

346
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,881
and aggregated into these timelines that you could compare against other players

347
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:01,242
and we were just getting ahead of ourselves.

348
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:03,924
We had all these multiple feeds and ways of managing those feeds,

349
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,325
ways of looking at your friends' feeds.

350
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:08,760
And really, we'd gone a bit too far with it.

351
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:11,803
And that meant we had this terrible problem with signal

352
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,924
to noise ratio, and it was really hiding

353
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:14,585
the fun of the game.

354
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:18,168
So what were we going to do?

355
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:20,170
So this got us scratching our heads a bit.

356
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,313
And the answer was in Beat It.

357
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:28,557
So we were asking ourselves, how are these features in

358
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:29,398
service to the game?

359
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:33,221
And we took all of those automated feeds, and then we

360
00:20:33,762 --> 00:20:34,382
curated them.

361
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:38,480
automatically to be one feed of recommendations.

362
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:41,283
Because throughout the whole time of playing with your friends,

363
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:46,447
it might seem obvious now, but the most compelling motivation,

364
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,990
way beyond anything else, is someone beat you.

365
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:52,453
Ultimately, when you look at popular events and things like that,

366
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,194
they're just not as interesting because

367
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:57,998
they don't change over time necessarily or...

368
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,200
Yeah, whereas someone beat you, that means,

369
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,022
hey, one of my friends, they've played my event and they're...

370
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:07,834
They've beat me at it, but I didn't really try, so I can go back and I can beat them.

371
00:21:07,894 --> 00:21:09,595
I can beat that one faster.

372
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:16,499
And it also made us change all of our events, because before that point, we also had events

373
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,640
which were based on points.

374
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:24,483
And we had a few different event modes, but if they didn't sort of...

375
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:27,504
If they didn't support this idea of being the fastest,

376
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:31,787
then they fell to the side because they weren't as engaging.

377
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:33,889
They weren't as natural to talk about an event.

378
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,250
You know, when you're comparing points,

379
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,132
it's one step removed from this idea of be the fastest.

380
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:41,575
And then we used all of these other rich stats

381
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:44,197
and comparisons that we had and that we were generating.

382
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:46,759
They were then layered through the whole game

383
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,161
to flavor every choice that the player made

384
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:51,162
as they played through it.

385
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,501
So then our previous recommendations, or our previous stories that were generated,

386
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,662
and the previous feeds that we had, became this one dedicated recommendations feed.

387
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,623
So, we took all of our recommendations and worded them as a BTIT.

388
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:11,744
That was really important, so if we had an event that was recommended because it was popular,

389
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:15,545
or because it was a way of pushing the player through the progression...

390
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:21,086
We reworded them. We took the player that was one above you on the speed wall, which is our

391
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:26,250
friend's leaderboard, and then we just worded it as, this player is 0.2 seconds ahead of you.

392
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:34,897
Beat them to take second. And with this, that just meant that every single time we had, even

393
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:39,881
if we had run out of beat-its of those places where a friend had beaten you, we were able to

394
00:22:41,597 --> 00:22:44,840
give that nudge for competition. We always like to say it's not

395
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,722
really, we don't want to push the player through competition.

396
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:50,344
We don't want to push the players into rivalry. But it's

397
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:52,105
more just like the game is there, it's just giving the

398
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:56,168
player a nudge and being like, you know what, this guy, I'm

399
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,431
just saying, but he's beaten you. And we felt that that was

400
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:03,774
really working. The other thing we did was we balanced that

401
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:07,276
signal to noise ratio. So we tuned it back so there were

402
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:10,078
never more than five cop and five racer recommendations.

403
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,402
And also at that point, for going into production, we recognized from a while back that we wouldn't

404
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:24,224
be able to make the responsive UX experience that we wanted on a website, especially on

405
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,664
previous generation consoles.

406
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,925
You just needed too much memory to have that sort of web experience.

407
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:34,927
So we rebuilt our front-end as a web-driven, console-oriented UX.

408
00:23:35,307 --> 00:23:38,468
So that meant it suited up, down, left, right, forward, and back.

409
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:46,365
So then to really break it down and give those examples,

410
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:51,006
I'm going to have a look at a session with recommendations

411
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:53,207
just to talk through what we shipped.

412
00:23:57,888 --> 00:24:00,589
We had a motto for Autolog, and that was connect, compare,

413
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:00,989
compete.

414
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,230
So this first section, that's about the front end.

415
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,830
It's about connecting me with my friends.

416
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:13,037
When you booted the game, you got this live connected front end.

417
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:15,918
So it had a load of content that was delivered by web.

418
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:19,660
And it set the scene by giving you recent updates of what

419
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,961
you'd been recently up to.

420
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:23,382
And it also gave you refreshes of what

421
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:24,282
your friends had been up to.

422
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:27,944
So the first of those social features,

423
00:24:28,064 --> 00:24:29,985
we still had those social features that made it through,

424
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:31,866
was photos.

425
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:35,488
Whereas today, we've got Xbox record that.

426
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:36,849
We've got the share button on PS4.

427
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,032
They do a lot of capturing of in-game content, but by

428
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:44,454
building a dedicated photo mode, by giving the player the

429
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:47,275
tools to take the time to compose a shot, that's still

430
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:47,956
really powerful.

431
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:50,257
And I think that's really important to remember, because

432
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:52,298
it's a great way for people to spread their passion with

433
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:56,461
their friends, but also it's got that in common with tools

434
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:57,722
that you want to build communities.

435
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,923
And that's what we started to see with our photo mode.

436
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:02,544
So.

437
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:07,387
Just to show you, these are some of the photos that came up

438
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:11,108
through dedicated blogs that started popping up about the

439
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:16,650
artistry of Sechrest County and about the great sites that

440
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,510
could be seen in the game.

441
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,191
And then some people take it further.

442
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:23,752
So a lot of the slides or a lot of the photos on my slides

443
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:26,373
are from the website deadendthrills.com.

444
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:29,368
where you've got this guy, Duncan Harris,

445
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:31,930
and he runs the website, and he goes around

446
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,351
taking screenshots from games

447
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:34,752
that have good screenshot capabilities.

448
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:36,494
He doesn't touch any of them in Photoshop,

449
00:25:37,254 --> 00:25:41,978
and he just makes an art out of taking screenshots.

450
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:43,939
And so then, by having these tools,

451
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:45,380
you're allowing your community

452
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,463
and those outstanding individuals in your community

453
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:52,245
to do this stuff and make your game look fantastic,

454
00:25:52,265 --> 00:25:54,647
and then share the best of your game with everyone else.

455
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:56,909
So that was really cool.

456
00:25:57,887 --> 00:25:59,188
It was nice to see those.

457
00:26:01,668 --> 00:26:03,309
And then we had our wall feature.

458
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,850
And as I said before, using an on-screen keyboard

459
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,030
might not be much fun.

460
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,231
And it might seem like a bit of a niche feature.

461
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:17,133
But it got really, really heavy use in our PC communities,

462
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:20,434
especially in the hardcore PC community in Scandinavia

463
00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:21,774
and Eastern Europe and in Russia.

464
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:25,395
Because PC players, that was their main tool

465
00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:26,195
for friend discovery.

466
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,837
So they're able to go there because on the wall you could

467
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:32,840
see posts from your friends of friends and replies from your

468
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,440
friends of friends.

469
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,483
So we had these huge, huge wall posts of people just

470
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,725
introducing themselves to one another and getting acquainted

471
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,668
to all share in that Autolog experience.

472
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,832
The other thing we built that was in our front end was friend

473
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:49,493
recommendations.

474
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:55,580
As I said earlier, more than half of all players had only one or naught friends.

475
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,142
And this was a game about playing with your friends.

476
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,064
So if you've got no friends, now you can get friends.

477
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:07,730
But back in 2010, when we were getting ready to release this, it's a sign of the times

478
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,471
that we really had to push with first parties.

479
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:14,217
that to get this feature released because they were concerned about the

480
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:18,501
privacy set up for being able to see friends of friends lists.

481
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,044
Whereas in today's world, that's just sort of, that's very,

482
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:22,345
very commonplace and it seems weird.

483
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:23,926
Why would you not want to see your friends' friends?

484
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:27,209
But in fact, I can't remember.

485
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,212
It only shipped on one of the platforms, I think, because of that.

486
00:27:33,075 --> 00:27:34,416
So if that was Connect, then.

487
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:40,419
The other thing throughout the front end and throughout your event select, we had compare.

488
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:48,963
So we put friend comparisons at every opportunity to really drive home the sense of playing with your friends.

489
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:57,906
So here on our map screen, a player works through both Cop and Racer events through this one map screen.

490
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:01,968
And in the bottom right, we've got this speed wall.

491
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:07,202
This is a cycling wall that goes through the speed wall, which is your friend's leaderboard.

492
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:14,185
Then it goes on to show you a comparison right where the player needs it, and it influences their event choice.

493
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:17,986
All the speed walls and story were pre-downloaded.

494
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:21,128
When you were picking an event, they were right there.

495
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:24,893
and you should have never had to wait for leaderboard fetches.

496
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:27,155
And it was an expensive tech investment,

497
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:29,237
but for a game about friends leaderboards,

498
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:31,959
that was really, really fundamental to it and worth it,

499
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,322
because we needed that sense of every single time

500
00:28:35,342 --> 00:28:37,223
you're flicking through the events trying to pick something,

501
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:39,085
you can see your speed wall,

502
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:42,387
and you can have that influence on your choice based on that.

503
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,421
So we also put a face to the name.

504
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:50,403
We shipped a feature to be able to get profile pics in the game.

505
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:53,745
Again, this is now provided functionality by first parties.

506
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:56,607
But we really wanted to humanize it.

507
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:58,988
We're also really passionate about this idea

508
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,730
of trying to get your real names into the game,

509
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,891
because especially on PSN, I'm still

510
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:06,193
embarrassed about my PSN ID that I set up all those years ago.

511
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:07,974
But I can't change it.

512
00:29:08,174 --> 00:29:10,175
But now at least they provide the functionality

513
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:11,256
to put your real name in the game.

514
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:15,799
And then there we go with the story.

515
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:19,902
So by automating the story, you get a refresher of what you did

516
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:20,543
last time out.

517
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:23,686
And you get that friend compare.

518
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,591
I said earlier about the idea of taking rich stats to really

519
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:32,193
flavor the stories, to be able to build up more of an

520
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:33,014
interesting story.

521
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:36,857
And attempts was a really big one for Need for Speed Hot

522
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:37,157
Pursuit.

523
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:40,260
So by tracking the number of attempts and presenting that

524
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:40,960
back to the player.

525
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,142
It made that friend competition really interesting.

526
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:47,065
So looking at this example, we've got Matt Webster,

527
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,127
who's our studio GM.

528
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:52,912
So DizzyRascal22, that's a group of all of our IT guys.

529
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:55,575
That's the account that they used to play in their lunch

530
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:55,815
break.

531
00:29:56,856 --> 00:29:59,759
And they took second from Matt, but Matt couldn't have

532
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,222
that, so he went straight back in there and took second back

533
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:02,502
from them.

534
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:05,630
And at that point, the competition got really serious.

535
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:11,153
So 1,375 attempts, that equates to about 20 hours

536
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:13,754
of dedicated playtime on just this one event,

537
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:16,716
which is ridiculous.

538
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:18,157
I mean, well done them for trying,

539
00:30:18,237 --> 00:30:21,459
but ultimately, it didn't get them anywhere, so jokes on them.

540
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,442
So then even with the context of friends,

541
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:29,604
a simple car select now has real meaning to me.

542
00:30:30,104 --> 00:30:31,625
So I can see what my friends have chosen.

543
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:33,759
to set their personal bests.

544
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:39,222
And then also, when we see this car,

545
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:41,464
so Matt Follett, he was our vehicle designer,

546
00:30:42,144 --> 00:30:45,626
and holy crap, he's amazing at racing games,

547
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:48,088
and he was at the top of every single speed wall.

548
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:50,949
So when I see Matt Follett use this car to take first,

549
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,852
I'm gonna take this car and try my best to control it.

550
00:30:55,892 --> 00:30:57,473
Personally, I found it a bit back-end heavy,

551
00:30:58,234 --> 00:31:00,435
but by knowing that Matt used that to take first,

552
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:02,519
It'll make me try that again.

553
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,600
It'll make me replay and try the game in different ways.

554
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,100
So connect, compare, compete.

555
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,401
That was compare.

556
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:13,041
And then the last section, compete.

557
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:18,342
So this was taking that nudge for friends' competition,

558
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:20,782
but seeing it through the whole way through to close out

559
00:31:20,822 --> 00:31:21,362
that game loop.

560
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,363
So when you're on the map screen,

561
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:27,043
you can get an autolog alert.

562
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:30,224
This is to say, since you were last hit.

563
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:34,576
someone's come along and they beat you. And then when you

564
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:38,018
follow that auto log alert, that button prompt, you get taken

565
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:41,900
through to your dedicated recommendations feed and we find

566
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,582
that Matt Follett's beaten me again. So as I said before, the

567
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:49,863
signal to noise ratio, that's had excessive tuning to surface

568
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:52,585
up all of those beat you recommendations first. They were

569
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,546
the stickiest ones, they were the freshest ones, they were the

570
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:57,807
ones that really got the competition going. Then we also

571
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,588
followed that up with some of those popular.

572
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:03,476
Those popular events to show what what your friends been

573
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:06,318
doing which was sometimes really interesting if you got

574
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:09,380
a run of friends trying to compete on one event

575
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:13,662
and then we finally if we didn't have any recent be used we

576
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:17,725
followed that up with these events that we recommended to push you through

577
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:22,068
push you through the progression to so you could play the whole game through

578
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:23,829
the recommends feet if you if you want to do

579
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:26,490
and keep just sort of hoovering up those events you haven't done yet.

580
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:31,842
So once I choose to play a recommendation,

581
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:34,783
it tells me about the recommendation.

582
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:36,223
It tells me about the recommendation

583
00:32:37,203 --> 00:32:40,484
through the loading screen and then again in the pre-event

584
00:32:40,504 --> 00:32:40,824
screen.

585
00:32:43,384 --> 00:32:44,685
And then the whole time I'm racing,

586
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:47,365
rather than racing against gold, silver, or bronze,

587
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:48,906
I'm racing against that recommendation.

588
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,406
So it's something that's there for me

589
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:52,826
to focus on the whole time I'm playing.

590
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:56,767
And then when I finish the event.

591
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:59,098
And then, hey, I came first, and I beat Clean Pete.

592
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:02,821
So it's great, because with that,

593
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:05,002
I know that my recommendations are updated.

594
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:07,504
But I also know that Clean Pete, when he logs back in,

595
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:09,966
he's going to have a recommendation sitting there

596
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:11,567
from me to say, hey, you know what?

597
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:12,107
Just saying.

598
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:13,048
Sven's just beat you.

599
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,972
And then, just to rub it in, we get that automated story.

600
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:20,833
And we give the player the opportunity

601
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:22,354
to post it to the other player's wall,

602
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,335
to just really rub it in, because then everyone

603
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:24,735
can see it.

604
00:33:28,058 --> 00:33:30,659
And the game takes me back to the Autolog Recommends feed,

605
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:31,940
ready to go again.

606
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,080
And that's the loop closed.

607
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:40,422
So that was a breakdown of a session of Autolog.

608
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:44,203
But next, I just want to talk about the outcome.

609
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:52,866
So overall, the game did all right.

610
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:55,787
I'm quite pleased with its reception.

611
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,004
My particular favorite here is Keith Stewart from The Guardian.

612
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:03,925
So The Guardian, if you don't know it,

613
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,826
it's sort of like the British New York Times.

614
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:07,687
And that's a review I can show my mom.

615
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,908
So she'll be really proud of me.

616
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:12,028
So way to go.

617
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:16,030
But the thing that he experienced and recognized

618
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,931
is that the game creates a beautifully seamless sense

619
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:20,252
of competitive multiplayer action,

620
00:34:20,752 --> 00:34:22,352
even if you're not online at the same time.

621
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:24,793
And that's exactly what we set out to do.

622
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,401
It was also, at launch, the highest rated Need for Speed

623
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:30,641
game.

624
00:34:32,342 --> 00:34:36,983
And then we won a BAFTA for it, which was really nice,

625
00:34:37,023 --> 00:34:40,644
because that's the industry it's voted for by others

626
00:34:40,684 --> 00:34:41,324
within the industry.

627
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:42,845
It's sort of like the British Oscars.

628
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:47,286
And that was awarded to us for innovation and making

629
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:48,326
great social gameplay.

630
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:51,827
They really honed in on this idea that we had found new

631
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:54,388
ways and really got it about playing with your friends,

632
00:34:54,888 --> 00:34:56,788
this idea of the social async gameplay.

633
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:03,284
And the great thing about it being a game that then launched

634
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:06,266
was real people can now play it, and we could see how our

635
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:08,006
design ideas actually paid off.

636
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:10,888
And that's the great thing about having telemetry and

637
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,309
having this time passed since its release is we've got a

638
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:15,950
real sense of how people played it over time.

639
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:21,453
So we know that 45% of all the events that were started were

640
00:35:21,473 --> 00:35:22,613
because of a recommendation.

641
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:26,235
And a player took, on average, five attempts to beat a

642
00:35:26,295 --> 00:35:26,875
recommendation.

643
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:29,676
So you're seeing there that we are getting real replay value

644
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:30,037
through.

645
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:34,220
The players that engaged with it, we had real replay value for them.

646
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:40,042
And also, 17% of event starts were through that dedicated recommendations feed.

647
00:35:41,143 --> 00:35:42,363
And that's actually a really big deal.

648
00:35:42,403 --> 00:35:45,984
So 17% is like 1 in 6-ish.

649
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:50,526
But those people are playing purely for the competition.

650
00:35:50,546 --> 00:35:51,986
They're not playing through the progression.

651
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:54,807
And they're not picking their own events as to what they're playing.

652
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,428
They're not looking at the map thinking,

653
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:57,628
oh, I want to play this event today.

654
00:35:58,609 --> 00:35:59,669
They're just playing whatever they...

655
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,570
whatever the game tells them, this is where you're going to

656
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,150
beat your friends.

657
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:05,532
So that was really neat.

658
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:09,535
The most competed over event was Vanishing Point.

659
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:12,057
And that's the same one, just by coincidence, that Matt had

660
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:13,538
that competition with the IT guys.

661
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:15,959
And it was a great event.

662
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,622
This was a pure expression of great arcade racing.

663
00:36:19,982 --> 00:36:21,303
It had a low barrier to entry.

664
00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:23,064
It was early on in the progression.

665
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:26,507
And it had this really straightforward, simple track

666
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:28,608
that ran through the middle of that desert.

667
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:33,665
And it only had two turns, but you had so much depth

668
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:36,788
in how you placed that car to shave off those microseconds

669
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:39,350
and how you went and how you kicked it into drift.

670
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:41,651
And also it looked great.

671
00:36:41,771 --> 00:36:42,992
It had the Pagani Zonda in it.

672
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:44,894
It was an exciting event to play

673
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,855
just because it was really straightforward.

674
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:51,318
Straightforward, but also very fast.

675
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:56,722
And then we've also got this telemetry

676
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:57,663
through looking at

677
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:03,059
This graph is actually generated after three years of play.

678
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,820
So it's a sort of uncannily straight line.

679
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,101
It's hard to believe.

680
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:09,261
I had to check the data myself.

681
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:16,905
But I don't want to push the idea too much of the

682
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:18,945
relationship, because as everyone knows, correlation

683
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:21,366
isn't necessarily causation.

684
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:22,987
But you could say that.

685
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:26,896
Hey, the longer players played, the more need for speed friends they had.

686
00:37:27,216 --> 00:37:32,218
So need for speed friends, that's friends that they added to their friends list

687
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,759
after they started playing the game that also had need for speed.

688
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,441
So as they went through the game, we saw people adding more friends

689
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:40,142
or having more friends.

690
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:45,144
And then so, but then you could also look at that from the inverse of

691
00:37:45,544 --> 00:37:48,445
the more need for speed friends a player added, the longer they played

692
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:50,726
because they were getting more replay value out of playing these

693
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:52,627
against these different people that they were adding.

694
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:58,553
And to put a slightly different view on that same idea

695
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:01,975
is when you plot the total number of Need for Speed friends

696
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:05,037
against the rank that they achieved in the game.

697
00:38:05,357 --> 00:38:08,319
So the game's progression, how you unlocked cars,

698
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:10,281
was by earning XP to go up a rank.

699
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:12,342
And so what we saw here was,

700
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:14,503
even after reaching that top rank,

701
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,325
players kept on adding friends

702
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:18,906
to squeeze further playthrough autolog.

703
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,568
So it really meant we were beginning to see,

704
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:23,089
or what we've seen is that

705
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:28,584
The people that engaged with the friends play really squeezed a lot of extra replay value

706
00:38:28,604 --> 00:38:29,084
out of the game.

707
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:33,086
They were doing that thing of using the game as a means to keep playing with their friends

708
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:40,870
rather than trying to play for in-game rewards, intrinsic rewards.

709
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:46,132
And as I said earlier, what that leads to is it spills over into the real world.

710
00:38:46,812 --> 00:38:50,714
And we can see just from looking at Twitter, some of the things, people just keep those

711
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:51,575
conversations going.

712
00:38:53,226 --> 00:38:55,488
Tweeting to each other saying like, hey man, I've just beaten you.

713
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,010
And it's really nice.

714
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,491
I don't know, this last guy,

715
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:03,113
asynchronous gameplay is my ideal method of multiplayer.

716
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:05,214
Console games need to get on that tip.

717
00:39:05,495 --> 00:39:07,336
Hot pursuit was a nice start.

718
00:39:07,756 --> 00:39:09,417
Hashtag autologue, hashtag dog.

719
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:12,259
I have no idea what hashtag dog means, but we'll take it.

720
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:16,742
And to date, the game's had over 10 million players.

721
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:19,584
So that's 10 million unique players have logged into our service.

722
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:22,426
Which is cool.

723
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:29,010
So then, fast forward to today.

724
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:34,393
And again, being part of EA, we can look at the trends

725
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,674
across a wider portfolio of games.

726
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,376
And we see that that connected gap, so here we've got the

727
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:42,558
number of players that are connecting to our servers and

728
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:44,679
the number of players that are playing synchronously online,

729
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:46,059
so in online multiplayer.

730
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,222
And we see that they've both grown, but that connected gap,

731
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,002
it hasn't gone away.

732
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:54,204
So even though we've got more and more.

733
00:39:54,654 --> 00:39:59,317
online games and very heavily online games, we're still seeing a lot of players that are

734
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:02,499
connected but aren't choosing to go into online multiplayer.

735
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:05,961
So that's really important.

736
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:09,963
It's saying that the opportunity that led us to make Hot Pursuit back in 2009 or make

737
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:14,066
those decisions that led to Autolog, those conditions haven't gone away and it's still

738
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:14,967
this big opportunity.

739
00:40:18,526 --> 00:40:20,668
The other big advantage we have today is we've got

740
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:26,575
just more and more academia in games and psychological research into player motivation.

741
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:32,261
So in 2015, so last year, there was an independent study

742
00:40:32,902 --> 00:40:36,145
that showed that 78% of American teenagers

743
00:40:36,826 --> 00:40:40,250
agreed with the statement they feel more connected to their friends that they play games with.

744
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,182
And also, from this study in 2014 that was commissioned by

745
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,463
Twitch, we see that gamers are really inherently social people.

746
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:51,564
So for those people that identify themselves as gamers,

747
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:57,426
we've got 57% of them agree with the statement, my friends are

748
00:40:57,466 --> 00:40:59,527
the most important thing in my life.

749
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,548
Whereas for non-gamers, that value is 34%.

750
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:05,309
So there's a big difference there.

751
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:10,951
And what that says to me is that, oops, sorry, jumping

752
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:11,131
ahead.

753
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,239
Yeah, what that says to me is that gamers

754
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:18,779
want these social experiences, and we

755
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:19,620
need to give them to them.

756
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,741
We need to find ways to make genuine interaction

757
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:23,361
between players.

758
00:41:27,422 --> 00:41:29,562
And then today, admittedly, there's

759
00:41:29,942 --> 00:41:31,143
more advanced friends networks.

760
00:41:31,163 --> 00:41:32,283
You can follow players.

761
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:33,804
You can have much bigger friends lists.

762
00:41:33,884 --> 00:41:35,604
It's no longer limited to 100 players.

763
00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:39,465
But it's still hard to all be online at the same time

764
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:41,506
with your mates, especially now that every time I

765
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:42,646
seem to boot up my console.

766
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:46,918
I've got another couple of patches or updates to download before I can even get into the game.

767
00:41:48,398 --> 00:41:52,419
And we can see from Most Wanted, which is our last title,

768
00:41:52,919 --> 00:41:55,660
that the majority of players, when they're matchmaking online,

769
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,101
they're going just against strangers and not playing with friends.

770
00:42:02,962 --> 00:42:05,662
And the thing is, playing with strangers, it's easy to forget that

771
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,023
and make games that are predominantly...

772
00:42:08,854 --> 00:42:12,196
expected to be played with friends because as developers we often sit

773
00:42:12,837 --> 00:42:16,680
with our consoles all lined up next to each other and sitting alongside each other playing our games

774
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:20,003
but that's not real world conditions and it's easy to

775
00:42:21,144 --> 00:42:24,767
to forget when you're making your games how important it is

776
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:28,770
to find ways to put friends in the game when you're playing away from each other

777
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,011
when you're playing at different times.

778
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,736
So that opportunity, that's still there.

779
00:42:37,578 --> 00:42:37,698
and

780
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,841
Since Need for Speed Hopsuit, there have been some other

781
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:44,542
really good examples of asynchronous social play.

782
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:46,883
But it's not become this dominant mainstay.

783
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:52,544
So in racing, our next racing title, which was Need for Speed

784
00:42:52,564 --> 00:42:57,126
Most Wanted, we had Autolog again.

785
00:42:57,466 --> 00:43:01,047
It was in the open world, but we had billboards because we

786
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:03,247
wanted to be able to put the player's face in the game.

787
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:04,988
So we had your friends.

788
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:07,929
The billboards were where you would try and go for.

789
00:43:08,975 --> 00:43:09,655
go for a long jump.

790
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:11,217
And so the billboard was to say,

791
00:43:11,237 --> 00:43:14,700
this is your friend that got the longest jump on that gap.

792
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:18,963
And it meant that you could have that sense of competition

793
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:21,425
with your friends in an open world game.

794
00:43:21,806 --> 00:43:22,746
And that was fun.

795
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,507
That was something different.

796
00:43:24,488 --> 00:43:27,490
But then DriverTASK, I'm a big fan of Forza's DriverTASK system.

797
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:31,033
Because every time I go in and play that game,

798
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:34,456
even if there's friends that haven't played the game,

799
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:36,098
they're still, their name is above the car.

800
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:37,118
So I can attribute.

801
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:42,064
I can attribute the actions of that other driver, that AI driver, to someone that I

802
00:43:42,104 --> 00:43:46,828
know and it makes it just a little bit more fun and personable.

803
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:51,432
The problem for me with Drivatar is there's no loopback, so it's not sort of a closed

804
00:43:51,452 --> 00:43:55,055
game loop of you don't get to see what your Drivatar did when they're out there.

805
00:43:55,075 --> 00:44:02,001
I mean, I'm sure that would be a big challenge, but yeah, there's a great job done there,

806
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:03,702
but there's still so much more that they can do.

807
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:05,563
DriveClub.

808
00:44:06,716 --> 00:44:10,397
Now DriveClub's a really interesting game because with their development, having had

809
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:14,678
all of these ongoing iterations, I'm making big assumptions here, I don't know any of

810
00:44:14,698 --> 00:44:21,079
the DriveClub team, but by seeing how it performed in the wild, they've now got to this point

811
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,360
where they've got this really great system where you've got this great async play because

812
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,741
you join up with a club and then you work together against challenges to get rewards

813
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:32,142
as a club.

814
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:35,736
and you're competing against other clubs, but again, it's always synchronous.

815
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,337
You don't have to be online at the same time,

816
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,940
but you get that shared progression.

817
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:44,485
And then actually just jumping, this is not a console example,

818
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:45,265
but real racing.

819
00:44:45,946 --> 00:44:48,188
I love the fact that they've made a physical ghost system,

820
00:44:48,509 --> 00:44:49,990
so you can take your friend's time,

821
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:53,314
and then you can actually race a real car that's physical

822
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:56,037
that you can bump up into to try and beat it.

823
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:06,860
So then mobile, as I was saying, with console development,

824
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,402
it's really easy to fall into the trap of just sitting there,

825
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,743
playing a game together with your friends

826
00:45:12,783 --> 00:45:14,724
and thinking, right, we've got our connected experience.

827
00:45:16,184 --> 00:45:18,605
Whereas on mobile, so much more of the iteration

828
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:22,127
is done through these quick release cycles.

829
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:25,068
So I think it's naturally a much better fit

830
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:27,589
for making asynchronous play and making

831
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:29,490
asynchronous decisions that really support that.

832
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,991
So async on mobile is a space where I think there's a lot

833
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:35,932
that we can really learn from as console developers

834
00:45:37,212 --> 00:45:40,454
and start thinking about how we get more opportunities

835
00:45:40,514 --> 00:45:43,855
to make social play through connected players that

836
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,076
don't necessarily want to be online at the same time

837
00:45:46,116 --> 00:45:49,057
as others, especially in a competitive space.

838
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:53,379
And then now for us at Criterion,

839
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:54,900
this is a picture of our board game corner.

840
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,040
We're a big fan of board games.

841
00:45:56,781 --> 00:45:59,722
And as I'm sure the table that's upstairs.

842
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:03,456
is quick to point out we're going through a golden age at the moment with

843
00:46:04,276 --> 00:46:06,537
these masters of async social mechanics

844
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:09,619
because these games are all about building trust

845
00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:12,160
and creating deception and then

846
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,921
using peer pressure to

847
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:17,583
and collaboration to make new game mechanics it's really interesting

848
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:18,283
what they're doing there

849
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:19,264
so

850
00:46:20,604 --> 00:46:22,585
there's a lot of these great inspiration points

851
00:46:22,966 --> 00:46:25,187
for how we could build new async mechanics

852
00:46:26,147 --> 00:46:27,588
but again it's something where

853
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:29,269
I don't think

854
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,741
And the examples we should be looking to for building new types of async play come from

855
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:35,081
console because they're just not there yet.

856
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:41,643
So my advice to everyone would be to play as many different things as possible.

857
00:46:42,323 --> 00:46:46,764
For that opportunity of trying to get players to play with their friends while connected

858
00:46:46,844 --> 00:46:51,405
but not playing online together, we should be trying to invent new ways to play.

859
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:55,266
And just be thinking about...

860
00:46:58,278 --> 00:47:02,281
Be inspired and be iterating and trying things in real world conditions

861
00:47:03,502 --> 00:47:05,463
so that you can actually get a sense of async play.

862
00:47:05,483 --> 00:47:08,005
Because async play is different to synchronous play in that

863
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:10,467
you can't playtest it in one session.

864
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:11,588
You can't sit down and be like,

865
00:47:11,648 --> 00:47:12,509
right, we've made this change.

866
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:14,350
Let's have a go and see how it feels.

867
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,852
It's something that emerges between the sessions.

868
00:47:16,912 --> 00:47:20,495
It's something that you only get a sense for once you've

869
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,377
tried it and then tried it a few times

870
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:26,339
and tried it in real world conditions where you're not playing at the same time.

871
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:33,406
So yeah, as I said, that connected gap that's still

872
00:47:33,446 --> 00:47:33,646
there.

873
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:36,887
And I feel like that represents this huge space for innovation.

874
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:41,909
So I'd love it if we started seeing more and more console

875
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,169
games try and take that on and try and make

876
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,030
good asynchronous play for players

877
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,391
to have that social experience, have that online experience.

878
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:54,253
So then just to summarize.

879
00:47:56,084 --> 00:48:01,347
Autolog. So Hot Pursuit was a game about arcade racing, and it was this pure arcade racing game.

880
00:48:02,428 --> 00:48:04,529
And it really focused and intensified that core.

881
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:12,634
We had this sort of very overworked social network, but we pared it back to this idea of beating real friends.

882
00:48:12,814 --> 00:48:14,115
Everything was about that beat it.

883
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:16,596
And that amplified the core racing experience.

884
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:20,959
And the outcome of that was that people added more friends.

885
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,100
They kept adding more friends.

886
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,901
And they were playing with their real friends.

887
00:48:24,428 --> 00:48:27,551
And out of that, they got much more replay value out of the game.

888
00:48:31,254 --> 00:48:36,959
And then fast forwarding to today, we can see from our telemetry that that connected

889
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,820
gap is still there.

890
00:48:39,262 --> 00:48:42,124
So we've got more players online, but they're still not playing synchronously.

891
00:48:42,865 --> 00:48:46,648
So there's this great async play out there, but it's just not there on console yet.

892
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,551
So I invite everyone in this room.

893
00:48:50,314 --> 00:48:53,616
to get social, start trying to invent new asynchronous mechanics.

894
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,858
Because I really believe that this is a big opportunity

895
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,900
and it's primed for breakthroughs.

896
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:04,303
So take what you've learned today, go out into the world and beat it!

897
00:49:05,424 --> 00:49:05,604
Sorry.

898
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:12,636
So that was my talk, but we've got a couple of other talks

899
00:49:13,097 --> 00:49:14,217
from Criterion going on.

900
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:16,559
At the moment, it's actually in a different room.

901
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,641
It's at the same time, which is really annoying, but you

902
00:49:18,681 --> 00:49:22,144
can catch it on the vault, is Pete Lake, who's been talking

903
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:25,727
about rapid idea visualization techniques that we use at

904
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:26,287
Criterion.

905
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:28,930
And also with his talk, you get some juicy behind the

906
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:33,233
scenes in production pictures and videos from Black and

907
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:34,674
from Burnout 3 and Revenge.

908
00:49:35,815 --> 00:49:36,396
But then also.

909
00:49:37,793 --> 00:49:40,635
On Friday at 1.30, we have our wonderful tech director,

910
00:49:40,655 --> 00:49:43,657
Molan, who's talking about how we've changed as a studio,

911
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:47,860
how we are in this new phase of development

912
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,102
where we're building our new game, which

913
00:49:50,122 --> 00:49:52,624
is a really exciting team to be part of.

914
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,687
So that's it for the talk.

915
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:58,428
But does anyone have any questions?

916
00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:00,170
Feel free to come up to the mics.

917
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,481
Did you notice any major differences in behavior between

918
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:19,823
players that play synchronous multiplayer and the players that

919
00:50:19,863 --> 00:50:23,966
engaged with the asynchronous stuff a lot? Like differences

920
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:26,347
in how much they engage with the game or anything like that?

921
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:28,748
Sorry, what was that last bit?

922
00:50:29,149 --> 00:50:31,210
Just differences in how they engage with the game, how much

923
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,050
they play or...

924
00:50:34,592 --> 00:50:37,393
Not so much for Hot Pursuit because with Hot Pursuit the

925
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:46,204
Didn't get as much pickup as we would have wanted to,

926
00:50:46,624 --> 00:50:48,665
but then at the same time, we didn't focus on it as much.

927
00:50:49,086 --> 00:50:52,288
And there was great play and great fun to be had with it,

928
00:50:52,568 --> 00:50:56,951
but it's hard to really have enough data to draw comparisons.

929
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:59,552
And it's not something that I looked into in a lot of depth

930
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:02,174
before this talk, because it was so focused on autolog.

931
00:51:02,214 --> 00:51:05,276
So any data that we might have available,

932
00:51:05,356 --> 00:51:06,637
I don't have fresh in my head, I'm afraid.

933
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,398
That's cool.

934
00:51:07,638 --> 00:51:07,858
Thanks.

935
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:08,779
Thanks.

936
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:22,158
First, thank you for that. Very good talk. I have a few questions. First, did you keep the web

937
00:51:22,178 --> 00:51:30,702
browser on the console after your first two experiments? So the question is, did we keep the

938
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:35,105
web browser on console after our first two experiments? Yeah, I know you changed the way the

939
00:51:35,185 --> 00:51:38,486
user interface was, but did you actually keep the underlying web browser?

940
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,012
So we didn't keep the underlying web browser in the client.

941
00:51:45,293 --> 00:51:49,617
We didn't use it for anything, but we kept a lot

942
00:51:49,637 --> 00:51:50,497
of the same back end.

943
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:53,500
Some of the back end we rewrote because we'd

944
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,022
been writing all of our back end in PHP just for speed,

945
00:51:57,663 --> 00:52:01,185
whereas then that then was harder

946
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,266
to manage for going live.

947
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:04,067
So there were some aspects that we rewrote,

948
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:05,408
but that was the back end.

949
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:06,369
In terms of the front end.

950
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,931
The front end was all custom tech and was just driven by

951
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:12,271
JSON snippets that would come down from the web.

952
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:17,193
And also, yeah, some other bits of binary blobs and things.

953
00:52:17,953 --> 00:52:18,873
Okay.

954
00:52:19,874 --> 00:52:24,895
Did you try any other aspects other than the speed for the

955
00:52:24,935 --> 00:52:26,035
beat it components?

956
00:52:26,075 --> 00:52:27,976
You know, like, I'm going to beat that guy.

957
00:52:28,096 --> 00:52:30,197
In a racing game, of course, the speed makes the most

958
00:52:30,237 --> 00:52:31,777
amount of sense, but did you try anything else?

959
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:36,038
Yeah, so the question was, did we try anything other than

960
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:36,458
time?

961
00:52:37,114 --> 00:52:38,134
for those comparisons.

962
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:43,255
We actually, yeah, underlying, the underneath system

963
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:44,956
can generate those recommendations

964
00:52:45,016 --> 00:52:46,896
based on speed rules that go either way.

965
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:48,857
We played a lot with, we did have events

966
00:52:48,897 --> 00:52:49,677
that were based on points.

967
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:52,397
I think the rapid response, actually maybe it was

968
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:53,958
the interceptor was a points-based game

969
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:58,179
where your time was just one factor that came into it

970
00:52:58,319 --> 00:52:59,699
as to how quickly you took someone down.

971
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:01,859
I think we also had like how many weapons you used

972
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:04,720
and other things so that we could try and shape

973
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,000
the player's play in a particular way.

974
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:10,325
But then ultimately it was just that simplicity that came back of

975
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:13,807
by keeping it just about time, that's a natural thing.

976
00:53:13,827 --> 00:53:15,828
You don't have to explain how those game mechanics work.

977
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:17,208
Everyone just implicitly knows it.

978
00:53:17,709 --> 00:53:22,191
So it became just a much more natural, important thing to be able to talk about.

979
00:53:22,211 --> 00:53:23,752
And it shortcuts a lot of the

980
00:53:24,272 --> 00:53:27,514
the difficulty of trying to explain the competition before you before you said.

981
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:51,115
My last question. So I've worked on a game where we had a similar system and generating a graph between all the players and the relationships and all the processing to generate that. How did you guys handle that? Because 10 million, I mean obviously not 10 million simultaneous players, but I mean you must have had a tremendous server load for that. How did you guys deal with the complexity of that?

982
00:53:54,236 --> 00:53:56,457
So the question was with all of that real time.

983
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,052
Comparison and just churning through all that data.

984
00:54:01,392 --> 00:54:02,673
How did we deal with the back end?

985
00:54:02,894 --> 00:54:03,294
Is that right?

986
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,215
In terms of the technology platform.

987
00:54:07,898 --> 00:54:11,360
With a lot of unexpected live support would be one answer.

988
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,584
So as in, we did stress test

989
00:54:15,624 --> 00:54:17,125
and we stress tested as much as we could.

990
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:19,707
And then also it's amazing.

991
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:23,250
There's, because of, because the amount of investment

992
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,691
that Facebook and Google have done

993
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:26,532
into web backend services,

994
00:54:27,642 --> 00:54:30,423
There's so many great tools for scalability,

995
00:54:30,723 --> 00:54:32,724
and also it's something that lots and lots of different,

996
00:54:33,164 --> 00:54:34,905
there's a lot of people outside of the games industry

997
00:54:34,945 --> 00:54:39,167
that know loads about how to scale up web very efficiently.

998
00:54:39,607 --> 00:54:41,888
And so we leant on that because there's a lot of

999
00:54:42,428 --> 00:54:44,349
great knowledge in how to do that.

1000
00:54:45,229 --> 00:54:47,030
But then we could have done it more effectively

1001
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:47,970
and efficiently than we did,

1002
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,551
because we still actually shipped with

1003
00:54:50,051 --> 00:54:51,352
some of our back-end in PHP,

1004
00:54:52,192 --> 00:54:54,213
which would have been better probably

1005
00:54:54,273 --> 00:54:56,794
if we'd sort of gone and baked that down into

1006
00:54:57,179 --> 00:54:59,079
I'm not sure though.

1007
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:02,521
Actually, I changed over to become a producer

1008
00:55:02,621 --> 00:55:03,881
to avoid questions like that.

1009
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:06,082
All right, thank you very much.

1010
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:06,642
Yeah, thanks.

1011
00:55:07,462 --> 00:55:09,063
Hi, it was a great talk.

1012
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:10,384
Thanks.

1013
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:13,385
Regarding the Autolog version three,

1014
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:17,046
how long did it take you to balance it

1015
00:55:17,386 --> 00:55:20,387
to your satisfaction?

1016
00:55:21,888 --> 00:55:23,449
So how long did Autolog version three

1017
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:24,949
take to balance to our satisfaction?

1018
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:26,230
Good question.

1019
00:55:28,115 --> 00:55:33,376
So it was lots of iterations, and it was quite late

1020
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,077
in the development that it changed the order

1021
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:37,038
to have all the BUs up front.

1022
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:40,399
And then it was even later that we had the prompt

1023
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,879
to really push you through the whole way from the map screen

1024
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,640
back into the game.

1025
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:50,302
And that was part of just the insight

1026
00:55:50,322 --> 00:55:56,144
we had from Matt Webster and Steve Kass, who

1027
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:57,084
are the two guys that really.

1028
00:55:57,538 --> 00:56:01,799
drove Autolog, and they recognized that, and they felt very strongly about it.

1029
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,680
Whereas on the team, we felt like, hey, we've done all this work, you know,

1030
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:08,021
we've done all this work to track the popular events, we've done all this work to

1031
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:13,042
track those recently played events, try and make some intelligence about what

1032
00:56:13,182 --> 00:56:14,542
you've been playing and how you want to play.

1033
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:18,343
But ultimately, all of that just fell away next to this idea that

1034
00:56:19,263 --> 00:56:20,623
someone's beat you, do something about it.

1035
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:21,263
So...

1036
00:56:22,763 --> 00:56:24,965
Yes, so it was this gradual process,

1037
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:28,128
and it was as we shifted that mentality from pre-production

1038
00:56:28,168 --> 00:56:31,430
and discovering what we could do to then actually production

1039
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,312
and shipping, thinking, OK, what's

1040
00:56:34,352 --> 00:56:35,253
the most important thing?

1041
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:36,574
What's the best player experience?

1042
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:40,457
So yeah, initially we had loads of ideas.

1043
00:56:40,517 --> 00:56:42,559
We put a lot of effort into trying

1044
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:43,479
lots of different things out.

1045
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,381
But then as we went through the development,

1046
00:56:45,441 --> 00:56:47,643
it all just got slowly paired back and back and back,

1047
00:56:48,063 --> 00:56:50,365
just to that simplicity of your friends beat you.

1048
00:56:52,233 --> 00:57:01,238
And my second question is regarding, did you employ any automation to test the correctness of this system?

1049
00:57:02,259 --> 00:57:03,120
Sorry, so the question was...

1050
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:09,704
Did you do any automated testing for making sure that the system is working correctly?

1051
00:57:11,365 --> 00:57:15,067
Yeah, so the question being, did we do any automated testing?

1052
00:57:15,687 --> 00:57:18,429
Yes, we did a chunk of automated testing.

1053
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:19,730
We have a...

1054
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:23,933
I team at E.A. that helps with our automated testing.

1055
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:26,074
And so we had to work very closely with them

1056
00:57:26,214 --> 00:57:28,575
because it was something where it was so driven by

1057
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:31,777
how players played the game and how we expected players

1058
00:57:31,817 --> 00:57:33,037
to play the game, so it wasn't that,

1059
00:57:33,777 --> 00:57:35,138
it wasn't straightforward to automate, you know?

1060
00:57:35,178 --> 00:57:36,939
It's not like just saying, this is a game

1061
00:57:36,959 --> 00:57:39,299
where we're gonna have however many players

1062
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:41,120
simultaneously playing on servers,

1063
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:43,921
so we need to stress test those servers.

1064
00:57:43,981 --> 00:57:45,682
It was a lot more complex than that

1065
00:57:45,702 --> 00:57:46,922
because we've gotta sort of imagine,

1066
00:57:47,002 --> 00:57:49,023
well, how are the players gonna be playing the games?

1067
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:49,603
When are they gonna?

1068
00:57:50,024 --> 00:57:52,285
Complete the events and how many friends are they going to have?

1069
00:57:54,526 --> 00:57:56,027
So it was tricky to do the testing,

1070
00:57:56,067 --> 00:57:58,989
but we did have a big automated pipeline to that.

1071
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:02,310
We could write scripts against to test against our infrastructure.

1072
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:07,273
Thank you. Okay. You're welcome. Any other questions?

1073
00:58:09,197 --> 00:58:12,699
Okay, so after this talk I'll be hanging around outside

1074
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:14,880
just in case anyone wants to have a chat about it

1075
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,640
or find out more.

1076
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,401
And I think Pete Lake, who's another producer

1077
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:20,322
who's just finished his talk, he'll be out there as well.

1078
00:58:20,402 --> 00:58:22,203
So if you want to just come hang out

1079
00:58:22,263 --> 00:58:23,924
and talk about any of Criterion's games,

1080
00:58:23,964 --> 00:58:26,225
then we're always very happy as well.

1081
00:58:26,785 --> 00:58:27,785
Okay, thanks very much.
