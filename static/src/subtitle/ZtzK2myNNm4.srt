Hello, I'm Alyssa. I am news editor and associate publisher at Gamasutra.

You're feeling a little sick.

00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:40,468
I learned a lesson about don't fly with a head gold.

10
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:44,671
Oh, yeah. You just came from South Dakota, right?

00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:50,876
Yeah. The hotbed of the game industry, as they call it.

13
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:54,840
We have Dakota State, which is a game design college. So they're great. I graduated from there.

14
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:58,027
Oh, okay. All right. Well, good job

00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:25,107
but we're not going to acknowledge him yet.

21
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:28,228
We're going to put him, we're going to put Brandon in a corner for now.

Uh, we got to mention that registration.

25
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:45,838
It's still open. It's still open. It hasn't closed yet. So if you would like to go, you should go to

27
00:01:53,724 --> 00:02:01,169
else that is cool that happened. The GDC narrative wall is up. Alyssa, what exactly was that again?

28
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:10,013
It was a project they hosted at GDC 2019 where they solicited contributions from developers

29
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:14,218
in attendance and built that into three neat little twine projects that are now up and

30
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:14,638
playable.

31
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:22,294
Yeah, and that can be found at narrativewall.gdconf.com.

32
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:26,955
And lastly, this is freshly baked news,

33
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,516
fresh out of the oven, newly announced game funding and

34
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:37,717
investment summit at GDC 2020, and that'll be a place where you can

35
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:44,319
learn about how to partner with people and, you know, who have money

36
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:45,139
to give you.

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,965
And also people who want to give you money, they can go over there and find out how to be a wiser investor.

38
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:59,551
So if you're interested in, you know, supporting your studio or your project with cash money,

39
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:04,135
which I think that, you know, some people might be, check it out.

40
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:07,177
Game Funding and Investment Summit at GDC 2020.

41
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:13,023
All right, I think, what do you think, Alyssa?

42
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:14,403
Should we just cut to the chase?

43
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:15,824
I think so, yeah.

44
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:21,566
Yeah, I mean, the suspense, I don't think that I can take it

45
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:21,927
anymore.

46
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:27,989
So our next guest, former editor-in-chief of Game

47
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:32,911
Developer Magazine, sibling publication of Gamasutra

48
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:35,412
before its unfortunate demise.

49
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:43,537
Contributor on Gamasutra. Sorry, that was kind of bleak. Game Developer Magazine was, you know,

50
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:53,705
it was the best game development magazine that ever existed. And so, he's also a contributor

51
00:03:53,825 --> 00:04:00,710
on Gamasutra, founder of the indie studio Necrosoft Games, which is responsible for

52
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,993
great games like Gun House and Oh Dear. That's D-E-E-R.

53
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:09,035
It is a racing game where you run over deer.

54
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:10,095
Or not.

55
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,196
You can choose not to.

56
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:12,136
Oh, really?

57
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:12,696
Yeah.

58
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:14,037
I always played running over.

59
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:21,719
He also worked on, uh, the highly successful releases, the, uh, Street

60
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:24,420
Fighter 30th anniversary collection.

61
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,262
SNK 40th anniversary and an upcoming Samurai showdown.

62
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:32,743
What is it like 50th anniversary?

63
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:36,865
You just gotta keep ramping it up.

64
00:04:37,065 --> 00:04:37,946
Yeah, ramping it up.

65
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:42,950
The older the franchise of fighting games, the better for Brandon.

66
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:51,016
A frequent GDC speaker and a really great advocate for students who want to enter the

67
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:54,059
game industry and develop careers in the game industry.

68
00:04:54,899 --> 00:05:00,563
And kind of the main reason he's here now is he was the lead writer on Lab Zero's Indivisible,

69
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:03,104
which came out in October this year.

70
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:05,786
Great game that we'll find out more about.

71
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:07,847
And here we go.

72
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:09,308
Let's welcome Brandon Sheffield.

73
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:09,908
Hey, Brandon.

74
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:10,709
It's me.

75
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,670
Yeah, it is you.

76
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,253
So you are the lead writer on Indivisible, or were.

77
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:19,534
It's out now.

78
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,475
So your work is mostly done, right?

79
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:28,802
Mostly done is what I should say.

80
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,324
Yeah, it's mostly done.

81
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:34,588
Can you tell us, uh, for listeners who, who aren't familiar, what is

82
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:38,252
indivisible and, uh, what exactly did you do on the game?

83
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,345
yeah indivisible is

84
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:40,385
a

85
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,347
it's a platforming

86
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,707
uh... action

87
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:47,848
metroidvania-ish game with

88
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,829
a

89
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:51,730
kind of fighting game inspired

90
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,692
battle system uh... we did kind of make the

91
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:57,352
mistake of calling it

92
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,753
an action rpg and

93
00:05:59,773 --> 00:05:59,814
it

94
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,235
it sort of misses a lot of the core

95
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:04,976
elements of an rpg

96
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:06,476
uh... like

97
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,941
a lot of stats and leveling and equips and stuff.

98
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:16,107
But it does still have that kind of vibe, which is why

99
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:18,490
we said it, but it's more like a

100
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,334
weird Metroidvania action turn-based fighting game.

101
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:26,579
Yeah, that's a lot easier to remember. Yeah, it's much easier to remember that way.

102
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,925
Yeah, and it's got this, I really like, we can talk, I mean, I know you didn't work directly

103
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:38,450
on the battle system, but you know, it, I like how it's just so fast-paced and it does have that kind

104
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,135
of, that immediacy like a fighting game might, which makes sense because Lab Zero worked on

105
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:49,319
Skullgirls, right? That's right, they did Skullgirls before and the battle system was very much

106
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,865
Mike Z's baby, Mike Z being the, I guess, the

107
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:02,725
gameplay lead on Skullgirls, and he's also the creator of the engine that this whole

108
00:07:02,745 --> 00:07:03,666
game is made in.

109
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:09,249
Yeah, I'm terrible at the indivisible battle system, but other people are good at it.

110
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,891
Yeah, well that's good.

111
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:17,655
But it's made by Mike Zedd, as he's known in the rest of the world.

112
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:18,735
Yeah, Mike said.

113
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:19,876
Yeah.

114
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:23,298
So the lead character is Ajna.

115
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,679
Am I pronouncing that correctly?

116
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:25,199
Yeah.

117
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,440
Yeah.

118
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,643
And you did the dialogue, which, you know, also would mean that you did a lot of the

119
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:35,925
character creation and development.

120
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:40,968
And this, Ajna is such a strong character.

121
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:44,770
You can tell like what, that she has had a strong vision behind her.

122
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,555
Can you talk about how you began to lay the foundation for her as a character?

123
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:58,904
It's an interesting one. It's kind of a long, meandering story, and she was less established

124
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:04,209
than you might think. I guess I should... I forgot to mention exactly what I did on the game.

125
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,610
Oh yeah, let's do that.

126
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:16,939
I basically did all the writing that, aside from the backer NPCs, because it was the highest

127
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:23,482
ever game on Indiegogo, and so it had a lot of backers that put their own NPC dialogue

128
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:23,802
in there.

129
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:33,026
So I did basically the dialogue, but the story beats were already established when I came

130
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:33,187
in.

131
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:34,227
There was a big outline.

132
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:40,892
and it was all tied to specific gameplay stuff, so it was an interesting challenge that we can talk about later

133
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:49,899
to have to essentially write around existing story beats to try to get the results that we wanted.

134
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:58,665
And that's kind of, in a way, the story of Ajna's development as well, because she was originally...

135
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:07,090
created by the team, and they had a vision for her.

136
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:12,093
She went through a lot of visual iterations, but by the time I came on,

137
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:20,878
I knew what she looked like. So I had that, and also when I came on,

138
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:24,300
there was an existing script.

139
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,431
which i re-wrote

140
00:09:27,112 --> 00:09:27,872
uh... well actually

141
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:30,034
re-wrote is not exactly the right word

142
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:33,116
put that in there, which i re-wrote

143
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:35,337
i just started over, is what i did

144
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:42,021
and one of the challenges that the team had with Ajna was that

145
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:50,305
Because as she goes along, she has to undergo some things that aren't fantastic,

146
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:56,127
and she has to make some choices that are not great and the player might not make.

147
00:09:56,808 --> 00:10:00,569
So it was really important that she be likable.

148
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:09,893
And that was the big issue before I came on, was that she wasn't a likable character.

149
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:21,565
Yeah, let's talk about that because I read a blog post that you wrote that focused a lot on the importance of making this particular character likable.

150
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:30,694
So what was the difference between the unlikeable version versus the honestly completely likable version that ended up in the final game?

151
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:41,038
I would say what started out as angsty teen, which was a little more of a coming of age kind of thing,

152
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,461
I opted to go toward...

153
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:54,132
a couple things. One is humor, which I have a kind of complicated view of, you know, maybe

154
00:10:54,172 --> 00:11:00,179
it's not complicated, but I have a specific view of. We're going to talk about that. Okay.

155
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,322
And then the other thing was like...

156
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:10,449
So, Meryl Cartwright, who's the creative director and was also the story lead,

157
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:19,376
she was like, Ajna can be dumb, she can be stupid, and that's okay.

158
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:31,762
And so I really took that forward and made her, not stupid, but like, incredibly straightforward.

159
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:39,405
Just like, she sees a goal and she goes toward it regardless of whether she knows what that goal is or how to get there or whatever.

160
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:40,366
She's just like, here we go!

161
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:49,393
And I think that doing that allowed me to have a lot of fun with her without making fun of her.

162
00:11:51,094 --> 00:12:04,866
Because she's just like... she's got that kind of tenacity of character that lets you build a lot of things around her.

163
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:12,935
I guess. Yeah, it's also, uh, she has a certain kindness to her, even if she is,

164
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:18,682
you know, her, her, like, like she, she, she is kind of naive, but she's also

165
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:21,004
optimistic and, and she is kind.

166
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:21,605
Yeah.

167
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,327
There's, there's a, uh.

168
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:28,671
There were kind of a couple of anime that I actually took cues from.

169
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:30,792
One is

170
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,873
Azumanga Daioh, where

171
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:34,074
there's a...

172
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,416
a character called Tomo who

173
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:42,241
is very energetic and always smacking people and

174
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:45,123
there's a particular scene in that

175
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:48,326
anime that

176
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:49,707
was kind of an inspiration for

177
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,589
Ajna. There's a bit where

178
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:56,313
everybody, all the, it's a bunch of schoolgirls and they're going on a

179
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,013
class trip

180
00:12:57,654 --> 00:13:00,616
uh... well not a class trip, they're going on a trip to someone's summer home

181
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:02,017
and uh...

182
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:10,852
Tomo, when they arrive after this long, arduous journey, grabs the keys and throws them into the grass.

183
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:15,819
Because she's like, wouldn't it be funny if someone grabbed the keys and threw them into the grass, and everyone's like,

184
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,942
no! And then she said, yes, it would, and she throws it.

185
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:23,564
And then everybody has to spend the next 30 minutes looking for the keys so that they can get into the house.

186
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:27,146
When they finally get them again, she's like,

187
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,307
wouldn't it be funny if someone did it again?

188
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:38,350
And so that scene was kind of partially an inspiration for Ajna.

189
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:43,332
And another is one called The Promised Neverland.

190
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:46,857
I'm familiar with that.

191
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,401
Alyssa, I was waiting for Alyssa to pop in here.

192
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:53,664
But yeah, go ahead.

193
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,287
I love the premise of Neverland, sorry.

194
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:57,989
No, I do. It's really good, but also...

195
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,349
yet well it's it's not a that no that's the key bits that are inspiring here

196
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:04,290
it's just the

197
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,232
the main female character in that

198
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:08,634
uh...

199
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:10,015
she

200
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:11,757
no matter what

201
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,079
wants to save everybody all the time

202
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,422
She's like, everyone around her is like, let's compromise, we gotta do what makes the most

203
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:26,783
sense to save as many people as possible, and she's like, no, we're saving everyone.

204
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:33,165
Even if it kills me, we're saving everyone. And that's another part that I got,

205
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:37,206
and kind of slotted into Ajna's character.

206
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:37,786
Yeah.

207
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:44,069
So not only is this lead character a young woman, but also

208
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,234
the whole game is inspired by the mythology of Southeast Asia.

209
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:54,538
So, you know, of course, you have to be mindful of, you know,

210
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:57,941
you know, writing for a young woman, but, you know, also for a different,

211
00:14:58,421 --> 00:15:01,544
you know, something inspired by a different culture that you want to make sure

212
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,586
that you still are accurate and respectful towards.

213
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:08,790
How did you go about doing that?

214
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:26,302
Well, a lot of the work was done already in terms of that stuff, because the mythology was set up by a very multicultural team, so there was already a lot of thought and concern put into that.

215
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:34,209
And then, for myself, to make sure that I didn't kind of mess anything up too bad,

216
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:37,451
I did a lot of research.

217
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:45,538
Like, in the early part of the game, you have to find this thing called the Campfaria Galanga,

218
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,180
which is also known as Resurrection Lily.

219
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,701
in order to recruit this character.

220
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:56,524
And so I did a bunch of searching to see what plants

221
00:15:56,884 --> 00:16:03,087
were used in kind of traditional medicine

222
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:06,348
in any of the regions that we were covering

223
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,970
that also vaguely looks like the plant that we had.

224
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,851
And that was the one that I found

225
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:14,892
that pretty much fit all those things.

226
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:17,673
And so anytime there was something where we needed

227
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:18,173
to have a...

228
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:22,753
or an opportunity to have a cultural touch point,

229
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:25,695
I would try to do some research and find something

230
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,917
that would meet that.

231
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:28,898
Yeah.

232
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:30,700
Hey, Alyssa.

233
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:33,262
How's your cold?

234
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:35,424
I'm just spacing out over here a little bit.

235
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:37,325
But no, it's really good conversation.

236
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:39,227
I'm having that interviewer's dilemma

237
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:41,428
where when the person you're talking to

238
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:42,469
is saying really interesting things,

239
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,711
I forget to turn my question brain on.

240
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:46,393
I'm just like, yeah, no, that is really interesting.

241
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:51,960
Yeah, the anime stuff, it sounded like you wanted to say something about that.

242
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,582
Oh no, it's just that Promised Neverland is an emotional journey.

243
00:16:57,363 --> 00:17:01,466
And Emma's fantastic, the character he was talking about, and I could see a lot of that reflected

244
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:04,848
in the very little I've seen of Indivisible. I haven't got to play it yet, I'm so behind on games.

245
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:06,669
That's okay.

246
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:09,110
I've played every single game.

247
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,411
True gamer, Chris Kraft.

248
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:18,556
Promise Neverland is an interesting one for me as a story exercise.

249
00:17:19,176 --> 00:17:26,978
I'm actually trying to... not exactly emulate, but I'm trying to draw from it for the next

250
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:36,320
game that I'm writing too, because it has a great cat and mouse tension between the various

251
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,921
parties that are involved in the mystery that's unfolding.

252
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:50,768
And one really cool thing that I learned from it is that a great way to do mystery in a

253
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:54,790
visual medium like this is to show...

254
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:00,154
You show all these various sides that are competing.

255
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:06,258
You show their individual internal dialogues and their stories within themselves.

256
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:07,299
So like they...

257
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,345
you know, one faction is discussing their plans and then another faction is discussing their plans,

258
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:21,290
so you as a viewer know more than either one of those factions knows, but at the same time,

259
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:26,615
both of those factions are hiding something both from you and from each other.

260
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:26,675
So...

261
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:34,778
you know, as a viewer you have more, you feel like you have more information than everybody

262
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:40,539
in the show does, and that allows you to kind of speculate about what's going to happen

263
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,700
and try to think about how these threads could interweave. But since the characters are also

264
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:53,861
hiding from something from you, there's a lot of potential for mystery and setups of complicated

265
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:54,841
scenarios and things.

266
00:18:56,242 --> 00:18:58,563
I think it's really cool, so I like that anime.

267
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:03,246
Yeah, and Indivisible, you know, if people haven't played it,

268
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,948
like, there is, I mean, all of these things,

269
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,389
there's so many things that are internalized inside of Vajna.

270
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:10,291
The whole, like, the premise of the game is that

271
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:12,432
she recruits people and they live in her brain, right?

272
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:13,192
Yeah.

273
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,893
Yeah.

274
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,375
That's, yeah, I guess I just wanted to clarify.

275
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,723
Yeah, she absorbs everybody that she meets into her brain.

276
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:30,999
And a lot of the dumb jokes that I make in it are like...

277
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:37,562
I don't really like direct fourth wall breaking, because I think that's kind of weird and silly,

278
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:43,065
but I like having the characters be aware of how ridiculous the situation is within

279
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:45,846
the framing of their universe.

280
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:54,751
So having one particular character, Razmi, often commenting on how Ajna is just essentially

281
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:56,111
abducting people into her brain.

282
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:04,618
felt appropriate to me because I would think that it was weird, so surely somebody else would as well.

283
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,443
Yeah, and that avoids the winking into the camera type thing.

284
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:10,483
Yeah, which you don't want.

285
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:13,206
What's your process for writing humorous dialogue?

286
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:16,549
Because it's so easy to write a line and be like, oh, this is the funniest thing in the world,

287
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:17,670
and then it just falls flat.

288
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:22,654
So how do you go from idea, inception, to actually what ends up in the game?

289
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:26,037
uh...

290
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:26,097
so

291
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,617
what i tend to do is

292
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:30,338
look at what i've got

293
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:32,278
uh... be it

294
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:35,579
images of characters or

295
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:36,619
various

296
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:38,459
scenarios that have to happen

297
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:39,359
and then

298
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:43,960
i'd just start writing something and see if something interesting happens

299
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:45,781
it's

300
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:48,221
my kind of

301
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:50,742
i had a background in writing

302
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:54,279
kind of uh... web comics for a while

303
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,901
and that actually really helped me find my

304
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:00,003
comedic voice, I guess

305
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:01,964
and how to write

306
00:21:02,484 --> 00:21:04,285
dialogue between characters that

307
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:05,185
sounded like

308
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,946
humans were involved with it

309
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:08,567
and

310
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:11,729
so it's kind of a similar process where I'll

311
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:18,193
I'll start from an image or an idea and then build it out from there.

312
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:24,296
And sometimes, you know, I wind up writing myself into a corner and the whole thing is

313
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:29,419
just terrible and I hate it, and so then I'll scrap it and rewrite it from scratch.

314
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,283
But you know, once you've got a few decent jokes in there, you can...

315
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:41,627
recycle them with restraint as the game moves along.

316
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:43,408
And that's really...

317
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:46,931
That actually, like, people love callbacks and stuff,

318
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:51,274
so for the people that pay attention, that's really handy.

319
00:21:51,914 --> 00:21:53,436
But you can also sometimes...

320
00:21:54,316 --> 00:22:04,779
Some of the blocks of text that I will scrap are ones where I'm recycling too much and I wind up feeling like I'm trying to make everything a joke.

321
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:09,180
And those wind up being just terrible.

322
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,341
That's my life, I try to make everything a joke.

323
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:19,844
I just did it now. So, like, I think we really established that you and I have known each

324
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:26,507
other for a pretty long time. Yeah. We're good friends. So I'm playing, oh, by the way,

325
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:31,649
this is total, what is it, collusion and, you know, yeah, it's happening right now.

326
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,671
Be aware, everybody.

327
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:41,637
No, but I'm playing Indivisible and within the first, you know, five minutes of gameplay

328
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:50,145
and I'm encountering NPCs, the dialogue, I mean, they read like text from you as far

329
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:52,608
as like the personality, you know, is there.

330
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,931
I mean, I'm pretty sure that if I was playing Indivisible...

331
00:22:56,612 --> 00:23:00,657
I'd be able to be like, wait, and I didn't know, you know, that you were working on the

332
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:00,837
game.

333
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:02,218
I'd be like, wait, did Brandon?

334
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:03,260
Yeah.

335
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:04,822
Yeah.

336
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:05,542
Yeah.

337
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:07,184
Well, yeah, go ahead.

338
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:11,409
My, uh, I did a, a short talk at GDC.

339
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:16,279
like i don't know how many years ago eight years ago or something like that

340
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,241
uh... which was

341
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:21,284
about how you should make games for yourself

342
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:23,226
because

343
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:28,171
i think i believe that if you make something that really resonates with you

344
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:28,272
then

345
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:34,895
and showing a perspective, then people will actually like that much more

346
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:42,138
and find it more interesting and more engaging than if you do something that's generic and for everybody.

347
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:54,723
So, you know, obviously this game is made by a lot of people, and all the gorgeous art and music and everything is by a whole group of folks,

348
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:56,504
but the writing was something that...

349
00:23:57,905 --> 00:24:06,429
was kind of my part that I got to own, and so I was able to just be like,

350
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:16,374
this is my joke. This is my style of joke that has been in my brain for some time,

351
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:23,198
and so now, here, you may have it. And so it really was kind of like I was writing.

352
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:32,418
jokes to my friends. And I think the important part of that is, say I'm making a dumb joke to

353
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:38,983
you or any other person that I've known for a long time, I assume that you will get it. I don't feel

354
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:47,269
like I need to explain it to you or whatever. And I think that having a trust in the audience

355
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:51,452
to get your joke is a big part of it.

356
00:24:51,972 --> 00:24:57,416
Yeah, yeah, it's almost like you know we're referring to these as jokes, but they're not things

357
00:24:57,736 --> 00:25:01,018
You know they're not like jokes there. It's just humorous

358
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:06,502
So for example really early on in the game you run into a guy with a bunch of sticks

359
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:11,385
And then he's just like I like to carry a bunch of sticks. I like to build stuff with it

360
00:25:11,565 --> 00:25:16,729
I like to sit on fire, and I like to slap people with them and something like that. That's not the exact

361
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:19,210
I'm not looking at the game right now. It's not a direct quote but

362
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:22,553
It's just kind of, there's that kind of like,

363
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:25,676
oh, that's like, you know, that's silly, you know,

364
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:29,339
type thing and it's just, and that kind of humor

365
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,802
plays out through, you know, so much of the game

366
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:36,906
that it really, it makes it feel like wilty.

367
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:38,587
You know, there's still some heavy things

368
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:39,508
that happen in the game.

369
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:43,432
But there are these, like really,

370
00:25:44,713 --> 00:25:51,698
micro scenario instances where you get to meet one of the very many NPCs in this game and

371
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:57,102
You just you know their personality right away

372
00:25:57,883 --> 00:25:58,143
which

373
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:04,988
let's let's talk about that because this there's a whole lot of characters in this game and

374
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:13,094
How do you write for all those keep track of them give them their own unique personalities

375
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:16,412
well i can't say that it did the greatest job of that

376
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:17,193
uh...

377
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:18,035
but

378
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:20,278
i did sort of track

379
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,704
the with with like that

380
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:24,745
sticks guy

381
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:25,567
i think

382
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:26,228
the

383
00:26:26,248 --> 00:26:26,428
like this

384
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:30,272
one one way to

385
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,894
get people on board with your character is to just

386
00:26:34,815 --> 00:26:35,155
kind of

387
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:40,718
have their first sentence almost describe who they are completely and

388
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:43,939
and that guy that guy the first thing he says when you

389
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,320
click on him is

390
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,121
ah yes, bale of sticks

391
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:53,126
uh... and uh... and of course the reason that came about is

392
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:54,888
they just showed to me

393
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,630
and pcs

394
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,052
that i needed to write for

395
00:26:58,072 --> 00:26:59,374
and i was like

396
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:03,158
was guys carrying sticks when he looked with the loves it with that this whole

397
00:27:03,198 --> 00:27:03,458
deal

398
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,501
and

399
00:27:06,382 --> 00:27:07,643
you know it makes it all out

400
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:22,034
How much of that, how much, sorry to interrupt, but how much of that is just you as somebody who's on deadline writing on a project just like, I can't think of anything else. He's got sticks. Let's do something with sticks.

401
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:32,702
Well, yeah, I mean, there's, there's definitely some of that. There's a, there's a character in one of the other, other regions, Connell, that has,

402
00:27:34,474 --> 00:27:38,658
they they sent me this character and he's looking down into this white bowl

403
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:42,061
and i was like it just looks like he's staring at milk

404
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:46,945
and so i made him a uh... a milk fortune teller who reads the milk to tell you

405
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:47,185
what

406
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:49,527
is gonna happen and it's just like

407
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:51,048
so stupid

408
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,289
but it is

409
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,191
the very first thing that i thought of

410
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:55,372
i like that though

411
00:27:56,072 --> 00:28:03,595
Yeah, and I find that when I'm under pressure and I have to think of the absolute

412
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:11,439
simplest or first thing that I think of and do it, a lot of my better work comes from that.

413
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:16,761
Just like a gut reaction, gotta do something, uh, this.

414
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:19,101
and then it'd be funny if it was actual.

415
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:19,902
Alyssa, you probably can't...

416
00:28:19,922 --> 00:28:21,822
I've never done that in my entire life.

417
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:23,923
Yeah, it's like...

418
00:28:24,443 --> 00:28:28,284
That's just how writers and reporters and, you know,

419
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:30,485
just in general operate, I feel like.

420
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:31,485
Yeah, we love pressure.

421
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:34,666
I mean, we must.

422
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,447
So, in terms of writing all these various characters...

423
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:49,983
It was tough because there are something like, I should really know the real answer, but there's something like 34 voiced characters in this video game.

424
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:51,605
We'll fact check that, yeah.

425
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:53,468
And you don't have...

426
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:58,547
this is only a minor spoiler, but you don't have access to all of them all the time.

427
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:06,949
And so, that made it a real challenge because there's a lot of...

428
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:14,832
Up until the very end, we were still deciding with some characters, like, when you could even get them.

429
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:16,153
and so

430
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:17,574
they couldn't

431
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,316
be part of the main scenario so I had to

432
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:25,080
essentially pare the main scenario down to only the characters I knew you could

433
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,320
get

434
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:26,761
and

435
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:28,563
even then

436
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,584
there's still like eight of them

437
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,085
which is too many to put

438
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:33,246
into

439
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:37,470
any one conversation so I had to limit conversations

440
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,633
to four at the absolute max, three would be a better number

441
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:44,015
and obviously two is much easier but

442
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:47,636
since we had so many characters I had to keep inserting them

443
00:29:48,577 --> 00:29:51,577
into conversations so you'd remember that they existed or

444
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,918
so that they could have some sort of an arc and all that kind of stuff

445
00:29:55,719 --> 00:30:02,140
and we wound up having to relegate some of the side characters. Their

446
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:05,021
whole arc only takes place during their recruit

447
00:30:05,461 --> 00:30:10,923
and loyalty quests that they have because there just wasn't a lot of space

448
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:14,044
to put them otherwise which

449
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:15,704
I would imagine.

450
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:16,725
Is regrettable.

451
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:21,409
I'd say working with a voice acting deadline, too, it just added a whole bunch more pressure

452
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:23,911
on top of what's already a very time-sensitive process.

453
00:30:25,012 --> 00:30:25,332
Oh yes.

454
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:31,277
Because of voice acting, I actually had to be, creative-wise, I had to be finished first.

455
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,520
Because we had to...

456
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:38,093
you know, record everything

457
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:43,716
and implement it in the game and all of that takes a lot of time and so

458
00:30:43,736 --> 00:30:45,237
I had to...

459
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:49,739
maybe I wasn't the very first but I had to finish up

460
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:52,900
uh... while other folks were still

461
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:54,681
working away on

462
00:30:55,862 --> 00:30:57,343
designing stuff and

463
00:30:58,463 --> 00:31:00,825
implementing cut scenes and all that sort of thing so...

464
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:06,207
it made me really nervous because there's no going back from voice acting.

465
00:31:06,747 --> 00:31:11,429
There's no return point because unless you can get people back in the studio,

466
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:18,673
which is expensive and thus not going to happen, you're stuck with the dialogue that you've got.

467
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:23,075
And so if anything changes, then you have to find creative ways to work around that.

468
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:26,916
Yeah, that sounds scary.

469
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:32,317
Yeah, it's a little spooky.

470
00:31:32,577 --> 00:31:37,598
Earlier you mentioned you were basically handed, you know,

471
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:38,658
all the story beats.

472
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:42,298
And on top of that, also we didn't mention,

473
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:44,299
like this is an Indiegogo funded game.

474
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,359
It's a $2 million Indiegogo funded game.

475
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:48,519
So it was big.

476
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,680
So a lot of the backers on there, what did they offer?

477
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,761
It was like their own.

478
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:58,402
dialogue or...

479
00:31:58,522 --> 00:32:02,005
They had their own dialogue and their own character.

480
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:09,892
The rule that I made, because I actually didn't edit the NPC dialogue for the backer characters

481
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:17,058
— someone else did that — but the rule that I set was that backers could not write

482
00:32:17,078 --> 00:32:17,258
dialogue.

483
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:20,685
the main characters or any of the

484
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:25,908
any of the core characters, any of the playable characters or even our NPCs.

485
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:28,689
They had to, they could only do monologues for themselves.

486
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,551
Yeah, and then

487
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,333
somebody added those all together and had to deal with all that stuff and

488
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:38,834
then they just got put

489
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,216
all over the place and so if you want to see a

490
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:43,537
chubby merman or a

491
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:46,878
furry cat girl or whatever, they're in there.

492
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:54,124
And as far as the story beats go, what was that like where it's like, okay, this is what's

493
00:32:54,464 --> 00:33:00,510
going to happen. Now you finish it up. Yeah, it was interesting because

494
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:10,180
there were definitely things that I would have liked to change but was unable to. And it's

495
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,442
been interesting to see the results of those.

496
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,522
changes, or not the changes, the results, how people react to those scenes.

497
00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:21,985
Like, for example, we had a huge...

498
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:26,709
huge is the wrong word, long is the correct word... long argument about...

499
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:31,433
this is not really a spoiler either because it happens in the first ten, fifteen

500
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:31,954
minutes, but...

501
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:37,597
there's a character called Dar who kills Ajna's father

502
00:33:37,617 --> 00:33:43,921
and he winds up being the first person that you recruit into your brain

503
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:49,103
and i was against that i was like can we at least have him

504
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:52,785
not be the direct killer of the father maybe it's

505
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:54,806
it's under his orders or

506
00:33:56,714 --> 00:34:05,396
something like that, but not have him be the one who actively killed him because it makes

507
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:10,177
it so difficult for him and Ajna to be together in the same space.

508
00:34:11,737 --> 00:34:17,358
Everyone was very adamant that he should, in fact, do this.

509
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:19,079
You wind up with this tension of...

510
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:26,232
Ajna carrying around her father's killer in her brain and being her only

511
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:29,334
companion for the first portion of the game.

512
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:38,438
And so, everyone thought that it was important for later events for that to be true.

513
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:43,501
And so I tried to write around it as best I could.

514
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:48,023
And so, reading reactions to that part have been very interesting because some people

515
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:49,043
are like...

516
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:53,926
Ajna took no time to grieve, this makes no sense, and they didn't like it.

517
00:34:54,286 --> 00:35:00,450
And then other people are like, this throws the traditional RPG narrative on its head

518
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:10,917
and is a good example of how this story seems like it's going to go down one lane of tropes

519
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:12,198
but in fact goes another way.

520
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:18,544
So, it's been interesting to read that both of us were kind of correct.

521
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:24,791
Yeah, I mean, how does that make you... I mean, it doesn't like...

522
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:28,815
What were your thoughts when you're reading all these?

523
00:35:29,456 --> 00:35:30,257
Oh, reading the comments?

524
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:30,997
Yeah, the comments.

525
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:37,081
I would say that the majority of people's complaints, I was like, yeah, I get that.

526
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:44,405
There were only a few where I was like, that's not quite right. But

527
00:35:47,407 --> 00:35:51,890
I think the ones where I didn't agree totally were the ones where they were...

528
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:54,425
where they didn't

529
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:56,408
decouple writing and story,

530
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,255
which I wouldn't really expect people to, but a lot of people actually did.

531
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:00,896
They were like,

532
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:01,517
I love

533
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:03,120
the characters,

534
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,946
but I don't love this aspect of the story, or something like that.

535
00:36:09,474 --> 00:36:16,583
But ultimately, I was really happy with the results because most people did love the whole

536
00:36:16,603 --> 00:36:20,908
story it seems and we made a bunch of people cry, which is good.

537
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,129
It's always good.

538
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:23,150
That's what you want.

539
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,011
That's proof now.

540
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,253
You know, this is the answer.

541
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,374
Can video games make you cry?

542
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:26,895
And here we are.

543
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,844
yep we did it

544
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:29,805
and

545
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,227
it's it's definitely nice to

546
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:34,008
read that

547
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:34,788
the game

548
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,210
made people laugh a lot

549
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,191
and then also made them cry

550
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:44,094
and they got to feel several ranges of emotion going on

551
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,936
in the one game so overall i'm pretty

552
00:36:47,697 --> 00:36:49,258
pretty happy with reading

553
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:56,263
the reviews. I didn't really like hearing Zero Punctuation's review, that one was

554
00:36:56,323 --> 00:37:16,378
kind of not so cool, but otherwise... I somehow missed it. Yeah, good. He's very snarky about a lot of things that are, like, fair enough, but kind of out of any one individual person's control and thus difficult to...

555
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:21,341
feel like this is those comments should be as bad as they were

556
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:25,265
on that note uh... how does like reading reviews for something you put your heart

557
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:26,866
and soul in your time and just to be like

558
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:32,091
horrifying i would be my personal word for it but uh... there's some value

559
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:35,214
like how you're explaining it and reading what other people have to think

560
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:36,975
in my criticism of the thing that you made

561
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:38,456
how do you kind of like

562
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:42,620
go about getting the useful information from reviews are kind of knowing when to

563
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,603
be like no i can't let this get to me that that takes completely wrong

564
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:58,293
Yeah, I think I've found that somehow, perhaps due to a long time of being a journalist and

565
00:37:58,313 --> 00:38:06,358
just being very online and such, I seem to have a slightly thicker skin when it comes

566
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,119
to reading these kinds of things.

567
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:13,972
if i feel like i did a pretty good job

568
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:16,614
that's that's my defense

569
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:19,657
against everything else

570
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:22,319
and there'll be people that say that they hate it

571
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:23,099
and

572
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,902
you know that won't stop me reading the review or the

573
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:29,664
commentary because i'll be curious to see

574
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:31,646
what they have to say about

575
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:35,789
like if they say they hate the writing i'll keep reading the rest to see if they

576
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,151
really liked something else and

577
00:38:39,472 --> 00:38:40,793
you know, I'll often find that someone

578
00:38:42,014 --> 00:38:43,235
didn't like the writing but they

579
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:46,977
were kept playing through the game because they liked the battle system, or

580
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:52,241
they compared the platforming to Celeste, or they thought that the game was too pretty to

581
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,802
stop playing, or something like that.

582
00:38:54,243 --> 00:38:55,884
And then I can share that back with...

583
00:38:57,225 --> 00:38:58,246
the team and

584
00:38:58,266 --> 00:39:07,055
have them, I don't know, feel a little nice about it. So that's valuable in itself.

585
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:08,936
Another thing is

586
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:13,221
it's worth sifting through a lot of

587
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:17,064
these just general comments because, for example,

588
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:26,872
I found someone on the internet, on Twitter, who was making fanart of Ajna and Torani,

589
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:31,236
who's kind of like her mentor character that shows up later.

590
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:37,300
And Torani is... she's sort of modeled after a Thai deity.

591
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:48,445
So I found a word that an older Thai woman could give affectionately to a younger Thai woman,

592
00:39:49,225 --> 00:39:54,587
and found this word, Luk Sao, which is basically like, my child.

593
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,890
And this person that I found on Twitter that was doing this fan art...

594
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:09,116
was a Thai person and was really focusing on the use of that word and writing it in Thai along with

595
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:15,381
the images that they were drawing, and it was great because it felt like

596
00:40:17,202 --> 00:40:24,548
that person... I mean, I wonder how many times that person had gotten to see a Thai term of

597
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:28,431
endearment in an English-language video game before, and they were...

598
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:32,672
also validating for me

599
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:36,033
that the term was used correctly because I'm always nervous when I

600
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:37,573
look up something from

601
00:40:37,593 --> 00:40:40,894
any culture that's not my own and then try to put it

602
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:42,015
into

603
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:45,175
a video game in correct context and so

604
00:40:45,936 --> 00:40:48,416
you know it was worth sifting through tons of

605
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:53,437
good, bad, mediocre tweets to find something like that where it's like

606
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,138
this totally resonated with somebody and that's fantastic.

607
00:40:57,567 --> 00:40:59,248
Yeah, you get that connection.

608
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,850
And it's good that the word didn't end up being like jerk face or something.

609
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,290
Yeah.

610
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,353
I mean, I, I got it from, uh, from Thai friends, so I had a reasonable amount

611
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:11,194
of confidence that it was fine, but yeah, you never know.

612
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:14,056
And of course, like there's like, there is the underlying.

613
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:21,383
you know, a concept here of all the benefits of having an inclusive team when you're when you're

614
00:41:21,403 --> 00:41:26,788
writing a story, not just like this, but you know, any kind of story, just get more interesting

615
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:34,756
characters and like more viewpoints on, on, you know, different ways that people, you know, live.

616
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:46,124
Yeah, and I was a little... I had some trepidation around being a Caucasian dude who's writing the

617
00:41:46,164 --> 00:41:53,393
story. I mean, writing all the dialogue, you know, for this very diverse cast, but...

618
00:41:54,818 --> 00:41:56,560
you know I realized that having

619
00:41:57,922 --> 00:41:58,702
a diverse team

620
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,507
behind you, all of, I mean not behind me, but um...

621
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:03,308
with me

622
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:03,368
uh...

623
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:05,550
Good save.

624
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:10,316
Mike Z thinks I'm too arrogant, so...

625
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,441
Anyway.

626
00:42:16,082 --> 00:42:26,929
Having this group of people that not only were responsible for crafting the story and the characters visually and story beat-wise in the first place,

627
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:43,840
but having them look at everything I wrote and veto stuff if it seems like it's wrong or just add a bit of themselves if they can or need to or want to somewhere,

628
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:51,706
I didn't do as much of adding of themselves as I could have because of time pressure, but there was some of that.

629
00:42:52,646 --> 00:43:05,335
And that all just kind of made it so much easier to make a game that has a lot of inclusivity, a lot of different kinds of people,

630
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:09,338
without making it a big deal or a big point.

631
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:13,381
I read an article that someone wrote recently about...

632
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:22,007
how they were happy that all these characters were hanging out together and allowed to just be there.

633
00:43:22,207 --> 00:43:24,028
They didn't have to be like,

634
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,850
you're this race and I'm this race.

635
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,871
We gotta figure out how to work together.

636
00:43:31,053 --> 00:43:32,514
Everybody was just like,

637
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:36,156
hey, it's a new friend, or I don't like that person.

638
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:37,917
And it didn't...

639
00:43:38,718 --> 00:43:44,721
that didn't follow down any particular lines and it's unfortunate that that's

640
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:51,344
rare but I guess it is rare and I'm happy we were able to get somewhere with that.

641
00:43:51,404 --> 00:43:56,206
Yeah I mean to be fair when you and I first met we were like you're white, I'm half Filipino.

642
00:43:57,066 --> 00:44:01,128
Right.

643
00:44:01,248 --> 00:44:02,009
That's how it went down.

644
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:03,710
My personal reaction already failed that test, I'm sorry.

645
00:44:06,638 --> 00:44:08,879
Yeah, so, well, we need to wrap up here.

646
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,460
Brandon was only supposed to be on for five minutes,

647
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:13,941
but this got really interesting.

648
00:44:16,183 --> 00:44:18,544
One thing, as I mentioned earlier,

649
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:24,387
you really do a lot to give young people the information

650
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:25,087
that they need to.

651
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:33,313
uh, you know, get into the game industry or navigate through the game industry.

652
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:38,977
Um, you do that, you know, through, uh, projects at, at GDC and, and just in

653
00:44:39,017 --> 00:44:47,824
general, uh, but, uh, for, for writers who are trying to, uh, get into the industry.

654
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:53,789
Uh, you know, what's, what's Brandon Sheffield's, uh, tip for that.

655
00:44:54,607 --> 00:45:01,775
Yeah, so I actually recently did a little talk at a group called Gameheads in Oakland,

656
00:45:02,455 --> 00:45:09,963
which is all about kind of youth of color breaking into the game industry and stuff.

657
00:45:12,906 --> 00:45:16,348
I mean, number one tip is, of course, do writing.

658
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:17,769
Do a bunch of writing.

659
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,991
And get critiques.

660
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,693
And try to do better.

661
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:25,815
And realize that you can always do better.

662
00:45:28,106 --> 00:45:35,553
And, like, this isn't exactly game-specific either, but I also think it's super important

663
00:45:35,634 --> 00:45:41,599
for people to figure out what their own taste is and write things based on that.

664
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,183
I remember in high school I got, um...

665
00:45:46,564 --> 00:45:48,344
invited some

666
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,665
writer's forum or something like that

667
00:45:51,185 --> 00:45:54,846
and i decided this was going to be a good time to challenge myself and

668
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:55,186
write

669
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:58,967
like a sci-fi story that was out of my comfort zone

670
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:01,187
and uh... it totally

671
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:03,207
fell flat

672
00:46:03,748 --> 00:46:06,228
what i learned from that experience was

673
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:09,009
not that i shouldn't have

674
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:13,770
written a sci-fi story or something but that i shouldn't have tried to

675
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:21,885
right so far beyond my feelings and my experience and whenever you can.

676
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:27,591
Not that people shouldn't branch out, because they obviously should, but if you are going

677
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:32,013
to branch out, you need to ground it in stuff that you know super well first.

678
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:40,616
So you can take the germ of something mundane and very familiar to you, and which might

679
00:46:40,656 --> 00:46:46,239
be familiar to other people, like the particular ritual that you have for getting cereal in

680
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:47,319
the morning or something like that.

681
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:53,661
and then we pan out from this serial thing to we're in a hellscape or whatever.

682
00:46:53,681 --> 00:47:04,504
It just helps to ground the experience and helps people to identify with it.

683
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:08,745
And I find that that's a mistake that a lot of young writers make,

684
00:47:08,885 --> 00:47:14,207
is they try to go straight for the fantasy bit without doing the,

685
00:47:14,307 --> 00:47:14,847
here's how this.

686
00:47:16,227 --> 00:47:21,109
relates to my life and this is why it came from me as a person rather than anyone else.

687
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:29,352
Then in terms of game stuff, people should make Twine games, I think. That's good,

688
00:47:29,372 --> 00:47:34,053
because Twine's free and it's really easy to use and you can make

689
00:47:34,674 --> 00:47:38,975
visual novels with choices and things. Another tip that I have is...

690
00:47:41,227 --> 00:47:48,630
If you write dialogue, try to read it out loud and see if it sounds extra stupid, because

691
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,131
that happens to me a lot.

692
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,032
I'll write something and I'll be like, is this fine?

693
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:57,334
And then I'll try to read it out loud or read it in my head and I'll be like, yeah, this

694
00:47:57,394 --> 00:48:00,455
is not something a human being would say.

695
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:03,516
How loudly do you recommend reading it out loud?

696
00:48:03,977 --> 00:48:06,858
Just the top of your lungs is probably...

697
00:48:06,878 --> 00:48:08,138
Okay, good, I'm doing it right.

698
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:15,705
yeah just uh... get on public transit and uh... just just scream it out

699
00:48:16,145 --> 00:48:16,925
but yeah also

700
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:18,225
just write

701
00:48:18,805 --> 00:48:20,186
write for any game

702
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:21,426
that you can

703
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:24,026
my first video game that i

704
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:26,367
did any writing for was

705
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:31,428
oddly enough a capcom collection with digital eclipse back in two thousand five

706
00:48:31,448 --> 00:48:34,509
uh... in digital eclipse's first iteration

707
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:39,612
And I was just writing some dumb quiz questions for a...

708
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:48,718
They had like a... there's this Capcom game called Quiz and Dragons, which had a bunch of quiz questions in it that were about Capcom.

709
00:48:49,038 --> 00:48:53,181
And they wanted to re... renew those, and so I wrote some new Capcom trivia.

710
00:48:54,922 --> 00:49:02,767
And, you know, that of course didn't do very much for me career-wise, because I was definitely

711
00:49:02,828 --> 00:49:08,011
a footnote in that video game, and very little of it had to do with me.

712
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:11,893
But when I next then went to someone...

713
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:16,431
who needed a writer, I knew they needed a writer,

714
00:49:17,272 --> 00:49:22,037
I was like, hire me because I can write things

715
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:26,763
and also I have one game credit and then you can see it.

716
00:49:28,525 --> 00:49:30,207
And so having just-

717
00:49:30,227 --> 00:49:32,449
For a little company called Capcom.

718
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,611
That's right.

719
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:38,734
So having any game credit can really help.

720
00:49:39,154 --> 00:49:45,738
It is fun that, you know, now, I guess I've been doing writing in games for...

721
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:54,924
almost 15 years now and I can finally claim to have a million seller and that's Street Fighter

722
00:49:54,944 --> 00:50:00,889
30th anniversary and it is like there's absolutely no way that that sold a million copies because of

723
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:06,754
me but I can still put it on my resume. You don't have to tell people that though. And that's what matters.

724
00:50:07,975 --> 00:50:17,017
Yeah, oh that's so good. So we'll wrap it up here then. Indivisible, Lab Zero, it's Brandon Sheffield,

725
00:50:17,137 --> 00:50:21,819
lead writer on the game. Highly recommend it, not just because he's my friend,

726
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:31,542
but it really is good. It does convey so many emotions. The battle system is so much fun

727
00:50:32,222 --> 00:50:35,643
and check it out and thanks a lot for joining us, Brandon.

728
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:36,501
Thank you.

729
00:50:36,521 --> 00:50:37,622
It was enjoyable.

730
00:50:37,642 --> 00:50:40,445
That's what we came for.

731
00:50:40,485 --> 00:50:41,626
What a weird way to say that.

732
00:50:42,186 --> 00:50:43,387
What do human beings say that?

733
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:45,309
I didn't think they would.

734
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,820
Alright, we're back for a little bit.

735
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,803
This is where we reflect on our guests.

736
00:51:07,885 --> 00:51:08,745
Reflect about them.

737
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,367
Talk about them behind their back.

738
00:51:10,888 --> 00:51:13,350
Yeah, this is where, yeah, Brandon's gone now.

739
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:16,091
Yeah, this is where we talk crap.

740
00:51:16,852 --> 00:51:22,754
So, uh, I got some juicy information on Brandon Sheffield, now that he's gone.

741
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:29,156
The man has 20 game consoles connected to his television set.

742
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:31,696
I'm trying to imagine, like, all at once? Like, that's...

743
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:33,637
Yeah, it's all at once.

744
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:35,147
I don't know.

745
00:51:35,227 --> 00:51:38,427
I'm like staring at my TV in the background right now and just like, you can see the

746
00:51:38,487 --> 00:51:42,068
cords hanging from behind the shelves and just this nightmare that if like a cat got

747
00:51:42,108 --> 00:51:43,548
back there, they'd be stuck forever.

748
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:45,668
Like I can't imagine.

749
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:47,089
Yeah.

750
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:51,969
I'm looking, I'm looking at my, uh, entertainment system that has one

751
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:56,890
PlayStation 4 connected to it and one Apple TV and it just looks like a rat's nest.

752
00:51:58,751 --> 00:52:02,591
So he, he must have some kind of system that makes that possible.

753
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:04,392
On the podcast, just to talk about cord management.

754
00:52:05,517 --> 00:52:08,379
Yeah, yeah, we'll get him back on for that for the GDC podcast.

755
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,543
We need to have... GDC should have a Chord Management Summit.

756
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:16,847
I think that that would be well attended. No, but Brandon, we didn't even get to

757
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:23,974
talk about it. He's a multifaceted person, but he collects games and

758
00:52:23,994 --> 00:52:28,698
he collects old hardware and things like that.

759
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,521
So it's there.

760
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:34,426
Yeah, he knows that stuff.

761
00:52:34,546 --> 00:52:37,791
That is an area of interest and expertise.

762
00:52:38,592 --> 00:52:39,774
And intrigue.

763
00:52:40,836 --> 00:52:41,136
Yeah.

764
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:43,780
Well, what did you think about the conversation we had with Brandon?

765
00:52:44,321 --> 00:52:46,904
Like I said, I kept kind of like it's mostly the cold brain

766
00:52:46,924 --> 00:52:50,549
But I kept kind of like just zoning out and listening like I was just listening to a very good podcast

767
00:52:50,569 --> 00:52:54,454
Conversation and forgetting to contribute but it's a really good

768
00:52:55,635 --> 00:53:00,582
This wasn't just a live stream like for yeah, I know I just come in to these are my own exclusive little interviews

769
00:53:00,602 --> 00:53:02,304
I can listen to and not contribute to but

770
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:07,366
I always like when we end up either on here the couple times I've been on the GDC

771
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:08,546
Twitch channel

772
00:53:08,566 --> 00:53:12,488
And we're talking to like writers and stuff like that because I try to poke in I'm like, okay

773
00:53:12,508 --> 00:53:14,868
But how do you how do you write good? How do you make words? Great?

774
00:53:15,629 --> 00:53:15,769
and

775
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:17,489
Every time it's just like oh, yeah

776
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:20,010
I'm, just I just do and it just kind of works out like that

777
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,390
but

778
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:24,871
The that was kind of the case here too where I tried to like dig in like how does how does humor work?

779
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:29,753
How do you make jokes funny and just he explained his process but like the thing that's not being said there is

780
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,073
These are people with

781
00:53:32,114 --> 00:53:37,415
20, 15 years in like experience and that it's just like a practice skill over and over and over again like he was saying with um

782
00:53:38,336 --> 00:53:39,716
Just getting your first like game credits

783
00:53:39,736 --> 00:53:44,398
but like all that kind of builds into experience that gives you the ability to just kind of like

784
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:49,119
Not overthink your jokes and just look at like the art you're given and be like, oh, this is a stick guy

785
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:52,640
This is the milk guy and just kind of like make that a funny productive thought

786
00:53:53,261 --> 00:53:57,642
And that's kind of like a secret expertise that I would pick up. Yeah, just

787
00:53:58,042 --> 00:54:05,025
Yeah, just get a time. I mean, you know, writers and journalists, not just those professions,

788
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:11,088
but anyone, I don't know, there's a certain kind of person that can only do anything on a deadline.

789
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:11,308
Yeah.

790
00:54:11,588 --> 00:54:13,729
You know, and I'm kind of that way too.

791
00:54:13,769 --> 00:54:13,929
Yep, same.

792
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,610
And yeah.

793
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:23,334
I'm sure that every single person that you know, I have worked with in uh in in journalism or writing or whatever

794
00:54:23,354 --> 00:54:23,394
uh

795
00:54:24,854 --> 00:54:27,756
They're the same way. I don't want to say when we're recording this podcast, but

796
00:54:30,557 --> 00:54:31,077
Oh man

797
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,658
Yeah, this case in point

798
00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:37,900
My other takeaway that I want to sneak in is anime is good and everyone should watch it

799
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,802
Yeah, and apparently you watch enough anime, then you'll get a video game credit somewhere.

800
00:54:44,822 --> 00:54:48,823
Yeah, no, it was interesting for people should go watch The Promised Neverland.

801
00:54:48,903 --> 00:54:51,884
It's on Crunchyroll, which is an anime viewing subscription.

802
00:54:51,924 --> 00:54:52,985
It's like Netflix of anime.

803
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:56,886
But the things he was saying about characters in there kind of changed.

804
00:54:56,926 --> 00:55:00,027
Like, I hadn't thought that deeply into it because I was just consuming my media.

805
00:55:00,848 --> 00:55:05,111
But the way he was describing how certain characters are very driven and each the

806
00:55:05,992 --> 00:55:08,914
conflict for the entire series is set up at the beginning and then it's these smaller

807
00:55:09,374 --> 00:55:11,856
micro internal conflicts that create the suspense and like I

808
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:12,877
Don't know

809
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:18,401
I'm really interested to see what game that manifests into because just how he was describing it was like really great. So

810
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:23,240
Yeah, that's that's something that you know, where this just sounds like an

811
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,284
interesting I haven't seen it, but I haven't seen a lot of anime, those

812
00:55:27,444 --> 00:55:34,612
Transformers, you know, count. Yeah. But, you know, that's such an interesting way

813
00:55:34,892 --> 00:55:40,819
to create suspense without hiding everything. It's like, we're going to show you everything.

814
00:55:41,744 --> 00:55:45,928
and you know we'll be able to draw the suspense from there is what it sounds like.

815
00:55:45,948 --> 00:55:50,752
Yeah just like very like character driven turns where everything feels it's there's like mystery

816
00:55:50,772 --> 00:55:54,195
novels you'll read where you'll get to the end you'll guess who the killer is and it's like

817
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:57,437
actually it's this guy because of this thing you that was kind of obscured for you and you don't

818
00:55:57,457 --> 00:56:02,021
feel justified in it but uh the kind of turns he was talking about are those where you don't see

819
00:56:02,061 --> 00:56:06,745
it coming but it still feels justified and like it fits into the overall narrative. Yeah.

820
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:09,168
Thank you, everybody, for joining me.

821
00:56:09,188 --> 00:56:10,770
Chris and Alyssa, Anime Hour.

822
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,292
I will review anime on this podcast if you let me.

823
00:56:13,352 --> 00:56:13,712
Do not.

824
00:56:13,732 --> 00:56:14,633
Please do not.

825
00:56:15,013 --> 00:56:16,234
Yeah, we can do that.

826
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,155
We'll add a segment.

827
00:56:18,236 --> 00:56:21,378
Anime with Alyssa, sponsored by Subway.

828
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:21,578
OK.

829
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,842
No, we have no sponsorship with Subway.

830
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:27,283
A little game awards joke for you.

831
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:29,625
Yeah, we're very timely.

832
00:56:29,645 --> 00:56:31,706
What were your big takeaways from the conversation

833
00:56:31,726 --> 00:56:32,547
now that I've blabbed on?

834
00:56:33,828 --> 00:56:37,798
Oh, no, no. Oh, you're not blabbing? Um, it's, uh...

835
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:48,855
I don't know, a lot of the stuff that Brandon, you know, talks about are conversations that I've had with him about writing.

836
00:56:49,175 --> 00:57:01,246
And I think with him, I love the advice that he had at the end about, you know, finding your voice and, you know, not, you know,

837
00:57:07,431 --> 00:57:15,636
I could tell that he was trying to walk a line between, you know, write what you know and also, you know,

838
00:57:18,925 --> 00:57:24,308
Writing like branching out, you know into into new topics and just to be to be careful about that

839
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:26,028
but it is

840
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:30,610
It's just an interesting thing that I think that you can only

841
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:35,452
Figure out I mean you can watch YouTube videos. You can watch it

842
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:40,174
You know that that talk about process you can watch Brandon's, you know talk

843
00:57:41,414 --> 00:57:45,356
you know on GDC vault or GDC YouTube, but

844
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:53,939
the only way that you're going to be able to figure that out is like writing and I know that

845
00:57:54,139 --> 00:58:00,962
probably is really annoying whenever any you know young writer asks for advice and the advice

846
00:58:00,982 --> 00:58:06,064
suggests well just write more but that that really is what it

847
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:23,018
It is what it is. I mean, you just have to keep on trying. And I do think that there is a point where it, you know, clicks or becomes more clear to you about the style, like your writing style.

848
00:58:23,718 --> 00:58:31,885
Like, you know, if I'm sitting around and, you know, trying to write like Philip K. Dick or Ray Bradbury.

849
00:58:32,586 --> 00:58:36,788
It's not gonna go so well for me and and in fact hasn't gone well for me

850
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:44,772
But that's kind of the thing I really like that idea of just kind of like figuring out you know

851
00:58:45,732 --> 00:58:50,355
What you like and I also liked when talking about writing the dialogue for

852
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:51,516
invisible

853
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,517
Indivisible, it's kind of

854
00:58:54,957 --> 00:58:55,778
that same idea

855
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,379
Excuse me, like

856
00:58:58,539 --> 00:58:59,640
You know writing

857
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:05,044
Don't write necessarily for other people. I mean obviously you're writing for other people

858
00:59:06,405 --> 00:59:09,768
But do something that you know write something that you

859
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:15,873
Enjoy, you know something that you enjoy, you know, there's gonna be somebody else out there that

860
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:18,254
That it connects with so

861
00:59:18,795 --> 00:59:25,097
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff there, and it's kind of nice to talk to somebody that you

862
00:59:25,157 --> 00:59:30,119
know about their craft, because usually we're just making dumb jokes.

863
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:33,880
But yeah, it was great.

864
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:37,122
So I think that about does it for this one.

865
00:59:37,582 --> 00:59:40,223
You need to get loaded up on NyQuil or something.

866
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:41,224
Day quill?

867
00:59:41,784 --> 00:59:46,551
It's ear pressure, so Benadryl is what I have to do, but I can't function as a human being

868
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:49,534
after taking that, so it's gotta be like, suffer through the work day and then just

869
00:59:49,554 --> 00:59:49,935
go to sleep.

870
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:55,274
All right, yeah, or you could just take it off. Take it off. Take the afternoon off.

871
00:59:55,294 --> 00:59:55,874
I don't know about that.

872
00:59:57,415 --> 01:00:02,418
