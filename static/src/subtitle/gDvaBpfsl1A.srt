1
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:05,382
Let me get started.

2
00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:07,184
Thanks for coming to my talk.

3
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:08,344
My name is Nick Yee.

4
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:10,846
I'm the co-founder of Quantic Foundry.

5
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:13,668
I'm going to be talking about gaming motivations.

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:17,912
Let's say I asked you to come up with a list

7
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:21,534
of key gaming motivations that gamers vary on

8
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:22,835
in a room full of.

9
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:25,838
gamers and game developers, I don't think any of us

10
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,100
would have any trouble coming up with our own lists.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,822
But all our lists will be a little different.

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,865
Some of us may have four high-level motivations.

13
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:39,168
Others may have dozens of fine-grained motivations.

14
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,311
Some of us may propose that socializing and competition

15
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,433
are on opposite ends of the same spectrum.

16
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:47,414
Some of us may not even agree

17
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:49,276
what competition means in the first place.

18
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:51,990
So how do we decide?

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,011
How do we go from there?

20
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:56,853
And how do we measure these motivations in the first place?

21
00:00:57,754 --> 00:01:01,197
There's a standardized process in psychology research

22
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:04,319
to answer this very exact question.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,981
It revolves around a technique called factor analysis.

24
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:10,882
What it does is it identifies variables

25
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:13,323
that cluster together and those that don't.

26
00:01:13,883 --> 00:01:18,285
So imagine if we had a lot of gamers go through a survey

27
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,046
on a five point Likert scale, how important?

28
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:24,767
On a variety of game motivations, and we got that data back.

29
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:32,753
What the factor analysis does is it surfaces the underlying structure of how those variables actually

30
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:40,078
Cluster together or don't so in this case the factor the cluster on the left that focuses on leveling up quickly

31
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:42,059
Getting as powerful as possible

32
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,783
We may label achievement the one on the right that focuses on chatting with other people making friends

33
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:49,584
We may label as socializing

34
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:55,999
Factor analysis is kind of like celebrity death match.

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,563
You throw in a bunch of proposed factors

36
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:02,665
and you can see what model actually comes out.

37
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:03,526
So that's what we did.

38
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:06,689
We went through the academic and industry literature,

39
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,692
whether they called it gaming motivations,

40
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,454
player taxonomies, models of fun.

41
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:19,729
We extracted the proposed motivations to generate a pilot list of 50 survey items.

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,475
Items like, how much do you enjoy games with an elaborate storyline?

43
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:30,603
How important is it to you to play a game at the highest level difficulty?

44
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:35,958
We used a bootstrap approach to collect the data

45
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,338
and iterate on the model.

46
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:40,259
We started with a panel of 600 gamers

47
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,680
to create a good enough model.

48
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,641
We took that early data and created an online app.

49
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:49,701
Gamers could come through, take a five minute survey,

50
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:53,442
and get a personalized report of their gaming motivations

51
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:56,623
relative to the pool of data that we had.

52
00:02:57,653 --> 00:03:00,575
And as the data kept coming in, we would constantly rerun the

53
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:04,696
factor analysis, replace survey items that loaded poorly until

54
00:03:04,756 --> 00:03:14,560
a robust model emerged. Here's a sample report that we had. We

55
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,242
also made it easy for gamers to share their reports on social

56
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,923
media, on Facebook and Twitter and so on. We released the

57
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:25,625
first pilot version of this model in June of 2015, last

58
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:25,765
year.

59
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:31,990
In the first wave, we got 30,000 gamers fill out the profile,

60
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:35,434
and we did a huge revision of the underlying math, the model,

61
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:39,238
and we pushed out the second wave in July.

62
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:43,322
In the second wave, Ars Technica, among other places, picked it up.

63
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:47,547
What the Ars Technica staff did was they actually had a lot of their editors take the profile,

64
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:48,327
and then their write-up.

65
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,090
was how their profiles compared to each other.

66
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:54,072
On the day of the Ars Technica hit,

67
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:55,813
on its peak, at its peak,

68
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,836
we had over 600 concurrent users

69
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:02,959
going through the profile tool that day.

70
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,041
After every big media hit,

71
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,343
we have a long tail of social media sharing.

72
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:10,205
In fact, 80% of our respondents

73
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,326
come to us via social media,

74
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,608
primarily Facebook and then Twitter.

75
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:22,154
To date, we've collected over 220,000 data points worldwide,

76
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:24,476
counted as unique IP addresses.

77
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,399
Most of the data comes from North America,

78
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,662
the US and Canada, and the EU,

79
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:31,564
but we also have sizable subsamples

80
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:34,046
from Southeast Asia and South America.

81
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:38,451
Let me show you the model that emerged from all this data.

82
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:43,166
We identified 12 unique motivations

83
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:46,049
that grouped into six pairs.

84
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:50,915
So in every column, the pairs are highly correlated,

85
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:53,277
and the motivations in different columns

86
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:54,419
are less correlated.

87
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,060
Let me go through these fairly briefly. Most of these should

88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,502
feel fairly familiar because they're based on existing

89
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:05,005
taxonomies. Action is the appeal of chaos and mayhem in exciting

90
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:09,648
fast-paced game play. Under social are both competition and

91
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:12,970
socializing, both the social interaction and the teamwork.

92
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,892
Mastery is about long-term thinking, whether that's

93
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:20,695
practicing a game over time so you get better at it and you can

94
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:23,797
master the game eventually or the appeal of strategy.

95
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:28,661
You like to think and plan ahead and make complex decisions

96
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,804
based on the information that's available to you.

97
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:34,409
Achievement is different ways of getting points in the game.

98
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:36,772
Whether it's completion, getting points

99
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:38,514
just for the sake of more points.

100
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:41,543
collecting everything in the game,

101
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:45,266
or getting points in the sense of leveling up,

102
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:47,707
gaining power, getting better gear,

103
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,209
getting powerful swords in the game.

104
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:52,691
Immersion is different ways of becoming embedded

105
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,072
within the story of the world,

106
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,374
whether that's the sense of immersion,

107
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:58,375
being someone else somewhere else,

108
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,816
or engaging with a elaborate plot

109
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:03,516
with a lot of interesting characters

110
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,857
with in-depth backstories.

111
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:08,077
And finally, creativity is different ways

112
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:09,438
of making the game your own,

113
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:12,739
whether that's creating a unique-looking avatar,

114
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,619
city, spaceship, or discovery,

115
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,480
playing the game in the broadest sense of the word.

116
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,081
You're swimming out to the edge of the ocean

117
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:24,221
in World of Warcraft just to see what happens

118
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,022
or doesn't happen.

119
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:30,043
I mentioned that the motivations in each column

120
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:32,424
are highly correlated and less so across columns.

121
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,606
But those correlations vary, right?

122
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:36,627
Some are a little stronger, some are a little weaker.

123
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:38,808
So ideally what we'd like to be able to do

124
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:42,671
is to visualize that web of relationships

125
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:45,812
across these 12 motivations all at the same time.

126
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,173
And we can do that.

127
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:49,755
And when we did that, we found that at the high level,

128
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:53,197
there are actually three motivation clusters.

129
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,339
There's a technique called multidimensional scaling

130
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,161
that does exactly what I just said.

131
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:02,145
So on this map, motivations that are more highly correlated

132
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:04,387
are positioned closer together,

133
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:07,069
and motivations that are less correlated

134
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,011
are further apart on the map.

135
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,673
I'm showing you, I'm starting with the North America data.

136
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:17,452
So on the top blue cluster, we see a lot of the motivations

137
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:19,714
related to long-term thinking, so strategy,

138
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,156
challenge, completion, power,

139
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:23,738
things that take place over time.

140
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,621
In the left yellow cluster, we have a lot of the

141
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,182
storytelling immersion elements,

142
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:30,264
story design, fantasy discovery.

143
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,326
On the bottom orange corner,

144
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,969
we have a lot of the action social elements.

145
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,670
So both community and competition,

146
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:39,253
as well as excitement and destruction.

147
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:41,215
What's interesting is that there are two dots

148
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,277
that don't clearly fit into their clusters,

149
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,578
so discovery and power.

150
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,261
They seem to be bridges right between the clusters.

151
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,203
So discovery is a bridge between the immersion

152
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:52,746
and the strategy, and power is the bridge

153
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,749
between the action social and the strategy.

154
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:01,389
This structure is actually consistent for all the

155
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:04,170
geographic regions that we had the data for.

156
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,770
I'm going to go through these charts fairly briefly.

157
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,191
So it's the same dots in their respective colored clusters.

158
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,331
Discovering power are always on the edges on the bridge.

159
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:18,272
Western Europe, for Eastern Europe, for Southeast Asia,

160
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:22,333
for Australia and New Zealand, and for South America.

161
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:23,933
The pattern is always the same.

162
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:29,062
So I've built upwards in the model.

163
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:31,023
I started with the 12, I ended up with the three high level.

164
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:33,103
I'm gonna build outwards now and show you

165
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:35,884
how these motivation clusters relate

166
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:37,985
to existing traits in psychology.

167
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,906
I'm gonna start with the action social cluster,

168
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:45,507
which I think is the most interesting

169
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:48,148
and also unintuitive cluster.

170
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,528
And I say unintuitive in the sense

171
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,469
that in the literature review that we did,

172
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,130
in the taxonomies that we went through,

173
00:08:56,878 --> 00:09:00,440
Few, if any, of those taxonomies paid any special attention

174
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,861
or ascribed any special relationship

175
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:05,262
between the action social motivations,

176
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:07,944
community, competition, excitement, destruction.

177
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:09,264
That there was something special

178
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:11,505
about all four of those together.

179
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:12,566
But that's what we found.

180
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,628
In hindsight, we realize that this is something

181
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,008
that we could have predicted

182
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:19,670
from personality psychology theory.

183
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,492
So in personality psych, the current gold standard

184
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:27,514
for understanding and measuring personality traits

185
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:29,235
is known as the Big Five.

186
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,957
It was developed also using factor analysis

187
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:33,799
of thousands of people around the world,

188
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,100
decades of research.

189
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:39,903
In pop psychology, everyone thinks they know

190
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:41,825
what extroversion means, right?

191
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:45,027
In pop psychology, extroversion is whether you're outgoing

192
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:46,148
or whether you're quiet.

193
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:49,970
But in personality psych, the research has shown

194
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,991
that there's actually a really rich set of traits

195
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,691
that cluster around extroversion

196
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,052
that we talk about less often.

197
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,153
So people who are outgoing, people who are extroverted,

198
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:03,634
also tend to be more cheerful, more optimistic,

199
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:05,975
more excitement and thrill-seeking,

200
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:09,176
and they tend to be more assertive in group situations.

201
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:11,336
That's the full cluster of extroversion.

202
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:18,080
That's really the underlying glue right? This is the reason why action social clings together

203
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,203
It's kind of like an expression of personality in the gaming context

204
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,349
The other two connections are a little more straightforward.

205
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:29,652
So conscientiousness is the personality trait

206
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:32,294
for how organized and self-disciplined you are.

207
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:35,696
It maps to the long-term thinking motivations,

208
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:37,378
long-term oriented motivations.

209
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:41,421
Openness is how imaginative, how curious,

210
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:43,202
how unorthodox you are.

211
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:46,364
And that maps to the immersion creativity cluster.

212
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,579
When I say map, when I say the motivations map

213
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,942
to personality, I don't mean just based on sheer intuition.

214
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:55,284
We actually have the data for that.

215
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:58,126
So alongside the gamer motivation profile,

216
00:10:58,707 --> 00:11:02,390
we also provided an optional big five profile tool

217
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,631
for the gamers coming through.

218
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:07,515
And we had data from the people who completed both.

219
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,997
So here's what that data looks like.

220
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,018
From the action social cluster,

221
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:16,400
extraversion correlates positively with three of them.

222
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,581
For openness on the right hand side,

223
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,982
openness correlates positively with all four

224
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:23,764
of the motivations in the immersion discovery cluster.

225
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:26,465
The strategy achievement cluster

226
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:28,166
actually had the weakest correlations.

227
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:29,447
We only found consciousness

228
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:32,469
correlating highly with strategy.

229
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,851
This means that, for example, that people who score high on extroversion

230
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:41,532
also score high on accidental social. People who are extroverted

231
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,374
are the same people who like excitement and fast-paced gameplay.

232
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:48,375
They like competition. They like social interaction in gaming.

233
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:52,657
You'll notice for those of you familiar with stats, these correlations are fairly

234
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:54,877
low, which is interesting, I think, actually.

235
00:11:56,685 --> 00:11:58,447
The Big Five is a universal framework,

236
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,969
but as you drill into specific context,

237
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:04,311
it can lose specificity and it fails to catch nuances.

238
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,812
You kind of need this middle layer

239
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,614
to catch all the nuances of specific context,

240
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:09,475
like game play.

241
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:12,698
But it's still enough of a relationship

242
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:14,639
to show the overall connection

243
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,821
as you drill down from the universal layer

244
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,403
to the context-specific layer.

245
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:25,494
In the media, well in the game community in general,

246
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:30,296
one typical framing of gaming is that games are escapists,

247
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:33,138
that people play games to pretend to be something

248
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:34,318
that they're not.

249
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:37,720
But if you buy the data that I'm showing you,

250
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,301
really the opposite is true.

251
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:42,842
Games are kind of like an identity management tool.

252
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:48,336
People play games that align with their core personality traits.

253
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:53,221
So instead of enabling us to pretend to be something that we're not, games actually help

254
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:55,063
us to become more of who we really are.

255
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,667
Let me slice the data now demographically.

256
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,328
I'll start with gender.

257
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,730
When we started drilling into the data,

258
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,934
at first, gender differences seemed to align

259
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,636
with gender stereotypes.

260
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:13,919
So in our data, everyone gets 12 scores,

261
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,021
and we can take their highest score and say,

262
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:17,702
this is your primary motivation.

263
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,044
So here's what it looks like at the high level.

264
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:21,806
I'm gonna slice it by gender,

265
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:23,207
where it gets really interesting.

266
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:27,610
So at the high level split by gender, the women are the blue bars.

267
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:34,255
For women, the most common primary motivations are fantasy, design, and completion.

268
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:40,320
For the men, it's destruction, competition, strategy, and challenge.

269
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,183
You know, again, at a high level, it seems like it's all conforming to gender stereotypes.

270
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,920
But then we dug a little deeper and we threw age

271
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:50,685
into the mix and then we found that a lot of these

272
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:54,230
gender differences are actually dwarfed by age differences.

273
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:55,995
Here's what I mean.

274
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,316
Here's a chart of competition.

275
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:00,317
So we're drilling down just looking at competition.

276
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:03,859
The x-axis is age, so from 15 to 55.

277
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,561
Every point is the average of all the people

278
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:07,441
who are that age.

279
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,263
The colored dots, green, are the women.

280
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:11,763
Blue are the men.

281
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:14,405
There are two interesting trends in this graph.

282
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:17,887
So one is that there is indeed a big gender gap

283
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,568
for young players, but that gap goes away

284
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:23,930
Past age 45, there's essentially no difference

285
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,932
in the appeal of competition between men and women.

286
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,774
The second, I think, what's the more interesting finding

287
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:32,095
is that if you look at that starting gap

288
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:34,757
between the young players, the men and the women,

289
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:38,079
that gender gap, and then you compare that delta

290
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,981
with the youngest men, so the leftmost blue dot,

291
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:44,983
and the oldest men, the rightmost blue dot,

292
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:45,883
that

293
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:49,247
In fact, there's a bigger difference between older men

294
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:51,929
and young men than between young men and young women.

295
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,833
We can actually quantify the effect size of gender and age.

296
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:59,815
Age actually explains twice the variance

297
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:01,876
that gender does in competition

298
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:03,857
and in a lot of the other motivations.

299
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:06,899
We can also calculate the actual overlap

300
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,680
between different groups.

301
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,640
So here in competition,

302
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:12,687
one of the places where there's the biggest gender difference, there is still nonetheless

303
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:18,377
an 87% overlap between men and women's interest in competition.

304
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,450
In the game industry, we spend a lot of time talking about

305
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,851
how men and women are different in terms of

306
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:27,772
gaming motivations, what games for women might look like.

307
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:32,013
But what the data is saying, that the elephant in the room

308
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:35,494
is really age, and instead of worrying so much about

309
00:15:35,574 --> 00:15:37,075
what games for men and women would look like,

310
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,996
we should worry more about what games for different

311
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,537
age groups, what games for people as they grow older

312
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:44,197
look like.

313
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,358
Speaking of age,

314
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:51,237
The Action Social Cluster Motivations

315
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,804
is the most age volatile group.

316
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:59,757
That's the group that varies the most dramatically with age,

317
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:01,818
and it's a little different between the men and the women.

318
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:06,302
So for the men, the entire action social cluster,

319
00:16:06,362 --> 00:16:08,304
competition, excitement, challenge, community,

320
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:11,968
they all fall, and they fall the most dramatically with age.

321
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:14,069
For the women, you still see excitement

322
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,531
and competition there, but you get

323
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:17,532
the interesting replacement of story.

324
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:20,035
So younger women are a lot more interested

325
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:21,996
in narrative than older women are.

326
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:29,097
I spent some time talking about the findings

327
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,478
from the motivation data.

328
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:33,440
I'm gonna pivot a little and talk about

329
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,002
the many unexpected ways we've been able to play

330
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:39,704
with the data due to its sheer size.

331
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:42,406
We never thought we were gonna collect this much data.

332
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,547
And we had one question that we added

333
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:46,288
serendipitously to the survey.

334
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,270
We asked gamers to tell us their favorite games.

335
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:53,653
And we did this as a way to potentially debug the survey.

336
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,394
So if there were any factors we couldn't understand,

337
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:58,296
We could look back at the games to figure it out later on.

338
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:01,237
We were really glad we asked this question.

339
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:03,338
So gamers were asked to list up to three

340
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:04,218
of their favorite games.

341
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:08,060
We coded the games in Mechanical Turk in Triplicate

342
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,481
to create a lookup database between the messy names

343
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:12,521
and the canonical names.

344
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:16,283
And the first thing that came to us was,

345
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:19,005
could we try to build a game recommender engine

346
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:20,566
based on this data?

347
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,907
So for every gamer who comes through

348
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,828
and we get their gamer profile,

349
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,731
we can look up the 1,000 gamers who are most similar

350
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:32,653
to that person's profile in the whole of our data set,

351
00:17:33,214 --> 00:17:35,475
essentially find your 1,000 groupies from our data,

352
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:38,537
and we surface the games that were popular

353
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:40,418
and favorites among your groupies.

354
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,520
to show what you might like based on your motivation profile.

355
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:48,402
We then realized that if we get multiple people coming through,

356
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,503
if me and a friend come through, you both take the profile,

357
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:51,924
you both get the recommender,

358
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:55,005
we can do the Venn diagram of game recommenders,

359
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:57,146
that what are games that you like, they like,

360
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:58,587
and you both like in the middle.

361
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:03,348
So here we're going from the motivation profile to game

362
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:07,130
titles, but we realized we could also do it the other way

363
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,173
around. So if we pick any of the game titles that we have in

364
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:12,574
our data,

365
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:17,485
We can aggregate the audience that listed that game

366
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:19,546
as a favorite, the core engaged audience,

367
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:22,627
and calculate the average profile for a game.

368
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:25,088
So here's what the profile looks like

369
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:26,449
for Europa Universalis, right?

370
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:28,470
So we can calculate the demographic profile,

371
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,631
the motivation profile, and also the games

372
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:34,412
that are popular among people who play this game

373
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,933
or this franchise or this genre.

374
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,072
So we have this not just for Gupernirvusalas,

375
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:42,114
we have it for almost a thousand games.

376
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:44,697
So then we realized if we could drill down

377
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:49,161
into a genre space, we could visualize the relationship

378
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,403
between specific game titles in that genre space.

379
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:55,627
So let's take the strategy space, for example.

380
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:57,049
Here I've...

381
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,790
I'll tell you how we did this.

382
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,692
We picked StarCraft and Civilization as the starting seeds

383
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:06,073
and we said, we looked at the data to surface the games

384
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:10,375
that are popular among audiences of those two games

385
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,436
to get the other games in this list.

386
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:13,436
So some people often ask us,

387
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,037
why is Counter-Strike in this list?

388
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:17,418
It's being pulled in by StarCraft.

389
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,848
So I'm plotting just the strategy dimension on the X-axis,

390
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,650
the excitement dimension on the Y-axis.

391
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,432
Before you all get pissed off at me,

392
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:29,476
there's a lot of, I'm zooming in on the strategy space.

393
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:33,140
So there's empty space to the left of the strategy,

394
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,282
and there's empty space on the bottom of the excitement.

395
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:37,564
I've just zoomed in on a strategy space.

396
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:39,707
I'm not saying that there's no strategy at all

397
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:40,427
in League of Legends.

398
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:46,805
One thing, we've done this with a lot of genres.

399
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,948
We've kind of played around, and in every space

400
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:51,030
that we've looked at, we've seen these interesting

401
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,392
relationships and underlying structures that surface.

402
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:56,275
So here in the strategy space, what's really interesting

403
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:59,458
is that the top right quadrant is essentially empty.

404
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:03,722
And in hindsight, we're like, oh, it's obvious in hindsight

405
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:06,004
what's happening, that if I make a game,

406
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,155
Europa Universalis, that's incredibly strategically complex.

407
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,836
There's a lot of information to process through.

408
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:14,979
I have to give you the time to make those decisions.

409
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,801
In fact, I have to let you be able to pause the game.

410
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:20,403
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to make those decisions

411
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:22,304
in time and it becomes incredibly frustrating

412
00:20:22,364 --> 00:20:22,944
to play the game.

413
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:26,427
On the other hand, the faster and more fast-paced a game is,

414
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:29,493
The game is more based on reactions.

415
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,055
There's strategy, but not the kind of strategy

416
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:33,876
where I'm giving you 30 pieces of information

417
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,677
and asking you to make a complex decision.

418
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:38,238
So there's kind of a trade-off, right,

419
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:40,419
between the amount of cognitive resources

420
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,520
I can take from you.

421
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,982
I can either take them from you via strategic complexity

422
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:48,604
or reaction time, but not both, because it wouldn't be fun.

423
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,224
If I push you over that edge,

424
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:53,306
the game stops being fun for the majority of gamers.

425
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,068
But, you know, games that are right near that edge

426
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:58,649
or slightly beyond that edge may be really good

427
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:00,250
as eSport candidates, right?

428
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,771
Because there's that level of challenge

429
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:04,532
that a lot of people can't master,

430
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:05,613
but people get the game,

431
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,834
but they know they themselves cannot play well.

432
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,846
So I've shown you this, I think all of us also have an intuition that these dots represent

433
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,648
an aggregate gamer audience.

434
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:23,092
Some of these games probably have more homogenous audiences than others.

435
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,182
We realized we could drill down in each of these dots.

436
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:33,807
We can drill down into a game title or a subspace,

437
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:37,031
say city building games, and do a cluster analysis

438
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:40,255
to surface the personas, the distinct personas,

439
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:43,199
the coherent personas, within a specific space

440
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,220
in this gaming map.

441
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:49,378
And we can identify what combinations of motivations

442
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:53,119
tend to come up the most, what demographic profiles,

443
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,620
what platform preference profiles surface with those,

444
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,501
and also estimate the distribution

445
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:01,101
of those personas within that space.

446
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:06,083
You can download the slides at this link.

447
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:12,345
And that's my talk.

448
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:13,385
Thank you so much for coming,

449
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:15,046
and I'm happy to answer any of your questions.

450
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:40,779
you tell, do you have a data, how is the relative share of

451
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:45,661
each major cluster? Like how many percent of action social

452
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:51,264
and others? Relative share of each cluster, like action

453
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:54,665
social and how many percent do you have the data?

454
00:22:56,012 --> 00:23:00,434
We do. So everyone gets scored on each of those 12. We've

455
00:23:00,474 --> 00:23:03,595
looked at it in that big chart I showed you by the 12. I haven't

456
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:07,137
done it by the 3. It's a really good question. Email me. Yeah,

457
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:08,598
I'll tell you. Yeah.

458
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:14,901
Hi. I'm a student working on a thesis project that I want to

459
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:17,222
take into account player personality. I'm just curious. I

460
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:20,823
haven't obviously looked into this yet. Thank you so much for

461
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:22,584
this presentation. This is really informative. I'm

462
00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:24,765
wondering how much of your data is available online.

463
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:29,127
to look at and reference on projects like that?

464
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:30,227
No, that's a really good question.

465
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:32,208
So this current data set is proprietary.

466
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:34,489
We've done a lot, Nick Duchenneau and I,

467
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:36,889
we've worked on the gaming psychology space

468
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:37,650
for over 10 years.

469
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,531
There are past inventories that I can point you to

470
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:43,092
that I have and other researchers have.

471
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,752
So I'm happy to point you to those.

472
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:45,973
Yeah, I'm not emailing, thanks.

473
00:23:47,113 --> 00:23:48,033
Let me take your question.

474
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:52,591
Hi, I noticed your data starts at age 13.

475
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:56,974
Do you have any data for children below the age of 13?

476
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,277
No, so you get a lot of legal restrictions

477
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,138
in terms of surveying children under 13,

478
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:06,520
and we did not survey people who are under the age of 13.

479
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:10,063
Are you aware of anyone who has conducted such a study?

480
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:11,254
That is a good question.

481
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:14,155
I am sure there has, but I don't know it off the top of my head.

482
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:17,597
But I remember when there was a point where I was looking at other game scholars, and

483
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:20,579
I know it's been done, but I just don't know it off the top of my head.

484
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,821
It just gets really, really tricky.

485
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:25,541
I don't have to do IRBs anymore.

486
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:29,945
But those of you who are in academia know how painful it is

487
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:32,667
to IRBs and there are additional set of IRB regulations

488
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:35,368
that come into play for doing any kind of research

489
00:24:35,428 --> 00:24:36,729
on people under the age of 13.

490
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:38,530
That makes it particularly tricky.

491
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,970
Yeah, it's a great question though.

492
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:40,631
Thank you.

493
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:41,011
Yeah.

494
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:43,892
Nick, this is Randy Engel.

495
00:24:44,253 --> 00:24:46,274
You and I have talked before.

496
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:48,035
Very much appreciate your talk today.

497
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:52,635
I'm wondering what you've done in terms of mapping

498
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:58,538
brain chemicals and neurobiology and all that back to this.

499
00:24:58,578 --> 00:25:01,019
That's a great question, and I think it's one of these

500
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,401
big problems that will take a lot of different researchers

501
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:04,001
to come together.

502
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:07,263
My background's not in neuropsych or biochem,

503
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:10,565
so it's not an area of research that we've gotten into,

504
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:13,907
but I think as more researchers do this stuff,

505
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:15,668
I think we'll see some really interesting findings with.

506
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:18,829
with chemical changes over age and how that may or may not

507
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,409
align with the age findings that we've seen.

508
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,670
I'll send you some emails.

509
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,632
Hi, thanks for the talk.

510
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:26,872
Thank you.

511
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:27,352
It was super great.

512
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,353
So I was one of those people that

513
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:31,313
saw this shared on Facebook, went and took it.

514
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:33,094
So I was a little bit primed, and I kind of

515
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,875
knew what was going on here.

516
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:37,656
I wonder how much of your data do

517
00:25:37,696 --> 00:25:39,356
you think has some self-selection bias,

518
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,537
and how do you check for that?

519
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:43,038
Or is the data set just large enough that it doesn't matter?

520
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,891
That's a really good question.

521
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:47,953
And I think, you know, there are a couple of biases

522
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:49,534
in the data that we are aware of.

523
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:53,637
So I know we skew towards a core gamer demographic,

524
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:56,679
and so that brings along a higher percentage of men

525
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,101
and a slightly younger gamer base,

526
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:01,663
but it's harder for us to quantify.

527
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:06,126
and understand the potential social media biases of this.

528
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,029
In a sense, we were glad that it didn't primarily travel

529
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:13,133
through gaming websites like PC Gamer and so forth,

530
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:15,235
that it was more on the social side.

531
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:18,237
So that was good, but again, it's not clear to us

532
00:26:18,638 --> 00:26:20,199
what the other potential confounds may be

533
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,340
because of that route.

534
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:22,882
It's a great question.

535
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:25,984
Actually, I was gonna ask something similar.

536
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:28,186
I'm curious if you guys are planning to do any...

537
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:33,794
studies that aren't self-administered online things

538
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:35,595
that we'll try to build from the same profile?

539
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:37,737
Because there's obviously a lot of shakiness with that.

540
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:39,898
So one of the things that we're working with a lot

541
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:43,080
of our clients is actually targeting their gamers

542
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,963
specifically and really looking and being able to track

543
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:50,125
those motivations in line with how they actually behave

544
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:53,186
in the game so we can actually see,

545
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,188
does what they say correlate with what they do?

546
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:59,591
And so we're doing a lot of that stuff with clients.

547
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,732
Likely a lot of that data cannot be shared,

548
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:04,775
but it's something that we're actually doing alongside this.

549
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:09,198
Cool, so is that surveys on the games of specific,

550
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:11,940
like just administer to people or?

551
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,441
So right, when people, so the problem in what we're doing

552
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:16,223
is we don't have a good sense of how,

553
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:18,164
of the true representativeness of it.

554
00:27:18,564 --> 00:27:20,566
But if we were working in hand with a game company,

555
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:25,293
and we know the actual distribution of retention cohorts

556
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:26,856
or different player segments,

557
00:27:27,257 --> 00:27:29,020
we can actually sample representatively

558
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,125
and have a much better sense of the sample distribution.

559
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:32,866
Cool, thanks.

560
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:33,267
Yeah.

561
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:44,079
I was really interested in your, when you talked about age and how that was a bigger

562
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:47,381
correlation and you mentioned that younger women were more interested in the narrative

563
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,202
than older women were in your study.

564
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:51,543
I was wondering, is that universal?

565
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:56,646
Like all countries, that was a universal thing or was that more Europe?

566
00:27:57,306 --> 00:27:57,786
Western.

567
00:27:57,906 --> 00:27:59,346
Yeah, that's a really good question.

568
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,687
So we've sliced the data a lot of ways,

569
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:05,468
but we're going at a moderate pace,

570
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:06,648
but there's some questions like that

571
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:08,749
that we haven't been able to drill down into the layer.

572
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:10,509
So that's a question that I actually,

573
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:11,989
we have not looked at yet.

574
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:13,370
But it's a great question.

575
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,770
So we know that in a lot of places

576
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,891
where we've drilled down into a specific genre

577
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:20,291
or a specific age group,

578
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:22,772
that things tend to change a little,

579
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:24,272
but I don't know off the top of my head

580
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:26,933
what it does look like geographically for that question.

581
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:33,979
question. Hi there. So this is obviously really, really cool

582
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,504
stuff. So I know somewhere along the line you kind of said you

583
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:40,906
transitioned, you were in phase one and then you had a phase 2.

584
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:47,953
I guess I'm curious, what's phase 3? How much or what ways

585
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:49,354
are you going to expand on this data?

586
00:28:51,016 --> 00:28:57,240
I think that the biggest the hardest thing about what we did so I a lot of my past research was in

587
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,282
Virtual worlds and MMOs so I have a taxonomy of motivations and MMOs

588
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:06,046
Where it captures the nuances of do you prefer casual versus raiding guilds?

589
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,188
You know how much time you spend designing your avatar

590
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:11,230
where they're really grounded in that genre,

591
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,511
the biggest difficulty with coming up with a taxonomy

592
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:15,894
at the most general level is you start losing that nuance.

593
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:19,176
So for us, the phase three will be figuring out ways

594
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:22,039
to bring that nuance back in,

595
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:25,502
in a way that's still manageable in a generalized survey.

596
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:28,965
And we're thinking that there will be additions

597
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:30,726
of questions that are targeted of,

598
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,549
if you play this genre,

599
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:34,990
which of these things do you generally prefer

600
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,371
when you're playing this genre of games?

601
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,291
That's cool, thank you.

602
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:41,677
Yeah, we're out of time, but there is a wrap-up room.

603
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:43,420
If you don't know where the wrap-up room is,

604
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,323
it's right around the corner.

605
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:46,945
Nick Dushan and I will be there,

606
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:48,828
we'll be happy to chat and answer

607
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:49,950
any of your questions after this.

608
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,532
Thank you so much for coming to my talk.
