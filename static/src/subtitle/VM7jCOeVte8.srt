1
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,815
Thank you.

2
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:15,656
Something about cell phones and forms.

3
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:16,876
All right, let's start.

4
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:20,838
All right, so my name is Itay Karen.

5
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:23,139
I'm the owner of Untame and the creator

6
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:25,059
of a game called Mushroom 11.

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:28,581
Mushroom 11 is a game about destruction and growth.

8
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:30,902
And the only way you can move is by destroying

9
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:31,582
your own cells.

10
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:35,904
The game was released in October on Steam, GOG, and Humble.

11
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:38,344
And we're gonna talk a little bit

12
00:00:38,344 --> 00:00:40,305
about the design of the puzzles.

13
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:42,368
Alright, quick background.

14
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:46,170
Game started in 2012 at the Global Game Jam at NYU.

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,731
The theme was the Ouroboros,

16
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:50,473
which is the snake eating its tail.

17
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:51,894
I was thinking about a 2D creature

18
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:53,855
that has a set of cells,

19
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:59,358
and you remove the cells and it immediately regrows,

20
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:02,840
so we have this cycle of destruction and growth.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,240
I called it...

22
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:09,576
pixel blob and quickly change it to mushroom 11, which is a whole story in itself. This

23
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:15,920
is how the game looked after 48 hours. It clearly had something interesting going for

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,542
it, although it was very slow and clunky.

25
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:24,525
and even though it was presented in this very naive layout.

26
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:27,386
I recreated this layout just for the purpose of this talk

27
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:30,607
and I was trying to think, you know,

28
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:34,649
what are the reasoning for me to just put this layout?

29
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:38,230
and this is basically the default layout.

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,992
I can clearly see Mario here,

31
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:44,252
and what would Mario do in this case?

32
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:48,194
You could either slide or jump over the gap,

33
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:51,455
and then I just put this interesting mechanics on it,

34
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:52,495
and even...

35
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:55,270
Even though I really didn't give any attention

36
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,892
to the layout already,

37
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:00,353
even though you don't have any jump,

38
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,674
you could do a bunch of different and interesting things

39
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:05,355
like use the free form pruning and split

40
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,436
and the reattachment and the fact that you have

41
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:10,658
this cellular level persistence of the physics

42
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:13,380
to go over all sorts of obstacles.

43
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,241
You can use the rigid skeleton.

44
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:19,383
to grip and conform to a terrain.

45
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:22,045
You can use the idea that you can regenerate

46
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:24,706
from even one cell, which kind of opens the idea

47
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:26,847
of sacrificing, you can destroy the cells,

48
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,068
but as long as you have even one,

49
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:32,210
then you're good to go to cross all sorts of obstacles.

50
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:37,312
The idea that you can shape your set of cells in any way

51
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:40,493
means it gives you unlimited shape and extent,

52
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,013
but it also shifts the center of mass,

53
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:44,654
which opens up a whole source of interesting behaviors

54
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:51,375
and physical effects like gyration, tumbling, and momentum.

55
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:56,637
But yeah, the risk was that I have this interesting

56
00:02:56,637 --> 00:03:00,758
mechanics, but it's presented in this familiar package.

57
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,311
it took me the longest time to kind of try to figure out

58
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,192
what this game is about.

59
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:11,354
I call it the NT platform, which represents the mental leap

60
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:13,355
that I had to go through to kind of understand

61
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:16,616
what's the nature of this behavior,

62
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:18,077
and what does it mean, what's the mechanic mean,

63
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:19,218
what does it need to have.

64
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:23,080
Also, it also stands for the idea that the main weapon

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,721
for any platform, which is jumping,

66
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:28,603
is completely absent from the vocabulary of this mechanic.

67
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,362
A couple of words on the mechanics design.

68
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:37,304
So one of the first thing I did was to eliminate growback.

69
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:40,505
So as you remove cells, they immediately change

70
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:43,607
the probability for regrowth where you removed it.

71
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:48,490
So it kind of perpetuates the growth away from the cursor,

72
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,732
allowing you more control over where you're going.

73
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,553
Another thing is that this game is not about walking.

74
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:57,674
It's not a walking simulator, which means that

75
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:01,228
It's not just one button or joystick.

76
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:02,970
There's a lot of attention into just moving.

77
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,292
So making this enhanced gyration

78
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:06,633
and allowing you to tumble forward.

79
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:09,645
gives you this opportunity to make this much more enjoyable,

80
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,166
even this very, very basic motion, which is very important.

81
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,948
The idea of eliminating the mid-air growth,

82
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:18,889
something that's kind of controversial in my own mind,

83
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,191
the fact that you can't grow mid-air

84
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:25,252
allows you to control your own size,

85
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:27,853
and by that you control your own weight.

86
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:32,695
Also, if I did allow mid-air growth,

87
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:33,776
it means that you can kind of...

88
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:35,937
eliminate the purity of the puzzles

89
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:38,137
by just flying over some of the obstacles.

90
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:41,138
So this was eliminated.

91
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:42,498
So I'll talk about that further.

92
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:46,940
And they have the idea of using the size,

93
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,220
and the smaller the mushroom,

94
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,261
the bigger it tries to grow back to its original size,

95
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:53,961
which means that if you keep it really small,

96
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,802
it grows really fast, you can walk really fast,

97
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:57,462
but your size is super small,

98
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:59,263
so you have very small surface area,

99
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,023
so you have less control,

100
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:02,024
so you have this interesting speed control trade-off,

101
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:03,184
and if you have a trade-off, you have a game.

102
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:08,246
So you have this unlimited growth,

103
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:12,087
which is something that took me a bit to reach.

104
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:14,968
For a long time I had this energy bar,

105
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:17,629
and you would pick up these creatures

106
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,790
and gain energy and use their energy to regrow.

107
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,791
But then I realized that I was actually

108
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,272
punishing the players for doing the one thing

109
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:25,372
that they enjoy the most.

110
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:28,193
So quickly I just completely split it,

111
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:30,494
and people ask me what the creatures are.

112
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:32,534
Well now you know, they're just for points.

113
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:32,815
And.

114
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,435
the growth is completely unlimited.

115
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:39,876
And the idea of going from right to left,

116
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,056
if you played this game in 2012, 2013,

117
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:43,836
you know that this is actually designed for tablets.

118
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:47,897
And if you try to play this game on a tablet,

119
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:50,518
you realize that as you go from left to right,

120
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,218
your hand is in the way of anything

121
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,259
that's coming towards you.

122
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,680
So I just thought, why not just make it from right to left?

123
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
I mean, I'm talking about right-handed,

124
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,221
who are the grand majority, sorry, lefties.

125
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,483
And, but then it's like the question is,

126
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:09,946
so why are all the platforms go from left to right?

127
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:11,668
So I had this interesting discussion

128
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,309
and it went through, you know,

129
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:16,552
western languages with ink being smudged

130
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,153
if you would go from right to,

131
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:21,335
if you write from right to left.

132
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:23,777
And then the Cartesian coordinate system.

133
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:27,180
And then maybe some lazy developer

134
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,841
trying to use unsigned integer.

135
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:31,023
to avoid going negative.

136
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,726
Anyway, so why not use power-ups?

137
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:36,368
I've been thinking about that a lot,

138
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:37,208
and I had a lot of attempts.

139
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:42,233
Why not have it bigger, go lighter, faster, invincible?

140
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:44,895
So yeah, I decided to not go there at all

141
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:46,917
because it took me the longest time

142
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,259
to figure out the parameters of the growth,

143
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,341
the speed, the number of cells, the weight,

144
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:54,743
all these things took the longest time

145
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:55,684
to find that sweet spot.

146
00:06:55,684 --> 00:06:56,565
If it was too small,

147
00:06:56,945 --> 00:06:59,847
you couldn't reach some of the obstacles.

148
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:00,608
If it was too big,

149
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:02,609
you have a lot of things to pay attention to

150
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:03,650
and everything grows.

151
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,812
So if you leave something behind, it grows.

152
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:09,654
So that actually makes kind of no sense.

153
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:12,636
It's not an advantage to have more cells necessarily.

154
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:15,298
And also the idea of invincibility.

155
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:18,581
What does it even mean when the main control

156
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:19,701
is to destroy your own self?

157
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:22,201
So all these things kind of made no sense.

158
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:25,142
So I decided at some point that the mechanics

159
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:28,142
is going to stay the same and the entire mechanics

160
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:30,043
is going to be built into the environment.

161
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:31,483
The environment is the mechanics.

162
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:34,043
If you keep minimal character features

163
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,744
and versatile environment,

164
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:38,144
you end up with a rich experience.

165
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:40,685
Also, I was stupid enough to submit the game

166
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:42,665
even back in 2012 to a festival.

167
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:46,986
And while I did get in, one of the jurors told me

168
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:51,930
I'm concerned that there isn't much more to be explored with this mechanic.

169
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,611
Challenge accepted.

170
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:52,831
All right.

171
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:59,177
So the next few years, I was going with my trusted sketchbook everywhere, as you probably

172
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:00,918
noticed, and had a bunch of ideas.

173
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:03,841
I immediately tried to implement them.

174
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:08,465
And I came up with this set of puzzle mission statements.

175
00:08:08,465 --> 00:08:11,568
Create environments that challenge the mechanics.

176
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,171
Experiment with as many environments

177
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:15,512
and derived mechanics as possible.

178
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:17,393
And granted this is completely personal.

179
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:19,154
This is a personal challenge that I put for myself

180
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:20,835
to dig deep into this mechanic

181
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,236
and figure out what I can do with it.

182
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,177
I don't think that a game is complete

183
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:28,080
when every single path is explored.

184
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,941
Build on and combine mechanics,

185
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:31,322
challenging logic and skill.

186
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:35,084
And following the core unpredictable nature

187
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:36,645
of the mechanics,

188
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:38,786
encourage exploration and open solutions.

189
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,898
and make every challenge unique to Mushroom 11.

190
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,219
Even this puzzle here is,

191
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,481
well, we've all seen platforms in platformers,

192
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:50,582
but this is almost like a backwards,

193
00:08:50,582 --> 00:08:55,064
ironic implementation of those platforms.

194
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:56,344
Now, as for the goal design,

195
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:58,725
this is another thing that I took this decision

196
00:08:58,725 --> 00:08:59,726
very early on.

197
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:02,363
to have a linear and consequential progression.

198
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:07,406
Even the side tracks are kind of like

199
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:09,248
just right on the main path,

200
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,789
so you can just go and explore a little more.

201
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,330
For me, it was a matter of mastery,

202
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,373
just figuring out a lot of the puzzles,

203
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:18,374
our ideas are based on each other.

204
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:24,320
It was important for me to have the players being primed by learning all these different

205
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,284
vocabulary pieces and just continue from there.

206
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:32,526
And also since I'm kind of the product of the 90s, this is the kind of games that I

207
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:37,149
liked to play as a kid, so I really enjoyed those.

208
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:41,109
As for the, even the story, the story is told

209
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:45,111
in a completely passive way, using background images

210
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:46,832
in order to not interrupt that flow,

211
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:49,294
so that was a completely conscious decision.

212
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:51,488
All right, let's go quickly through

213
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:52,988
some of the puzzle systems.

214
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:56,549
So even walking in Mushroom 11 is quite a challenge,

215
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:59,670
you know, so just understanding the fundamentals of control.

216
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,290
Once you understand those, you can go

217
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,871
and start mastering those basic control

218
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,512
when things are starting to move under your feet,

219
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:08,792
you have some time pressure.

220
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,873
If you go into the idea of balance

221
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:13,694
and this changing center of mass,

222
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:15,334
you have unstable foundation,

223
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,635
all of a sudden open up bunch of new ideas.

224
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:24,235
Excuse.

225
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:24,396
Come on.

226
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:25,678
Sorry.

227
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:36,856
So, by changing your balance and changing your center of mass, you also change the environment

228
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:37,376
in some way.

229
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:41,660
Use your friction, the fact that you gain some momentum, you can apply that momentum

230
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,241
on objects on the scene.

231
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:49,206
Also, you can apply that balance on other objects, and those objects in turn have different

232
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:55,691
interaction with the environment by themselves, so that's another family of challenges.

233
00:10:57,344 --> 00:11:00,207
splitting another one of the core elements of Mushroom11.

234
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:03,770
Clearly, the fact that you have distributed growth,

235
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,594
the number of cells stays the same,

236
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:09,516
but you can cut it to any number of pieces

237
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,598
with no loss of mass.

238
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:14,600
But as you do so, you have some sort of attention management.

239
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,421
You have a few pieces,

240
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:17,003
you need to pay attention to each one of them,

241
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:19,785
but each one of them can be assigned with a different task.

242
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:24,709
So that opens up, well, a bunch of the ideas

243
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:25,610
in Mushroom 11 come from that.

244
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,014
And also you can have the environment split it for you,

245
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,516
enabling a bunch of interesting,

246
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,058
at least visually interesting ideas as well.

247
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:36,339
The structure of Mushroom 11.

248
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,275
You can use it to conform and grip onto objects

249
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:43,197
and use it to progress further into the level

250
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:45,258
in various ways.

251
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:50,961
The structure itself can sustain any physical forces

252
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:54,323
of gravity and other centrifugal forces

253
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:56,204
and momentum and all that.

254
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:59,506
And it's even strong enough to sustain

255
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:02,488
forces applied by other objects.

256
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,729
So you can use it to stop other machines and whatnot.

257
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:08,356
Shape, well clearly one of the things you wanna do

258
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:13,658
is try to shape a certain silhouette as given by,

259
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:18,120
whatever in this case we've used the shape sensors

260
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,061
which is an entire discussion I could talk about.

261
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:22,801
What did I do?

262
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:25,662
But more interestingly,

263
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,623
you can use your shape to change the environment.

264
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,023
or in some way become the solution.

265
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:36,427
You become a tool, this dynamic tool in the environment

266
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:39,230
that you can perpetually change

267
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,652
and align to the environment.

268
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,700
A quick word on the physics.

269
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,082
The physics of shape-shifting,

270
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,084
it seems very natural to us now.

271
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:51,166
If you think about it,

272
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,828
if you change the center of mass,

273
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:58,252
it means that you expect a negative force

274
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:00,074
to compensate for that change.

275
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:01,255
And we don't have that in Mushroom11.

276
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,116
In fact, there is no consequences at all.

277
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:05,757
we're avoiding the law of conservation of energy

278
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:08,058
and it feels very, very natural.

279
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:10,539
It also means that you have no force

280
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,439
applied on the environment.

281
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:13,880
So what do you do when you don't have a force

282
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,620
on the environment?

283
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,801
You need to find other ways of handling the environment

284
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,301
and solving puzzles.

285
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:26,705
It also means that you have to grow around objects,

286
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,586
you can't grow into them, you don't have any force,

287
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:32,349
so you kind of like slime through cracks,

288
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:36,212
which is pretty much the idea of the dysfunctional organism.

289
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,353
Makes a lot of sense.

290
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:41,216
That's the main reason why moving in tunnels

291
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:43,158
is so satisfying.

292
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:48,622
Alright, so once you have physics,

293
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:50,865
any physical object combined with the fact

294
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:54,289
that you have shape shifting and splitting

295
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:57,533
becomes interesting in any way you put it.

296
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,956
And it's completely unpredictable in some cases.

297
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:01,997
and the amount of things that you can do

298
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:06,079
just by placing an arbitrary moving object with mushroom

299
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,461
is almost always fun, at least for me anyway, so I enjoy it.

300
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:13,641
So a lot of these puzzles just started with me

301
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:15,642
putting stuff on the screen and seeing what happened.

302
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:20,306
Add that to the fact that you have this cellular level

303
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:23,649
persistence, any cell has its own momentum

304
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,732
and that momentum is inherited even between

305
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:28,993
splits and reattachments.

306
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,656
We talked a little bit before about the changing mass,

307
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,458
the fact that you have some control over your mass.

308
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,521
So sometimes your weight combined with some momentum

309
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:41,562
is the only way you can solve some puzzles.

310
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:44,705
But in some cases you would actually have to mitigate that.

311
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,127
changes in a way to keep yourself light.

312
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:51,551
So using split and mass already looks a little different.

313
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:54,293
And the fact that you have remote mass shifting,

314
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,275
again, something that doesn't seem very intuitive,

315
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:57,876
but once you play it, it's level seven,

316
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,238
you kind of understand it intuitively,

317
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:02,560
that you need to balance the seesaw

318
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,982
while progressing one of the pieces towards the exit.

319
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:10,558
Applying external forces, well, we've all seen wind

320
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:16,003
in many platformers, but when you have a shape shifter

321
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:18,725
that reacts to the wind in different ways

322
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:21,167
based on the shape, it already is interesting.

323
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:25,950
We used some turbulence, simulated turbulence here,

324
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,810
and a bunch of other stuff,

325
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,011
but basically this is just wind.

326
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:33,773
And another little change we have at the same level

327
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:37,274
is the sticky walls, these plants.

328
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:42,596
It's slightly similar to the wall climbing

329
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:44,497
that we've seen before, but in this case,

330
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:48,988
As you move away from the wall, the center of mass changes,

331
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:51,552
it means that you need a bigger surface area

332
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:52,634
to stay on the wall.

333
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,772
It's another little change that makes a lot of difference

334
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:59,033
and other interesting flavor.

335
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:01,754
And one of my favorite things is the water

336
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:04,855
allowing you to have all sorts of interesting effects,

337
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:07,737
this unrestricted growth underwater.

338
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:11,878
The fact that you can shift yourself underwater

339
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:14,960
with no consequences allow you to do all sorts of things

340
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,420
that obviously are not natural,

341
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,541
but they are completely natural

342
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,501
in the world of Mushroom 11.

343
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:22,465
A couple of words about the hazards of Mushroom 11.

344
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,748
First of all, fireballs, like almost every other game.

345
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:27,390
They are, I call them the slap on the wrist

346
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,633
because they are pretty much just like your eraser.

347
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:34,196
They remove cells, so they look very flashy and scary,

348
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:37,580
but that's just because of what you know about fireballs.

349
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:40,845
More interestingly, you have the acid infection

350
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,366
that just spreads inside your body

351
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:46,049
and the only way you can heal yourself

352
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,671
is by completely removing the infected area,

353
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:51,052
which I think is a nice metaphor

354
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:51,793
for the story of Mushroom 11, by the way.

355
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:55,055
And the insta-death, not used a lot,

356
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,616
but another interesting effect,

357
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,919
allowing me to put some interesting obstacles

358
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,179
later on in the game.

359
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,841
The boss is one of my favorite interesting opportunities

360
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:08,902
in the game, probably the one thing that took me

361
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,082
the longest time to develop.

362
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:14,944
Every level ends with this ultimate test of acquired skills,

363
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:16,605
things that you've learned through that level.

364
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:23,231
So this is kind of this perpetual procedural puzzle system

365
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:28,195
that just behaves regardless of whether you're there or not

366
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:30,478
it just lives there and then when you come into their

367
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:32,680
chamber interrupting their way of life.

368
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,023
It's just a lot of fun just designing those things.

369
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:38,525
And one of the things we were talking about

370
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,628
the consequential progression of the game,

371
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:41,969
one thing that I,

372
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:47,073
don't necessarily enjoy in some games is the idea of key drop that magically after you beat a boss

373
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:51,377
you have it has a key that you open a door and you magically teleport to someplace else. For me

374
00:17:51,377 --> 00:17:56,702
it was very important to have some sort of consequence. You kill the boss because the boss

375
00:17:56,702 --> 00:18:03,067
is in your way to the next area and sometimes you even use their corpse to progress to the next level.

376
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,790
All right, puzzle types.

377
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,311
Okay, so clear you can use it to have some logical puzzles

378
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:15,432
and a bunch of exploration and open solutions.

379
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:17,393
This one is a logical puzzle

380
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:20,834
with a bunch of different solutions.

381
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,454
One of the things that is important

382
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:24,954
when you have open solutions

383
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:27,915
is the idea of avoiding distractions.

384
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:29,656
I call it the loose brick

385
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:31,436
because if you have a loose brick,

386
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:33,416
it probably means that you need to push it.

387
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:33,697
Once.

388
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:36,761
the player feels that there's something in there,

389
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,205
they're gonna just stick to that solution

390
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,307
and try it over and over again.

391
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:44,414
So just make sure that when you have open solutions,

392
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,499
then just don't make things that are taking away

393
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,401
from that experience.

394
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,885
And then you have all sorts of combination of skill, logic, and exploration,

395
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,787
which basically is most of the puzzles in Mushroom 11.

396
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:03,293
You know, you get to see the entire, all the elements in the puzzle.

397
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:07,397
You try to figure out what to do, and then you still have some hard time using your own

398
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:12,302
unpredictable nature of character to get through.

399
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:19,365
all the way to 100% skill-based puzzles,

400
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:21,227
timing-based, precision-based,

401
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:25,132
basically taking something from the general platform world

402
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,295
and putting it in the world of Mushroom11,

403
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:28,997
and I'm going to talk about that puzzle in a moment.

404
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,007
All right, we should bring this to what went well.

405
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:34,689
This is a mid-mortem because clearly I'm working

406
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:37,131
on the tablet version, mobile tablet version

407
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:40,574
of Mushroom 11, so try and look back, see what happened.

408
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:44,197
What went well, the game got great reviews,

409
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:47,660
a bunch of game of the year awards,

410
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,941
best platform of the year,

411
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:52,403
but that really doesn't mean much.

412
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:54,925
What is important to me is the depth and detail

413
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:56,987
that I think I got into this game

414
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,448
with environments, the art.

415
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:01,590
the story, the music, the audio, and the technology,

416
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,551
I think I'm very proud of what we achieved.

417
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:07,613
The variety of puzzle and puzzle systems,

418
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:11,895
the creatures, the bosses, and a lot of secrets,

419
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:14,697
some of which are not yet discovered, by the way.

420
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:18,519
The minimalism of the mechanics, clearly,

421
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,201
and the storytelling, which is a talk in itself.

422
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:29,790
of teaching. I'm extremely proud in the way we give this novel mechanic to the players

423
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,615
and slowly teach them, by the way with the help of my co-designer Julia, my wife, how

424
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:38,398
to get through and understand it like...

425
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:44,398
Every new obstacle is kind of taught

426
00:20:44,398 --> 00:20:47,359
and you're primed through these things.

427
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,660
So by the end of level one or two,

428
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,041
players already know how to use this mechanic.

429
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:57,062
The challenge, clearly the game is very challenging.

430
00:20:57,062 --> 00:20:58,383
If you played it, you know what I mean.

431
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:02,404
And the depth of emotion as a result.

432
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:04,225
As someone said, I love Mushroom 11,

433
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:06,105
I hate Mushroom 11, but I also love it.

434
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,991
Which brings me to what could be improved.

435
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:12,571
The difficulty curve.

436
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,352
Clearly the game ramps up in the second half of the game.

437
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:18,753
A lot of skill and time-based puzzles

438
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:23,835
versus more slow exploration logic-based puzzles.

439
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:28,196
The length and the density of the later levels as well.

440
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:30,529
I guess some of it is my ego.

441
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:32,651
I found all these cool mechanics.

442
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:35,232
I wanted to put all of them in.

443
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:38,254
And even the very basic game design elements

444
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:40,656
that everybody knows that you need to kind of have

445
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:42,717
something, you challenge the player

446
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:43,978
and then have some sort of relief.

447
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:45,539
But all these things were so cool.

448
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,920
I just wanted to put all of them

449
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,080
for the enjoyment of the players.

450
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,761
So it ended up really being long

451
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:51,583
and very, very dense and very hard.

452
00:21:53,607 --> 00:21:59,050
Limited control, of course, the abundance of timing based

453
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,092
and vertically based in precision control that's required

454
00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:05,953
and the idea of purity versus fun with no growth in midair.

455
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:08,855
All these things kind of contribute to the idea

456
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:11,756
of limited control, so limited control.

457
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:16,638
in some cases caused some frustration, clearly.

458
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:19,478
And the idea of lingering defeat and lingering triumph,

459
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:23,019
which is some interesting observation that I had recently,

460
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:25,980
which brings me back to that puzzle that we've seen before,

461
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,120
the 100% skill-based puzzle.

462
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,521
This is actually the top RQ factor puzzle in the game.

463
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:33,722
RQ stands for Rage Quit, by the way.

464
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:37,482
So I have analytics for all the puzzles,

465
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,303
and I have this list of all the puzzles

466
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:41,643
that did well and did...

467
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:43,564
Not as well.

468
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:49,728
And the problems with this puzzle are pretty clear.

469
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:52,049
It's a limited control based puzzle.

470
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,290
It's very, it's timing based, it's precision,

471
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,851
a lot of vertical motion.

472
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:59,513
It's surrounded by other very, very hard puzzles as well,

473
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:01,274
so there's not a lot of relief.

474
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:04,396
And ultimately, it has the lingering defeat.

475
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:06,497
If you fall off the platform,

476
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:09,098
you have this long, extrusioning,

477
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:13,347
wait until you hit the ground and even then you have some time to go back to where you

478
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:14,688
were.

479
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,850
So clearly there's something wrong with that specific puzzle.

480
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:23,015
Although this is all Julia's fault because it's her favorite puzzle.

481
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:26,498
On the other hand, you have the lingering triumph.

482
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:30,862
So after you beat a boss, there's this moment of…

483
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:38,884
just basking the glory of winning and instead what mushroom 11 does because of that purity is to

484
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:44,646
Introduce another small challenge to just go through to physically go through to the next level

485
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:47,267
Instead of just enjoying that moment of winning

486
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:51,731
Which reminded me of one of the biggest changes between Street Fighter 1 and Street Fighter 2

487
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:56,976
when they introduced this slow motion after you beat your opponent.

488
00:23:56,976 --> 00:24:01,720
So you have that lingering effect of like seeing yourself beating or getting beaten.

489
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,964
So just that emotion is just much stronger.

490
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:10,008
Which kind of also reminded me of one of my least favorite games in the world, Monopoly,

491
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:12,771
which is pretty much all based on lingering defeat and lingering triumph.

492
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,562
Which reminds me, a quick take away on this whole thing.

493
00:24:18,562 --> 00:24:19,462
Test early and often.

494
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:22,224
Everybody knows that my game was out on day two.

495
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:25,266
It tested often because we went to a bunch of events

496
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,846
so we showed it all the time.

497
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:28,107
Diverse beta team.

498
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:29,868
That's very, very important.

499
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,029
I have a bunch of beta testers.

500
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:33,150
They're all awesome.

501
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,191
I love you all, you're probably here.

502
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:37,913
But they're all really good players.

503
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:39,253
They're fans of the game.

504
00:24:39,593 --> 00:24:41,454
and they're pretty much better than me.

505
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:44,616
And if you see why some of the problems didn't surface,

506
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,317
people wanted the game to be harder and more challenging.

507
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:49,798
And you know, so just make sure

508
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:51,659
that you have a very diverse beta team.

509
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:56,141
All right, so going forward to the tablet mobile version

510
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:57,701
that I'm working on now.

511
00:24:57,701 --> 00:24:59,802
So featuring clearly touch-based,

512
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:00,963
which is the original design.

513
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:03,085
A shorter best of cut.

514
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:07,229
And the reasons are, we want to enable

515
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:09,451
the modified puzzle selection as discussed.

516
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:14,336
A better fit for the intended audience

517
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:16,018
and expected price point.

518
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:22,358
And technical constraints like memory and performance

519
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:25,379
and aspect ratio, a lot of these things kind of dictate

520
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:27,500
a different selection of puzzles.

521
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,441
And what we're doing now is obviously working

522
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:33,482
on the difficulty curve, balancing skill, logic,

523
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,983
and exploration, modifying, removing puzzles

524
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:37,884
with limited and timing based controls

525
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,925
like the ones we've seen.

526
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,052
tweak the general control parameters.

527
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:45,615
So some of these things like the purity factor

528
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:47,256
is gonna be altered a little bit,

529
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,038
and maybe also in the other, in the Steam,

530
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:50,739
in this desktop game as well.

531
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:54,402
As for the lingering defeat and triumph,

532
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:58,566
modify some of the layouts, less punishing replay,

533
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:00,407
and more checkpoints where needed.

534
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:05,311
And ease the post-boss challenge, or make it a bonus.

535
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,113
We're experimenting with a couple of approaches.

536
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,186
Constraints and capabilities of the device.

537
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:12,468
So, right to left for lefties.

538
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:16,550
So, we're thinking of doing a mirrored version,

539
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,291
just for lefties.

540
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,713
And the four by three aspect ratio,

541
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:22,515
which means that some puzzles are unfit.

542
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:24,396
There's the idea of exposing.

543
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:27,158
all the elements in the puzzle in one screen,

544
00:26:27,158 --> 00:26:30,682
which is another discussion, but anyway.

545
00:26:30,682 --> 00:26:33,785
And the idea of multi-touch puzzles are now allowed.

546
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:36,267
And a lot of puzzles are designed for multi-touch

547
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:38,309
and they couldn't be in because you only have one mouse.

548
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,731
Imagine you have like a bridge of mushroom

549
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,653
and then you need to cut it with two fingers

550
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:45,555
so just the center piece just falls down.

551
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:48,478
Anyway, so any ideas and any feedback is welcome.

552
00:26:48,478 --> 00:26:48,738
Thanks.
