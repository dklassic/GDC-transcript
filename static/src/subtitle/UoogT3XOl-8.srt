1
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:07,790
Thanks everybody. My name is Chris

2
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:12,876
I'm Tyler. We're we're pretty much co everything on

3
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:16,481
Red Hook studios on darkest dungeon and just thanks very much for being here

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,986
There's a panel on writing sex scenes at the same time as this talk

5
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:24,331
So really appreciate you guys making them very poor choice to be here

6
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:29,177
So we're probably going to use the full 30 minutes,

7
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:33,080
unless miraculously we run short because of some reason

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,822
that hasn't happened yet.

9
00:00:35,363 --> 00:00:37,225
But we're happy to talk to people in the wrap-up room

10
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:37,905
afterwards.

11
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,767
Just corner us, and they'll shoo us out of here

12
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:40,928
somewhere where we can talk.

13
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:44,412
And we'd love to talk about the challenges and things

14
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:45,333
you're facing in your studios.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,951
So quick preface, this isn't like an instructional or prescriptive talk.

16
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,592
I find those really abrasive because I don't think there's any like

17
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:57,734
true flight path through, you know, something as personal as a partnership.

18
00:00:58,314 --> 00:01:01,776
So we thought we would just try to expose our working relationship,

19
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:06,598
given that our company structure is 50-50, which is somewhat uncommon,

20
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:09,919
and we've had some troubles with that, and also some really good successes.

21
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:14,121
So this is really a subjective recounting of how we structure things and how we do it.

22
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:18,163
And hopefully there will be something in there for you guys

23
00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:20,245
to apply to your own situations.

24
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:23,687
Yeah, and the other thing is we don't talk a lot about the

25
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:24,568
team in this talk.

26
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:26,589
So apologies to the team members who are sitting here.

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,211
This is really a focus on-

28
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:30,352
It's our time, not their time.

29
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:34,452
So a little bit of background, Red Hook,

30
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:37,313
we were already, I guess, veterans in the industry

31
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:40,775
of various places, but Red Hook started

32
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:42,535
with just Chris and I and an idea,

33
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:46,177
and the only money we had was savings

34
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:47,557
from working at other studio jobs.

35
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:50,639
And so this partnership has seen it go from that

36
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:54,060
to something that ended up being quite a bit more successful

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,181
than we ever thought it would be, to be honest,

38
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,681
making a game not for everyone about.

39
00:01:58,342 --> 00:01:59,442
the grim dark.

40
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:02,064
And so we've seen different challenges.

41
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:03,244
We've seen the no money challenge

42
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:04,545
and we've seen the money challenge.

43
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,426
And along the way there's been a lot of things

44
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:08,327
that we've had to tackle.

45
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:11,008
As Chris mentioned, we are co-presidents,

46
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,329
we're co-everything.

47
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,310
We don't do the same things all the time,

48
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,130
but sometimes we do.

49
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,331
Our skills are very different,

50
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,471
our personalities are very different,

51
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,452
but we share all the decision making.

52
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:23,334
And as you might expect, that's sometimes cool

53
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:24,955
and sometimes really messy and complicated

54
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:26,256
as probably some of the team members.

55
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:28,978
They'll be in the wrap-up room too, if you want to ask.

56
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:29,699
Yeah, venting.

57
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,143
Having two bosses is not always, it's not streamlined, really.

58
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:35,084
So we'll get into that a bit.

59
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:37,326
But the bottom line, I guess, of this whole thing,

60
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:39,128
and if there's any real context to put on it,

61
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:40,970
is that we truly believe that the game would not

62
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,873
have been as successful without that messy, imperfect

63
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:45,254
structure.

64
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:45,314
So.

65
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:53,772
all the reasons why you partner are pretty self-explanatory so we're gonna

66
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:56,613
gloss over the good stuff just like a steam review we're gonna ignore most of

67
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:59,755
the good stuff and take it for granted and then really focus on that just the

68
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:03,436
trash it's not the first hundred hours that matters is that last ten minutes

69
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:05,217
yeah it's a slap in the face wow

70
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:10,862
So, obviously, you can accomplish more together than apart sometimes, having two people.

71
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,885
The key takeaway of this talk is two people can do more work than one person.

72
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:14,385
I know.

73
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:15,726
Let it, like, sink in.

74
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:17,849
There's moral support.

75
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,532
You can really leverage different but compatible perspectives.

76
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:24,834
That's all great and pretty self-explanatory.

77
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:29,035
What sometimes gets overlooked, especially early on when you're talking about

78
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:33,357
partnering up with someone is you can lose the realism with all the enthusiasm.

79
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:36,538
All of these benefits of partnership have a very real price.

80
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,100
You can have competing egos, you can be fighting each other for the authorship of the thing.

81
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:47,883
There's a huge potential for conflict, arguments, and many, many partnerships flame out.

82
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:50,746
I mean, we're not the police, but like the police.

83
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:52,628
Simon and Garfunkel, obviously.

84
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:54,209
He worked up the Simon and Garfunkel thing,

85
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:55,551
and I was like, I don't know if it's gonna land.

86
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,813
It's there, it's so old now.

87
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,137
The hit band Simon and Garfunkel.

88
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,200
So really the thesis here is

89
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,662
partnership is a double-edged sword.

90
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:07,344
We're not gonna hit this analogy the whole time,

91
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,465
but if you don't know how to use it,

92
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:09,246
you're gonna hurt yourself.

93
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,234
So I think this is pretty common usually when you decide you're going to partner

94
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:18,758
with someone hopefully you know them and you've done some things but sometimes

95
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,861
it's just you're sharing ambitions you like I want to make a game you want to

96
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:23,965
make him let's do it in our case we had known each other for years we worked at

97
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:25,627
we first met another studio.

98
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,570
and had a chance to kind of work nearby each other

99
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,412
on different projects and then work together

100
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:31,093
on some projects.

101
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:32,674
So we started growing an appreciation

102
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:33,775
for the other person's skill.

103
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:36,058
And that planted definitely a seed.

104
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:37,940
That took many years to germinate.

105
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,122
And over those years, we ended up going other places,

106
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:41,503
working, doing a million other things.

107
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:42,884
We became friends.

108
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:45,726
And probably the most common thing that we did

109
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,486
is we'd get together once a month and play poker

110
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:49,627
with a few other friends in Vancouver.

111
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,888
And that alternated between like really heavy poker

112
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:53,849
at the beginning of that, maybe like six years,

113
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:56,450
and then went into therapy sessions and then back to poker

114
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,911
because it was taking like an hour to play a hand.

115
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:00,672
But during that time, we got to know each other

116
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,153
and not only what their skills and values are,

117
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:04,593
but ambitions, that was really important.

118
00:05:05,394 --> 00:05:07,194
But just like relationships and other things,

119
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:08,255
timing is everything.

120
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:13,128
So once, you know, we had talked about working together.

121
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:16,730
We actually tried a web comic at one point.

122
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,651
It didn't make it very far.

123
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,432
It never got out there, so don't go hunting.

124
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:22,113
You know, we thought about making a really elaborate

125
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:22,734
choose your own adventure,

126
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,555
because we were figuring out ways to blend our skills.

127
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:27,497
So when the timing finally came up,

128
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,279
let's say we both had disasters at our previous companies,

129
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,660
which ended up being really fortuitous.

130
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:34,443
But we're like, okay, we're doing this.

131
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,285
But we discussed a lot of the hard stuff up front.

132
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,788
And as you might expect, the first thing is like,

133
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:40,009
okay, well, who's the boss?

134
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,534
As shortcut, spoiler alert, nobody's the boss.

135
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:46,417
But the biggest thing was the 50-50 talk.

136
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:47,038
There was...

137
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,722
a proposal for 5149 for really good symbolic reasons.

138
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:56,323
And then that really, we had to confront those no-go lines.

139
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:58,063
And we ended up at 50-50,

140
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,944
and I guess the main message from this is like,

141
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,384
and that was just as symbolic as the 5149.

142
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:05,346
You wanna have these discussions up front.

143
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,126
I guess we're not trying to be prescriptive, but.

144
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:09,388
It's a bad idea to have that discussion after you've

145
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:10,409
created something of value.

146
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:13,412
Like even if it's just, OK, now we have a full design.

147
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:16,014
And it forced us to work through something hard

148
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:19,097
at the beginning just to test, test ourselves.

149
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:22,860
Quite a scene in that Starbucks.

150
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,060
Great reason to partner up.

151
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,061
You can leverage your compatible interests, your skills.

152
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,542
You can carve out areas of expertise.

153
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,984
Really feels like you've got someone who's got your back.

154
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:35,725
You're able to make progress in multiple SKUs at once.

155
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,366
Again, glossing over the positives.

156
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:38,847
Yeah, the positives are kind of boring.

157
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:40,188
However.

158
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:44,488
As you might expect, apologies to all the Tony Danza fans,

159
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:45,428
but who is the boss?

160
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,329
The reality is, you know, some areas require a lead.

161
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:51,850
You can't just, hey, we're gonna just link arms

162
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,791
and make every decision.

163
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,452
Our skills are different, our minds are different,

164
00:06:56,472 --> 00:06:57,673
and that's really difficult.

165
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,674
I think that's an area of can-be-heavy team confusion.

166
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:01,394
It still happens.

167
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:02,974
Chris will give a piece of direction.

168
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:04,995
I'll come in and contravene that accidentally,

169
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:06,056
or vice versa.

170
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,397
One thing that is, I guess, been really helpful,

171
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:12,400
but is also challenging, is the right now versus the future.

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,442
Sometimes you take on a role to get it done,

173
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:16,923
or this needs done, or I'll do this,

174
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,204
or maybe you're just better positioned

175
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:20,285
to make that decision right then.

176
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:26,477
But then the other person's thinking, oh wait, did I, you know, you, you give feedback to

177
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:30,962
the composer and then I'm thinking, did I just, you know, am I no longer the music guy?

178
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:31,963
Was I ever the music guy?

179
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:32,344
I don't know.

180
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:36,649
But these are easy to think about in the short term, but they become really scary when you

181
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,233
think about totality of like, am I handing over the keys to this part of the business?

182
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,878
Yeah, some partnerships I think are really effective,

183
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,058
because you might have two completely different skill

184
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:48,819
sets, so the business guy, the creative guy.

185
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,480
And we have a lot of overlapping interests and skills.

186
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,321
And so for me, I spent years and years and years of my career

187
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:00,381
going up through the art track, concept artist, art lead,

188
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:01,842
art director, studio art director,

189
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:03,522
back to concept artist.

190
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:05,423
And the whole time just fighting tooth and nail

191
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,863
to get into that secret room with the designers and the story

192
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:09,183
guys.

193
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:10,744
I felt like I had a lot of ideas.

194
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:11,584
I felt like they were.

195
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:12,824
like really good.

196
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,725
But no one was listening to me.

197
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,426
So, but in those larger, you know, triple A structures,

198
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:22,707
they're compartmentalized for good reason, I guess.

199
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:25,488
But it was very, very hard for me to actually get to the place

200
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:29,470
where I felt like I was being able to express all of my creative potential.

201
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,050
So that's why we've started the game.

202
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,711
I want authorship on the design.

203
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:34,611
I want to be a part of it.

204
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:35,892
It's important to me.

205
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:39,153
But funnily enough, that's a huge overlap with Tyler.

206
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:42,961
Yeah, I mean my background, my business card has said game designer for a long time.

207
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:46,746
And, you know, originally, and it's really simple, you know, we look at each other and it's like,

208
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,368
okay, you're an artist, I'm a game designer, let's...

209
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,250
Despite what you're seeing here.

210
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:50,651
Make a...

211
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:50,811
Ha ha.

212
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:51,351
Ha ha.

213
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:51,492
Ha ha.

214
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:51,552
So...

215
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,395
You look like the artist.

216
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:54,595
Ha ha ha.

217
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:54,776
Ha ha ha.

218
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:54,976
Ha ha ha.

219
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:55,176
Ha ha ha.

220
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:55,356
Ha ha ha.

221
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:55,557
Ha ha ha.

222
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:55,777
Ha ha ha.

223
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:55,957
Ha ha ha.

224
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:56,137
Ha ha ha.

225
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:56,318
Ha ha ha.

226
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:56,538
Ha ha ha.

227
00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:56,858
Ha ha ha.

228
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:57,038
Ha ha ha.

229
00:08:58,436 --> 00:09:01,238
And so, you know, I, that's a big,

230
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,160
that's what I'm bringing to the partnership

231
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,941
is that background.

232
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,182
And, but it's not that simple, you know,

233
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,063
like, so there's a lot of,

234
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:10,166
the reality is like Darkest Dungeon was created by

235
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,949
all of us, and a lot of the design decisions

236
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,550
were made by Chris and I working together.

237
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:19,413
And it's definitely challenges the ego a little bit,

238
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,895
right, to figure out like what's your role

239
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,775
and what's my identity,

240
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:22,776
because sometimes you enter that

241
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:23,817
with your own self identity.

242
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:27,221
And that tension is really hard,

243
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:30,145
but it's also definitely really key to making things better

244
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:34,029
because basically an outcome of that tension

245
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:35,511
is that you make better decisions together.

246
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:39,395
despite our extremely similar address code,

247
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:42,157
we're different people, we think differently.

248
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:46,161
And that means two sets of eyes,

249
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:48,283
but sometimes two sets of eyes just represents,

250
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:49,444
like, you know, okay, someone might,

251
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:50,725
you're thinking the same,

252
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:52,007
you might catch a mistake that they missed.

253
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,048
But when you fundamentally look at problems differently,

254
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:55,109
it's better than that.

255
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,772
It's a way to solve things from different angles

256
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:59,213
and stress test all your decisions.

257
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:00,675
And it really does apply to...

258
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:03,657
to everything, you know, not just design,

259
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:06,900
but business decisions, strategy, staffing, all that,

260
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,861
and I think marketing.

261
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:09,562
And I think that's been really helpful.

262
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:11,524
And to like illustrate a little bit of our differences,

263
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:14,586
I guess, using the poker analogy again,

264
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:18,750
you know, Chris can read people really well.

265
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,371
He can play the situation.

266
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,252
He can play the person.

267
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:23,919
Manipulate? No.

268
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:24,759
He can...

269
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,860
That's not a nice word.

270
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,041
He can take the temperature of the situation really well.

271
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:33,183
And that's a real advantage to have that sort of like bird's-eye view

272
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:34,463
and that intuitive gut feel.

273
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,884
Conversely, playing poker against Tyler, you can be very confident

274
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:41,406
that whatever move he made calculates the pot odds,

275
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:43,707
is fundamentally correct, maybe not right in the moment,

276
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,548
but absolutely mathematically the most common sense,

277
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:47,588
sound choice to make.

278
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,390
a lot more methodical, a lot more numbers-oriented,

279
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,032
and communication-wise, I'm French-Canadian,

280
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:57,514
so give me a glass of wine and we'll just hash this shit out.

281
00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:59,135
Like, it's fine, we'll just get right into it,

282
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:00,355
we'll make a decision, we'll move forward.

283
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,477
Tyler's a little bit more asynchronous,

284
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,498
so we've had to adapt our communication styles

285
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,119
where I can be bigger and bombastic

286
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,600
and then know that he needs to go away,

287
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,481
take it, think about it, parse it a little bit,

288
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,223
and just adjusting our workflow back and forth like that

289
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,224
has been really, really helpful.

290
00:11:16,324 --> 00:11:21,911
Devil's Advocate is great fun, especially for me. I'm a huge fan of the devil and all of his advocacy

291
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:25,575
It's it's more than that though. It's necessary

292
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:31,101
And I think you know human nature is when you hear someone argue passionately for a point of view a perspective

293
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:34,785
You assume that this is something that they believe in

294
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:39,848
And we really tried to break that down and argue passionately for things that we didn't believe in.

295
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,751
So that we could really stress test the correct answer.

296
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,833
And so we spent a lot of time trading positions on things.

297
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:50,975
Even when, you know, let's say my gut was against it, I would argue as hard as I could

298
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,337
for the reasons why we should do something.

299
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:57,620
So, anecdotally, before we launched the early access of the game,

300
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,181
we were broke, like we were running out of money.

301
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,542
Everybody on the team was running out of money.

302
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:03,303
It was very, very stressful.

303
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:07,770
And we had shopped around looking for publishers here at GDC,

304
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,693
and we met a lot of nice people, and they all wanted 30%.

305
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:11,756
And then they wanted to recoup their ad buy,

306
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:15,541
and it was going to be just really hard to create a scenario in our minds

307
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:16,522
where that made a lot of sense.

308
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,686
But finally, at the 11th hour, this group came forward,

309
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,487
and they said, well, we'll give you $500,000.

310
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,550
as an advance.

311
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,831
And my gut was like,

312
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:28,493
no, we should live and die by the decisions that we made.

313
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,275
We spent a long time worrying, stressing, and bleeding for this.

314
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,755
It's three months out from release.

315
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:34,537
Let's just go for it.

316
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:38,159
We earned the right to at least, you know, watch it unfold.

317
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:40,580
And I felt like the die had already been cast.

318
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,443
But I remember arguing very passionately for why we should take the money.

319
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:48,667
You know, I got a mortgage, I've got a family, everybody was stressed, we could pay people.

320
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,829
There was a million reasons why it made sense to take that cash.

321
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,372
Yeah, and that situation I think we looked at it from both angles.

322
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,314
I mean, our message here is not, don't go with publishers.

323
00:12:57,714 --> 00:12:59,796
It's just more of a reflection that we were pretty late in the game.

324
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:01,617
We had already kick-started, we had already created value.

325
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:04,299
And so we also looked at the numbers side and said,

326
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:06,621
like, wait, it's two months before we go early access.

327
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:09,164
you know, does that risk profile,

328
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:10,948
does that amount of points make sense?

329
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,733
And we both arrived at the same conclusion,

330
00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:14,838
and it was really hard to turn it down, to be honest.

331
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:15,980
But it felt good.

332
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:17,083
Later.

333
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,899
So it's great to have all this amazing decision-making power

334
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,660
at your fingertips, really.

335
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:27,542
Well, at arm's length.

336
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:28,702
It's not that close.

337
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:31,464
But really, you can only leverage

338
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,626
that when you're aligned emotionally,

339
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,307
when you're in the same head space

340
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:37,989
and you've got the same mental landscape.

341
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,791
And a development cycle, as I'm sure everybody here knows,

342
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:43,433
three, five years, a lot can change.

343
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:44,134
A lot can change.

344
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:46,856
I had a baby girl partway through Darkest Dungeon.

345
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:48,877
Do not recommend having a child.

346
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,519
when you're trying to make an indie game.

347
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,240
A second child, even worse.

348
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,723
I should have run the numbers on that decision.

349
00:13:56,885 --> 00:14:01,410
And more seriously, Tyler experienced some death

350
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,030
in his family.

351
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,052
And these things have real consequences,

352
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,774
especially on small teams and especially

353
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,556
where there's very few decision makers.

354
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:10,018
And you can find yourself trying to make good decisions

355
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:12,481
by putting your heads together, but if you're out of sync,

356
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:12,941
it doesn't work.

357
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:19,074
Yeah, and I think it's very common that you're aligned on the game, or you got into it for

358
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:24,696
a reason, you have the same goal of, I don't know, walking up on the IGF stage and grabbing

359
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:26,537
a trophy or selling, or whatever it is.

360
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:30,178
But those externalities are not always aligned, and that's the thing.

361
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:34,800
When you first get in it, you're like, okay, you're not really worried about the long term,

362
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,441
but if you have a good partnership, you're going to want to keep working.

363
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,081
So in my case...

364
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:42,162
Yeah, like Chris mentioned, like six weeks after early access, my father passed away,

365
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,682
and then just a year ago, one of my brothers passed away.

366
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:48,543
So two deaths within one game development cycle, not recommended also.

367
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:53,925
It was hard, and we had to lean on each other, had to lean on the team.

368
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:55,165
It was tough.

369
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:59,346
And basically last year, I realized, OK, we got Crimson Court out.

370
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:02,947
And it was like, I need a break.

371
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:08,068
We are not aligned right now on just the life,

372
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,729
but not so much the game.

373
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:11,209
And so those were hard discussions.

374
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:13,830
They weren't easy discussions, but we ultimately, I did.

375
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,490
I went away, and I took the better part

376
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,290
of a couple months off.

377
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:19,851
And Chris, that meant more responsibility on Chris

378
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:20,492
during that time.

379
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,052
So those are.

380
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:25,981
Handled it beautifully. So yeah, so those were hard discussions

381
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:29,890
But also those are real things that you might have to face over the course of several years

382
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:34,630
And I have a problem with this slide.

383
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:38,914
So Chris has dismissed the Highwaymen.

384
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:40,256
I'm renowned in this.

385
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:41,657
Why am I looking at it?

386
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:42,938
I'm not even aware of what's happening.

387
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,120
Because I've got your back.

388
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,161
Yeah, I know.

389
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:47,103
But he's just, I'll handle this.

390
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:49,105
I try to be sincere like one time.

391
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:49,645
I know.

392
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:50,186
It doesn't work.

393
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:51,787
It just looks like I'm completely

394
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:52,908
oblivious to what's happening.

395
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:54,690
Anyway, this is an obvious benefit.

396
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:56,512
You don't have to do everything yourself.

397
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,286
But paradoxically, having a partner who's very competent

398
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,970
and focused on another area of the business off,

399
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:09,394
especially working as a distributed team,

400
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,578
you can create a real nice narrative

401
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:12,860
around how you're doing more work

402
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,322
than anyone else who's ever lived.

403
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:16,863
It's very, very easy to fall into that trap.

404
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:20,645
And you can get backed into a corner if you're forced to do a couple of jobs maybe you didn't

405
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:24,146
want to do, like, oh, I got to do the UI, and now I'm like, I'm doing all the UI.

406
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:28,327
It just doesn't, it's very easy to fall into that pitfall and feel like the grass is always

407
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,688
greener, you know, the other guy's got it easy, and start to feel like the partnership

408
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:32,828
is becoming unbalanced.

409
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:38,009
Which, again, when you have overlapping disciplines and you're 50-50, it can really spell trouble.

410
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,541
over time I think what I struggled with in this area was

411
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:43,683
the the

412
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:48,928
art in the game sat on, I thank god I have Trudy working with us now, but for

413
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:51,331
the core game was all on me and I felt a really

414
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:55,215
uh... a lot of pressure to deliver high quality stuff the best I could

415
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:58,078
uh... but in early access specifically

416
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,699
Tyler would be like, OK, we're getting ready for the patch.

417
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,640
How's the art coming together?

418
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,941
I'm like, yeah, it looks really good.

419
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:05,341
But it's coming along.

420
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:08,063
And I'm like, how's the design?

421
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:08,883
He's like, oh, you know what?

422
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:11,164
I looked at Excel, and it fired out there.

423
00:17:11,184 --> 00:17:12,204
We'll see what the community says.

424
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:13,425
We'll just see what they say.

425
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:15,526
And you know what?

426
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:16,966
Paraphrasing.

427
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:18,227
It's colorful.

428
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,688
I said I was French-Canadian.

429
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:23,909
So I felt a disproportionate amount of pressure

430
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:25,570
to do finished work, where I felt like over

431
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,731
on the other side, it's like, oh, it's

432
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:27,711
just work in progress.

433
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,481
Yeah, so that frames your view of things.

434
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:36,202
And so the pressure I was feeling simultaneously

435
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,163
with a lot of that going on is some weird reason

436
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,103
several years ago I went back and got an MBA

437
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:42,543
because I was interested in entrepreneurship.

438
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:46,124
So I started doing more of these business operations thing,

439
00:17:46,144 --> 00:17:47,404
liaison with accountants and lawyers.

440
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:48,365
I mean, these things just happen.

441
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:49,245
They suck up time.

442
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,246
Someone proposes a potential partnership,

443
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:53,606
you're excited and you're looking into all this.

444
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,127
And I felt like I was doing more and more things just

445
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:57,107
to keep the wheels turning.

446
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:58,808
Like when it was just a couple of us in a room,

447
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,889
there was not much of that.

448
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:03,891
But once there's a community, store for instance to manage,

449
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,491
all these things, it just grows and grows.

450
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:06,232
We all know this, right?

451
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,152
It's so much work.

452
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:09,253
And so I was feeling like, oh, I'm

453
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:11,774
having to do these things that are not, they're very thankless.

454
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:13,695
And they're kind of hidden.

455
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:15,736
It's like maintaining the car just so someone else

456
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:16,596
can drive it all the time.

457
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:19,778
And so I think it's easy to get buried in your own perspective.

458
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:28,588
Another benefit is, I guess it's related to the not having to do it all yourself, but

459
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:29,589
passion is infectious.

460
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,853
I'd like to think of the darkest dungeon parties, you know, someone fails their affliction check,

461
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:38,717
other characters get stress because cowardice and fear is infectious.

462
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,640
So is heroism, you know, and we even have that mechanic.

463
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,685
If someone goes virtuous, then they can start stress healing other people in the party.

464
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:48,546
I mean, that's exactly how it works on the team, too.

465
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:54,927
This one is, I think, like the two bosses one,

466
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:58,570
is really probably one of the hardest challenges.

467
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,393
We got into this because we want to make games

468
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:04,295
that we come up with, not that people tell us to do.

469
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,097
And that does result in sharing.

470
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,204
and sharing authorship, sharing credit,

471
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:12,888
seeing things referred to in articles or other things that,

472
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:14,269
hey, wait, I actually did that,

473
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:16,692
but they attributed that to the other person.

474
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,134
And again, we're not talking about the team here,

475
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:19,715
and I understand there's a lot of angles in it,

476
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:22,599
but just each other, trying to maintain that tension of,

477
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,521
we made this together, it's not always easy.

478
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:27,559
Yeah, and it's a creeping death.

479
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:28,560
It's a slow thing.

480
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,261
It's not like one thing happens and you're like,

481
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:32,643
suddenly you feel boxed out of your own game.

482
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:36,165
But you know, anecdotally, Valve emails Tyler,

483
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:37,826
hi Tyler, we want to put the game on sale.

484
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:38,427
I'm like, okay, why not?

485
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:40,568
Or I email them and say, please let us put it on sale.

486
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:41,049
That's more.

487
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,389
And I'm CC'd, which is cool.

488
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,919
And then, you know, I see him on Slack and he's like,

489
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:48,880
okay, Dana, I need you to check out these numbers.

490
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,541
Hey, this looks good.

491
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:51,022
I'm gonna talk to PowerUp about this other thing.

492
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:53,163
And then there's an article that comes out,

493
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:56,245
you know, deep dive, game director, Tyler Sigmund.

494
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,366
And it's like, over the course of a couple of weeks,

495
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:00,888
a few things happen and you can, again,

496
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,088
build that sort of sense of like,

497
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:05,450
wow, am I getting lost in, you know, the swimming pool?

498
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,991
I don't know why you get lost in a swimming pool.

499
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:07,372
I should have...

500
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:11,235
it's a it's not a good one that's a really good to be where a lagoon

501
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:11,995
perhaps yet

502
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:15,959
uh... but we develop this way of kind of coping with this is we again we really

503
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,101
try to talk candidly it's not easy to do but

504
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:19,642
we sat down a look we both

505
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:22,125
want credit for this game that we both made

506
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:25,908
and that's natural and normal and this isn't like we don't spend all the time

507
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:27,289
talking about how great is have credit

508
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,731
But we made sure that when we do a solo interview or something, we credit the other person and

509
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,632
shout them out, and that helps take the edge off.

510
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:38,514
And we try to share or alternate interviews or things that are really important to us

511
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:39,474
like being right here.

512
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:40,135
We're sharing it.

513
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:44,536
It would have been maybe, who's to say if it would have been better if it was just me?

514
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:45,017
I don't know.

515
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:45,697
Who is to say?

516
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:46,237
We'll never know.

517
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,770
You know, it's not practical for that always to be equal.

518
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,392
And I mean, we'd like to think we're above worrying

519
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,413
about things like credit, but it does matter, right?

520
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,215
That's like your reputation and also, you know,

521
00:20:57,555 --> 00:21:00,157
it's a discussion point, so it's not always easy.

522
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:05,560
So yeah, basically from that conversation,

523
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,582
we evolved this, this one of our big like kind of takeaways

524
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:10,504
is don't let anything fester,

525
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,945
especially when you have this sort of odd arrangement

526
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:16,768
of overlapping skills and 50-50 ownership on something.

527
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:20,449
And we have a zero tolerance policy for anything that gums up the gears.

528
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:25,891
And what that looks like practically is somebody says something that the other person doesn't

529
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:26,511
sit well with them.

530
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:32,313
And if that feeling, however ephemeral or vague it is, lasts for longer than a day,

531
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:39,295
the victim in this case has an obligation to raise it and discuss it with the other

532
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:39,835
person.

533
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:45,237
And that's very tricky because a feeling bad is not something that's...

534
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:49,581
easy to solve and and the causes the root causes might not be something that

535
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,125
are immediately apparent and it requires the other person to be extremely patient

536
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,028
and to put down whatever they were doing

537
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:58,732
at the time that the you know the wounded party so this is a man we gotta

538
00:21:58,792 --> 00:21:59,052
talk

539
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:01,595
and sometimes you know it's inopportune

540
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,279
but making that time means that our machinery is at least free

541
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:09,403
from this sort of sticky goop that can kind of accumulate over time.

542
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:13,527
You know, death by a thousand cuts, or like just feeling wounded every day for

543
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:17,111
for three months kind of builds up, and we just refuse to allow that stuff to

544
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:19,333
accumulate. But there's a time cost to it. There's a maintenance cost.

545
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:24,356
Yeah, I think one of the huge benefits of talking sooner rather than later, if any of

546
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,538
you have been to relationship counseling, you probably know this too.

547
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:29,239
Not that I have ever.

548
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,780
All my relationships are perfect.

549
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,341
There's no point.

550
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:34,682
But you diffuse assumptions fast, right?

551
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:39,825
It's easy to sort of construct, especially if you're a little more introverted, it's

552
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:43,748
easy to construct sort of a Tolkien-esque, like Cimmerillion backstory of...

553
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:47,131
of why this person did this thing that hurt your feelings

554
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:50,736
and create motivations and start constructing a scenario.

555
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:52,578
Is this the beginning of a change in dynamic?

556
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,981
But when you just go right to the heart of it and talk,

557
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:56,703
then often you find out that, oh no,

558
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:57,905
maybe they just did it obliviously.

559
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,368
They weren't trying, it was not even a thought.

560
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:03,231
And those diffusing assumptions is really powerful.

561
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,631
So another thing that we found really useful,

562
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:11,312
and it's taken quite a while to totally formalize this,

563
00:23:11,612 --> 00:23:14,714
even just how we refer to it, is veto power.

564
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,417
We don't have to agree on everything that happens,

565
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:20,938
but nothing happens unless we each approve it,

566
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,299
generally speaking.

567
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,361
Especially, I'm talking big decisions here and things.

568
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:27,162
And so the concept of veto power,

569
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:30,124
that if something is truly something

570
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:31,404
we don't want to live with,

571
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:33,105
or we think it's bad for the company or the game,

572
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:34,346
we can veto.

573
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:39,028
And that pays the way for differing levels of enthusiasm,

574
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:41,889
or even being able to give power to the other person

575
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:42,970
based on their expertise.

576
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,411
Like, hey, I trust you with this call.

577
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:48,232
I don't hate it so much that I feel like we should stop it.

578
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:50,553
I don't necessarily love it, but I trust you.

579
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:55,295
And so pardon the reference to current geopolitical climate,

580
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:56,836
but it's a little bit like the nuclear keys.

581
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:58,316
You each need one.

582
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,637
You each need to turn it to.

583
00:24:00,497 --> 00:24:05,662
to uh... start the business. Maybe I should do just a secure lock. Yeah. We each need to turn the key to open the secure lock.

584
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:09,265
You know I have an employer thing too. You know I hate that stuff. I'm sorry.

585
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:13,248
The other benefit of structuring this sort of like veto power

586
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:15,851
and maybe some of you are thinking, yeah but how do you even get everything done?

587
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:19,954
But it really helps relax the pace where I can see

588
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:25,388
things that maybe I'm worried about or that I think in advance I might not like.

589
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:29,732
I don't need to jump on them right at that moment because I can rest assured that

590
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,454
you know when when it comes time to make a call

591
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:36,297
I've got to green light it and the same thing with Tyler.

592
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:39,700
So it really helps take some of the pressure and tension down and you don't

593
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,181
feel like someone else is sort of like

594
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:45,465
you know driving the car off the road or in a direction that you're

595
00:24:45,545 --> 00:24:46,025
unsure of.

596
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:52,418
So another aspect of working on a multi-year project

597
00:24:52,498 --> 00:24:53,658
is just nothing static.

598
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,760
And recognizing this is really helpful,

599
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,602
you know, as we've gone into just how situations can change.

600
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:02,563
But the truth is, like, your partnership

601
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:03,464
is going to change too.

602
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:07,347
for all those reasons and other ones that we haven't mentioned.

603
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:10,169
And a real good concept that we use is like,

604
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,331
or think about is solvable versus manageable.

605
00:25:12,431 --> 00:25:13,772
It's really wrong to think that

606
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,894
every issue in your partnership is solvable.

607
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,636
There's a lot that you just have to keep it from

608
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:20,718
becoming a conflagration out of control.

609
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:22,500
You have to manage it, you have to address it,

610
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,741
it will grow again,

611
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:25,302
you prune it, you weed it,

612
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:28,345
and that's something we do constantly actually.

613
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:33,598
So really, it's not a sword, it's a marriage.

614
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,681
I had this epiphany like a year and a half ago,

615
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,122
I was lying in bed with my wife and I was like,

616
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:39,763
you know, whoa, whoa, team I.

617
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:44,207
Like, it's funny, you know, it's like I'm married to Tyler

618
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:45,108
and she's like, yeah, no shit.

619
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,952
So maybe she should be giving this talk.

620
00:25:49,972 --> 00:25:52,094
When I got married to my actual wife,

621
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:54,937
my dad took me aside and he's kind of old school

622
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:56,358
and he's like, here's the deal, son.

623
00:25:58,397 --> 00:26:00,798
It's only a good marriage if you feel like you're doing 65%

624
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:03,239
of the work and getting 20% of the recognition.

625
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,160
And I'm like, OK, that's kind of old school.

626
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,402
And he also says the only voice a man has is the in voice,

627
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:08,702
so you've got to take it with a grain of salt.

628
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:14,145
But I think that's important to feel like you're always

629
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:15,506
in a state of overperforming.

630
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:18,888
But you have to take time out to praise and recognize

631
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:21,610
the efforts and the work that your partner is doing

632
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,872
and restore some intimacy.

633
00:26:27,393 --> 00:26:29,054
You know, we go on dates.

634
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:33,478
We'll go and get a steak and have a couple glasses of red wine

635
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:38,122
and really just try to get out of our heads and, you know, away from the game a little bit.

636
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:41,604
And it's kind of funny to dress it up this way,

637
00:26:41,644 --> 00:26:45,067
but really it's a powerful tool to sort of really ease things out

638
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,849
and help us both like just relax a little bit.

639
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:50,731
And just, again, maintaining is really important.

640
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:56,591
We have shared a kiss during early access.

641
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:58,152
He threatened to do it.

642
00:26:58,172 --> 00:27:01,955
If early access did well enough that we could survive,

643
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:02,616
it happened.

644
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:04,257
It was a good moment.

645
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,860
But no, the bottom line here is that.

646
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:12,334
is that it does challenge our egos.

647
00:27:12,374 --> 00:27:15,556
It does challenge a lot of pieces of us.

648
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:18,639
But the bottom line is we need each other.

649
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,760
And we look at each other, and we know that we could not

650
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,622
have made something like this without each other.

651
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:26,024
And so that forms a basis for working through the kinks.

652
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,607
And that's us.

653
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:31,448
Wait for it.

654
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:32,289
Wait for it.

655
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:33,910
Yeah.

656
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:42,737
We have time for one or two questions.

657
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:44,257
If you've got a question for Tyler or Chris,

658
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:45,617
please come to one of the mics in the aisles.

659
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,138
We'll probably leave this slide up.

660
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:49,919
This, it just has a bell in particular.

661
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:51,699
No, no, go one more.

662
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:52,780
I think there's some more content.

663
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,420
I think it's done.

664
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,520
I think that's the end of the slides.

665
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,661
I have a question for you while we're waiting

666
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:57,861
for other people to possibly come up.

667
00:27:58,221 --> 00:27:59,222
So you talked about doing the,

668
00:27:59,322 --> 00:28:01,242
figuring out the 50-50 thing early on.

669
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:02,823
Did you also discuss what would happen

670
00:28:02,903 --> 00:28:05,323
if one of you decided to leave the company later on?

671
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:06,164
Because that actually happened to me

672
00:28:06,204 --> 00:28:08,004
with a partnership that I was in before,

673
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:09,265
and it was tricky.

674
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:10,982
Um...

675
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:14,970
No?

676
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:16,293
No?

677
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:17,335
No.

678
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:20,482
We had an interim agreement when we started that, um...

679
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:25,529
we would, the ownership would shift back

680
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:27,370
because I had a sketchbook that I had written

681
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,251
Darkest Dungeon in and had like a bunch of drawings

682
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,692
and some notes and that was the 51-49 argument.

683
00:28:33,873 --> 00:28:36,414
So we had an agreement that if we couldn't get

684
00:28:36,454 --> 00:28:39,315
to make anything, if things imploded too quickly,

685
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:42,336
then I'd be able to walk away with my sketchbook.

686
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:46,938
But then once we started to build something of value

687
00:28:47,138 --> 00:28:49,179
and really create a game together,

688
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,740
we just broadened that to be sort of a standard

689
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,261
like shareholder incorporation shotgun clause thing

690
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,282
and just went from there.

691
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:57,743
But there was a bit of time where it was kind of,

692
00:28:57,763 --> 00:28:58,763
I guess, in hindsight,

693
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:01,064
maybe we shouldn't be giving any advice.

694
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:07,828
You got one?

695
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:08,188
All right.

696
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:13,162
Hello.

697
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:13,683
Hey.

698
00:29:13,703 --> 00:29:13,943
Hello.

699
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:17,284
So you talk about having a lot of overlapping interests

700
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:21,406
as well as skills, and both also having veto power.

701
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:24,527
So I guess my question is, what would you

702
00:29:24,547 --> 00:29:29,829
do when, say, Tyler, you have a lot of opinions about art,

703
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,650
but they conflict with something that?

704
00:29:35,426 --> 00:29:37,367
like a pre-existing idea or another direction,

705
00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:38,808
how would you resolve that kind of conflict?

706
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:39,909
Sure.

707
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:42,110
Especially if you were really, really opposed

708
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,091
to a certain direction.

709
00:29:43,771 --> 00:29:44,631
Yeah.

710
00:29:44,772 --> 00:29:46,372
I'm going to slightly shift here,

711
00:29:46,432 --> 00:29:49,134
because art is the one area that actually isn't that hard,

712
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,556
because he's a fucking amazing artist,

713
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:53,096
and I cannot draw shit.

714
00:29:53,597 --> 00:29:54,577
So that one's pretty easy.

715
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:56,839
But UI, oh my god, UI.

716
00:29:57,619 --> 00:29:58,820
We battle so hard.

717
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,780
We have in-jokes.

718
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,801
We tease each other.

719
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:02,022
It gets, we get angry.

720
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:03,723
But like not really fun teasing?

721
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:05,024
Yeah.

722
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:07,226
There are moments of momentum where, you know,

723
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,087
it's just somebody's gotta,

724
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:11,289
we, remember one of the slides said like,

725
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:12,610
is this a dying on the hill thing?

726
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,372
So there's a lot of momentum sometimes where somebody,

727
00:30:15,572 --> 00:30:17,314
you know, has already taken it a certain far.

728
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:19,676
And so a lot of times it's a practical decision,

729
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:22,138
because we're like, look, this is almost finished,

730
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:24,420
or we have it figured out, and I know you don't love it,

731
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,682
but now we gotta go back to the wall and figure out,

732
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:27,342
and we have a deadline.

733
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:29,384
So sometimes, you know, then that's when you can do that,

734
00:30:29,424 --> 00:30:31,586
say, well, okay, I don't love it, but if it doesn't work,

735
00:30:32,086 --> 00:30:33,328
Like, I'm, we're gonna have a chat.

736
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:34,429
And we've done some of those, like,

737
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,353
do your thing, I'm gonna be back to visit

738
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:38,895
if it doesn't work out.

739
00:30:39,155 --> 00:30:41,257
And so there's no one answer to that,

740
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:42,940
but there's a lot of clash,

741
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,441
just not so much on the actual art.

742
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:46,204
I generally say, ooh, that looks cool.

743
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:47,846
Okay, so there's a bit of trust that like,

744
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,227
something about it will work,

745
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:51,450
but if it's really a failure, then you can revisit it.

746
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,365
Yeah, we showed off the Crimson Court promo art and I was like super amped about it because I'm like mosquito vampires

747
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:59,467
it's gonna change the world and

748
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,969
We put it out and then Tyler go hey, man

749
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,833
I'm not really wild about these bugs people

750
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:10,657
He's like they're all drawn so I was like, okay

751
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:13,696
But it took a little bit of trust because I'm like,

752
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:14,417
it's going to be great.

753
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:15,318
Here's why it all works.

754
00:31:15,378 --> 00:31:16,819
I think the thematics are super strong.

755
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:18,840
So it's just something you have to talk about.

756
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,741
And we trade victories.

757
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:20,642
That's the last thing I'll say.

758
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:22,303
All right, that's going to be the last question.

759
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:23,985
If you have more questions for Tyler or Chris,

760
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:25,125
please come on up and ask them.

761
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,287
And make sure you fill out your email surveys

762
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,109
to give them feedback on what you thought about their talk.

763
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:30,630
And before you go, let's give them

764
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,711
one final round of applause.

765
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:32,752
Thank you.

766
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:33,332
Thanks, guys.
