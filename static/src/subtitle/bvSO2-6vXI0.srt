00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:06,311
On GDC Podcast Episode 6, we've got artist, designer, marketer, and brazen overachiever,

2
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:13,334
Gabby D'Arienzo. I almost messed that up, of Drinkbox Studios to talk art, creativity,

3
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:18,936
death, and more. Also stay tuned for exciting GDC 2020 news, including our

4
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:24,098
State of the Industry Report, and help us find out where Alyssa went, back in a sec.

5
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,379
Oh, hold on a second. Hey, cats!

6
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:54,718
Hey everybody, this is Chris Graft, Editor-in-Chief of Gamasutra, and I am here with not Alyssa

7
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:55,379
McElhune.

8
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:57,961
I'm here with Alex.

9
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:00,003
Alex, can you introduce yourself?

10
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,924
Hi, I'm Alex.

11
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:05,487
I'm not Alyssa McElhune, but for today at least, I'll do my best.

12
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,549
That's too much information.

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,071
So we're just going to leave it there.

14
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:12,973
So Alyssa isn't here.

15
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:15,896
Alex, we're privy to her whereabouts, aren't we?

16
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:17,647
Yeah, I think she's at lunch

17
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:25,331
No, no, she is in a high noise situation. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. No, that sounds rough

18
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,692
It's being recited. Hmm

19
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:35,002
Yeah, it's you can't really do that when there's hammers, uh, just burying themselves into

20
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:36,043
the side of your building.

21
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:37,203
You can't really podcast.

22
00:01:37,823 --> 00:01:37,963
Yeah.

23
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:42,984
And you could if it was like the, this old house podcast.

24
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:48,065
I mean, well, if she could be podcasting, then why, what are we doing here?

25
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:49,886
I would much rather hear her side of the story.

26
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:55,807
I'd much rather hear a podcast from deep within the bunker that is Alyssa McAloon's apartment.

27
00:01:56,242 --> 00:02:04,899
Yeah, just the hammering and the jackhammering, the scraping, all the ambient sounds of a

28
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:05,741
house being sited.

29
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,970
That's what we should move GDC next year.

30
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:13,273
GDC 2020.

31
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:14,453
That's the segue.

32
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:15,314
You mentioned GDC.

33
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:16,795
GDC 2020 is coming up.

34
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:20,137
That's taking place March 16th to 20th.

35
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:24,519
Registration is open at gdconf.com.

36
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,361
That's like, it's now...

37
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:34,789
Two podcasts away one podcast away. Yeah, man. How you feeling about it? I feel like she's gonna be pretty solid this year

38
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:40,912
We just pronounced the death stranding talk. We got a bunch of other cool stuff coming up. I'm like i'm starting to warm up to this year's

39
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:42,233
uh

40
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:49,256
Smorgasbord of content on offer. Yeah, you've really been using the word smorgasbord a lot like lately and I approve

41
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,117
I'm swedish

42
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,411
I didn't realize that was a Swedish thing.

43
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:54,252
Yeah, man.

44
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:56,133
I'm very US-centric here.

45
00:02:57,874 --> 00:03:00,696
Yeah, and it's not only any Death Stranding talk.

46
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:02,117
It's Hideo Kojima.

47
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:06,321
He's going to be talking about the game where

48
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:07,281
you deliver the packages.

49
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,603
About strands, about strand games.

50
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,204
He's going to talk about themes of connection,

51
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:12,986
how to express that through game design.

52
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,607
It's going to be a banger, I tell you what.

53
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:15,548
So don't miss it.

54
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:18,278
It's also gonna be about death, which is what we're gonna talk about

55
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:19,939
kind of in this podcast too.

56
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,239
We'll mention death.

57
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,100
We won't dwell on it.

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,020
I mean, we might, I don't know.

59
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,541
About 40 minutes into every podcast.

60
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,442
If you're a frequent listener, you know, that things get super existential.

61
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:31,202
Really?

62
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:32,663
Yeah, it does.

63
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,523
Alex hasn't listened to any of the podcasts yet, but that's okay.

64
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,744
I'll prepare accordingly.

65
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:41,725
There's also going to be a talk about the level design of outer wilds.

66
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:42,946
Oh, right.

67
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:44,286
Yeah, that's really cool.

68
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,410
That game, man. That game's something else.

69
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:48,511
It is something else.

70
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:50,714
There's also the Goose game.

71
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:51,855
That's going to be...

72
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:53,497
There's going to be talk on the Goose game.

73
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,138
Oh, yeah. So something I didn't know,

74
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:56,760
and I don't know if anybody listening knows this.

75
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,863
When you go check out our talk on the Level Design Summit

76
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,385
about Untitled Goose Game,

77
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,267
it's about how they scouted the locations

78
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,769
using like film scouting techniques.

79
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,631
It's really fascinating. I can't wait to see it.

80
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:08,496
Yeah.

81
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:13,300
I wonder if they brought a goose to the scouting locations and just kind

82
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,362
of let it do whatever it wants.

83
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:18,584
And, you know, they probably got a goose to do the scouting.

84
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:20,025
Honestly, I would know.

85
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:24,149
Does the goose like this farm area?

86
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,031
Honk once for yes.

87
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:31,455
In my experience, geese don't really like anything.

88
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,820
Yeah, they don't. It's true.

89
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:41,163
Also, we did announce the nominees for the Game Developers Choice Awards.

90
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:42,283
Oh, right, yeah.

91
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:44,184
Yeah, Death Stranding is leading that.

92
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:49,426
And then there's also the finalists for the Independent Games Festival Awards.

93
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:55,968
And you can see all those on, I guess, I don't have the, I have the URL in front of me, but I'm not going to read it out.

94
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:56,548
No.

95
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:57,488
But you can Google it.

96
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:59,629
It's more fun, it's a game, to go find it for yourself.

97
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:00,509
It is.

98
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,130
Oh yeah, so...

99
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,830
I might also be in show notes too, no promises.

100
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:10,872
We do have a guest, though, now that we got all the morning announcements out of the way.

101
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,192
She's lurking in the background currently.

102
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:24,054
As of now, currently, she is the art director of the Toronto-based Drinkbox Studios, which

103
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:28,435
you might know from Guacamelee!, is one of the games they did.

104
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:39,178
She was previously art director and co-founder of Laundry Bear Games, where she worked on the IGF finalist Amortition's Tale.

105
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:40,538
Death.

106
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:49,520
Her credits also include Super Crush, KO, Parkitect, and the wonderful Celeste.

107
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,301
She has spoken at GDC in the past, and is also speaking this year.

108
00:05:55,516 --> 00:06:05,702
at GDC 2020. 2019 Forbes 30 under 30. That's awesome. And she's an advocate for, and she's

109
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:11,946
a helpful voice within the game dev community. She's a kind of a, just a really supportive

110
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:19,391
person and advocate. It's great. So let's please welcome Gabby Darienzo. Hey, Gabby.

111
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:22,293
Hey, thanks for having me. Yeah, thanks for joining us.

112
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,584
You were on mute a second ago because I think your cat was having a conniption.

113
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:31,385
Yeah, he's still, he's still meowing.

114
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:35,828
So if you hear any kind of like high pitched mews, that's, that is me.

115
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:36,128
Yeah.

116
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:41,291
We're all about the high pitched mews here on the podcast.

117
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:42,432
Yeah.

118
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:50,397
So can you, can you tell us a little bit about your background in art and just as an artist

119
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:51,238
in general?

120
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:56,277
Sure. So my background is actually in graphic design. That's what I studied in school.

121
00:06:57,358 --> 00:07:02,102
So I kind of like tangentially got into video games. After I graduated school,

122
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:06,586
I started working on the marketing team for a local game studio here in Toronto,

123
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:11,250
which is where I'm from. And when I was working on the marketing team for a little bit,

124
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:18,134
Eventually they moved me over to the game side, so doing art and UI UX design for the game side of

125
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:24,299
the team. And around that time, I also started to get more involved with the indie scene,

126
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:30,122
both here in Toronto and also just online, starting to go to events and stuff, and taught myself how

127
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:34,825
to use Unity and started teaching myself how to make my own games and how to do 3D modeling and

128
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:35,426
blah, blah, blah, blah.

129
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:37,885
And you know, I started getting a lot of people who

130
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:44,150
Reached out asking me to do some freelance work for them. So I left my full-time job at that studio and

131
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,851
started freelancing and

132
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,853
Freelanced for like four and a half years

133
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:54,238
yeah, and got to work on some really cool projects like Celeste and Parkitect and like you mentioned and

134
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:59,219
Also, within that four and a half years, I co-founded my own studio, Laundryware Games,

135
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:02,460
which is a studio I founded with my partner, Andrew Carvalho.

136
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,621
We got to make A Mortician's Tale, which is like my baby.

137
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:10,463
And so we made that together.

138
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:11,503
And then...

139
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:17,246
Yeah, I guess back last September, so like four months ago, however long it's been,

140
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:23,730
the people at Drinkbox offered me a job. And that's like, I've wanted to work with them for

141
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,293
so long because they work on such cool projects. I'm such a huge fan of Guacamelee and Severed,

142
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:34,177
which are also really big games about death. That's like a topic I'm very into. And so

143
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:37,539
they reached out, they offered me a job. And so I'm working with them now,

144
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:41,081
which is really exciting. So that's kind of my background and how I got into games.

145
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:43,984
We're going to hit like every single one of those things that you talked about.

146
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:44,765
Yeah, let's do it.

147
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:50,350
Now, let's let's start with being an art director at Drinkbox.

148
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,351
I'm not an art director at Drinkbox.

149
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:54,173
I'm just like a senior artist.

150
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:55,474
OK, sorry.

151
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:56,855
That's all good. Don't worry.

152
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,156
Senior artist. Yeah.

153
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:00,238
Well, we like to give promotions away here.

154
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,399
Nice. On the podcast.

155
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:02,120
That's official.

156
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,885
Yeah. So what does it mean to be a senior, like artist there?

157
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:15,769
Yeah, so the art team at Drinkbox is only like four people. And so it's really exciting to be

158
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,131
a part of them. For the longest time while I was freelancing and even at Laundry Bear,

159
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:23,254
I was often the art director on a bunch of different projects, or not even art director,

160
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:28,396
but only like the sole artist on a lot of projects. And so it's been a while since I've

161
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:33,359
gone to work with a team that's like over two people. And so working with Drinkbox is really

162
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:33,899
fun because I...

163
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,983
I obviously am a big fan of their games, I'm a big fan of their artwork, and so being able to work

164
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:43,225
with other artists, especially like an existing art director who's been doing art direction for

165
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:47,808
their games for years, is really exciting because I get to kind of, you know, take a step back from

166
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:51,291
art direction and really learn from them. And I've already, it's only been a few months, and I get to

167
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:57,454
learn so much from them. And so it's been a really, really, really, really good experience. And it's

168
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,257
great too because one of my biggest fears about taking the job with them was like, oh, I'm going

169
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:01,437
from...

170
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:05,160
being an art director to being just like, you know,

171
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,044
like a regular artist and am I gonna hate that? Is that gonna...

172
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:11,486
Am I not gonna be able to make decisions and stuff?

173
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:16,491
But the folks at Drinkbox are so lovely and my experiences are taken so seriously

174
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:21,276
and they listen to me a lot and I get to make a lot of decisions. So yeah, it's really it's really cool.

175
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:24,519
Yeah, so I think the term senior artist maybe is a bit confusing.

176
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,792
to some people, but basically I get to do a lot of art and UI and marketing and

177
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:33,122
just a whole bunch of stuff at Drinkbox. That's kind of what my role is now, yeah.

178
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:34,957
I actually, this is, I'm so curious.

179
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:37,298
I was talking about this with someone else recently this weekend.

180
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:40,420
Um, and I don't know if you can speak to this, but you just joined and sounds

181
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,561
like you're really enjoying and feeling comfortable there and learning a lot.

182
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:46,863
Um, can you speak to the onboarding process and what it was like to join up

183
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:50,285
with a, with an established studio after sort of doing your own thing for so long?

184
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:53,626
I talked to a lot of devs who are either really excited or really, really nervous.

185
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,748
About joining a big studio after they've been working on their own for a while.

186
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:59,649
And I never really know what to tell them because I've never done it myself.

187
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,790
So I'm curious, like, what was the experience like for you?

188
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:05,788
Yeah, it definitely was a little bit nerve wracking, especially

189
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:09,511
going from working at like a two person studio and freelancing

190
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:12,073
on a lot of really small teams, right? Like the Celeste team was

191
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:15,316
only like six people and Super Crush is only like three or four

192
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:18,439
people like it's very, very small. And so Drinkbox is about

193
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:21,361
13 people, which isn't drastically bigger, but it is,

194
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,583
you know, like they have their own processes and they have

195
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:28,206
You know an existing team making existing games. So it was a bit nerve-wracking

196
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:35,969
But it was quite smooth, right? They're really good about their they they're really really organized and have a really good production pilot pipeline

197
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:39,310
so coming into the onto the team, it was like

198
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:44,032
You know, they showed me their tools. They got me on boarded onto the art

199
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:49,774
I'm pretty one of my favorite things to do and the reason why I love working in indie games, especially is

200
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:55,697
I really love stylized art and kind of adapting to other people's styles.

201
00:11:56,298 --> 00:12:03,242
And so the games we're working on right now have two new styles that I'm not super used

202
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:08,525
to working on, and I'm really, really, really excited to be able to make art for them and

203
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:09,986
adapt to them.

204
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:11,587
Yeah, I don't know.

205
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:13,568
It was pretty smooth, is basically what I'm trying to say.

206
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:14,349
That was a long answer.

207
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,050
But it was a pretty smooth onboarding process.

208
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,731
And yeah, it didn't take very long for me to feel very comfortable.

209
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:25,953
And I think probably the weirdest thing is like having a schedule and routine again.

210
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:30,094
Because when you're freelancing for so long, it's like, oh, yeah, I can wake up whenever

211
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:30,554
I want.

212
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:35,516
And I can like work out of a coffee shop, you know, like, you get very used to running

213
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:37,136
your own schedule and doing your own thing.

214
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:41,898
And when you work at a studio, you know, they have their own like, eight to four, nine to

215
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:42,278
five.

216
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:43,138
And you're like, Oh, yeah, okay, I got it.

217
00:12:43,158 --> 00:12:43,418
Like, I got it.

218
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:43,578
So yeah.

219
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:43,678
Yeah.

220
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:43,778
Yeah.

221
00:12:43,798 --> 00:12:43,938
Exactly.

222
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:44,198
Thank you.

223
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:48,859
I gotta be there on a certain time and get things done, which is probably a good thing, I think.

224
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,701
I think it really is. I thrive underneath schedules, and so it's kind of nice to have

225
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:59,642
that again after so many years of not having that. I think a lot of creative people are like that,

226
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:03,923
which is what I kind of want to talk about. It's interesting. You went from

227
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:09,784
full-time studio, and then you did freelance for a number of years, and then now you're going back.

228
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:17,671
Can you tell me what it was like, you know, that life as an artist that is taking contract work,

229
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:24,057
what are some of the ways that you, for people who are out there here either trying to break

230
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:29,522
into freelancing or current freelancers who want to stay freelancers and even those freelancers

231
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:35,427
who want to maybe pivot into full-time, can you talk about your experiences as a freelancer?

232
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,728
What are some of the ways?

233
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:46,766
that you survived that kind of life and how did you end up leveraging that into a full-time position?

234
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,692
Yeah, I think the biggest thing is, a lot of people don't think about this when they want to

235
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:57,995
do freelance, but it's like 20% just admin and accounting, right? You're not just doing 100%

236
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:02,717
of the time doing fun art or game design or programming or writing or whatever it is that

237
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:07,338
you're doing freelance. It's like, you have to, you're basically running a business. And so a lot

238
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:12,741
of your time is spent responding to emails and doing accounting. But it's also things like self

239
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,841
marketing. You know, like

240
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:20,043
putting yourself out there on social media, going to events, making sure your portfolio is always

241
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:24,225
stocked with pieces, and if you have a slow period with work, making sure that you use that time to

242
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:28,626
find more work or fill your portfolio with pieces that will help you get more work. It's like,

243
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:36,049
it's a lot of that kind of stuff. And I think if you are a person who is maybe not keen on that,

244
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:40,431
then freelancing might not be a thing you're interested in doing. But I love that stuff.

245
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,965
I love marketing. I love running business. This is one of the things I enjoyed about running

246
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:50,651
Laundry Bear as well. And so for me, it was like a lot of that kind of stuff. And so I think a lot

247
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:55,918
of it too is like networking. I hate the term networking. It feels really business professional

248
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,641
and that seems like such a contrast to what we do in games. But

249
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:04,325
Essentially, just like making friends, you know, going to events and being social on

250
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:05,765
the internet and just making friends.

251
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:09,848
And then when people are like, oh, you know, we need an extra artist on a thing, or we

252
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,549
need to hire someone to do a logo, they think of you.

253
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,771
And that's like how I got a lot of my work when I was freelancing.

254
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:17,732
That's how I started working with...

255
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:21,434
I became friends with the Celeste developers long, long, long time ago when they were working

256
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:22,015
on Towerfall.

257
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:25,997
And so when they were looking for another artist, they were like, oh, yeah, Gabby, let's

258
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:26,757
just hire her.

259
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:27,438
So I think...

260
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:33,082
Anybody who's interested in freelancing, that's a big thing I recommend, is just making

261
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,302
friends, just getting friendly.

262
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:38,305
You don't have to go to events and shove business cards at people necessarily.

263
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:46,451
I advise against that probably, but just making friends and putting yourself out there goes

264
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:49,233
a long way if that's something you're comfortable with doing.

265
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:55,217
I think just the experience of making so much art.

266
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:59,318
both professionally, like, both from freelance projects

267
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,118
and also just on the side doing my own thing,

268
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:03,799
that helped really build up my portfolio.

269
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:07,759
And, you know, it's full of a lot of really impressive games

270
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,840
and impressive pieces that really, really helped me

271
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,941
get this job at Drinkbox, and I think would help.

272
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,321
I think that that was a big thing that, like,

273
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,781
would probably help a lot of artists

274
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,322
if they're looking to exit freelance life,

275
00:16:20,422 --> 00:16:24,203
is just, you know, building up your portfolio.

276
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:34,338
Do you think that in particularly like the indie deaf community, and this is why I respect

277
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:40,201
what you're doing, like when I was internet stalking you for research for this, like one

278
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:42,683
of the, you know, you're known as an artist.

279
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:58,008
But I think like one of the first, if not the first result from you was a video of a talk that you gave at an indie conference about marketing, about Amor Mortician Stalin, about niche marketing.

280
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:05,007
Yeah. That was for Full Indie Summit, I think, two years ago, last year, which is like an event

281
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:10,332
based in Vancouver. And that's like not a thing that like I do professionally. Like I would never

282
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:14,195
you know, choose to work somewhere as like a marketer per se,

283
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:16,197
or freelance marketing. Like I don't think...

284
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:20,899
That is the thing that I am best at and or want to do full-time.

285
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:26,581
But I think a lot of it comes from my background in graphic design and marketing,

286
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:29,182
and my first job was in marketing for games as well.

287
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:33,084
It kind of just, like, it ingrains things in you that you can't help but think about.

288
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:38,166
And when you are self-marketing yourself as a freelancer,

289
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:42,528
but also running your own business and making your own indie games,

290
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,048
I think that's a huge part of it.

291
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:45,769
Something that people don't really think about is...

292
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:48,171
marketing yourself.

293
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:50,833
I know I listened to one of your episodes,

294
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:51,994
was it

295
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:52,974
Hannah Flynn?

296
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,777
I listened to that today about marketing

297
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,918
and I was just nodding my head vigorously

298
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,139
like, yes, yes, excellent.

299
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:07,946
And a lot of the stuff that she told us about marketing for, Hannah Flynn is a marketing

300
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,766
director at Failed Better Games.

301
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:13,768
They did Sunless Skies for people who don't know.

302
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:21,970
But one of the things that the good marketers with successful games, they say, market early.

303
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,631
Like, start right from the top.

304
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:26,632
Tell us a little bit about that and how you did that with The Mortician's Tale.

305
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:32,621
Yeah, so Mortician's Tale was a game that I started thinking about back in like 2015.

306
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:36,385
And it was just like an idea. And you know, this is subject matter that's like,

307
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:41,349
very close to me and a thing I'm really interested in. And so I remember right

308
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,250
from the beginning when I started to prototype things.

309
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:45,998
And started to share it on the internet

310
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:46,778
and share it with people.

311
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,059
And started to get some kind of interest and traction.

312
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,160
And you're a funeral director in this game, right?

313
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,580
Oh, yeah.

314
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,121
Sorry, I guess I should explain what the game is.

315
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,021
Sure, yeah.

316
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:59,221
So for anybody who hasn't played A Mortician's Tale,

317
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:04,883
it is a 3D narrative driven game where

318
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:07,783
you play as a mortician running a funeral home.

319
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,824
It sounds really gloomy and doomy,

320
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:13,384
but it's actually quite soft and very, very

321
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:13,845
sensitive.

322
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:19,088
brightly colored and you know you kind of it's it's very short but you kind of

323
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:25,932
go through the story of the funeral home and how it evolves over time and you

324
00:19:25,972 --> 00:19:29,735
also get to see kind of the stories between each of the different the bodies

325
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:33,057
you take care of we released that back in like 2017

326
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:39,280
and it won a bunch of awards and was nominated for an IGF award. I did a GDC talk about it,

327
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,541
and it was a really, really cool thing to see people excited about this game.

328
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:46,803
And so, yeah, I started prototyping Mortician's Tale back in 2015.

329
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:54,490
And yeah, basically, as soon as people started getting interested in it, it was like, okay, yeah, this is like a real thing that we should actually do.

330
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:58,876
And as soon as my my co founder, and I decided to make it our thing, like a thing we're going to make.

331
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:01,179
That's when I started to think about marketing.

332
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:05,724
And that seems like really early for a lot of people, a lot of people when you say that to them, they're like,

333
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:10,848
really right at the beginning, that's so early though. And also for a game that is so niche and

334
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:15,130
so small and so indie, that seems like a really weird thing to think about. But I think it's

335
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:20,374
such an important thing to kind of consider when you're doing your market research, is also like,

336
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:23,916
okay, well, you know, how are we going to talk about this game? What is our audience? How are

337
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:28,218
we going to reach them? And that was a thing that we didn't have the budget for.

338
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,388
the capabilities of hiring someone to do this for us. And

339
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:36,031
so I did it myself was, you know, I did all the marketing,

340
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:39,774
I did all the social media, we went to events ourselves, we got

341
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:42,877
a little bit of help at the very, very, very end, like, a

342
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:45,419
month before we launched the game, just with PR stuff, just

343
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,641
like getting someone who has more experience with that to

344
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,844
help us reach out to people that we didn't have context for. But

345
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:54,007
yeah, 95% of the marketing was was me. And I think that that's

346
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:56,028
like, you know, a big thing I bring to

347
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:01,271
A big thing I'm excited to bring as well to Drinkbox as well is like, you know, I started

348
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,091
working with them and I started doing art with them.

349
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:06,492
And then they were also like, oh, you have a bit of a marketing experience.

350
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:07,833
And I was like, sure do.

351
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:10,814
So it's kind of fun to be able to bring that to them as well.

352
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:15,975
And it's a big like fun part of being an indie developer as opposed to working AAA is like

353
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:19,416
being able to wear multiple hats and really enjoying that process.

354
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:24,360
I think also there's a certain amount of, at least from the des I speak to, who, who

355
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,102
talk about, you know, starting in a project early.

356
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:30,785
If you commit to marketing yourself and thinking about your demographics and getting the word

357
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:34,348
out there and announcing your project almost, you know, from that first month, then you

358
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:35,689
commit to finishing the project.

359
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,531
And that's hard for some people.

360
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:40,793
Yeah, that's, that's totally fair.

361
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:41,153
Yeah.

362
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,958
So kind of segueing back to the artist side of you.

363
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,516
Kind of a general question, but I'm curious,

364
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:57,761
what is a good productive day for you

365
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:00,164
as someone who makes art?

366
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:00,945
What does that look like?

367
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:09,953
Uh, let's see. That's an interesting question. Definitely like the way I like to start my day

368
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:15,516
is, and I don't know if everybody does this, but I like doing it, is I get to my desk at work,

369
00:22:15,656 --> 00:22:18,937
I like make a tea, and then I have a bunch of websites I go through.

370
00:22:19,517 --> 00:22:22,320
only for like five or ten minutes, like it's a very, very short part of my day.

371
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,583
And I just like look through inspiration. And even if that inspiration's not like directly

372
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:32,368
tied to the games we're making, it's just kind of a good way to fill yourself with creative

373
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:37,692
inspiration, but also kind of just like, see what's out there and kind of like,

374
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:44,197
slowly but surely pick up on trends. Whether it's not even just like from games and game art,

375
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,058
it's also things like...

376
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,432
I look at architecture blogs, I look at graphic design blogs,

377
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:51,275
and I look at like packaging design and like, you know,

378
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:54,618
like painting and 3d modeling and things that are not really

379
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:57,241
related to what we're doing. And it's just like a really good

380
00:22:57,301 --> 00:23:01,145
way fashion, blah, blah, blah. I don't know, it's a kind of good

381
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:04,068
way to start my day. And it like, it helps me feel super

382
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:08,032
inspired. And also helps me get motivated to be productive. And

383
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:09,493
it's also like, yeah, like I said, like

384
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:15,975
a good way to keep on top of trends and get some ideas for making some interesting game art.

385
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:20,716
And so I think that a good productive day for me starts with that. And if I don't get that in,

386
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:28,338
I find that I don't do as well. It's nice to be surrounded by that stuff. And then,

387
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,058
yeah, being able to just like...

388
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:37,222
go into work and again I think having a team of people of other artists is has been so excellent

389
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:43,345
for my my mental health especially as an artist it's just like having people that you can kind

390
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:49,508
of bounce ideas off of and just kind of um brainstorm things with is is really nice and

391
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:54,091
it's been a while since I've had other artists to do that with professionally and freelance it's

392
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:58,913
like in whatever discipline you're in it's kind of a solo thing a lot of the time isn't it

393
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:06,969
Yeah, and I have other collaborators I work with, and on Super Crush I had a little bit of an art

394
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:10,170
team, like a small art team. So that was great that I could have other people I could talk to

395
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:16,974
about things, but largely, especially as an art director, a lot of the pressure falls onto you

396
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:22,517
to make those decisions. And so oftentimes it was like, oh god, I don't have anybody to talk to

397
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:27,740
about this. And so having a team that I can talk to about these things is really nice. It's really,

398
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,840
really good to be able to be like.

399
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:33,801
I'm thinking about this. What do you guys think?" And have people to be like yes or

400
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:35,002
no about things. It's good.

401
00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:40,530
So we asked about how you start your day and we should ask, do you have any trouble ending

402
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,335
your day and do you have any ways in which you sort of work through the process of leaving

403
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:46,758
your work at work and sort of moving on and going home?

404
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:51,111
That's a good question. I think that's something that I used to be really bad about,

405
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:55,095
especially freelancing. And I think a lot of freelancers have this problem. Oh, there's a cat.

406
00:24:55,315 --> 00:25:04,504
Hello. Sorry, just jumped into my lap. When I was freelancing, I had a big problem with

407
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:06,326
working too much.

408
00:25:06,887 --> 00:25:10,488
And this is gonna be a big thing I talk about in my GDC talk, which is about like burnout

409
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:11,228
and creative block.

410
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:15,610
But when I, especially when I first started freelance, it was almost like a badge of honor

411
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:22,793
to work too hard, you know, like, oh, I worked so hard today that I forgot to eat some meals

412
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:25,434
or I worked so hard today, I didn't look at the clock and now it's 11pm.

413
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,257
And I remember feeling so proud of myself for like,

414
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:30,619
oh, I worked really hard today.

415
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,084
And years of doing that kind of slowly burns you out

416
00:25:35,144 --> 00:25:37,107
and also kind of ruins your work-life balance

417
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:38,949
because you get home and you're like,

418
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:40,311
oh, the grocery stores are closed.

419
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,532
I guess I'll just eat whatever.

420
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:43,354
Or you're like, oh, well.

421
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:48,240
you have a hard time like decompressing and getting to bed because you're still thinking

422
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,825
about work because you've been working all day and you have to get up in like six hours to get

423
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:56,670
back at it again and like I don't know I used to be really bad about that I know a lot of people

424
00:25:56,691 --> 00:26:00,735
a lot of like not even just artists but also programmers and writers and designers who are

425
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:02,457
just as bad about that kind of stuff and I think

426
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:11,225
Certainly, working at a studio that has a rigorous 9 to 5 makes it a lot easier.

427
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:13,247
Because it's like, okay, well I have to get this work done.

428
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:16,370
And at 5pm, we all gotta leave the office.

429
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,131
And it's like, okay, it's a good way for me to like...

430
00:26:18,532 --> 00:26:18,792
Yeah.

431
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:21,875
A good excuse for me to walk home and that walk home.

432
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:22,596
And do a podcast.

433
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:30,204
And like just, yeah, like just kind of stop thinking about the work you've been doing.

434
00:26:30,264 --> 00:26:34,589
And then like, you know, get home and don't jump on other projects, which I used to do a lot.

435
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:35,270
Sorry, I cut you off.

436
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,530
What's up?

437
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,491
No, no, no, I'm cutting you off, sorry.

438
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:41,994
I'm just saying, because everything that you're describing right now, like, uh,

439
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:48,218
you know, I, I freelance did contract, uh, writing for, uh, you know, for game

440
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,721
business sites for like four and a half years or five years or something.

441
00:26:52,881 --> 00:26:58,204
I don't know a single person who freelances anything that has good work

442
00:26:58,244 --> 00:27:02,727
life balance or had good work life balance while they were freelancing.

443
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:03,067
Right.

444
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:09,433
because it is just a thing where you're at home, you never leave work, and you find excuses

445
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:16,020
and reasons to keep on going, or, you know, like what you were saying, it's like you also

446
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,703
have that badge of honor thing going on, which is twisted.

447
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:21,605
So once I, you know.

448
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:28,510
I think that's very encouraging that Drinkbox is a studio that says, you know, five o'clock

449
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,551
and that's it.

450
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:36,696
I think that's how places should be because otherwise, you know, people can say, oh, we

451
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:38,237
don't force, you know, crunch.

452
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:39,077
We don't force crunch.

453
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:46,182
But they also don't have management that tells people, go home now or you're over hours now.

454
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:47,263
You have to go home.

455
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:51,345
And that's the kind, I mean, that's management support is what you have.

456
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:52,106
That's great.

457
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:57,640
Yes, 100%. That's like, yeah, the big thing that Drinkbox seems to be very aware of and

458
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,501
very good about. And it's excellent. It's Yeah, it seems like everybody there has really,

459
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:05,922
really good work life balance. And that's something that I really appreciate. In general,

460
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:09,364
but also for everybody else I work with. And as like a studio setting an example for other

461
00:28:09,384 --> 00:28:14,786
studios, it's it's really important. And I'm Yeah, should be standard across. Yeah, everywhere.

462
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:16,766
But you know, that's, that's like a bigger issue.

463
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:21,477
Like with burnout then while we're on this topic now

464
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:23,664
You know

465
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:31,487
I guess I'm wondering how you would recognize that in yourself in that moment, because you

466
00:28:31,547 --> 00:28:38,249
said that you were burnt out for like a year or you were just like had creative block.

467
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:45,372
I'm wondering what are the signs, were you able to look back at that retrospectively

468
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:50,393
and say, these were signs that I couldn't recognize in the moment?

469
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:54,824
Oh, yeah, 100%. It's, it's really easy for me to look back

470
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:59,227
at now and be like, Oh, yeah, that that is a sign, but at the

471
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:04,951
time, no idea. And like, I think a lot of it was, you know, like,

472
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:07,913
so just to kind of give some context, I'll talk about this a

473
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:10,575
little bit in my GDC talk, but I'm happy to talk about it now

474
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:14,137
just to kind of give some context. But basically, after I

475
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,579
after we shipped a mortician's tale, which is a very personal

476
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,541
game, we worked on it really, really hard for a long time.

477
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:24,305
I got really, I felt like super burnt out and just like unmotivated.

478
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:28,849
And I think a lot of that wasn't to do with the project, but it was because I was doing

479
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:31,051
art direction on two new projects.

480
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:35,174
So one of them was Super Crush KO, and one of them is a project I was working on with

481
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:36,115
my studio Laundry Bear.

482
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:41,540
And I think art directing on two game projects.

483
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:46,194
pretty much more than full time, because I was splitting like seven days, not five days.

484
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:51,577
I think A, that's a lot of work to be doing, but B, you're kind of, you're shifting your brain

485
00:29:51,617 --> 00:29:56,541
around so much, right? Because you're doing, it isn't like you're like, there's an existing

486
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,643
art style that you're hitting and you're like, okay, on these three days,

487
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:03,205
I'm going to do 3D art. On these two days, I'm going to do 2D art.

488
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:09,487
it isn't like that. It's more like, okay, I have to think of and be in the creative headspace and

489
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:14,489
concept art for one game and come up with ideas for one game and do the same thing but completely

490
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:20,010
different on another side. And that's, I think, creative work. I think any work in general,

491
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,711
there's only so much you can do before you get burnt out, but I think especially creative work,

492
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:28,153
whether it's art or writing or whatever, just like thinking of concepts for games even.

493
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:32,856
I think is especially tiring to like have to context switch constantly

494
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:33,356
Yeah

495
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:36,299
And I think that burnt me out and it wasn't you know

496
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:40,802
The people I was working with the team behind super crush ko and also my co-founder

497
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:42,603
Neither of them were pushing me to do this

498
00:30:42,664 --> 00:30:48,688
This was just entirely self-imposed and I think a lot of it was like I was getting very in hindsight. It's very clear

499
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:49,649
I was getting very

500
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,111
frustrated and

501
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:58,218
just was making a lot of really bad decisions. And I think a lot of it was I felt the pressure

502
00:30:58,318 --> 00:31:03,224
to like, I have to get it right. I don't have time to concept and think of ideas. I just have

503
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:07,069
to get it right immediately. And we know that that's not the way that anything works. There's

504
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:10,594
the, you know, games especially are very iterative process. They change so much,

505
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,236
they evolve so much over the development.

506
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:18,196
And setting up this expectation to get it perfect the first time, not realistic.

507
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:22,723
And I think I was pushing myself to do it, not just for one game, but two games.

508
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:24,986
And that really messed me up.

509
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,086
Because I was like, if I don't get it right, if this art isn't

510
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:30,708
completely unique, then these games won't sell and these

511
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,370
companies will go under and blah, blah, blah. That sounds

512
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:39,075
really like that sounds so bizarre and so like, huge, but

513
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:41,397
that's kind of a lot. And when I talked to a lot of game

514
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:44,099
developers, that's kind of how they feel. And I think a lot of

515
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,981
it is just like the indie space in general is, you know, it's

516
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:49,763
very, there's a lot going on right now. And I think a lot of

517
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,045
people are just kind of panicking. So that panic on top

518
00:31:52,105 --> 00:31:52,145
of

519
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:57,550
thinking about art, also, you know, working on two things at once, and just coming off of a game

520
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:02,234
that was very personal, I think they just kind of all added up to this burnout. And I think a lot

521
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:09,340
of the signs, in general, are things like, yeah, just feeling really frustrated, feeling really

522
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,964
unmotivated. I just like didn't want to, I didn't want to work on these games at all. And I was

523
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:18,128
really excited, you know, in my headspace, I was very excited about these two projects, but like,

524
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:20,809
when it came down to sitting down and doing the work,

525
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:22,030
I just didn't want to do it.

526
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,811
I just could not push myself to do it.

527
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,253
And it's also things like I got really defensive.

528
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:29,194
I was very defensive about my own art,

529
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,695
which is something that I'm embarrassed to talk about,

530
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:32,495
embarrassed to admit,

531
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:34,877
but I think it's important to kind of speak about

532
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:37,018
because I see a lot of other artists go through

533
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,579
the same thing where, you know,

534
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:40,780
I was very defensive about like, you know,

535
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,321
my co-founder would be like,

536
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,961
oh, I think this art would be good.

537
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:44,622
And I'd be like, what?

538
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:45,782
Like, what's wrong with my art?

539
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:46,503
Like, what's wrong with my art?

540
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:50,346
Or like on Super Crush I would make a really weird decision and

541
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:54,530
Mobine Vickery who's the lead designer and the

542
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,253
Programmer and like the owner of Vertex Pop who makes Super Crush

543
00:32:59,334 --> 00:33:04,098
He would be like, oh, here's a critique of a thing. I would get very defensive about it

544
00:33:04,118 --> 00:33:09,122
and that's like a very clear sign if you're a person who you think that you might be burning like burnt out or

545
00:33:09,582 --> 00:33:13,365
you know someone who might be burnt out, I think that's a huge sign. Is someone just getting very,

546
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:18,028
very defensive about the work that they're doing, right? And I think a lot of it too was just like,

547
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:22,992
it was bleeding into my personal life as well. Like I was getting really, I was exhausted all

548
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:28,456
the time and like just so stressed and having a really hard time decompressing. Like it's just,

549
00:33:28,996 --> 00:33:32,999
I think burnout, I don't, I don't mean to like go on and on about this because it's pretty sad.

550
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:40,805
it's such a big deal. And I think it's it's something, you know, when we think about burnout,

551
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:46,910
when we hear the term burnout, especially in games, we often think about, you know, AAA,

552
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,234
big studios forcing their their employees to work. We think about I think about like Rockstar,

553
00:33:52,294 --> 00:33:57,799
that marketing pitch where they were that article that was like, Oh, yeah, our employees are

554
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:01,822
working hundreds of hours to get Red Dead done. Like that's what you think about when you hear

555
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:02,943
burnout. But I think

556
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:07,647
a lot of people, especially indie devs, we really have to consider that a lot of it is

557
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:15,272
self-imposed, right? We're putting it on ourselves without even realizing it. And I think, was

558
00:34:15,312 --> 00:34:17,494
it GDC that did, I think, the state of the industry report?

559
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:17,934
Yeah.

560
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:19,255
Right? I think you guys were talking about that earlier.

561
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:19,816
Yeah, I was about to say.

562
00:34:19,836 --> 00:34:24,639
One of the things, yeah, one of the things that was mentioned in there was like, was

563
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,522
talking about crunch and burnout. And if you feel, I think that I can't remember what the

564
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:30,084
exact wording was, but it was something about like...

565
00:34:31,024 --> 00:34:36,009
why you feel the need to crunch. And very, very small amount of it was like, someone's forcing me

566
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:40,993
to and the very, very large amount was either like, it's self imposed, like, I feel like I need to,

567
00:34:41,273 --> 00:34:45,637
or I wear it as a badge of honor. Like, I think a lot of me that's not entirely indie devs,

568
00:34:45,677 --> 00:34:49,620
I could be triple A devs too, right? But I know a lot of indie devs that just like,

569
00:34:49,741 --> 00:34:52,883
either they don't notice that they're doing it, or they do it because they think it's like,

570
00:34:53,344 --> 00:34:55,025
you know, you can't be indie unless you work.

571
00:34:55,965 --> 00:34:57,626
16 hour days and that's just not true.

572
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,666
And there's so much more.

573
00:34:58,686 --> 00:34:59,506
I mean, you've talked about it,

574
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:02,447
but like it is what you face in AAA and then some,

575
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:04,547
because so often you are the whole company.

576
00:35:04,707 --> 00:35:06,487
You are, I mean, the, you know,

577
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,788
you live or die based on how, what your game sells.

578
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:10,868
And so like, absolutely.

579
00:35:10,928 --> 00:35:13,009
It is a culture of rife with overwork

580
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:14,389
and with pressure to overwork.

581
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,470
Do you think there's anything you could have done differently

582
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,290
during the period you were burning out

583
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,470
to sort of avert that or stave it off?

584
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:29,163
I definitely think there are some things in hindsight that I could have done sooner.

585
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:34,069
Luckily, I was able to kind of, I think the burnout lasted way too long.

586
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,531
And that kind of sucks in hindsight.

587
00:35:35,612 --> 00:35:36,913
I feel like I wasted a lot of time.

588
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:41,256
But there were some things that I was able to kind of

589
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:46,478
Do and get support in that really helped and that kind of helped me overcome my burnout

590
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:50,299
I think my only regret is I didn't do them or didn't know about them sooner. And

591
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:52,960
Again, this is a big thing. I'll talk a lot about in my GDC talk

592
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,960
But a few of the things were things like, you know

593
00:35:55,581 --> 00:36:01,142
Admitting that I needed help and admitting that I wasn't feeling like motivated or excited to work on things

594
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:05,264
right and I think as soon as you're able to admit like I'm not having fun doing this and

595
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:11,346
your colleagues, your co-workers, whoever you're working with can kind of help you, you know? Like

596
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:15,487
it's not... I don't have too much pride to ask for help or wait, I do have too much pride? I don't.

597
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:20,309
It's very easy for me to ask for help. And so, you know, that was a big thing that happened on

598
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:26,891
Super Crush was Mo, again, the designer, the programmer, he saw that I was really like frustrated

599
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:29,732
and getting defensive and kind of struggling with coming up with art.

600
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:33,955
And this was pretty early on in the development of Super Crush.

601
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,317
And so, and he was like, okay, you know what?

602
00:36:37,257 --> 00:36:41,080
Take like a couple of weeks and just walk away from this.

603
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,022
Don't try to hit what we're doing here.

604
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:46,884
Just kind of like, come up with what you like.

605
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:48,605
Just just kind of do what you want.

606
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:51,847
Like, do your own thing and come up with an art that you want to come up with.

607
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:56,050
The context here is that I was having a really hard time coming up with a style for the game.

608
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,651
And it was like...

609
00:36:57,051 --> 00:37:00,995
it wasn't bad, necessarily, the things I was coming up with, but they were very safe.

610
00:37:01,396 --> 00:37:05,019
Like, I think I was falling into some, again, some of that pressure to like,

611
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,623
oh, I just need to be different. We need to be different. We need to have a different art style.

612
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:13,828
And subsequently, I wasn't really making any good decisions. I was just kind of making safe decisions.

613
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:17,852
And so as soon as I was able to kind of walk away from the project and just like...

614
00:37:18,593 --> 00:37:25,834
take a mental break from the game and just kind of like look at art for art's sake and start

615
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:31,336
concepting things for fun. That's when I was able to kind of bring in some colorful palettes,

616
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,997
bring in some interesting character ideas, and that's like really where the art for Super Crush

617
00:37:36,097 --> 00:37:42,278
came in. And that was like, again, just having Mo be able to be patient enough and have the

618
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:44,978
bandwidth to just give me that few weeks to do that.

619
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,609
That was tremendous.

620
00:37:46,669 --> 00:37:47,609
That helped out a lot.

621
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,752
I think things too, like, and this is a thing I didn't learn about until a couple

622
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:56,593
months ago when I started working at Drinkbox, but the concept lead at

623
00:37:56,613 --> 00:38:03,816
Drinkbox, Augusto Keano, or Kusho, he is an incredible concept artist and he

624
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:06,438
came up with the concepts for both Guacamelee and Severed, right?

625
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:11,259
And something that he said to me, kind of offhandedly one day, was like,

626
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:15,160
oh, you can't be too precious about your concept art. That's what he said.

627
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:19,282
And I think it was just in response to me being like, oh, I'm not very good at concept art.

628
00:38:19,322 --> 00:38:22,363
And he said, yeah, well, you know, it's one of those processes you can't be too precious about.

629
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,264
And that stuck with me so much because I was like, oh, no, you're right.

630
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:30,945
I have this whole tendency to be like, I have to get it right the first time.

631
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:34,907
That completely negates what the whole process of concept art is for, right?

632
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:35,867
Concept art.

633
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:39,887
I don't know what the writing equivalent is or what the programming equivalent is, but

634
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:44,910
concept art is basically just like sketching out as many ideas as you possibly can.

635
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,671
Doesn't matter if they work, doesn't matter if it makes sense, you just do it.

636
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,334
And when you do that, when you just let your brain kind of go into this creative flow and

637
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,336
think of ideas, you're going to have some good ideas.

638
00:38:55,796 --> 00:38:59,578
And it also kind of gives you, again, working with a team of people, it's really easy to

639
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:01,219
kind of give them concepts and have...

640
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:05,321
other people say, hey, I really like the direction you're going in here.

641
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:08,582
And that kind of opens up the ability to do even more stuff like that.

642
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:10,422
And so I kind of, I really love that.

643
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:14,324
It's definitely made making concept art a lot more fun and a lot easier.

644
00:39:14,364 --> 00:39:15,364
And that's the way it should be.

645
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:17,925
I really wish I had heard that, you know,

646
00:39:18,546 --> 00:39:20,586
when we were starting to concept stuff for Super Crash,

647
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:22,047
because I feel like that would have made things.

648
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:27,489
just more fun and more easy and breezy and just, you know, would have would have given me more

649
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:34,151
motivation to actually do the thing. Yeah. I wonder, it sounds like you're, you're deeply

650
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:37,112
passionate, not just about the work you do, but about improving that work and learning new ways

651
00:39:37,152 --> 00:39:41,534
to do it. Is there any kind of advice you would give, you know, fellow game artists who are

652
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:45,975
looking to improve their artistry on sort of what you can do? And what do you do like on a regular

653
00:39:45,995 --> 00:39:50,597
basis to try and get better, you know, like broaden your skill set?

654
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:56,440
Yeah, it's a great question. I think part of it is just doing

655
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,263
it as often as you can doing anything as often as you can,

656
00:39:59,503 --> 00:40:02,666
right? And that's that that sounds really simple and easy to

657
00:40:02,706 --> 00:40:07,030
do. But you know, when you have a full time job and hobbies and

658
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,513
groceries and like errands, you get a run sometimes that that

659
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:10,293
space fills up.

660
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:15,138
But just making a little bit of time every day to just draw a little bit or model a little

661
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:19,223
bit or write a little bit or whatever, whatever it is that you do, just doing a little bit

662
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:23,547
of it every day or every other day, really that practice adds up.

663
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:28,573
And I, last year, my partner bought me an iPad Pro.

664
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,575
So I had like the Procreate and a pencil.

665
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:34,240
And I noticed that I started drawing way more often.

666
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,442
And when I look at my art

667
00:40:35,922 --> 00:40:38,186
and how it's evolved over the last year,

668
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,991
it's the difference in my skillset is way bigger

669
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:44,074
than it was the previous years before that,

670
00:40:44,094 --> 00:40:45,736
because I wasn't doing any of that stuff, right?

671
00:40:46,957 --> 00:40:50,041
And so I think just like daily practice is a really really important thing.

672
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:59,330
But I think part of it too is also just like, you know, making the effort and the time to to learn new things and learn new skills.

673
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,272
And very fortunately we live in a time where.

674
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:03,295
Whoa, hold on one second.

675
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:04,516
Hey, cats!

676
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:05,917
Oh my god, stop.

677
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:06,357
Oh, buddy.

678
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:09,680
Everyone okay?

679
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,360
We live in a time.

680
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,961
You guys hear that?

681
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:12,902
Oh, just a little bit, yeah.

682
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:14,143
Oh my god.

683
00:41:14,163 --> 00:41:15,364
I have two cats.

684
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:18,346
We're gonna turn the volume up on that in the final edit.

685
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:19,507
Great, really good.

686
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,474
Talking about inner conflict, you just have the two cats fighting over me in the background.

687
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:29,977
Yeah, creative block is really hard.

688
00:41:29,997 --> 00:41:32,460
Interesting analogy, cats.

689
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:39,590
Jeez. God, what were we talking about? Talking about art. Oh yeah, just like, we live in a great

690
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:44,053
time of everything's on the internet, you know what I mean? And so if you're like, oh, I really,

691
00:41:44,073 --> 00:41:49,676
I really want to improve my skills in 3D, you can, because there's so many tutorials and so

692
00:41:49,696 --> 00:41:54,599
many resources and Blender is free and Unity is free. Like, there's so many things you can do to

693
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:59,983
just learn. I think a lot of it is just committing to putting the time into doing that, you know? And

694
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:05,368
I don't know, I think a big thing too, and this is like, this might sound kind of out

695
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:11,875
of left field, but I think a thing that's really helped me is finding hobbies and interests

696
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:14,477
that are not related to games and art.

697
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,581
Sorry, I'm laughing at my cat.

698
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:18,281
No, it's great.

699
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:18,542
I love it.

700
00:42:20,143 --> 00:42:21,184
I don't even notice anymore.

701
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:23,247
There's a whole drama going on back there.

702
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:28,210
It's because I'm sitting at a microphone and not paying attention to them.

703
00:42:28,271 --> 00:42:29,873
So they're like, we got to cause trouble.

704
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:33,979
Jesus.

705
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:39,448
Yeah, I think getting into hobbies.

706
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:44,864
can really like things that are not related to games, right?

707
00:42:44,884 --> 00:42:47,166
And this is what I talked about earlier about getting

708
00:42:47,186 --> 00:42:49,387
into the office every day and looking through art blogs

709
00:42:49,427 --> 00:42:51,309
and architecture blogs and giving you

710
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:53,851
ideas of things that are outside of games is a really good idea.

711
00:42:54,191 --> 00:42:56,773
But I think also your personal hobbies and interests,

712
00:42:57,073 --> 00:42:59,715
it helps a lot when they're not connected to games.

713
00:42:59,735 --> 00:43:01,797
Because I think if you're a person who is only

714
00:43:01,837 --> 00:43:04,018
interested in video games, it really

715
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:06,800
narrows what your...

716
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:11,417
what your kind of like creative capabilities are, right? If you're only

717
00:43:11,477 --> 00:43:15,099
ever looking at what games are doing, you're not seeing what like, animation

718
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,962
or film or comics are doing. And so I think just like, having interests that

719
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:22,584
are not games is really important. And that can be anything that can be sports.

720
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:26,307
It doesn't have to be visual, it doesn't have to be like writing related or

721
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:29,749
whatever you do, it could just be like, you know, it could be pottery, it could

722
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:30,990
be woodworking, it could be

723
00:43:31,631 --> 00:43:38,495
Going for runs just anything that is outside will ultimately like let you have that creative freedom to just like

724
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:44,278
Do something that is different and also I think probably give you the headspace that you need to kind of get away from work

725
00:43:44,479 --> 00:43:46,520
You know, right when you're not thinking about work

726
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,642
It's kind of a rest like resting your muscles that you can get back to work and really yeah

727
00:43:51,303 --> 00:43:55,224
I mean, that's what you said, you said that scent would sound out of left field, but,

728
00:43:55,324 --> 00:44:00,867
you know, I, I hear game developers, mostly the ones who make really interesting stuff,

729
00:44:01,507 --> 00:44:06,049
say the same thing, but you know, there, there was definitely a time where, you

730
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:09,410
know, everything is like military shooter type thing.

731
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,891
And it's like, okay, this game was definitely made by a gamer, you know?

732
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:19,074
And it's kind of like, after a few decades, um, people kind of want something.

733
00:44:19,979 --> 00:44:26,782
new, you know. So I think that's totally great. Such as, like, if we can get back to Mortician's

734
00:44:26,802 --> 00:44:33,066
Tale, because we're kind of winding down here, but I want to talk about that real quick. And

735
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:41,570
why is it that we talk about interests outside of games, death positivity and commentary on that.

736
00:44:42,531 --> 00:44:46,033
It's not exactly, you know, you know, Halo.

737
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:50,575
But where did that come from?

738
00:44:50,615 --> 00:44:53,978
And why is death positivity important to you?

739
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:56,839
And what's the death thing with Gabby?

740
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,142
So for anyone who doesn't know what that is,

741
00:45:01,162 --> 00:45:05,905
death positivity is basically similar to sex positivity,

742
00:45:05,965 --> 00:45:06,345
I guess.

743
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:08,907
The idea that if we talk about a taboo thing,

744
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:10,107
it makes it less taboo.

745
00:45:10,648 --> 00:45:11,908
And when we make things less taboo,

746
00:45:11,928 --> 00:45:14,830
we're able to have really open and honest conversations

747
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,571
about those things.

748
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:16,831
So yeah.

749
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:23,955
For me, death positivity is really important because it allows you to kind of like be more

750
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:29,177
aware of what is going on in that industry and what's going to happen to us and our loved ones

751
00:45:29,197 --> 00:45:35,300
when we die. And that sounds really like super goth and very sad. But for me, the importance

752
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,162
of it is when you are able to kind of be open to talking about that kind of stuff,

753
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:41,823
you can make really important decisions for yourself and for others.

754
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:46,347
And that's always been, not always, but a thing I've been really interested in for a long time.

755
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:52,852
And I have a few friends who are morticians, which is hilarious that I just kind of draw

756
00:45:52,892 --> 00:45:55,394
that crowd. I don't know. I have no idea. I'm not a goth, but...

757
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,460
I was gonna say, you don't seem goth, the stereotypical goth.

758
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,581
No, not at all. I think I'm just like, deep down inside, maybe there's something about me that...

759
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:07,603
But I think this has been a thing I've always been interested in. And I think just

760
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:13,884
their jobs are so fascinating and so beautiful. A lot of their work has nothing to do with, you

761
00:46:13,924 --> 00:46:18,826
know, the taking care of dead bodies. It's also about supporting people and having empathy for

762
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:19,426
people and...

763
00:46:20,226 --> 00:46:26,689
And I just think that's a really, really fascinating thing, and that's kind of what got me interested

764
00:46:26,709 --> 00:46:30,531
in the subject matter, and what kind of inspired me to make this game about it.

765
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:36,774
But also, you know, I had a podcast for a little while about death in video games, kind

766
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,235
of my two worlds colliding.

767
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:45,000
And also a big reason why I wanted to work for Drinkbox is because their games are so death positive, right?

768
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:48,584
Like Guacamelee! is such a beautiful, beautiful game.

769
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:52,027
And Severed is one of my favorite games ever.

770
00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:57,031
It really subverts the expectations of what it means to kind of collect things.

771
00:46:57,091 --> 00:46:59,333
And I don't know, it's just like...

772
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:01,526
Yeah.

773
00:47:01,547 --> 00:47:03,909
What did you notice about death, like in video games,

774
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:05,831
and how, like, give us a little, like,

775
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:09,335
taste of what we would hear on your podcast about death

776
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,116
in video games.

777
00:47:10,136 --> 00:47:12,258
Because I'm interested, like, there's,

778
00:47:12,298 --> 00:47:13,700
I'm sure there's, you've probably

779
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,961
found a lot of stuff to say about it.

780
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:16,323
There's a lot of death in video games.

781
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:41,915
There sure is. And I think a lot of it too, I don't really have anything all that profound to say about it. But a lot of it is, you can really tell when someone has experienced a loss in their life, or whose culture is a lot more open to talking about death and loss and grief. Because when I interview someone like I did, like a long time ago, before I was working at Drinkbox, I interviewed Kousho Kiyono, again, who's the

782
00:47:43,316 --> 00:47:49,179
the concept lead at Drinkbox. And he talked about Guacamelee and Mexican culture and folklore

783
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,301
as a person who's from Mexico. And you can really tell that this is a subject matter that he's

784
00:47:53,341 --> 00:47:59,084
comfortable with. And a lot of the people I talk to my podcast, you know, the team behind Edith

785
00:47:59,184 --> 00:48:04,607
Finch, like very, obviously very, very, very comfortable with talking about it. And you can

786
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,488
really see that in their games.

787
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:09,909
is they don't shy away from it, they're really open,

788
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:12,650
death is often very beautifully showcased.

789
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,370
Whereas there's been a few developers, and I won't say who they are,

790
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,551
but when I talk to them about death, it's very clearly like,

791
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:22,072
ah yes, it is a thing that happens, and we've put it in our game

792
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:24,972
mechanically for these reasons. They very clearly don't have

793
00:48:24,992 --> 00:48:28,333
that experience, and maybe don't have that comfort

794
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:30,934
with the subject matter. And that's fascinating to me.

795
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:33,994
And I'll never call them out on it, because it's totally understandable to feel that way.

796
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:34,675
Especially like...

797
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:37,916
in Western culture, we're really, really quiet about that kind of stuff.

798
00:48:38,096 --> 00:48:41,818
And we don't talk about it as much. But it's so fascinating to see, you know,

799
00:48:42,098 --> 00:48:47,320
like the personal stuff behind each game. And you know, like, I would love to, and I don't do the

800
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:52,702
podcast anymore. But I really wanted to talk to the Outer Wilds team, because that game is like,

801
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:56,604
they do such cool things with death, right? And I really want to like,

802
00:48:56,624 --> 00:49:00,686
just speak with them about it and their experiences with it. Because I get the

803
00:49:00,746 --> 00:49:03,527
impression that at least one person on that team has some really

804
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:08,529
like you know have some experience with that and that's really fascinating to me so time to

805
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:15,553
relaunch the podcast yeah i'll listen to it coincidentally and uh you know not to totally

806
00:49:15,613 --> 00:49:20,856
get off of video games here but like coincidentally this morning i was listening to uh i think it was

807
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:27,319
like this american life and it was about uh the whole episode was about digging and like what

808
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,900
you know you can you know find digging

809
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:34,543
And one of the segments was about how,

810
00:49:34,783 --> 00:49:37,324
and I didn't know this, maybe everyone knows this but me,

811
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:40,326
but in Greece they run out of land to bury people

812
00:49:40,786 --> 00:49:42,807
and they don't really cremate much out there.

813
00:49:43,308 --> 00:49:45,489
So after like three years or so,

814
00:49:46,009 --> 00:49:48,310
the family comes and they exhume the bodies.

815
00:49:50,952 --> 00:49:58,035
their relative and it followed, I think that she worked, like she works at NPR or something,

816
00:49:58,435 --> 00:50:05,098
but she went back to Greece to meet her father who was digging his mom up, so her grandma.

817
00:50:05,658 --> 00:50:09,560
So by the time they get there, the dad is just kind of like,

818
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,281
kind of freaking out understandably.

819
00:50:12,461 --> 00:50:12,782
Yeah.

820
00:50:13,062 --> 00:50:14,882
And saying stuff like,

821
00:50:14,963 --> 00:50:16,363
I hope that, you know,

822
00:50:16,743 --> 00:50:19,184
mom is totally decomposed by the time we,

823
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:21,465
by the time we dig her up.

824
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:22,926
And then they do,

825
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,287
and then there's a very specific process

826
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:28,449
of how they dig the people up,

827
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:31,410
like from the head to the toe.

828
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:32,691
Fascinating.

829
00:50:32,911 --> 00:50:33,171
Yeah.

830
00:50:33,491 --> 00:50:37,694
Yep, and then they just like take the skull out and then they put them in boxes.

831
00:50:38,114 --> 00:50:43,178
When they die, they wear socks so that they know that they got to the end of the body.

832
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:44,960
Oh, interesting.

833
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:52,325
Yeah, and then they put them, clean up, put in boxes like so the guy's mom is in back in the

834
00:50:52,725 --> 00:51:00,771
in the shed and in boxes that were blessed, you know, and then that's how they handle death.

835
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:14,078
I mean, and at the end of it, it was really cool because he was very nervous and kind of afraid of what what's going to be like, but their whole family felt more at peace.

836
00:51:14,759 --> 00:51:16,019
Yeah, understandable.

837
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,981
Yeah. After going through that process.

838
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:19,681
So, hmm.

839
00:51:20,134 --> 00:51:23,656
That's really beautiful. And I, there's so many different ways

840
00:51:23,676 --> 00:51:27,199
that different cultures handle it that are just so just so

841
00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:30,101
beautiful and so hands on. And I really wish that was a big part

842
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:35,365
of Mortician's Tale, which is, it's very Western focused, you

843
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:38,108
know, you you make what you know, and all of us are based

844
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,790
here in Toronto, Canada. So we just kind of went off of what

845
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,171
the Western death process is.

846
00:51:42,871 --> 00:51:44,772
And so Mortician's Tale is very much about that,

847
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:48,875
like how, you know, cold and there's just like no interaction

848
00:51:48,895 --> 00:51:51,537
between us and our dead and that's, you know,

849
00:51:51,577 --> 00:51:53,298
and hearing stories like that is really,

850
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:54,359
I'm a little bit envious.

851
00:51:54,399 --> 00:51:57,161
Like I wish that we had experiences like that

852
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,142
and were able to kind of take care of our own

853
00:51:59,222 --> 00:52:01,023
and that's really cool.

854
00:52:01,124 --> 00:52:01,704
That's really neat.

855
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:03,345
Alex, I want you to dig out my body.

856
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:05,587
After three years.

857
00:52:05,607 --> 00:52:06,367
Say what's on the record?

858
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:11,940
Yeah, yeah. Keep me in the, uh, in your shed if you have one by then.

859
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,441
If not, I'll take the, uh, the kitchen or something.

860
00:52:14,621 --> 00:52:15,222
Yeah, beautiful.

861
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:21,255
Absolutely. Okay, on that note, I think, thanks so much for joining us. This has

862
00:52:21,295 --> 00:52:27,120
been completely fascinating. I'm glad that we got an artist on here too, you

863
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:32,005
know, and just talking about the process and creativity and I think that a lot of

864
00:52:32,045 --> 00:52:36,469
people think that, you know, you just go to your desk at drink box and start

865
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:37,851
doodling until something good comes out.

866
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:42,292
Yeah, yeah. Probably not how it works. We found out that's not how it works. Not always, yeah.

867
00:52:42,332 --> 00:52:47,754
Yeah, not always. So, uh, yeah. Thanks again for having me and also my cats on your podcast. Yeah,

868
00:52:47,774 --> 00:52:52,376
I do feel like we should ask for their names for crediting purposes. Oh, um, one of them's named

869
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:58,218
Bastion after, you know, the Overwatch character, and one of them's Meredith, and I could go on for

870
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:02,100
hours with my cats, so maybe I should leave. That's the next podcast. Yeah, well, we'll make

871
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:07,121
sure to give them a proper credit there. So, thanks again, and best of luck with everything.

872
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:07,849
Thank you.

873
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:20,540
Yeah, have a good one.

874
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:28,227
And we're back.

875
00:53:28,287 --> 00:53:29,769
What do you think of that, Alex?

876
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:31,650
I think that was pretty great.

877
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,422
I can't believe that you agreed to exhume my body.

878
00:53:36,442 --> 00:53:37,763
Hey man, that's what I'm here for.

879
00:53:37,783 --> 00:53:43,268
That's what being colleagues at GDC means.

880
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:45,309
It means ride or die.

881
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:49,352
Ride, die, and dig.

882
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,593
That's what it is.

883
00:53:51,114 --> 00:53:53,035
We call it the old RDD.

884
00:53:53,095 --> 00:53:56,238
Man, we just talked about so much death, and I've been playing so much Death Stranding,

885
00:53:56,638 --> 00:53:59,320
and it just is on a whole nother level.

886
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:01,482
It's like really not even...

887
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:03,782
relevant to the conversation of

888
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:07,163
Meaningful death rights, but I don't know

889
00:54:08,263 --> 00:54:13,545
How much death is in actually in Death Stranding? I mean you 3d print roads out of death. So there's like a lot of it

890
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:16,086
big crisscross America

891
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:24,229
Do you consider that death positive? I think it really is a very death positive game. I don't know if it really

892
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:31,793
Don't know what it's trying to say about death. It's not as good as morticians tail. It's too high concept for me

893
00:54:33,013 --> 00:54:34,393
Yeah, morticians tail kind of guy

894
00:54:35,414 --> 00:54:38,315
Now Kojima he was like pretty

895
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:41,335
like Metal Gear Solid 3

896
00:54:41,996 --> 00:54:47,897
Was three right you walk down the the stream and then you see all the ghosts of the soldiers. Oh, yeah the sorrow. Yeah

897
00:54:48,857 --> 00:54:52,558
Yeah, I mean you actually you actually addressed like all the death

898
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:53,879
that you

899
00:54:54,932 --> 00:55:01,935
you know, made happen. Yeah. Yeah, he did. But also if you happen to have killed one

900
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:06,477
of those poor souls by shooting them in like a really private place, they would have like

901
00:55:06,517 --> 00:55:11,119
a really silly animation when they were walking down that really somber river. So it's hard

902
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,520
to take it terribly seriously. Hey, just being real. That's just video games, I guess.

903
00:55:16,674 --> 00:55:19,235
Yeah, it absolutely is video games.

904
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:24,498
Anyway, Gabby, great, great guest.

905
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:25,879
Uh, her cats.

906
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:28,501
Yeah, also phenomenal guests.

907
00:55:28,681 --> 00:55:29,561
Top 10 for sure.

908
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:32,223
At least, I would say at least as good as Gabby was.

909
00:55:32,523 --> 00:55:32,703
Um...

910
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,242
I don't know. That's tough. That's tough. Better than me.

911
00:55:36,322 --> 00:55:41,606
I would have, I would have, I would have placed Gabby a lot further up the scale

912
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:46,991
compared to her cats. If it weren't for that, uh, little, uh, fight that they got

913
00:55:47,031 --> 00:55:49,713
into that really sold the drama for me.

914
00:55:49,753 --> 00:55:52,776
Yeah. I was going to say that was the high point of my podcast, but, uh, you're

915
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,077
right. I'll take that into consideration.

916
00:55:55,698 --> 00:55:57,159
How do you, how do you title these?

917
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,601
Is it, do we have to like come up with a fun catchphrase?

918
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:01,082
They're going to be like a fun kick somewhere.

919
00:56:01,423 --> 00:56:02,504
Well, we'll find, we'll find out.

920
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,901
Yeah, we'll surprise people.

921
00:56:04,942 --> 00:56:06,242
I guess that they'll know by now probably.

922
00:56:06,323 --> 00:56:06,963
Oh, I guess they would.

923
00:56:06,983 --> 00:56:08,444
Uh, what, what we title the podcast?

924
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:09,205
What would they tell us?

925
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:10,546
Yeah.

926
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:11,766
What were the cat's names again?

927
00:56:11,887 --> 00:56:13,468
Yo Gabby Gabby was my favorite.

928
00:56:14,408 --> 00:56:15,309
That's probably too much though.

929
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:16,870
No.

930
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:23,323
Anyway, let's talk about something real quick before we go.

931
00:56:23,523 --> 00:56:28,204
GDC did release, we mentioned it during the podcast, that the Earth...

932
00:56:28,444 --> 00:56:29,405
This is still the podcast.

933
00:56:29,425 --> 00:56:29,725
Yeah.

934
00:56:30,065 --> 00:56:30,985
Earlier in the podcast.

935
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:34,466
Yeah, I didn't want to draw focus away, but yeah, the State of the Industry report is out,

936
00:56:35,406 --> 00:56:36,526
and it is real hot.

937
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:41,907
We have tons and tons of exclusive data that you are going to want to check out.

938
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:44,728
If you go to gdconf.com, there's a bunch of stuff.

939
00:56:44,748 --> 00:56:46,408
I think we recently just highlighted the fact that there...

940
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:53,423
was a lot of conversation in this year's survey about sort of like new stuff, like especially

941
00:56:53,523 --> 00:56:58,886
subscription services and the Epic Games Store and that kind of stuff. And we got a lot of

942
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:05,250
interesting feedback from the devs and other professionals we surveyed. I think we ran this

943
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:11,433
little story today. Check it out if you have time. It's all about how when we asked, I think it's

944
00:57:11,453 --> 00:57:14,195
like nearly 4000 people we survey every year for this.

945
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:19,430
And we asked him, like, how do you feel about subscription services?

946
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:20,430
You know, let's talk about it.

947
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,953
Like Xbox Game Pass, like your Apple Arcade, that kind of stuff.

948
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,935
Like, is it going to devalue individual games?

949
00:57:27,255 --> 00:57:30,637
And what we got back was really interesting and mixed.

950
00:57:30,677 --> 00:57:32,038
It was not a strong yes or no.

951
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:34,500
It was a lot of confusion and a lot of like.

952
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:39,322
um, concern from our, uh, survey respondents.

953
00:57:39,402 --> 00:57:40,222
And it's really interesting.

954
00:57:40,262 --> 00:57:41,343
So you should go out and get the report.

955
00:57:41,403 --> 00:57:43,645
It's, uh, it's available right now for free.

956
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:45,106
So, uh, go download it.

957
00:57:46,347 --> 00:57:46,988
It's on Alex.

958
00:57:47,008 --> 00:57:48,649
Yeah.

959
00:57:48,749 --> 00:57:49,209
It's free.

960
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:51,611
It's subs on me as many copies as you want.

961
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:54,693
Oh, okay.

962
00:57:54,894 --> 00:57:55,314
That's great.

963
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:55,554
Yeah.

964
00:57:55,874 --> 00:57:59,237
I highly, uh, highly recommend checking that out.

965
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:02,680
Uh, GDC state of the industry survey.

966
00:58:03,223 --> 00:58:04,785
How do you feel about game subscription services, Chris?

967
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:05,885
Are you still on Apple arcade?

968
00:58:07,647 --> 00:58:11,329
Um, are they, are they sponsoring this podcast?

969
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:12,670
Okay.

970
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:17,514
Then no, actually I actually canceled it, but I'm trying to be better with my budget.

971
00:58:18,514 --> 00:58:21,797
Um, but I'm probably gonna re up it at some point.

972
00:58:21,977 --> 00:58:27,921
I am a, uh, an Xbox live game, games, pass game pass.

973
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:28,982
Oh, you got a games pass.

974
00:58:30,003 --> 00:58:37,830
I do. With the PC. With the PC. Yeah. So I am just drowning in video games.

975
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:44,036
This is one thing with subscriptions is that there's, you get so many games and it's the

976
00:58:44,076 --> 00:58:49,882
same thing with my like Kindle Unlimited. You're just, you have so many choices that you just end up

977
00:58:51,046 --> 00:58:55,888
not playing games or not, not reading anything. I mean, I eventually play

978
00:58:55,928 --> 00:59:01,070
something, but it's about like three seconds of a game. And then I close the

979
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:05,051
game, open another one, play that. That's not really hitting the spot. Close that

980
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:08,973
open another one. Yeah. Until do that 10 more times. And then you just open up

981
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:12,754
Netflix and watch it all over again. Millions time.

982
00:59:13,335 --> 00:59:15,676
Yeah, see, this is the problem with smorgasbord. It's like not to take it

983
00:59:15,716 --> 00:59:19,057
back. But like you have all these options on front of you have like an

984
00:59:19,117 --> 00:59:19,597
array.

985
00:59:20,312 --> 00:59:24,074
of just mouthwatering choices, and you just can't take any of them.

986
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:26,056
You just got to take a couple nibbles and leave.

987
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:29,978
What is on a real Swedish smorgasbord?

988
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:31,498
Yeah, this is how we stay in such good shape,

989
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:35,741
is we have these just tables full of mouthwatering dried fish and flatbreads,

990
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:40,343
and we just, we can't pick, we can't, can't eat any of them.

991
00:59:40,363 --> 00:59:40,964
Seems salty.

992
00:59:40,984 --> 00:59:41,184
Yeah.

993
00:59:41,204 --> 00:59:43,685
Is that, can't be that good for you.

994
00:59:43,985 --> 00:59:45,586
I mean, you know, you look fit.

995
00:59:45,606 --> 00:59:45,706
Yeah.

996
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:47,647
But how healthy are you at?

997
00:59:47,687 --> 00:59:47,887
Yeah.

998
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:50,609
It's, I mean, it's, it's all a sodium that that's literally, that's all.

999
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:51,349
It keeps me alive.

1000
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,671
Death positivity.

1001
00:59:55,291 --> 01:00:02,354
You are preserved by all of the, you're just mummified by all of the

1002
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:05,396
salted fish that you've been eating.

1003
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:07,097
I wonder if anyone's still listening to this anymore.

1004
01:00:07,117 --> 01:00:10,298
Who can say, I had the opposite problem with you, which is where I am not

1005
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:14,260
watching my budget and I'm still on all these services because I only play.

1006
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:18,503
one to two video games a year and that is a problem like

1007
01:00:18,523 --> 01:00:23,127
When you talk about games like you say that you say you only play one or two video games a year

1008
01:00:23,627 --> 01:00:27,730
But you play a ton of video. Okay, but so far this year. I've only played one or two video games

1009
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:36,597

1016
01:01:01,419 --> 01:01:03,922
I don't know, I'm afraid of YouTube commenters,

1017
01:01:04,503 --> 01:01:07,987
