1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:10,456
So welcome. So all week at GDC you've all been, those of you in industry, have been leveling up

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,199
your career. But if you're at this session, it might have occurred to you that there's this

3
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:20,244
whole other career track in academia. Maybe you're wondering if you might want to crossover.

4
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:26,214
Maybe you're thinking it sounds nice to never have to crunch to meet arbitrary publisher deadlines again.

5
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:31,375
You get to mentor a bunch of bright, eager young developers who are like younger versions of you.

6
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:37,017
They all love games and they just want to be in your class and they look up to you like a god

7
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:40,078
because you've got industry experience and that's where they want to be.

8
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,642
you get summers off, and you get so you can make games,

9
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:46,503
and not just games for profit motive,

10
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:49,666
but just wonderful games that come from your heart,

11
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:51,607
something along those lines maybe.

12
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:55,370
And if your mental image is something like that,

13
00:00:56,291 --> 00:01:00,895
then you have about as good an idea

14
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,576
of what it's really like in academia

15
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:06,159
that then grandma's boy has to the actual game industry.

16
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:09,467
Don't worry though, we've got half an hour here.

17
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:11,089
So let's cover some reality.

18
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,633
So first and most important thing is that saying

19
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:17,997
you're a faculty is like saying I'm a game developer.

20
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:19,839
There are many different kinds

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,641
and they all work differently.

22
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:24,519
First is the adjunct.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,161
Pay is generally low.

24
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,483
It's temporary, not full time.

25
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:32,025
You have little or no institutional power.

26
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,646
It's a thankless job.

27
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:36,068
You're treated like you're easily replaceable.

28
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:38,590
You have no job security past the courses

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,411
that you're teaching now.

30
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:42,173
But a lot of people use it as an entry point,

31
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:45,576
either to test the waters or gain some teaching experience

32
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:46,136
and a foothold.

33
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:50,519
On the bright side, it does tend to require minimal credentials.

34
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,800
If you have industry experience, that's a plus.

35
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:55,782
You usually don't need to have an advanced degree or anything

36
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:56,223
like that.

37
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:59,365
So it's basically the academic equivalent of QA.

38
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,809
Visiting professors are like outside contractors.

39
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,851
It's a full-time gig for a fixed period, usually one year.

40
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:15,111
one academic year. And like a contractor you have all the responsibility of

41
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:18,594
getting your work done but none of the institutional authority since you're the

42
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:19,154
outsider.

43
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:24,098
There's one important difference between visiting professors and outside

44
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:25,700
contractors in the game industry though.

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,301
In the game industry

46
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:32,545
outside contractors tend to make more money as base salary because

47
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:36,356
Yeah, you have to, because they don't get benefits,

48
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,798
because they have these dry spells in between

49
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:39,959
that they have to cover for,

50
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,322
and so it's understood that you pay a premium on that

51
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:45,484
to cover their extra costs.

52
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,707
Academics are less nice about this.

53
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:52,331
So usually it's more like visiting professors

54
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:54,312
make about half of what a full-time,

55
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:56,294
a permanent faculty does.

56
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:58,897
But usually do get benefits.

57
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:03,115
Sometimes as a visiting professor, you can make the case to renew your contract,

58
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:08,345
but usually if you like the place, um, that you're at, um,

59
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:13,478
You'd instead be trying to make the case to convert to permanent faculty from there.

60
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:18,502
And that's about as easy as being a freelancer and converting to full-time at a company you're

61
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:18,962
working for.

62
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:20,223
It usually doesn't happen.

63
00:03:20,603 --> 00:03:22,965
And if it does, it's kind of a trial by fire thing.

64
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:28,169
Some visiting professors require an advanced degree and they're basically the school's

65
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:30,070
way of saying, well, we like you.

66
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,353
We'd like to have you teaching here, but not enough to actually pay you what you're worth

67
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:35,514
or be a permanent employee.

68
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:37,015
We just want to try before we buy.

69
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:43,388
Other visiting professors are a way for schools to bring in someone that doesn't have the academic credentials

70
00:03:43,748 --> 00:03:50,257
without getting their kneecaps broken by their accreditation boards because hey, they're they're not permanent. They're they're just here for a limited time

71
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:51,279
Don't worry about it

72
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:55,504
And while you're there, they'll try and milk everything they can out of you to help boost their program

73
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:01,948
Next position goes by two names, professor of practice or

74
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:04,789
designer or something in residence, like designer in

75
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,811
residence, artist in residence, something like that.

76
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:10,313
There are some arcane nitpicky differences between professor

77
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,895
of practice and resident, but they mostly work the same way,

78
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:16,517
which is full time with a split between teaching and

79
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,379
actually making stuff, in our case, making games.

80
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,401
These positions are specifically for people with

81
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,782
field experience, so they typically have lower

82
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:26,283
requirements for academic credentials.

83
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:31,787
And there's a focus on actually making games in addition to teaching them.

84
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:33,848
So it's a lot of a practice what you preach type thing.

85
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:37,111
Naturally with so many upsides, you might be wondering,

86
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,772
ooh, that sounds awesome.

87
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:39,412
What's the catch?

88
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,855
The catch is that there's very few of these in existence.

89
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,277
The competition is very fierce, so you're not going to get one.

90
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,279
So this is basically the academic equivalent of entry level game designer

91
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,121
or concept artist or producer.

92
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:55,004
A few of them do exist.

93
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:56,126
Not very many.

94
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:56,868
Don't count on it.

95
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,502
Then there's the lecturer position.

96
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:07,644
This is a full-time position with an emphasis on teaching,

97
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:10,665
lots and lots of classes, and almost nothing else.

98
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,446
So this is for people who just want to teach

99
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:14,587
and then teach some more.

100
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,548
Usually, lecturers are not permanent.

101
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:20,209
Instead, they're on a fixed-term contract,

102
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:23,230
sometimes one year, sometimes two or three years,

103
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:25,671
but you can usually renew indefinitely.

104
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:26,872
So when your contract is up,

105
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:29,773
you can try and just keep it going and roll it over.

106
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:32,716
These vary a bit in terms of course load.

107
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:35,799
I've talked to some people who teach as few as four courses

108
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,101
per term, others that have taught as much as seven.

109
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:41,184
And just so you understand the math,

110
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:43,246
when you're talking number of courses,

111
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:46,168
a typical course, you're talking about

112
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:47,750
10 hours of work per week.

113
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,932
That's just to, that includes actually lecturing the course,

114
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,533
you know, or teaching it.

115
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:57,094
Usually that's just like maybe two or three hours.

116
00:05:57,694 --> 00:06:01,076
But then you have grading, you have office hours,

117
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:02,636
all these other things.

118
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,857
So it all adds up to about 10 hours a week.

119
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:07,738
If it's a course you haven't taught before,

120
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,620
add another 10 hours a week of course development.

121
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:13,995
And I see some of you doing the math in your heads.

122
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:16,497
And yes, if you start with four classes a semester

123
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:17,618
and you've never taught before,

124
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,000
that means you're gonna be having flashbacks

125
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,762
to your most recent death march in industry.

126
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:24,584
So at a lot of schools,

127
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:27,426
lecturers also have very little institutional power.

128
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:29,848
So when it comes to things like important meetings

129
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,150
about deciding the strategy for the department,

130
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,471
they tend to be forgotten

131
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:35,593
and they're mostly invisible to administrators.

132
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:37,415
So lecturers are kind of like

133
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:39,056
the academic equivalent of game audio.

134
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,190
That said, like audio, it is still full-time.

135
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,411
You still get benefits.

136
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:47,853
You still make a living wage.

137
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:50,375
And in some schools, there is an opportunity

138
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:53,379
for promotion to senior lecturer and principal lecturer

139
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,059
and things like that.

140
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,881
Some schools do that, some don't.

141
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:56,782
You would have to ask.

142
00:06:57,903 --> 00:07:01,084
And most schools are willing to substitute field experience

143
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:03,746
and teaching experience for advanced degrees here

144
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:04,626
for their lecturers.

145
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,847
So you don't usually need a master's or PhD

146
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,008
if all you're doing is teaching and no research.

147
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,749
Though if you have an advanced degree,

148
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,150
it does help if you have one.

149
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,691
The downside is that lecturers are also rare

150
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,512
and they're becoming more and more rare,

151
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,653
they're disappearing because schools have figured out

152
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:22,193
that if they just wanna bring in someone

153
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,054
to teach their classes,

154
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:25,275
it's cheaper to get the adjuncts to do it.

155
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:31,985
At the top of the pyramid, there's this thing called tenure track faculty.

156
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,226
And that's what most people think of when they think of a college professor.

157
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:41,528
And this varies internationally, but in the US, the way this works is you're

158
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,709
what's called pre-tenure for a period of six years.

159
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,850
And I always thought that was odd.

160
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,711
Like, you know, it's called tenure.

161
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:52,112
You'd think it would take 10 years, but it really takes six.

162
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:57,116
And you have one checkpoint halfway through to find out whether you're on track.

163
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:02,702
Some schools just use that as a way to give you feedback of how you're doing and what

164
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:03,903
your strong and weak points are.

165
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:07,747
Others actually use it as a checkpoint where they can just eliminate you if you're not

166
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:08,488
making the cut at three.

167
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:08,728
It depends.

168
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:09,028
So, that's it.

169
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:09,268
Thank you.

170
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:09,469
Thank you.

171
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:09,689
Thank you.

172
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:09,889
Thank you.

173
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:10,089
Thank you.

174
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:10,289
Thank you.

175
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,490
Thank you.

176
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:10,690
Thank you.

177
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,890
Thank you.

178
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,090
Thank you.

179
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,290
Thank you.

180
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:15,197
And when the clock runs out at the end of six years,

181
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,661
then there's basically this all or nothing.

182
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:21,006
Thumbs up, you're promoted, you now have tenure,

183
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:23,189
which means you pretty much have to kill someone

184
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:24,531
to ever get fired or laid off.

185
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,733
You have a job for life here.

186
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,156
Or you're fired GTFO.

187
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:32,072
Now this sounds like a lot of pressure, and it is.

188
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:36,654
If you talk to junior faculty in most fields, they'll act like this is the worst thing ever.

189
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:41,416
But we come from the game industry, and where can you go in the game industry where you'd

190
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:43,256
get a guaranteed job for six whole years?

191
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,338
I think that's a pretty sweet deal.

192
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:50,039
Now that is what I am, so maybe you can see my bias here.

193
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,867
That's kind of where the action is.

194
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,669
Now it's worth mentioning some terminology here

195
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,331
because it's different from the game industry.

196
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:01,774
In academia, if you're tenure track but not yet tenured,

197
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:04,377
your job title is assistant professor.

198
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:07,059
That doesn't mean you're assisting anyone.

199
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:08,601
I don't know why they call it that,

200
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:09,702
but that's what they call it.

201
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:15,487
If you get tenure, then your job title changes to Associate Professor.

202
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:19,331
Now in the game industry, we use the term associate to mean entry level,

203
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:24,957
but in academia, it means you're finally one of the people we've actually chosen to associate ourselves with.

204
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:25,758
So it's a good thing.

205
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:29,639
And after you reach the associate level, later on, at

206
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:34,541
some point, you can request a try for a promotion to what's

207
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:35,641
called a full professor.

208
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,802
And then your job title gets shortened to just professor.

209
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:42,163
So in the game industry, going from associate game designer

210
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:45,264
to just game designer is entry to mid-level.

211
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:48,905
In academia, that's going from mid to senior level.

212
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,823
Now if tenure track sounds sweet, there is a downside.

213
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:56,165
And that is that this is where you usually require at least a

214
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,946
master's degree just to apply.

215
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,227
Sometimes it's PhD or go home.

216
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,009
And sometimes they ask for what's called a terminal

217
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:03,389
degree.

218
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,371
Now terminal does not mean it's a malignant degree that

219
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:08,552
kills you, although it feels like it sometimes when you're

220
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:09,052
going through it.

221
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:12,496
It just means the highest degree that's offered in your field.

222
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:16,380
So that does include PhD, but it can also include things like MFA,

223
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,144
Master of Fine Arts, if you're in the arts, MBA for business,

224
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:24,769
or professional degrees like an MD for doctors or a JD for lawyers.

225
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:27,792
There's no higher degree you can get for those things,

226
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:29,654
so those count as terminal degrees.

227
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:35,107
There's also another position you might hear about from time to time called postdoc, but

228
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,149
unless you already have a PhD, this is not relevant to you.

229
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:42,811
Basically in the old days, when you graduated with a PhD in a field, you'd either go work

230
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,113
for a company or you'd get a tenure-track faculty job.

231
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,194
But then schools started pumping out more PhDs they could absorb.

232
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:52,596
so they had to lengthen the pipeline so now there's this like Ponzi pyramid scheme thing

233
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:56,878
where you've got this kind of sort of position where we like you as a faculty but we're going

234
00:10:56,898 --> 00:11:01,099
to still treat you like a graduate student and then when you're done with your postdoc

235
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:04,760
then maybe you can apply for tenure track faculty positions or maybe we'll just ask

236
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,361
you to do another postdoc because we're jerks.

237
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,543
So you don't have to worry about that one but you might hear about it every now and

238
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:13,323
then that's what it means.

239
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:18,538
Now, if you ever meet someone who's a tenure track or tenured faculty and you want to really

240
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,598
annoy them, you can start by asking, oh, you're a faculty, what do you teach?

241
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,980
And the reason this is annoying is that teaching is definitely one of the things that faculty

242
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,301
do, but we usually do other things, too, specifically research and service.

243
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,682
And for some reason, academics are obsessed with furniture.

244
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:35,602
I'm not sure why.

245
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:38,363
But you hear this called a three-legged stool a lot.

246
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,303
So when we talk about teaching, that's not just running a class.

247
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:45,406
You do have to run the class.

248
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,648
But there's also other tasks that count as teaching,

249
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:51,233
like designing or pitching brand new courses for the curriculum, which

250
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,757
involves lots and lots of paperwork to describe exactly what you're going to do.

251
00:11:55,658 --> 00:12:00,102
Or taking an existing course and porting it to a new format, like we used to teach this in a classroom,

252
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:01,524
now we're teaching it online.

253
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,348
Or being on thesis committees for graduate students also counts.

254
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:11,254
And when you're being evaluated in your job, teaching is mostly judged by student course evals.

255
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:15,178
Those of you who have been to college remember filling those things out and thinking they're completely useless?

256
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:16,519
You know, those things.

257
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,385
Downside of teaching evals is we have a ton of research showing that they do not correlate at all with how good of a teacher you are.

258
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:26,566
But everyone uses them anyway.

259
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:30,369
And at least there are known ways to game the system, if you want.

260
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:35,452
Like inflating your grades to keep your students happy, or being male because there's a gender bias among students.

261
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:38,534
I wish I was kidding when I said that, but I'm really not.

262
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:42,437
And sometimes you also get peer review, if you're really lucky,

263
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:44,658
where another faculty will sit in on one of your lectures

264
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,660
for a few minutes and then try to extrapolate

265
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,681
to all of your teaching ever.

266
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:55,066
Now when we say research, this is a very broad topic.

267
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,448
Well, sometimes it's more broad than others depends on the school.

268
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:01,551
But generally what we mean is being a thought leader in your field.

269
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:06,235
So kind of like what you would do at a director level at a game studio,

270
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:09,457
except you're doing it for the entire industry and not just that one company.

271
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:13,701
It's the academic equivalent of the kinds of people in the industry who keynote at conferences,

272
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:18,846
give well-attended and high-rated talks at GDC, the kinds of people who have 10,000 followers

273
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:22,869
on Twitter and who have a dev blog that everyone in the industry follows, that kind of thing.

274
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:28,815
And research is usually judged by three buzzwords, so it's kind of like a recursive stool.

275
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,598
And the buzzwords are peer review, dissemination, and impact.

276
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,134
Peer review means we don't just take your word for it

277
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:37,154
that your work is awesome.

278
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,755
Other people in your field agree that your work is awesome

279
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:40,915
and they're willing to say so.

280
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:44,697
Dissemination means you don't just do really awesome stuff

281
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,798
but you also get it out there and tell people

282
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:47,678
so they can see it.

283
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:50,939
And impact means that you have some kind of measurable

284
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:52,219
effect on the field.

285
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,141
Like other people are actually referencing your work

286
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,121
and building off of it.

287
00:13:56,841 --> 00:13:58,382
So how many people here are game designers?

288
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:01,383
Okay, how many of you have read the MDA framework?

289
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,338
Right? Impact.

290
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,323
So schools vary in terms of what counts as research and what doesn't.

291
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:14,066
The traditional academic form of research is getting published in peer-reviewed academic journals,

292
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:18,869
and you typically want a high-quality journal that has a high rejection rate, because that's peer review,

293
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,591
wide viewership, because that's dissemination,

294
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,274
and you want your article to be cited a lot by other people, because that's impact.

295
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:29,357
Usually, you can count speaking at conferences as part of research.

296
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,120
Again, a high reject rate makes it more significant if you're speaking there.

297
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,284
You can also show impact by numbers of people who attended your talk, people who referenced

298
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:41,967
the talk later in their work, and also things like audience ratings at GDC or best talk

299
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:43,809
or best paper awards at other conferences.

300
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,153
Some conferences publish their proceedings in a journal, so you kind of get two for one.

301
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:51,495
You get a publication and a research, or and a conference speaking.

302
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:56,562
And writing textbooks can count as scholarship, and your success metric there, for once, is

303
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,064
actually the same as your publisher.

304
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:02,050
You want the book widely adopted in classes and industry with really high sales numbers.

305
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:07,533
Bringing in grants is something you might be judged on.

306
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,614
A grant means you're basically saying,

307
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:12,756
hey, I convinced other people to give me lots of money

308
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,098
to do my work, therefore I have value.

309
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,520
Realistically, if you're consistently bringing in

310
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,802
more money than your salary from the school,

311
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:23,584
then they're never going to fire you no matter what

312
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:25,605
because you're a net positive on their cash flow.

313
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,327
Also realistically, most of us who come from

314
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,548
the game industry are gonna have

315
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:31,109
a really hard time doing that.

316
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,927
Another way to disseminate your work is during exhibitions and festivals.

317
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:41,449
Having your game nominated for an award at IGF. Having your game accepted to a

318
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:45,451
festival like Indiecade or Boston Fig or different games or other game festivals.

319
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:49,493
This is particularly important for those of us who make games and that that is

320
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,175
our primary form of research or scholarship.

321
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:55,356
And those of you who would like to do research in the form of making games

322
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:58,758
should now be sufficiently terrified at how competitive these festivals are.

323
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:05,993
The last leg of our three-legged stool is service. And we use the word service in the same

324
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:11,900
meaning as community service or public service. This is the easy part. You can serve on

325
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,065
committees at your school, be a reviewer who green lights talks or papers for journals or

326
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:20,310
conferences, judging games for IGF or Indicade or other competitions.

327
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,692
doing academic advising for students,

328
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,073
being a faculty advisor for student clubs

329
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:26,974
or organizations like a game dev club,

330
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:30,076
organizing on-campus events like Global Game Jam

331
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,016
or other game jams,

332
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:34,178
doing, you can also do service outside of campus

333
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:36,119
but in the local community, that also counts.

334
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:39,341
So giving workshops in game design at local high schools

335
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:41,402
or a local scouts troop, something like that.

336
00:16:42,443 --> 00:16:44,024
You can also do service

337
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:46,285
in the game development community itself,

338
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:49,166
doing volunteer work for IGDA, for example.

339
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:52,298
Surface is easy, and it's a lot of fun.

340
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:53,939
It's also usually weighted much less

341
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,240
than in your job evaluation than teaching and research.

342
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,881
We usually call it a checkbox.

343
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,562
And there's not actually a physical checkbox

344
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:03,483
on the tenure form, but it's one of those things

345
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:05,885
where you just have to put in a few bullet points

346
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:09,146
that say, yes, I did the minimum amount of service.

347
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:14,657
Now as game developers, you might have had a lot of people ask you,

348
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:16,858
oh, you're in games, what's that like?

349
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,660
And of course the answer is, it depends.

350
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,642
Working at a AAA studio is different from working at a bedroom indie,

351
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:25,022
which is different from AAA,

352
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,864
and even within the same class, like working at Valve is a very different

353
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:30,905
experience from working at Blizzard, even though they're both AAA.

354
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:38,948
And this is true of schools too. Each school will have a different emphasis on how they value teaching versus research versus service.

355
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:41,909
Within each category, what kinds of things they look for.

356
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:45,110
Every school has a different culture and a different community.

357
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:51,753
And so, just like with game studios, everyone is different. You're not going to be happy at all of them.

358
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:55,395
because there is a certain fit for your skills,

359
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,476
for the types of things you want to do, for your culture.

360
00:17:57,937 --> 00:17:59,978
And so it's important to find places that are a good fit

361
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:02,199
for your personal desires and strengths.

362
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:08,143
So know what your desires are and what your strengths are

363
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:09,644
before you start applying for jobs.

364
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,306
And speaking of applying for jobs,

365
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:13,947
where do you find job postings?

366
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:15,668
If you've listened to this and you're like,

367
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,030
yeah, okay, I still would like to take a look at.

368
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:22,728
you know, academia, I'm not running away fleeing in terror.

369
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:24,749
You know, where do you find job postings?

370
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,429
Well, you know, there are a lot of places.

371
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:27,950
There are game academic mailing lists

372
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,830
like IGDA's game education SIG.

373
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,611
There are various Facebook groups.

374
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:34,011
Many of those are open to anyone who's interested,

375
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:35,552
even if they're not actively teaching

376
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,052
or doing faculty things.

377
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:40,453
New positions often get posted on these groups.

378
00:18:40,513 --> 00:18:42,474
That's actually the most common kind of post

379
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:43,234
on the ones that I'm on.

380
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:48,057
There are also job postings on Gamma Sutra and Game Career Guide, places like that.

381
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:53,161
Because if you're a school and you are hiring faculty, where are you going to think to put

382
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:56,884
your job postings? If you're looking for someone with industry experience, you're going to

383
00:18:56,904 --> 00:19:01,847
put it in places where people with industry experience will find it. So you can look for

384
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:06,371
jobs there. There's also, you're at GDC. There's a ton of schools in the Expo Hall and the

385
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:10,194
Career Center here. And you can just walk up and ask if they're hiring. Some of them,

386
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,916
that's the reason why they rented a booth in the first place.

387
00:19:13,996 --> 00:19:14,998
And hey, we're game developers.

388
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:17,180
We already live or die by our social networks.

389
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,804
So if you're in a position to go public with your desire

390
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,766
to cross over to academia, you can just

391
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:26,410
ask your hive mind of friends on Facebook and Twitter

392
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,574
and other social media, hey, thinking of teaching,

393
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:31,776
does anyone know any open academic positions?

394
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,599
You can do that, and you'll probably hear something back.

395
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:39,480
If you want to stay local to where you are, you can also just research the local schools.

396
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,243
Look around and see, you know, do they have a game dev program?

397
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:46,046
Well, if so, you can walk in and ask, you know, are you looking for extra people?

398
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:50,650
Or, sometimes you'll see, you can like look at their department and they'll be like,

399
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,074
they're kind of, sort of, want to do games, but they haven't really done it yet, like...

400
00:19:55,294 --> 00:20:00,576
They have a major in interactive entertainment and a couple classes that are like, you know,

401
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:06,119
interactive media, but you, you know, it's like, but they don't seem to have a game major

402
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,961
yet and you get the feeling that maybe it's because they really want to, but they haven't

403
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:12,422
found anyone who actually knows how to make games to teach it.

404
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:17,064
And so you can just walk in and cold call them and say like, hey, it looks like you're

405
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:19,745
doing some stuff with games or you want to, would you like some help with that?

406
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,407
Oh, and by the way, raise your hand if you're a game developer.

407
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,703
And raise your hand if you're an academic.

408
00:20:28,683 --> 00:20:32,125
So game developers, psst, those people with the hands up

409
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,186
for the academics, they already know

410
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:35,647
what it's like in academia.

411
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:37,568
They don't need to be at this conference,

412
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:40,790
or at this session, which means there's no reason

413
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,990
they should be in this room.

414
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,492
They're either here because they misread the description

415
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,033
or because they're hiring and want

416
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:47,233
to scout the room for talent.

417
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:50,935
So you're probably going to lunch

418
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:52,416
right after this session anyway.

419
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:54,357
Just ask them if they have lunch plans.

420
00:20:55,645 --> 00:21:00,288
Oh, and speaking of my employer, RIT is also hiring two full-time lecturer positions, one

421
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:03,490
for a visual artist and one for a graphics programmer, if you think it'd be cool to work

422
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,190
down the hall from me.

423
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:08,693
I also heard from my friend Brenda Romero, she's also hiring if anyone has gameplay programming

424
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:10,254
experience and wants to move to Ireland.

425
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:14,196
There's probably many other schools hiring too, many of them in this room, so work the

426
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:16,418
room here and on the expo floor if you're interested.

427
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:20,897
Once you find a good source of job postings, first thing

428
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:24,179
you'll run into is a wall of required qualifications.

429
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:25,721
So that's the downside.

430
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:27,862
And this is a lot like breaking into the game industry.

431
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:28,623
It looks daunting.

432
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:29,824
It keeps a lot of people out.

433
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:32,446
So what do we tell students who want to break in?

434
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,808
We all have that conversation with someone.

435
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:37,110
Like, oh, you're in the game industry.

436
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,292
I know someone who would love to get into the game industry.

437
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:40,533
And what do we say?

438
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:42,495
But they can't, because they don't have any history

439
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:43,035
experience.

440
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:43,995
And what do we tell them?

441
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,416
We say, don't let a lack of experience or a lack of a job

442
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:47,716
or a lack of talent stop you.

443
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:48,837
Just make games.

444
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:51,257
And eventually, the experience and the talent and the job

445
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,037
will follow, right?

446
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,438
And the same is true here in academia.

447
00:21:54,698 --> 00:21:56,359
If you want to teach, then teach.

448
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,799
You don't need a school for that.

449
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:58,959
You don't need permission.

450
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,100
You can find some local kids who want to learn.

451
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,620
And you can teach them on weekends if you want.

452
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,801
You can look for local homeschool communities and

453
00:22:04,821 --> 00:22:05,861
pitch the idea to them.

454
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:09,983
to say, you know, do enough of you have kids who would like to learn how to make games?

455
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:15,485
You can talk to local science museums and tech museums and see if they have any, like,

456
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:21,307
you know, any desire to host workshops that help people to create in the science and tech

457
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:21,668
areas.

458
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,829
Or you can just talk to your non-developer friends and family.

459
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:28,511
We all know that conversation that starts like, oh, I have a nephew who would love to

460
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:29,071
make games.

461
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:29,791
Right?

462
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:34,213
And instead of just saying, yeah, yeah, okay, go away, you could say, oh, you know, would

463
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,033
you like me to teach them?

464
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:39,881
You know or you can put together and run a course online independent of any school

465
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:44,707
I've did that twice and people are still finding it useful. There's nothing stopping you from doing that

466
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:51,675
You know it's not like practicing medicine where someone's going to like you know throw you in jail if you teach without a license it doesn't

467
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:52,136
Work that way

468
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:58,439
You can find local game dev classes at schools if there are any and find out who's teaching and offer to do a guest lecture every now and then.

469
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:05,621
Or if there's a student game development club at a local university, you can just offer to run some workshops or lectures for them at their meetings.

470
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:07,382
They're usually not going to tell you no.

471
00:23:08,582 --> 00:23:11,783
If teaching is your passion, you don't need any school's permission. Just teach.

472
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:17,165
And just like if game design is your passion, you're going to design games whether you get paid for it or not.

473
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,026
And if you do it enough, then eventually you'll find a way to get paid for it.

474
00:23:20,326 --> 00:23:21,186
Teaching is like that too.

475
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:26,879
Getting experience in research is a little less obvious than getting experience in teaching,

476
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:28,940
but it is still very possible, I assure you.

477
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,841
Presenting at conferences, for example.

478
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:32,262
That counts as academic work.

479
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:36,104
If you've been in the industry for more than a couple years or so, you've probably solved

480
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:39,926
some really interesting problems in your work where the solutions would be of value to your

481
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:43,808
peers if you generalize them, and you can pitch that to GDC or other conferences.

482
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:44,928
That's research.

483
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:48,590
but it's also just what we do in the industry.

484
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,292
Like, how many of you in industry have spoken before

485
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:53,693
at some conference or other at some point in your life?

486
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,294
Quite a few of you, right?

487
00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:57,215
So you're not as much of a noob

488
00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:58,936
as you think you are to academia.

489
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,237
You can also write a book.

490
00:24:00,437 --> 00:24:02,418
Anyone here read Raph Koster's Theory of Fun?

491
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:03,218
Right?

492
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:05,640
That's, see, impact again, right?

493
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,181
And you don't need to be an academic to write books.

494
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,922
He doesn't have any academic qualifications.

495
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:11,743
He just wrote a book and now everyone's reading it.

496
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:14,404
And it gives you academic street cred if you do that.

497
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,613
Another thing you can do is reach out to academics.

498
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:19,514
We are all over the place at GDC.

499
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:22,016
We even have our own summit that took place a few days ago.

500
00:24:22,536 --> 00:24:24,217
And just ask about collaborations.

501
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:26,099
Now you might be thinking about this,

502
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,000
having this image in your mind

503
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,541
of the ivory tower academic,

504
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:31,422
the person who just lives in their own bubble

505
00:24:31,462 --> 00:24:33,784
doing meaningless research with no practical application

506
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:35,345
who just doesn't care, right?

507
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:36,966
Believe me, that is a myth.

508
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,268
That is an unfair stereotype, especially in games.

509
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:44,789
virtually all of the academics I know, they want their work to be used in the field.

510
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:46,810
That's why they became researchers.

511
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,871
It's just that some of them don't know how and would desperately like to consult with

512
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,372
actual game devs so they don't get in over their heads.

513
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:57,173
Or sometimes you'll find a researcher who does know what they're doing and they'd like

514
00:24:57,213 --> 00:25:00,634
to collaborate with industry because it's tactically useful to have industry partners

515
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:01,594
on certain types of grants.

516
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,075
Or just because they'd like to work with proper developers again and not just students.

517
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:11,732
If you can bring extra work to your game dev studio that you're working for now from an academic grant,

518
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:15,160
that helps your game development career and gets you research experience.

519
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,984
And now earlier I talked about degree requirements.

520
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,225
So for those of you who don't have a graduate degree,

521
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:22,947
you have options.

522
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:25,288
You can do the job search anyway,

523
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:27,210
just with a more limited pool of jobs

524
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,291
that are willing to take your industry XP

525
00:25:30,092 --> 00:25:31,993
and substitute it for academic credentials.

526
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:34,155
Keep in mind, there are fewer of those

527
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:36,416
and you're competing with everyone else in the room here,

528
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,098
but that is a possibility.

529
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:42,866
The other thing you can do is you can go back to school and earn your degree.

530
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:47,668
Many schools have part-time options where you can take one or two classes per term while

531
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:48,728
still keeping your day job.

532
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:53,330
Most of you with industry experience are going to kick the ass of most other applicants to

533
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,952
those programs who are coming fresh off a bachelor's degree with no real world experience,

534
00:25:57,352 --> 00:26:00,814
which means you've got a decent shot at scoring a sweet scholarship to reduce or eliminate

535
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:01,394
your costs.

536
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:05,299
Or if you have the means, you can go back to school full time.

537
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,919
That's kind of the all-in option.

538
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,820
But that is what I did.

539
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,841
I saved up over really aggressively

540
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:12,482
when I had a full-time job in industry

541
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,783
until I had a couple years worth of financial cushion

542
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,524
and was able to just stretch that out

543
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:18,084
by doing freelance work on the side

544
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:19,405
while I was doing full-time school.

545
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:24,428
Generally, the higher degree you have, the more doors in academia will open for you,

546
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:28,570
but also the longer it takes you to earn the degree in the first place, and the riskier

547
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,772
a proposition it is if something goes horribly off the rails in your academic career along

548
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,032
the way.

549
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:35,314
At any rate, so it's all trade-offs.

550
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:38,016
At any rate, if you know that you want to be a faculty,

551
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,458
then the rule is get the highest degree you can,

552
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:43,160
but know that there are occasionally job postings

553
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,262
with lower requirements, and you should keep an eye out

554
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:47,704
for those and be ready to pounce on an opportunity.

555
00:26:48,184 --> 00:26:50,146
So it's basically just like when all of you

556
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,607
started out in the game industry,

557
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:54,389
and it seemed like the only job postings

558
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:56,411
required three plus years industry XP

559
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,013
and minimum one ship title, and you didn't have any,

560
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:01,875
and it felt impossible, but obviously it wasn't impossible

561
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:02,976
because you're here.

562
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:05,138
So academia is like that too.

563
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:12,351
So there's a lot more I could say about this, but for a short time period of a half hour session, this is about all I could cover.

564
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:19,616
I did create some extra slides on the job search process and how to get hired, and I put those on a bit.ly link here,

565
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:23,178
so if you want to unlock the bonus content for the talk, it's right there right now.

566
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,939
Also, here's my contact info.

567
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:28,720
I am happy to answer any questions you have over email

568
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,040
if anything occurs to you later.

569
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,721
I field questions from people in industry

570
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:34,642
about what it's like in academia all the time,

571
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:37,302
but I can also take some questions.

572
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:39,443
I think I have time for like one or two questions now,

573
00:27:39,763 --> 00:27:41,263
and I can also be in the session

574
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:42,464
in the wrap-up room after this.

575
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:43,564
So thank you.

576
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:58,782
Hi, my name is Angela Stukater. I'm from Sheridan College, which is located just outside of Toronto in Canada.

577
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,661
And I'm here looking for people who want to teach.

578
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,482
Our probationary...

579
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:06,962
See, told you.

580
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:07,943
Yes, this is me.

581
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:12,504
Probation in Canada at our college is one year, not six.

582
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:16,685
So it's a little bit an easier slide.

583
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:20,506
I wanted to ask you though, Ian, about the balance

584
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:26,288
between work experience and academics.

585
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,149
Yeah.

586
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:28,990
It's, yeah.

587
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,771
So it's usually on a sliding scale,

588
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:32,352
but it varies widely by school.

589
00:28:32,392 --> 00:28:34,553
There are some schools that really, really

590
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:36,874
want the academic credentials, and then the industry XP

591
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:37,435
is a plus.

592
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:39,536
There are some that are willing to sub-XP

593
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:41,637
for academic credentials, depending

594
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:43,158
on how much you have.

595
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,879
If you're at the creative director,

596
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,281
like director level position with 20 years industry

597
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,942
experience, sometimes you can get along with just a bachelor's

598
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:50,603
and it's fine.

599
00:28:51,804 --> 00:28:53,645
In the US, the reason it, the reason

600
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:56,427
The way it works is it's not academic snobbery.

601
00:28:56,767 --> 00:29:00,591
It's that schools are beholden to their accreditation boards.

602
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,132
Schools are accredited, which means

603
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:05,054
that there's some outside, unbiased third party that

604
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:07,036
looks at them and says, yes, you are actually

605
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:08,377
teaching what you say you are.

606
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:10,619
And you get the stamp of approval

607
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,202
that basically gives them some legitimacy among students

608
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:15,103
and everyone else.

609
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:23,908
And the problem is that accreditation boards require you to have a certain percentage of

610
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,949
faculty with advanced degrees.

611
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,211
And so it's just kind of a non-starter for them.

612
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:34,273
Now I will tell you that sufficient amounts of paperwork can make every problem go away.

613
00:29:35,014 --> 00:29:41,621
So if you are Will Wright and you want to teach and normally it requires a master's

614
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:49,309
degree and you just have a bachelor's, the school can write enough stuff to their accreditation

615
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:53,013
board to satisfy them to say this person is justified as qualified.

616
00:29:53,854 --> 00:29:56,575
The problem is that it's a lot of extra work.

617
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,176
Academics don't have a whole lot of time.

618
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:00,498
So for most people, they're not willing to do that.

619
00:30:00,518 --> 00:30:01,478
And they'll just tell you no.

620
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:04,420
And really what they mean is, no, I don't have the time to

621
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:04,881
deal with this.

622
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:06,902
I think we are out of time.

623
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:09,304
But feel free to follow me to the wrap-up room later.

624
00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:09,924
Thank you.
