00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:36,503
Hello, hi, everybody. I'm Emily Greer. And I really appreciate anybody who is spending 45 minutes today on this weighty topic and really engaging with it. There's a couple of things I want to start out with just to let you know how it's going. This topic is so big that I have more than 45 minutes of content in the deck. And I'm going to have to go through it really fast. I've got notes on everything that I wanted to say and I'm going to release the deck

2
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:39,895
With all of those notes, so you can see it at the end.

3
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,678
The other is that I have a lot of good place gifts in here.

4
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:46,899
And that's because it's one of my favorite shows.

5
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:50,481
And I think it talks about a lot of the issues here, only as much

6
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:54,003
if much funnier and much more philosophical and on a grander scale.

7
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:59,646
So to give context to how I'm going to talk about harassment and abuse,

8
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:03,909
I'm talking about it from the perspective of leadership and what leaders can do.

9
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:13,915
And that comes in the context of my own experience, which is 14 years in games, all of it as a co-founder and leader of a company.

10
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:18,017
Most of you know me from co-founding Kongregate back in 2006.

11
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:23,239
I left there a year ago and have started a mobile game studio called Double Loop now.

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,742
But most of this talk is going to be referencing my Kongregate years, because that was 13.

13
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:32,744
And because we went through the whole journey there from, you know, just two founders.

14
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:35,686
All the way up to 120 employees.

15
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:38,588
We were part of GameStop for seven years.

16
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:42,451
We had two offices almost from the start,

17
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:46,893
but had four offices and 120 employees by the end.

18
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,715
So really went through kind of the whole,

19
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,616
a big spectrum of growth.

20
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:55,119
And that is, and learned a lot and made a lot of mistakes.

21
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,280
And we'll talk about that here.

22
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,002
So over the last few years, there's been

23
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:07,600
Kind of waves of harassment allegations coming out kind of every six months or so.

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,421
And if you look at those, they really cross the whole divide of the industry.

25
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:22,104
You see lots of AAA publishers, but you also see, you know, tiny, small indie studios being mentioned, technology companies, game streamers.

26
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:25,685
Everybody seems to be impacted by this problem.

27
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:29,283
And even though so much has come out,

28
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:30,924
if you talk to women in the industry,

29
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:33,786
the sentiment that you're gonna hear again and again

30
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:36,728
is that we're surprised that more hasn't come out

31
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,889
because this just feels like the tip of the iceberg

32
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,071
from what we know from our own stories

33
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:43,212
and what we have heard from our friends.

34
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:47,775
And the statistics that you see for the US broadly

35
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:50,977
kind of bear, sort of support our feeling

36
00:02:51,057 --> 00:02:52,938
that we still really haven't heard that much.

37
00:02:53,608 --> 00:03:06,720
From the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, which I'm going to reference many times, released a really great report in 2016 that had a lot of stats, and other surveys support this as well.

38
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,588
And it shows that 60% of US women and 20% of US men have experienced sexual or gender-based harassment at work.

39
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:19,074
Sexual or gender-based harassment, almost all of it at work.

40
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:22,737
Now, what's the difference between sexual harassment and gender-based harassment?

41
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,400
Sexual harassment is unwanted sexual attention.

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:34,767
Gender-based harassment is harassment based on your gender, but not necessarily with sexual intent.

43
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:43,353
Now, these two categories are not, are a little fluid, because especially you find that a lot of gender-based harassment uses sexual terms.

44
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:47,546
But it is still good to think about them separately and to include both of them.

45
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:50,888
And it's not just sexual harassment.

46
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:57,532
This shows all of the complaints that the EEOC got in 2015.

47
00:03:57,852 --> 00:04:03,495
And while gender and sex is the number one category, race is not far behind.

48
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,536
And a lot of other categories show up as well.

49
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,698
Note that these add up to more than 100 percent.

50
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:13,101
And that's because people can fall into multiple categories at the same time.

51
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:17,107
intersectionality, as it's called.

52
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:25,233
And it seems from what the data seems to show

53
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:29,036
is that people in underrepresented minorities

54
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:33,359
show similar, report similar levels of harassment as women.

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,682
And it's not hard to assume that people who are in multiple categories

56
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:39,945
experience an even more disproportionate amount of harassment.

57
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:48,693
So when cases come out and stories come out, it's really easy to sort of, you know, shudder and say,

58
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:54,936
God, that's awful. I had no idea. And think, well, it's good. It's been revealed. Now that person

59
00:04:55,737 --> 00:05:01,419
is out of the industry and we can move on. But there's been so many cases across so much of

60
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:06,822
the industry that I think it's time to really grapple with the fact that it's not just one

61
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:10,203
company and it's not just a few people. It's systemic and

62
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:15,593
Bad actors are flourishing in games at a broad scale.

63
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,638
So, you know, knowing that, it's pretty easy to get mired down in sort of

64
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:27,140
the fact that, you know, humans can really suck.

65
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:32,303
And easy to think, you know, this is inevitable, there's not much we can do,

66
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:35,204
it happens in lots of industries, not just games,

67
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:39,667
and throw our hands up. But, you know, I wouldn't be giving this talk if I

68
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,767
thought it was inevitable.

69
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,982
I have a general theory of how humans behave.

70
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:48,783
And because I'm me, I put it in chart form.

71
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:50,844
I can't do it on top of that chart.

72
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:56,486
But that general philosophy is that there's

73
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:58,066
some small percentage of people who

74
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:01,588
will be good and kind and respectful and supportive

75
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:02,528
in any situation.

76
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:04,789
And there's a small percentage of people

77
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:08,891
who are true predators, who are truly cruel

78
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:11,372
and will be terrible in any situation.

79
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:25,691
But most of us are ordinary and most of us are reacting to the norms of the people that we're around and we're in the middle and we live up and down to what we see around us and what we think is expected of us.

80
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:35,778
But are those group norms fixed? They're not. In companies, there's a series of things that strongly influence group norms.

81
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,640
What's modeled by leaders, what's rewarded or incentivized.

82
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:45,234
Think like the Wells Fargo scandals from a few years ago, what behaviors tolerated,

83
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:51,896
and then cultural norms of individual employees and places they've worked in the past.

84
00:06:52,396 --> 00:07:00,857
Now, if you look at those, the first three are all things that the leaders have direct influence over and generally direct control.

85
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:07,818
And that means that leaders of companies have tremendous, tremendous impact on the norms of those companies.

86
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:11,325
Uber is a really great case study of that.

87
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,286
Travis Kalanick, the founder,

88
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:16,227
it's a little in different tools.

89
00:07:16,707 --> 00:07:18,308
I think it can be safely said.

90
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:22,890
You know, Uber was founded with the desire

91
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,211
to sort of, you know, undermine and ignore taxi regulations.

92
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:31,153
And that kind of attitude created a great new industry,

93
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:34,334
but it also created a sort of pervasive atmosphere

94
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:35,035
where

95
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:40,170
You know, rules did not matter and legal legality did not matter.

96
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,891
And that became very clear when Susan Fowler did a blog post about the sexual harassment,

97
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:49,652
really egregious sexual harassment that she experienced from her manager there.

98
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:58,854
But that was ignored, even though there were many, many complaints of women because he was a high performer and, you know, too important to let go.

99
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,355
Now, Fowler came to a head and.

100
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,556
He, Kalanick was ousted from the CEO,

101
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:07,197
but you can see that it was really,

102
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:08,538
you know, kind of top to bottom.

103
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:09,819
It wasn't just the leader.

104
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,401
It infiltrated the whole company.

105
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:16,543
On the other side of it, you see Big Huge Games,

106
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,225
which has, you know, goes back to 2000,

107
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:22,547
focused at Baltimore Studio that focuses on strategy games.

108
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:26,690
They went under when 38 Studios went under,

109
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,932
went bankrupt back in sometime in the 2000s.

110
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:34,366
And they decided to reboot in 2013.

111
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,147
The leadership was really shocked

112
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,867
by what was happening in Gamergate

113
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:41,709
and decided to really focus on changing the culture

114
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:44,229
and making it more inclusive and diverse.

115
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,690
And the rebated company,

116
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,170
even though it had a lot of the same team

117
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,371
and a lot of the same leadership,

118
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:50,991
had really different group norms

119
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:52,512
than the original version of the company.

120
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:55,173
I think it would be a great GDC talk.

121
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,833
And I hope Tim Train and the others there

122
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,114
will sometime talk about it

123
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:00,114
because they've really done a lot.

124
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:08,266
So the thing is, Uber is a really successful company. Does it matter if my company's culture

125
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:16,910
is toxic or even just a little bit neutral? There are a lot of reasons why it really is a problem.

126
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:23,554
The costs are real, and it starts with the very real pain that individuals who experience

127
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:28,696
harassment and abuse suffer, all the way up to what can just frankly be called PTSD.

128
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,140
And all of those costs, physical and emotional,

129
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,542
end up rolling up into organizational costs.

130
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:42,844
Looking at this list of things that the EEOC cites,

131
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:46,186
it's not just the people experiencing harassment

132
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:48,927
who have debilitating job dissatisfaction

133
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:52,769
or avoiding the team member or consider leaving.

134
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:55,150
People who witness harassment

135
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,352
also have a lot of those same emotions and feelings.

136
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:03,582
and it affects much more broadly than just the one person.

137
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:06,583
You also see lawsuits and reputational damage

138
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:08,683
and hiring and recruiting impacts.

139
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:10,064
And if you think about it,

140
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:12,584
all of these sorts of things have hit riot

141
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:15,645
in the last two years since the Kotaku article came out.

142
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,566
And who, does anybody really want their company

143
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:19,666
to go through that?

144
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,046
Not really.

145
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:25,287
So far, I've talked about are sort of negative things

146
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:29,268
that you want to avoid, costs that can hit you.

147
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:37,835
But there's a carrot too, and that's that your team will be more effective if you eliminate abuse and harassment.

148
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:50,523
And it's not just coming from me. This is the basis comes from a lot of research on psychological safety. Psychological safety is when team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other.

149
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:56,627
And Google, who've done extensive research on teams, has found this to be far and away the number one

150
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:58,163
And I think that's one of the

151
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:05,509
most important factor in team effectiveness. There's four others there, but psychological safety was really, really crucial.

152
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:10,352
And it's not just Google who's seen this. The Games Outcomes Project,

153
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:16,296
which research games projects specifically from indie teams to Triple A,

154
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:19,098
that strongly correlated with the financial and critical success of games.

155
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:33,291
And when you think about it, how can any member of a team feel safe if somebody on that team,

156
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:35,873
whether it's them or not, is getting abused and harassed?

157
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:40,175
You're never going to feel comfortable and safe and trusting in that environment.

158
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:49,001
So hopefully now you're ready to absolutely eliminate harassment and abuse in your company.

159
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,863
But to do that, you really need to understand what's driving that.

160
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,728
And to do that, and it's not what people always think,

161
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:58,650
and to help eliminate that,

162
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,812
I'm gonna tell a story of my own,

163
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:05,236
going back to a GDC from 11 years ago in 2009.

164
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:09,279
I was then in the industry about two and a half years,

165
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,721
a little less than three, since we started Congregate,

166
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,383
and I was still very much on the fringes.

167
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:16,545
This was the first time I started to be included.

168
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:19,268
I was invited, or actually my brother was invited

169
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:20,089
to a dinner.

170
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,008
Organized by a triple A company, he couldn't go.

171
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:24,988
So I was subbed in.

172
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:28,829
And first big party that I'd gone to,

173
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:30,729
attached to GDC.

174
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:33,010
And I had a great time.

175
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,230
I sat next to really interesting people.

176
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,430
We had a great discussion.

177
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,391
I was feeling really warm and included

178
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:41,411
and part of games for the first time.

179
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:43,532
As the dinner went on,

180
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:45,352
people started to get up and leave

181
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:46,992
and mingle and talk to people

182
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:48,393
who are in different parts of the table.

183
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:56,827
I talked to several people and probably around 10 p.m. I was talking to a very senior exec from one of the

184
00:12:57,207 --> 00:13:04,052
fast-rising social game companies that were sort of the big news of the time and we started talking

185
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:08,795
about a potential distribution deal because Condor Gate, while we were not making tons of money at

186
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:15,500
that point, we had a lot of traffic. So we're talking about that deal and then suddenly his

187
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,222
language just totally changed.

188
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:21,207
And he started talking about it in sexual terms.

189
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,889
You know, we don't need to get married.

190
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,951
We can make this deal one night stand

191
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:29,934
and starts making sexual hand gestures at me.

192
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:32,516
And I think the blow job gesture as well.

193
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:37,940
And I was sort of like really taken aback and shocked.

194
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,361
Like what just happened here?

195
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:41,903
Is he, is this a quid pro quo?

196
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:44,726
Is he, does he want me to have sex with him

197
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:45,847
to get a distribution deal?

198
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,408
Is this what he thinks is going on?

199
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:53,225
I was, whatever it was, I was, you know, kind of grossed out and freaked out.

200
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:59,828
And just, I quickly said goodbye and I left and I grabbed a taxi and I remember being

201
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:04,169
in the taxi feeling kind of, you know, really small and dirty.

202
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:05,310
I really wanted a shower.

203
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,070
I remember that.

204
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,792
And all that lovely feeling of belonging and that I was, you know, kind of meant to be

205
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,672
there kind of evaporated.

206
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,653
But, you know, tomorrow's the next day.

207
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:17,274
I tell my brother and some coworkers.

208
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:22,103
didn't really feel like there was anything to do and kind of moved on,

209
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,304
except for that I couldn't stop thinking about it.

210
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:28,967
And one of the things that always really puzzled me about the story is,

211
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:33,629
if that guy really wanted me to sleep with him or do a deal, either one,

212
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:37,651
that was a really terrible way to go about it. Absolutely terrible.

213
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:41,873
Like there was no way that I would consider sleeping with him under those

214
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:44,995
circumstances. And, you know, over time,

215
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:52,410
That helped me get to the insight, which is really broadly supported, that harassment is sometimes

216
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:59,012
about sex, but it's always about power. He was getting a thrill out of having something that he

217
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:04,314
could throw at me that I might want to, might be willing to have sex with him for, right? Like he

218
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:09,855
felt like sort of big swinging man because of that. And even though I was sort of grossed out

219
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:14,796
and pulled away, he probably got a thrill out of that too, you know, pushing my buttons, grossing

220
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:15,117
me out.

221
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,510
It goes back to the playground, that that's kind of its own problem.

222
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:25,615
Now, you know, this is an environment where, you know, that company was bigger and more famous than mine,

223
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:28,417
but there's no sort of direct hierarchy between us.

224
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:34,142
But when you get into, you know, employee to employee abuse and harassment,

225
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:37,404
especially in toxic and hierarchical environments,

226
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:44,890
harassment is usually used to enforce the pecking order and to control.

227
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:46,670
and push out rivals.

228
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:50,353
If you're a man, you might be called a fucking idiot

229
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:52,595
or a racist or homophobic slur.

230
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,816
But if you're a woman, it's nearly always going

231
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:56,458
to be phrased in sexual terms.

232
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,241
I think this quote that came out of one of the Liberation

233
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:04,004
articles on Ubisoft really shows that dynamic

234
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,426
where the creative director was pushing down

235
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:09,888
on a woman who was asking something of him

236
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:13,671
in a very, very graphic sexual language.

237
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:40,816
Now gender is what I've talked about quite a bit, but I think it's good to subtract to think of this as in group versus out group. Now, the in groups and out groups are going to line up, usually along the lines of things that are in groups and out groups of the society we come from. So gender, race, and class, sexual orientation, things like that. But really, they can be

238
00:16:41,347 --> 00:17:00,339
You know, almost anything as well. And these things can layer on top of each other. They could be what part of the industry you're in or what you look like or are you know, are you dev team or publishing team? Almost anything can can be the fault lines for in groups and out groups and

239
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:08,056
So it's helpful to think about it that way, especially because what's going to be strongest

240
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:16,278
in the U.S. might be totally different in Japan or Europe or Latin America. However, I do think

241
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,660
with the games industry, gender is always going to be a really strong part of it, in part because

242
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:28,842
it's set in this broader context of the gaming culture that is very proudly sort of a boys club.

243
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,930
Now, it's hard to tease out cause and effect here,

244
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,811
because they definitely reinforce each other.

245
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:37,173
But I do think that gender is probably the most universal

246
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:37,833
within games.

247
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,656
This is, again, backed up by research from the EEOC.

248
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,238
They put together a list of major workplace risk factors

249
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,080
for harassment.

250
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,601
And you look at this list, and most of them have to do

251
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:57,124
with in-group, out-group, and power and power disparities.

252
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:03,489
You also look at this list and almost all of them occur in the games industry.

253
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:07,511
So it's not surprising that we have a harassment problem.

254
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:13,373
The other thing to think about is that harassment happens on a continuum.

255
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:17,795
There's, you know, there's things that you can look at and say,

256
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:19,756
oh, that is clearly harassment.

257
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:20,877
That's clearly illegal.

258
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:25,939
But it's generally happening within a context where there's lots of things that led up to it.

259
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:32,526
and that are not necessarily illegal, but they might be if they're happening enough. Companies

260
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:37,388
have been focusing for a long time on just sort of eliminating illegal harassment and the most

261
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:42,610
egregious stuff, but to create a safe environment and to create a respected environment, you have

262
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,832
to deal with that whole spectrum, which includes a lot of things that are sort of more accepted

263
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:52,834
and more great in order to really create a culture of respect.

264
00:18:55,517 --> 00:19:05,079
And you can't half-ass this. I can't emphasize this enough. Your culture is defined by what you choose to do when it's inconvenient, not by what you say when it's expected.

265
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:21,183
Everybody can see through PR pieces that are, oh, we're sorry, oh, we can do better, or check the box that are required by the state. We know what you think is important.

266
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:24,083
by what you give your time, your attention,

267
00:19:24,503 --> 00:19:25,483
and your budget to.

268
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:28,805
And you're gonna need that to really deal with harassment.

269
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,047
Because harassment is so much about power,

270
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:38,009
the most underlying factor that you can use

271
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:40,130
to create cultures of respect

272
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,812
and to reduce harassment is to minimize

273
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:46,133
the power differential between people,

274
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,995
or at least the perceived importance of that power.

275
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,946
That doesn't mean going to holacracy or some other kind of flat organization.

276
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:58,989
Harassment can thrive just fine when in a world with no bosses.

277
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:06,474
But it does mean that you need to think about the separation of people in your organization

278
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:08,556
and what that means and how it's perceived.

279
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,039
To put it in games terms, you want a balanced party.

280
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:15,120
In a culture of respect...

281
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:23,950
And outgroups fade because everybody values the different experiences and the different skills that people are bringing to the party.

282
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:31,794
And you need a whole party working together to beat the monster or create a great game.

283
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:40,778
But to get to that kind of culture, you need to fight the leaderboard mentality where people are thinking of it as a hierarchy where they are.

284
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:47,887
rising and getting higher if they're pushing somebody else down and pushing them down below them.

285
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:57,394
One of the best ways to eliminate the power differential is for leaders to essentially

286
00:20:57,474 --> 00:21:02,998
invert it in their mind. And there's a sort of concept of servant leadership that I think is

287
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:09,023
really useful there, where it becomes not about the leaders being, you know, the big people

288
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:11,084
who are in charge and important.

289
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:22,764
Their job is to serve the people doing the work broadly and empowering them and teaching them and listening to them and rising them up.

290
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:37,409
In broader culture, one of the most famous examples is Costco, which really focuses on making their jobs great for the employees and are rewarded with tremendous retention and loyalty.

291
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:41,437
They've done things like in the last financial recession,

292
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:43,038
they actually gave their employees a raise

293
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:43,899
when sales were down

294
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,780
because they felt their employees needed it.

295
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,863
In games, I think Supercell is a culture

296
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:52,325
that whether they think they follow this or not,

297
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:54,007
this is very much kind of the model

298
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,929
where the CEO is there to serve the games team.

299
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,512
Another thing that I personally went through

300
00:22:01,732 --> 00:22:03,854
as Kongregate grew was that I needed to learn

301
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:04,655
how to

302
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,413
Watch my words in a much more in a very different way.

303
00:22:11,274 --> 00:22:17,138
I'm sort of quick to say things and say a lot of things off the cuff.

304
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:20,421
And that was totally fine when we were five employees,

305
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,062
when even when we were 15 employees.

306
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:25,725
But as we grew and people came into the company,

307
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:29,387
knowing my name and thinking I was important as CEO,

308
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:31,389
I had to change how I talk to people.

309
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:35,512
I still felt like the same approachable, you know, easygoing person.

310
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:38,276
But they had a lot of natural fear of me.

311
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:42,318
And I need to be very careful about things that I said,

312
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,179
either praise or criticism.

313
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,461
And I needed to think about those casual remarks.

314
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:52,083
So I encourage anybody who is in leadership

315
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:54,324
and going through it to think about,

316
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:55,744
okay, what's your self-image

317
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,005
versus how your employees think about you

318
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:00,847
and really think about how you talk to them.

319
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,402
Another thing that we struggled with sometimes at Congregate

320
00:23:06,842 --> 00:23:10,104
was distinguishing lack of conflict,

321
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:13,166
niceness from respect.

322
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:16,388
It's really important for everybody,

323
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:19,570
whether you're an individual or a company,

324
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,873
to be able to hear criticism and act on it

325
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,594
in order to really grow and flourish.

326
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:29,575
And there's a lot of companies where,

327
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:32,637
in trying to get away from people being abusive and cruel.

328
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:37,145
You get into the norm where nobody can say anything critical.

329
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:39,166
And that's not great.

330
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:42,548
You need to be able to express thoughtful criticism.

331
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:45,730
And you need to be able to deal with the things that are bad

332
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,972
and are important.

333
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:51,553
And you need to be able to fire somebody

334
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,294
because if you can't,

335
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,356
undercover harassers are going to thrive.

336
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:57,957
So think about that distinction.

337
00:23:58,017 --> 00:24:00,438
Am I being nice or am I being truly respectful?

338
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:06,351
I could talk about communication all day and I don't have that time.

339
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:09,713
So I'm just going to point out these two books that I think have been very helpful

340
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:12,214
for me and I think can be very helpful to anyone.

341
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:16,856
And I encourage everybody to spend a lot of time on working on their communication.

342
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:23,479
One thing I think is really important is to set the tone,

343
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,261
set the tone early with new hires, people come in feeling insecure and.

344
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:36,219
Both helping them see what's expected and also making them feel safe is really important very quickly.

345
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:42,080
A couple things we did at Conregate. One is that I went out of my way to greet every new hire.

346
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:49,463
Didn't wait for them to be taken around to greet me and made sure that they knew that I knew who they were and thought that they were important.

347
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:58,445
And I heard from a lot of company, a lot of people when I left, that that was actually specifically really meaningful. It only took five or 10 minutes.

348
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:04,812
on their first day, but it really set the tone of what the company was like and what I was like.

349
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:06,412
So I highly recommend it.

350
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,173
New hire orientation was also great.

351
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:15,534
And one of the things I think was important in there was that I put in a slide sharing my worst mistake,

352
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:17,135
which is that I said no to Minecraft.

353
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:18,595
Really big mistake, right?

354
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:21,136
And we have a successful company anyway.

355
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:23,577
And I wanted very quickly...

356
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:29,771
For employees to know that it was okay to be vulnerable and it was okay to make mistakes.

357
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:35,596
And the fastest way to do that is for me to say to show that I had really f'd up.

358
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:43,162
Another thing is you should have no VIPs. There shouldn't be special travel rules or special

359
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:49,348
vacation policies for people who are executives. Everybody should be fundamentally be treated the

360
00:25:49,368 --> 00:25:50,609
same and that includes.

361
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,871
So, you know, access to bonus programs or equity.

362
00:25:55,211 --> 00:26:01,173
Even if they're participating in a much smaller rate, everybody should be able to be included.

363
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:05,555
The other side of that is sharing communal responsibilities.

364
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:08,156
Things that everybody needs to do.

365
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:14,598
Rotating kitchen duty was really effective at Concrete and I think it was always really

366
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:19,639
powerful for people to see my name and my brother's name on that list and to see us

367
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:20,360
in their G-range.

368
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:21,954
something that was serving them.

369
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:27,278
People talk a lot about transparent communication

370
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:29,219
and access to leadership.

371
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,822
It's really common for companies to do regular business updates,

372
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,824
but you really need to go beyond that for best results

373
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:41,749
and have everybody feel like they can really reach out

374
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,010
and talk to leadership.

375
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,411
And the leadership will be honest,

376
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,593
and that includes not just cheerleading,

377
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:48,774
but also talking about real challenges

378
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:49,995
and how we're addressing that.

379
00:26:51,008 --> 00:27:03,796
Having any kind of system where people can ask anonymous questions really is helpful because that, even if they don't use it, the fact that we're willing to take anonymous questions really opens up the feeling of trust.

380
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:15,983
Getting people to talk to other levels through skip level one-on-ones, things like that is really great. Definitely think about remote employees and people at other locations to make sure that they have similar access.

381
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:22,106
You also need to actively look for red flags.

382
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:26,589
There's always going to be some people who are charming and cooperative with you,

383
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:34,874
but, you know, the kiss up and kick down type of personality who behave very differently with others.

384
00:27:35,815 --> 00:27:40,718
So to look for those, you need to not look just at how they behave in front of you,

385
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:43,420
but look at signs of how they're behaving elsewhere.

386
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,223
Here's a list of things. You definitely want to do exit interviews.

387
00:27:47,656 --> 00:28:04,164
You definitely want to watch out for anybody who's regularly getting into any kind of feud with peers or other types of groups, because those are red flags that are very serious.

388
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:15,389
The most serious harassment case I had dealt with a congregate that was employee to employee, the manager involved had pretty much all of these flags over his tenure.

389
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:28,092
Now, this is a topic I can't go into very deeply, but one of the most important ways we show how we value people is how we pay them and how we promote them.

390
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:35,516
And there's a lot of common practices, especially in US compensation, that create disparities over time.

391
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:42,559
I created a scenario here looking at a bunch of different junior hires that hopefully you can go over later.

392
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,762
But the thing that I want you to take away is to answer this question.

393
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:54,187
If everybody in your company's pay and compensation was released publicly tomorrow, could you defend it?

394
00:28:55,288 --> 00:29:03,093
If you can't, that means that you need to do more work in terms of analyzing the equity between people and the equity relative to the market.

395
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:04,954
And we need to do that on a regular basis.

396
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:10,598
So you probably noticed on the previous EEOC slide.

397
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:17,611
That one of the factors for harassment was workplaces that tolerated or encouraged alcohol.

398
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,292
And we all know this is true in the games industry.

399
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:23,073
I've certainly been a problem with that over the years.

400
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:27,175
I've had a lot of fun nights out with employees and industry friends drinking.

401
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:31,016
But I've also seen the problems with that, including, you know,

402
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:35,898
an indie dev who got, you know, blackout trump and followed me around a party.

403
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:44,762
You know, trying to hug me and announcing that I was going to be the future mother of his children and other things that were just really awkward for everybody.

404
00:29:44,782 --> 00:30:04,872
Over time at Conrad, we managed to make the culture less alcohol centric and part of that was how we organized events, the times, how we did things, making sure there was always food. The one shit showy holiday party we had was because there was not enough food.

405
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:08,317
But also making sure there was no peer pressure to drink.

406
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:10,499
We played beer pong on a regular basis,

407
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,680
but it was totally common practice for people

408
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,723
to play with water in their cups because they were sick

409
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:18,284
or they didn't like beer or they didn't drink.

410
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,645
And that was totally okay.

411
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:23,207
And you need to make that okay within your company.

412
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:29,431
Dating is another element in sort of fun things

413
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:31,753
that become pretty problematic quickly.

414
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:34,795
I put in a base policy here.

415
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,300
Everybody should have a base policy.

416
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,484
One thing that I would add on top of that is that you also really need to think about

417
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:47,227
the, that people above a certain level, it doesn't matter what the reporting structure

418
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:51,251
is, they're always going to have a power differential with the people below them.

419
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:59,457
And I think especially for the top level founders, C-level, and anybody in HR, you should have

420
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,438
a, have dating be strictly prohibited.

421
00:31:01,478 --> 00:31:04,140
There's no situation in which that doesn't end up being.

422
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:13,695
It's a little bit messy and a breach of trust, and you really don't want any situation where somebody high level is treating the company as their personal Tinder pool.

423
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:25,078
I also have a spicy take that employees are more likely to date each other if they're working, you know, 70, 80 hours a week and not seeing other people so don't crutch and it's less of a problem.

424
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:30,600
But even with all of these things that have happened and that you're doing.

425
00:31:32,482 --> 00:31:34,042
Realistic that there's still going to be abuse.

426
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:37,183
You can get the vast majority of the group

427
00:31:37,303 --> 00:31:39,423
to sort of better, more respectful norms,

428
00:31:39,703 --> 00:31:41,584
but there's always that percentage of people

429
00:31:41,604 --> 00:31:46,645
who are going to want to be abusive

430
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,386
and kind of get off on that.

431
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,206
And you need to be prepared,

432
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:55,987
especially because once you've changed the surface culture

433
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:56,387
and the group norms.

434
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:01,486
Then it's going to go underground.

435
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,126
People are going to know it's not OK,

436
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,388
but they're going to figure out ways to make it more covert,

437
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:08,489
more discreet.

438
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,531
And that means you need to work harder to find it and deal

439
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:11,811
with it.

440
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:15,973
So a little context here.

441
00:32:15,993 --> 00:32:18,775
I'm going to tell another short personal story.

442
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:22,917
And this is one from the time that we were owned by GameStop.

443
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,539
I was at a party at the buffet line,

444
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,960
and GameStop exactly worked with.

445
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,510
was on one side of me and then went to the other side of me.

446
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,231
And in that process, I took advantage of

447
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:41,133
a reasonable touching me to actually broke me.

448
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:47,594
And very typically I froze. What happened? Did this really happen?

449
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:52,435
I didn't want to make a scene, but so I just sort of walked away

450
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:57,136
and didn't deal with it right then. But once the party was over, I told my

451
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:57,416
brother.

452
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:01,064
And he was really skeptical.

453
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:02,564
He thought I must have imagined it.

454
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:03,864
It didn't really happen.

455
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:08,106
And I remember thinking, well, I'm 4'11".

456
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:14,227
No normal height man naturally touches the lower part

457
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:16,348
of my ass and groin area.

458
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:18,449
I really don't think this was accidental.

459
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:19,669
You have to bend your knees.

460
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:21,990
You have to reach to make this happen.

461
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,591
But if my own brother who loves me and respects me

462
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,212
doesn't think

463
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:33,953
This is true. What's the point of going to HR or talking to anybody else about this, right?

464
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:47,840
The man would deny it. I'd get into a fight. Nothing would happen. I damaged my position within GameStop and have created an enemy and just didn't seem worth it. And so I decided to do nothing.

465
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,483
But it still continued to bother me over the years. And I was, you know, angry that he got away with it.

466
00:33:55,177 --> 00:34:02,283
I was worried that he was doing that and worse to other women, and I hadn't done anything

467
00:34:02,323 --> 00:34:02,783
to prevent it.

468
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:07,287
I was also really disappointed with my brother on that.

469
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:13,233
The good news is that after Me Too came out, we talked about it, and he's really apologetic

470
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:14,634
now and gets it.

471
00:34:16,395 --> 00:34:20,499
And I don't want to talk badly about GameStop, because this story isn't really about GameStop.

472
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:21,760
I found the culture there to be...

473
00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:28,022
Totally fine, or I wouldn't have stayed for many years past my earn out.

474
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:31,225
In particular, I really came to like and respect my boss.

475
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:36,589
But even in a sort of a typical company with a not very bad culture,

476
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:39,651
it really didn't feel safe making harassment complaints.

477
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:43,234
And that is totally typical.

478
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:47,477
Only a tiny, tiny fraction, one in ten, one in fifteen, one in twenty

479
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:51,100
of harassment and abuse cases ever gets reported.

480
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,180
And.

481
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:55,868
You know, per the EEOC, it's all exactly the same reasons

482
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,549
why I didn't report to GameStop.

483
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,872
And everything I did was exactly totally, totally typical.

484
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:08,854
So when you think about preventing harassment,

485
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,736
you need to think about creating systems

486
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,057
that break through this.

487
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:16,198
How do you make the victim feel

488
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:18,999
like they're gonna be believed before they report?

489
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:23,889
How do you make them feel like something is going to be done to really deal with this?

490
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:27,632
And how do you make them feel safe to actually tell you about it?

491
00:35:28,453 --> 00:35:34,978
The other thing that goes along with this is that you actually need to accept

492
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:39,502
that getting harassment reports is actually positive,

493
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:43,085
because it means that your employees have faith in the system

494
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:45,767
and they have faith in you to take it seriously.

495
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:52,416
Going to social media, going to the newspapers,

496
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:57,360
going to a lawsuit, these are all sort of the actions

497
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,182
of people who have no hope of any other recourse.

498
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:02,924
So if you get a harassment complaint,

499
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:06,907
even if it feels terrible, it actually is a positive thing

500
00:36:06,987 --> 00:36:08,308
and means that you're doing something right.

501
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:12,091
So what kind of systems do you need?

502
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:14,593
First of all, you need a real harassment policy.

503
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:19,815
I'm not just something you pick up the Internet or legal or HR prepares.

504
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:24,817
It needs to be something that's accessible and specific and not at all generic.

505
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:26,838
And everybody can understand.

506
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:29,739
And it needs to cover that whole spectrum, not just what's illegal,

507
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,981
but what's inappropriate and everything that you don't want to be happening

508
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:35,202
in your company.

509
00:36:35,702 --> 00:36:39,083
And then you need to give that to your employees and get their feedback

510
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:40,644
because nobody is going to know

511
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:41,384
what's.

512
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:47,879
The real situation and what the dangers are in your particular context more than your

513
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:48,419
employees.

514
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,942
And once you incorporate that feedback, you're going to have something that people have bought

515
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,202
in on at a different level.

516
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:56,684
So do that.

517
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:58,085
That's the first starting point.

518
00:36:59,545 --> 00:37:03,107
The other thing is make concrete plans as much as possible.

519
00:37:03,928 --> 00:37:09,011
When something unexpected happens, especially something complex and stressful, our first

520
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:09,951
reaction is to freeze.

521
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:12,313
And you've seen me do that in multiple ways.

522
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:21,526
And when people freeze, inaction is the default response.

523
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:26,007
The more that you plan in advance, the more that you think things through, the more that

524
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:30,309
you give clear paths for escalation, the more quickly and the more consistently you will

525
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:30,489
get.

526
00:37:31,169 --> 00:37:32,929
So, you know, set up a small group.

527
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:42,691
Get practice in terms of taking investigations and things like that.

528
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:48,634
Identify things like GDC or the company holiday party

529
00:37:49,154 --> 00:37:53,075
where stuff is more likely to happen and develop a mitigation plan,

530
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:57,277
including like things like, you know, having food there and having a point

531
00:37:57,337 --> 00:38:01,879
person and sending out an email in advance saying, if anything happens,

532
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,221
please come, you know, come to this person and then they will help you deal with it.

533
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:07,596
All of that helps.

534
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:09,797
One thing I also used to do

535
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:11,178
is reach out to higher risk groups.

536
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:15,161
So because most of my negative experiences

537
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:17,943
were interacting with the outside world,

538
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:21,305
I would talk to our BD people and tell them,

539
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:24,888
if this happens to you, if you see something,

540
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:28,230
please come to me, it's happened to me, I will believe you.

541
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:33,194
So they would know that I was there.

542
00:38:33,214 --> 00:38:35,815
I think interns in particular is a group

543
00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:46,640
That you should think about as they're going to have less resources in terms of connections to other people or understanding of what's normal in the workplace.

544
00:38:48,541 --> 00:39:01,866
And you need to prepare for ambiguity. If you think about both of the cases that I've reported and told you about here, there's no witnesses, there's no evidence. It's only, you know, me versus what that person would say.

545
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:03,087
And that's

546
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:31,812
going to be common. There's also going to be stories that have a mix of consensual and non-consensual behavior, or bad behavior on both sides, or bad choices, all of those things. And you're going to have to think about them and come to some sort of synthesis of what the truth is. But you need to do that in the context of understanding how difficult it is for reporters to

547
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:34,263
They're taking a lot of risks.

548
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:40,488
And when you think about a court of law,

549
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:42,789
it's absolutely, absolutely right

550
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:47,973
that the system should be innocent until proven guilty.

551
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:51,375
But when you're thinking about an internal investigation,

552
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:55,158
are you ready for this to happen to another employee?

553
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:57,780
Maybe 10 or 20 more employees

554
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,221
before you get even one more report?

555
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:07,825
You need to think about what, given the severity of what happened, what balance do you want to strike there and what makes sense.

556
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:11,527
But that doesn't mean that you want to fire everybody.

557
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:21,995
People will often talk about zero harassment policies, but those can really backfire because they mean that people won't necessarily report something more minor

558
00:40:22,396 --> 00:40:30,242
Because they're afraid of getting people fired. You need to look at, you know, what's the context, what was the intent, what's the pattern, were they drunk?

559
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:37,111
All of those things to help put together what the correct response is in any situation.

560
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:43,793
And hopefully it's going to be just some sort of warning or talking to or therapy or some

561
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:48,714
other situation, something like that. Part of respect is having faith that people can learn

562
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:56,136
and grow and change. But the caveat with that is that anything predatory or very cruel still

563
00:40:56,156 --> 00:40:58,457
needs to be dealt with swiftly and harshly.

564
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:05,525
You also really need to think through the fact that no one can be too valuable to fire.

565
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:12,128
In the Games Outcomes Project, besides team trust and psychological safety,

566
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:17,330
one of the other factors that was really, really crucial was clarity of vision for the game.

567
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:20,852
And that actually being really important,

568
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:25,554
I think, has made the games industry fall very hard for the myth of the asshole genius.

569
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:27,415
But you have to question.

570
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:35,250
Are they really more of a creative visionary or are they just better at talking over people than other people?

571
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,953
Are they good at stifling dissent? Are they better at taking credit for somebody else's work?

572
00:41:41,313 --> 00:41:48,637
We often mistake aggressiveness for leadership as humans and once this pattern sets in,

573
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:54,401
it self-reproduces because younger people think that's what they're supposed to act like

574
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:58,343
and more collaborative creative visionaries might get

575
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,272
forced out or not recognized because the pattern has been set.

576
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:10,297
I'm a big basketball fan and there's a stat called plus minus which looks at the effect,

577
00:42:11,537 --> 00:42:15,840
the whole team's output when the player is on the floor because that helps distinguish

578
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,262
what's the, what effect are they having on their team and their teammates from what their individual

579
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:26,446
stats are. And I think a lot of these sort of asshole creative geniuses should be looked at

580
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:27,287
in that kind of.

581
00:42:27,905 --> 00:42:31,808
They may look good from one particular frame, but they're the reason why people quit.

582
00:42:32,068 --> 00:42:34,830
They're the reason why people are afraid to criticize the game.

583
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:37,492
They're the reason people are afraid to make suggestions.

584
00:42:37,913 --> 00:42:43,797
And games is absolutely a team effort outside of, you know, solo indie projects.

585
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:48,000
They're always going to be judged on the team effectiveness and not the individual.

586
00:42:50,462 --> 00:42:52,964
Now the other thing you really need to think about is safety.

587
00:42:53,814 --> 00:42:56,576
The process of reporting can be really traumatic.

588
00:42:57,076 --> 00:43:02,198
I felt nauseous when I was rehearsing to tell some of my stories here.

589
00:43:02,758 --> 00:43:07,941
And that's at a fraction of what's going on for people who are reporting it immediately

590
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:08,681
after it happens.

591
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:12,063
So focus on everything you can do to make them feel safe.

592
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:17,785
And in particular, you need to focus on not allowing any kind of retaliation or any kind

593
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:20,186
of pressure for them to work it out or be okay with it.

594
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:22,968
Do not make them go to lunch with their harasser.

595
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:29,544
Do not make them feel pressured to accept compromises that they do not feel safe with.

596
00:43:30,544 --> 00:43:35,549
But you also need to balance victim needs and consistency of policy,

597
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:37,391
and that can be really, really challenging.

598
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,996
If you have limited time, focus your effort on managers.

599
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:45,658
That's who's driving the individual experience.

600
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,621
of most people day to day.

601
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:51,063
And mostly they've gotten dropped into management

602
00:43:51,343 --> 00:43:53,945
without much training, managing their peers,

603
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,387
their former peers, and having had lots of bad modeling.

604
00:43:58,828 --> 00:43:59,568
That really sucks.

605
00:44:00,028 --> 00:44:02,710
Invest in their training, their support, and their mentorship.

606
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:07,132
And you also really want to encourage bystander action.

607
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:11,135
Traditional training that focuses on just what's legal

608
00:44:11,175 --> 00:44:13,476
and illegal and just on managers is...

609
00:44:14,006 --> 00:44:15,446
You know, probably been effective at best.

610
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:21,048
But there's some research that shows that training that focuses on teaching people,

611
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:25,409
if they're bystanders to some kind of harassment, how to recognize it

612
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:30,531
and how to intervene and how to help after the fact is much more effective.

613
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:32,391
And it makes sense because it's much more positive

614
00:44:32,752 --> 00:44:34,652
and it gives people a sense of what they can do.

615
00:44:34,692 --> 00:44:39,233
It goes back to that concrete plans type of advice that I gave previously.

616
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:43,075
And I certainly saw bystander action.

617
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:48,001
really kick in several times to congregate in positive ways. Unfortunately, I don't have time

618
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:55,424
to tell the stories here. And I know I've given you a lot, but you don't have to tackle it all

619
00:44:55,444 --> 00:45:01,347
at once, and not all of it is going to be appropriate for your company. 10-person studios

620
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:07,350
are totally different from a 10,000-person big publisher, but you need to start somewhere.

621
00:45:07,712 --> 00:45:13,414
So think about the principles that I sort of conveyed and think about, okay, what works

622
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:20,596
in our context? What can we do? What's going to be authentic to us? And if you're a manager

623
00:45:21,517 --> 00:45:26,218
within one of these larger organizations, you know, think about, okay, I can't get everybody

624
00:45:26,258 --> 00:45:31,420
on board, but I can make my team feel safer. I can make my team feel better with my own leadership

625
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:37,242
and my own communication. And as an individual bystander, I can learn how I might

626
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,781
I'm going to be talking about how to intervene or think that through and be ready to help.

627
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:50,565
Everybody has had the most impact, but everybody can do this and we can do it gradually over time and make the industry better and it's absolutely worth it.

628
00:45:52,225 --> 00:46:00,309
I was feeling depressed last year when I saw a whole wave of Nike stories came out, and this popped up in my Twitter feed from a former congregate employee.

629
00:46:00,649 --> 00:46:02,009
And she was posting.

630
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:24,080
About her good experience being harassed at a GDC party, actually our GDC party, where a AdNetwork representative that we were working with showed up, started harassing her really aggressively, followed her around the bar, she got the bouncer to help get him out.

631
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,041
I think he hit the bouncer. He definitely pulled the fire alarm. It was a whole scene.

632
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:33,862
And she was very smart and she had got his business card and.

633
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,704
The next day we all came together and put together a plan,

634
00:46:38,224 --> 00:46:41,264
particularly Zoe, our HR manager, and the VP of Marketing,

635
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:45,165
to deal with it, and got statements from everybody,

636
00:46:45,225 --> 00:46:47,466
Zoe, the bar, a bunch of other witnesses,

637
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:50,167
and put them together and took them to that ad network

638
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:54,408
as a pretty package, and they verified that it happened,

639
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:56,668
and three days later, that guy was fired.

640
00:46:57,128 --> 00:47:00,069
And as Zoe says, a disturbing experience

641
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,150
turned into something that felt really empowering.
